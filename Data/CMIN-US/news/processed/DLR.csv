2019-02-17,"One of the essential first lessons that investors learn is diversifying a portfolio reduces risk. That's because different assets often react differently to the same event. A downturn in one asset when interest rates rise, for example, may be counter-balanced by an upswing in another. By holding diverse assets, a portfolio becomes less sensitive to market swings.Diversification is recommended not only across asset classes, but across geographies. This is especially true for real estate, since the value of a property is largely determined by the local economy. A real estate investment trust (REIT) that performs poorly in the U.S. may generate good overall results from the performance of its European and Asian assets.Investors could be taking on unnecessary risk by limiting their holdings to US-centric REITs. Many large U.S. REITs recognize this threat and are diversifying their holdings across geographies. Global expansion not only trims geographic risk, but benefits overall performance by giving these REITs a foothold in faster-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, where an expanding middle class is fueling the creation of wealth.Here are 12 mega-sized REITs - many with rising dividends - that also offer diverse international exposure and generous yields. We've also included an extra real-estate play that's not organized as a REIT but is worthy nonetheless.

2019-04-25,"Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.No matter what state the market is in, there's always one thing investors are looking for and that's yield. During bull markets, bear markets and periods of chop, investors want to get paid. Naturally, that brings real estate stocks into the discussion. Because real estate investment trusts (REITs for short) are required to pay out 90% of their earnings to investors, these are generally big sources of yield for income investors.REITs don't just pay out attractive yields; many of these companies are terrific operators too. So not only do investors get to collect a solid dividend yield, but they also get to invest in some fantastic businesses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Today Just like every security, some are blue-chip REITs and others we shouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. So let's avoid some of those red flags and instead go with the best real estate stocks out there, many of which recently reported earnings.  Source:  Yuriy Trubitsyn via Unsplash Realty Income (O)Of those companies that recently reported earnings, Realty Income (NYSE:O) is one of them. Realty, known as &quot;The Monthly Dividend Company,&quot; also happens to be one of the best-run REITs out there.The company recently announced its 85th consecutive dividend increase, making it one of the market's strongest income plays. Shares still yield 3.84%, despite the stock sitting near multi-year highs near $70.Now that O has pushed through $70, it could spark a larger breakout. It helps that the Fed is on hold with its rate hikes while the economy continues to chug along. That bodes well for Realty and a whole host of other REIT plays. But make no mistake about it, this one is as blue-chip as they come. Technically speaking, I wouldn't worry about O unless it fell below $62.50.  Source: Shutterstock  Digital Realty (DLR)Breaking off of the more traditional REIT path is a technology play in Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR). The &quot;young&quot; company was founded about 15 years ago, is headquartered (fittingly) in San Francisco and has quickly worked its way up to a $24 billion market cap.DLR &quot;provides data center, colocation, and interconnection solutions,&quot; with its first segment providing it a big chunk of its business. It takes one simple consideration to see why DLR is a name to be long.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years The cloud operates in data centers and with large companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others gathering an ever-growing collection of data, all of that needs to go somewhere, right? As more data is created, it needs somewhere to be stored.Further, as A.I. applications begin to grow, these programs require a massive amount of data. Data centers are where it's stored and that's why DLR has done so well.Investors need to realize this is a secular shift and companies like DLR are going to be there to soak up the dollars. The stock yields &quot;just&quot; 3.73% and has been red-hot lately. If we get can get a pullback to the backside of former downtrend resistance or even just $116 for more aggressive investors, it's worth considering on the long side.    Source: Shutterstock   Ventas (VTR)Another well-known, high-quality REIT is Ventas (NYSE:VTR).It hasnt had a great 2019, but that should change after its latest revenue beat.The &quot;transition&quot; word doesn't usually sit too well with investors, but seeing VTR return to its stronger ways must have encouraged its investor base. The fact that it still yields 5.23% even though its well below the 52-week high means there's still room for growth.This healthcare REIT is well-positioned for long-term secular growth. As the Baby Boomer population continues to age, Ventas' senior care facilities and medical office businesses should continue to churn out consistent rent checks. That bodes well for investors whether VTR is pivoting or not, and it bodes well for the yield.  Source: Shutterstock  Tanger Outlet (SKT)Click to EnlargeSo far we have retail, technology and medical REITs on the list, so why not further diversify with a mall REIT? With Tanger Factory Outlet Center (NYSE:SKT), investors are getting exposure to a well-run company and a big 7.44% dividend yield.However, unlike VTR, O and DLR, Tanger is not bumping up against a potential breakout or trading higher. I'd love to see a close over $22.50 for SKT, but it's been on a recent downtrend.This REIT has not only paid but raised its dividend for 26 consecutive years, making this a safe-play income stock for investors. So those that are looking for safe payouts, SKT is one to consider.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt While the mall is considered a dying enterprise, not all operators are created equal. With that in mind, Tanger is actually doing incredibly well. Plus it's not a traditional mall REIT in the sense that it doesn't operate department store locations. Instead, it thrives on the outlet mall concept.Finally, it has a lower valuation compared to many of its peers and a higher yield. Tough not to like that.  Source: Shutterstock  Federal Realty (FRT)We can't end the top real estate stocks to buy list without talking about Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT). Yielding &quot;just&quot; 3.04%, this payout won't get income investors tripping over each other in order to buy.But considering the quality of the dividend may be another story. Get this: FTR has not only paid, but raised its dividend for 50 straight years. Through hellish inflation, tech bubbles and the greatest recession since the depression, FTR has raised its payout for investors each and every year.If you've got time and are looking for a dependable stream of income, FTR should be one of your first considerations. Not just for REITs, but among all dividend stocks.This retail REIT is as solid as they come and the valuation has been reasonable.Shares are running into recent range resistance, which has stalled it over the past few weeks. That's good news for bulls, as it allows the stock to digest some of this big rally. I would really like a pullback into that $127 area. However, long-term investors focused solely on the income are likely not interested in timing their investment in FTR.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-09,"Technology is the alchemy of the stock market. It is where companies turn worthless silicon into incredible new and expensive gizmos and devices. And it is where other companies conjure up applications and software out of the thin air of their employees' minds.So, no wonder investors love to find the latest companies as soon as they can to invest in the attempt to capture that sort of alchemy.And it shows in the performance of the technology sector of stocks. If you look at the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index over the past 10 years, it has generated a total return of 478.85% as compared to the general S&P 500 Index's return of 282.42%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsS&P Information Technology Index vs. S&P 500 Index Total Return Source BloombergBut there are many challenges in investing in technology. One of them is the vast uncertainty of ideas going from start to viable. And then, even with viability, the companies behind them still have to perform as profitable companies -- at least eventually. And along the way, they tend to share little of their wealth in dividend distributions to shareholders, as many tend to burn cash rather than piling it up. That's why you don't see so many of them among dividend stocks lists.This shows up in the average dividend of the S&P Technology Index which is a paltry 1.37% as compared to the S&P 500 Index at 1.92%.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips So, what about the idea of finding technology companies that are bringing new products to eager markets and that are profitable enough to pay better dividends? These companies do exist, and their shareholder are profiting from them with growth and income. Here are five from varied technology markets that are profitable and pay well. Hercules Capital (HTGC)Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) is based in the Palo Alto, California, which is home of many of the tech companies of the past and future. The company is set up as a Business Development Company (BDC) and really operates much like a merchant bank. It searches out technology companies from varied sectors and provides financing for development. And in turn, it also takes equity stakes via varied means, including warrants, which provides additional payouts when the companies come to the public market or are sold to other, larger companies.It has hundreds of companies in its portfolio and has had a series of major bold-faced names in its history of investments. And the returns to shareholders has been impressive. Over the past five years alone, the shares have generated a return of 52.6%And this return comes with a nice dividend currently yielding 9.4%. The company has been increasing revenues by 8.8% and has an impressive net interest margin (the difference in funding costs to investment earnings) at 9.3%. This drives an impressive return on equity of 14.5%.Yet the stock is still a bargain at only 1.34 times its book of asset. It makes for a great buy in a taxable account. Microsoft (MSFT)I know that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't an unknown company nor an undiscovered stock, even among dividend stocks. Yet it is a transforming company in the technology space. It has gone from a company that relied on unit sales of software packages and other products to services and products that are sold by subscription or on contract for recurring revenue.And it performs for shareholder. For the past five years, it has generated a return of 254.75%.It has done so with a big build-out of its cloud computing business and subscriptions for its software and other products. And this provides cash for its dividend yield of 1.5%. Revenues are up by 14.3% and its operating margin is fat at 33.1%, which in turn drives the return on shareholder's equity to 40.1%.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes The stock isn't cheap, but the company keeps building up its underlying assets and sales, so a price to book at 10.12 times and a price to sales at 7.9 times isn't that bad when both the book and the sales are climbing.It should be bought in a tax-free account. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) which owns and runs data centers around the U.S. and the globe. Data centers are vital to cloud computing and data processing for much to most of the technology world.The stock has delivered with a return over the past five years of 158.5%.The company pays an ample tax-advantaged dividend, yielding 3.7%. And it continues to perform with revenues gaining by 23.9% and its operating profit as measured from funds from operations (FFO) running at 16.4%.And yet, the REIT is a value at only 2.84 times its impressive book of assets.It should be bought in a taxable account. NextEra Energy (NEE)NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a utility company -- and while those are often dividend stocks, that might not strike you as a technology company until you learn more about the company. It has a base of regulated power businesses serving Florida which provides a dependable flow of profits. And in turn, those profits work to fund its massive unregulated, tech-focuses wind and solar power businesses around the U.S. and beyond.This has made the company into one of the largest wind and solar power companies in the world. And it has delivered profits to shareholders with the stock generating a return over the past five years of 120.4%.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio And it pays is shareholders with a dividend of 2.7%. Revenues have improved by 11.85 times in just the past three years. The return on equity is running at 8.7%. And the stock is a value at only 2.63 times its book. The stock should be bought in a tax-free account. FMC Corporation (FMC)FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) is a very old company with a history of technology innovation. It has invented and sold countless products and services in varied industries and turn have delivered to shareholders. The past five years has seen a return of 30.7%.Now, you'll note that the profits have been coming more recently. This is due to the history of the company transforming itself and its focus from varied technologies over time. But now after some business sales and acquisitions over the past years it is now fully focused on the technology of improving agricultural production. It is a global leader in pesticide and herbicide products and services with pin-point technology in the type of products and their applications.In a globe in vital need of more food and other agriculture products, FMC is the go-to Ag tech company. Revenue is soaring at 64.2% and its operating margins are at a fat 18.6% which helps to deliver a return on equity of 15.6%.And its dividend yields 2% -- not the cream of the dividend stocks crop, but still solid. The stock is also a value at only 3.73 times book and 2.2 times its rapidly rising sales. It should be bough in a tax-free account.For more of my technology dividend stocks, please take a look at my Profitable Investing, which is now in its 30th year of publication.Neil George is the editor of Profitable Investing and does not have any holdings in the securities mentioned above.

2019-05-17,"One thing is certain. In volatile markets, income is a great alternative. And real estate investment trusts (REITs) are delivering some of the best returns in the space. What's more, that outperformance should continue for a long time to come, with the perfect blend of slow growth and low interest rates in the US.Because these REITs are U.S.-focused, it also means that they're not vulnerable to external forces for their further successes. I did some digging and found seven high-yield REITs that will pay you inflation-beating yields while they also grow their asset values. These are some of the top names in the business that are in the best sectors for growth well into the future.  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy These picks are also smart, conservative ways to play sectors like tech, healthcare and the bond markets. And they all get top ranks from my Portfolio Grader for timeliness, as well as strength.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips High-Yield REITs That Will Pay You: Arbor (ABR)Arbor Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:ABR) is a unique REIT in that it doesn't own properties as much as it finances properties. Its specialty is multifamily and senior housing as well as healthcare and diverse commercial properties.While it only has a $1 billion market cap, this is actually a great advantage for growth investors looking for a serious income kick. Because it's relatively small, it's leveraged to growth - and the REIT sector is growing fast.For example, year to date, ABR stock is up nearly 30% and in the past 12 months it's up over 40%. But the kicker is, it's still trading at a P/E of 9.If that isn't enough for you, it's delivering a whopping 8.2% dividend, even after all that growth. Realty Income (O)Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is one of the founding REITs in the market, established in 1969. Another unique aspect of this tried-and-true trust is the fact that it delivers its income monthly.Usually, REITs and other dividend stocks pay out their dividends quarterly. If you're an income investor, setting up a varied income stream from your holdings is a good way to keep income flowing regularly.But beyond convenience, O is a rock-solid REIT that has some of the top names in the industry leasing its properties from coast to coast. That means its nearly 4% dividend is solid.  * Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 -- So Far It also means, the O can build off its clients' successes. O stock is up 33% in the past 12 months and is a good choice if you're looking for a conservative consumer retail play. Blackstone Group (BX)Blackstone Group LP (NYSE:BX) isn't technically a REIT. It's an investment and fund management service that operates as a limited partnership.The reason it's in this list is because it's an excellent firm that has significant investments in real estate around the world, as well as all the other investment services it provides.What's more, it also delivers a substantial - and reliable - 5.3% dividend.BX is another firm that like the REITs, will benefit mightily from this Goldilocks economy. Up 35% year-to-date with a P/E of 16, there is still plenty of headroom and opportunity for BX to keep on running. Digital Realty (DLR)Digital Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:DLR) specializes in owning and managing properties for data centers as well as co-location services.The latter is a space where data centers are available for rental to retail customers. For example, if you're a smaller company that is ready to launch your product but you don't want to spend a ton of money on a data center until you know how much capacity you need, you use a co-location service so you can right-size your build.DLR is the leader in this fast-growing sector and has been on a tear for a while, since it's also a way to play the cloud computing trend without having to invest directly in volatile cloud stocks.As 5G ramps up in the U.S, there will be another wave of demand for data centers and server space since 5G is almost 1,000x faster than current 4G networks. That means more streaming as well as AI-driven systems and internet of things (IoT) communication (e.g., smart houses, driverless cars, etc).  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy Because of its promise and sector leadership, DLR stock is very popular, so its dividend sits around 3.7% and its growth in the past 12 months is around 11%. It's a solid, steady way to play tech growth. WP Carey (WPC)WP Carey Inc (NYSE:WPC) is another REIT that has been around for a very long time, founded in 1973. Basically, it owns buildings and manages them for its clients. It also manages buildings for clients, as well as runs its own real estate investment business, including placements for other REITs.What makes WPC unique is its 'triple net lease' model, where its clients pay for taxes, maintenance and insurance on the buildings the lease, in addition to rent and utilities. So, WPC just owns the buildings and manages the properties. That's a pretty good deal and means WPC can run a much leaner operation since it isn't dealing with all these other aspects.And those improved margins get passed through to investors as its impressive 5.1% dividend. The stock is also up a solid 25% in the past year. This is a great choice if you're looking for a conservative play in commercial real estate stronger corporate growth. American Campus Communities (ACC)American Campus Communities Inc (NYSE:ACC) is a REIT that specializes in owning, developing and managing on- and off-campus housing for college students.Gone are the days of the rough-and-ready college dorms. Nowadays, the dorms are like nice apartments. Granted, for the money it costs to go to college these days, that may not be too surprising.But the fact is, housing is a big part of the competitive process for colleges. If a student is choosing one school over another, many times, all other things being equal, housing could be the tipping point.ACC currently has 206 communities on or around 96 campuses, with 83 on-campus developments. Plus, this model is a great feature for many schools that don't want to take on the massive efforts and costs to develop and manage these projects themselves.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Tank Your Portfolio ACC is up 26% in the past year and is still delivering a solid 4% dividend. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Medical Properties Trust Inc (NYSE:MPW) rounds off the group as the featured medical and healthcare facilities REIT.Like WPC, MPW is a triple net lease company -- the tenant pays taxes, maintenance and insurance on the property as well as rent and utilities -- that also offers financing to its clients. It can provide 100% financing to companies looking to develop projects from $10 million to $1 billion. Most conventional lenders only offer 60-70% financing.Given the fact that healthcare in the US is a significant long-term issue, especially as the population ages and baby boomers begin to retire in significant numbers, MPW is in the middle of a significant megatrend.With scores of properties across the US, it also has expanded its business to Europe where it has facilities in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy.Up 40% in the past 12 months and still delivering a robust 5.5% dividend and a PE ratio of a mere 6.7, MPW is a compelling way to play the global healthcare trend in industrialized countries.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-05-17,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips If you re like most people when you think about the best stocks to buy in the technology sector you immediately conjure up growth names More to the point you re dialing up speculative upstarts These publicly,7 Tech Stocks to Buy That Are Also Perfect for Retirement
2019-05-17,"If you're like most people, when you think about the best stocks to buy in the technology sector, you immediately conjure up growth names. More to the point, you're dialing up speculative upstarts. These publicly traded companies could change the world as we know it. Or, they could end up like so many poorly planned cryptocurrency-related projects.I'm not just speaking subjectively or through narrow, anecdotal examples. For example, the average employee age in some of the top companies in Silicon Valley is 30 years or younger. This dynamic doesn't give a lot of room or time for people to break into this industry. Thus, many sector investments are marketed as stocks to buy now. After all, who knows what's going to happen tomorrow with these &quot;opportunities.&quot;At the same time, tech is such a broad market. While the sexy, flash-in-the-pan stuff grabs headlines, those with longer-term outlooks (such as retirees) have many options here. In fact, some of the best stocks to buy now are intricately tied with technology.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSure, you can go with the more traditional names associated with retirement strategies. However, tech firms appeal as some of the best stocks in the markets because they'll likely be relevant. For instance, I'm not 100% sure that car manufacturers will represent a good investment 20 years down the line. But companies that specialize in automotive sensors and optics? That's a no-brainer!  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy So with that, let's take a look at the seven best stocks to buy in tech that are also perfect for retirement. International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Shutterstock Peruse the internet and you'll come across several ideas pitching best stocks to buy in tech. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), despite its legacy as a top-tier innovator, doesn't rank highly today. That's hardly surprising given its troubles competing with younger rivals. Also, IBM stock hasn't exactly inspired prospective buyers.That said, IBM currently sports a robust 4.8% dividend yield, which certainly catches the eye. The common criticism, though, is about sustainability. To be sure, Big Blue has had difficulty transitioning to the new tech environment. But what I like here is that management isn't laying down. Instead, they're embracing the challenge.Consider the $550 million partnership between IBM and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) to address the wholesale transition to connectivity, the cloud and artificial intelligence. The company already has a head start in the latter segment with its Watson platform. It has evolved from a Jeopardy! gimmick to a full-fledged AI system. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock In many ways, telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) is emblematic of the U.S.: it's big, bold and has wide-ranging problems. Sure, T stock initially attracts investors, particularly those planning for retirement, due to the very generous 6.7% dividend yield. However, like our country, AT&T is saddled with an unprecedented amount of debt.Most conservative investors look at that and take a beeline for the door. Further adding to the troubles, management has made some business-deal whoppers, and I'm not speaking positively. As a result, AT&T has ramped up its already massive debt, and due to telecom competitiveness, has few growth opportunities.  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week But just like America, you wouldn't choose to live anywhere else. Here's the bottom line: breaking into the elite levels of telecom is next to impossible. AT&T levers the massive infrastructure necessary to make the technologies of tomorrow possible. Thus, you can trust this company as one of the top tech stocks to buy for retirement. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Source: Shutterstock For some of the best stocks to buy for retirement are real-estate investment trusts like Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR). By law, these investments are obligated to distribute 90% of taxable income to shareholders. Currently, DLR stock sports a dividend yield of 3.7%.But what does a REIT have anything to do with tech stocks? The answer is that Digital Reality specializes in housing massive data centers and servers. As our increasingly connected economy moves toward the cloud, the space necessary to store hardware comes at a premium.Because of this dynamic, DLR really sells itself among tech stocks to buy. Barring extremely unusual circumstances, the digital economy will continue to centralize hardware needs to specialized warehouses. Therefore, we can expect to see increasing demand, making this a safe pick well into the future. Texas Instruments (TXN)Source: Shutterstock Tech stocks levered toward the semiconductor industry have generated headlines recently, and for the most part, not the good kind. Geopolitical pressures which have apparently just worsened with on-again-and-off-again tensions between the U.S. and China, have pressured tech firms. Even the usually reliable Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) has felt some heat recently.But if you've got a long-term outlook with your stocks to buy, I wouldn't get discouraged with TXN stock. In fact, quite the opposite: Texas Instruments is likely experiencing a temporarily bearish reaction due to the negative print. On their side, though, TXN is straight-up flying, presenting a solid beat for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings report.  * Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 -- So Far TXN stock also has a viable path forward once we work out this geopolitical mess. Order volume for its next-generation 5G-network related products is increasing, which is hardly surprising given the company's sector leadership position. Iron Mountain (IRM)Source: Shutterstock Admittedly, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) isn't the most appealing name among best stocks to buy in tech. Certainly, it doesn't attract conservative-minded investors who are seeking companies for retirement-planning purposes. Over the last few years, IRM stock has gyrated between ecstasy and despair. Generally, though, shares have tilted negatively.So why mention IRM stock? Fundamentally, the underlying tech firm has an extremely relevant business. Currently, the organization emphasizes its cloud-computing and data-server divisions, in addition to cybersecurity. With high-profile digital data breaches occurring with alarming frequency, it's not rocket science to understand why IRM is important.In addition, I think investors tend to overlook its legacy businesses, including physical-document destruction. This seems like an anachronistic sector, yet companies keep paper records for security and as back-ups. When they no longer need these sensitive documents, IRM provides the scale to service this demand efficiently. 3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock Speaking of physical documents, this is a great segue to discuss 3M (NYSE:MMM). Inarguably, 3M's biggest claim to fame is its ubiquitous Post-it Notes. Simple and yet shockingly effective, a small piece of paper with a sticky end catapulted this organization to worldwide recognition. And in this dizzying pace of digital innovation, 3M stock is still relevant.How so? Consider what happens when technology fails. It's actually alarming how easy it is for our digital networks to collapse on a moment's notice. Failure can stem from individual mistakes, such as dropping and breaking a device to infrastructural disasters, such as blackouts. In all these cases, the only alternative is &quot;analog technologies,&quot; which 3M specializes in.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Beyond that, 3M has solutions for a wide range of industries, including electronics, communications, healthcare, even mining. Given this broad coverage, it's almost impossible for MMM stock not to be relevant in the future. And if you're still not convinced to put 3M on your list of best stocks to buy, just look at its 3.3% dividend yield. American Tower (AMT)Source: Shutterstock American Tower (NYSE:AMT) stands out, both as a viable name in tech, as well as one of the best stocks to buy now. However, on the surface, it doesn't seem that way. With the underlying firm specializing in cell towers, AMT stock wouldn't seem to get much mileage in the 5G era. After all, 5G uses shorter waves that don't require the company's hulking behemoths.But that thinking isn't quite right. For starters, the 5G rollout won't begin in earnest until next year. And even then, we're talking relative baby steps. Businesses and residential communities must transition to the new platform, which requires upgrading physical components. As a result, we'll still have substantial use for 4G technology. That's why AMT is one of the stocks to buy now.But once 5G does start transitioning broadly, AMT is still relevant. Due to its prior-generation wireless projects, the company has valuable real estate to accommodate 5G-specific transmitters. And don't forget that American Tower has a dominant presence worldwide. Developing nations will take time to catch up, providing more opportunities.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long AT&T stock.

2019-05-21,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in April 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]A real estate investment trust (REIT) is dedicated first to income. It is required to send 90% of earnings back to investors in the form of dividends. This means it's unusual to find REITs that also offer capital gains. But I've found REITs to buy whose prices tend to rise over time .Data Center REITs offer hosting, colocation and cloud on-ramps to enterprises and Internet Service Providers. They act as a sort of glue among the Cloud Czars, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you do a Google search for something and then buy it on Amazon, the request and response likely went through a data center owned by a REIT. The data centers hosted by REITs aren't all cloud-based, but they usually require connections to clouds.The colocation market alone continues to grow at 10% each year, driven by the needs of the Cloud Czars, according to Synergy Research. This was a $34 billion market last year.It's part of a larger trend in which the Cloud Czars are taking over the telecommunications market.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential If you're seeking both income and capital gains, you can find both in data center REITs. Here are some good data center REITs to buy Equinix (EQIX)Source: Shutterstock Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) was founded in Redwood City, California in 1998 and has focused on global services almost since its inception. It has a market cap of $40 billion, and last year delivered $9.84 per share in dividends to its shareholders.To a current buyer that's a yield of just 2.17%. But five years ago, the stock was trading at $172 per share. Yesterday it closed at $480. If you bought some shares five years ago, the current dividend would give you a yield of 5.75%. Plus, there's that capital gain, almost 30% per year, doubling what you would have gotten from the average NASDAQ stock.This is key to successful income investing. Don't just focus on the current yield. Let time work for you. If you're on the right side of a trend, you are almost certain to prosper.Last year, Equinix had revenue of $5.09 billion, up from $2.44 billion in 2014, and it brought $365 million of that to the bottom line. The asset base has more than doubled, to $20.24 billion, and while there is $9.44 billion in debt on those assets, the debt-to-asset ratio has been improving.Equinix continues to grow its international footprint, most recently with a new Australian center. Its DC1 building in Virginia was the first large greenfield center to open, 20 years ago, back when such centers were mainly selling themselves as a way for corporations to speed data flows for things like video conferencing, or as alternatives to the Network Access Points (NAPs) that then dominated internet switching.Equinix is not a huge acquirer, its most recent buy being Metronode in 2017.  But that means that other companies' shareholders aren't getting a big chunk of your gains and that the stock isn't being watered down with new shares.All this makes Equinix one of the best data center REITs to buy. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Source: Shutterstock Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) was formed as a public company in 2004 out of 21 data centers acquired out of bankruptcy by GI Partners, a private equity firm. It now has 214 centers with 34.5 million square feet of rentable space in the U.S. and Europe.As of yesterday's close it had a market cap of $26 billion, and last year delivered $4.32 per share in dividends to investors. That's a yield of 3.55%. Add a 19% one-year gain in the stock price and you get a total return of about 22%. Over the last five years, the stock is up 137%, and if you bought in 2014, when the price of the stock was about $60 per share, your current yield is about 7.2%.In 2018, Digital Realty had revenue of slightly over $3 billion, with net income of $341 million, meaning 11% of revenues became net income. The company's assets are worth over $23.7 billion, with $11.1 billion in debt, a slight improvement over 2014. Operating cash flow has also doubled.The company's biggest deal came in 2017, a $7.8 billion agreement to buy DuPont Fabros Technology. But the company quickly came back for more, buying Ascently, based in Brazil, last year for $1.8 billion. The company also broke ground last month for its third center in Singapore.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential Brad Thomas of iREIT Investor notes that, while Digital Realty is an aggressive acquirer of data centers, it doesn't account for acquisitions aggressively, which means it's not stressing its balance sheet at the expense of the long term. Thomas calls Digital Realty's global footprint a big advantage, and its size let it carry $236 million of empty land in fast-growing northern Virginia on its balance sheet. CoreSite Realty (COR)Source: Todd Van Hoosear via Flickr (modified)CoreSite Realty (NYSE:COR) is much smaller than Equinix or Digital Realty, with a market cap of $5.3 billion. CoreSite was born from two &quot;telecom hotels,&quot; as they were called then, in 2001, in San Francisco. It was then called CRG West, and the location was where Internet Service Providers hooked into phone networks, and where enterprises could go for big bandwidth.CoreSite went public in 2009, and then began expanding internationally, starting in London. Its early expansion was funded by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. They reduced their interest to about 29% in 2016.The small size of CoreSite Realty, relative to Digital Realty and Equinix, does give it some big advantages, in the form of capital gains. The shares are up about 270% in the last five years, while quarterly dividends have tripled from 36 cents per share in 2014 to $1.10 now. That dividend yields a fat 4%.CoreSite is the right stock for you if you're mainly looking for exposure to the U.S. internet market. It is, like the other REITs, a great long-term holding. It's expected to raise the dividend again, to $1.29 per share, later this month. It bills itself as offering &quot;hybrid cloud solutions,&quot; with its close connections to big clouds like Amazon and Microsoft, and colocation services for enterprises building their own cloud systems. QTS Realty Trust (QTS)Source: Gothopotam via Flickr (Modified)Smaller market caps can deliver big gains, as CoreSite shows, but there are downsides. A strategic shift can take a stock down hard.QTS Realty Trust (NYSE:QTS) made that kind of shift in 2017, moving from managed services to being a &quot;cloud on-ramp.&quot; The company insisted the new plan would mean big new opportunities, but these have taken time to develop, with repeated misses on earnings estimates taking a toll on the stock.QTS began life in Kansas, in 2003, expanded into Atlanta through a 2005 acquisition, and now has 25 data centers with 5.7 million square feet of rentable space. QTS went public in 2013 and has since doubled in price, while the quarterly dividend has also doubled to its current 44 cents. That represents a yield of 3.91%, and the company's market cap stands at $2.82 billion.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential There are opportunities here, both in the success of its strategy shift and its continuing weakness, which could make it a prize for a larger company. A single transaction can transform an investor's play from the weakest stock on the block to a big stake in one of the strongest. CyrusOne (CONE)Source: Shutterstock Like QTS Realty Trust, CyrusOne (NASDAQ:CONE) is an underperforming company that is said to be attractive to acquirers. CyrusOne's weakness comes from its history of being privately held.CyrusOne wasn't publicly traded until 2013. Founded in 2001, it was bought by private equity players ABRY Partners in 2007 and then by Cincinnati Bell, a small phone company, in 2010. It went public in 2013 and by 2015 Cincinnati Bell had sold out its stake.The company today has 45 data centers, mostly in the U.S., but it also has operations in Europe and Singapore. It expanded into Europe through the 2018 acquisition of Zenium for $442 million.A business that began with small warehouses in central cities, where phone exchanges interconnected, is now built on finding big parcels of empty land near where cloud giants intend to build. A modern data REIT must acquire land and build ahead of demand, competing with other REITs, private equity companies trying to build new REITs from scratch and the cloud owners themselves.Some speculators are betting CONE will be acquired, which keeps the price of the stock up.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hong Kong’s ambitions to be an international data-center hub are a potential casualty of the city’s mass protests. Privacy breaches stemming from a summer of clashes between demonstrators and police threaten to erode confidence in the city as a base for foreign companies to set up storage facilities. To alleviate concerns, the government needs to improve security and regulation in the handling of sensitive data.Last month, dozens of protesters were arrested after being treated in the emergency ward of a public hospital following battles with riot police. The city’s Hospital Authority subsequently denied leaking patient data – despite the discovery of an internal document labeled “for police” that listed names of protesters seeking medical treatment, according to the South China Morning Post. At around the same time, the personal information of more than 800 police officers was hacked and released online.Data centers are a fast-growing market, valued at $31 billion globally in 2017 and forecast by Zion Market Research to grow 14% annually to reach $105 billion by 2026. In Hong Kong, total revenue for data centers is expected to reach $1 billion this year, with three firms sharing 55% of the market: Japan’s NTT Communications Corp.; Sunevision Holdings Ltd., a unit of local developer Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.; and Silicon Valley-based Equinix Inc.The Hong Kong government has targeted the industry for growth, and the city has many advantages that make it an attractive location. The former British colony has a common-law legal system that’s recognized and trusted across the Western world, and its data-privacy laws are among the strictest in Asia. In addition, Hong Kong sits at the mouth of the Greater Bay Area, a grouping of 11 cities with a population of 69 million and annual GDP of $1.5 trillion that China plans to develop into an economic bloc. For multinationals, storing data in Hong Kong bypasses red tape and potential legal minefields in mainland China.Besides its legal system and geographic position, Hong Kong is well equipped with a highly reliable power supply – averaging only 1.5 minutes of unplanned power outages per year, according to one of the city’s two main electricity providers. This compares with 17 to 28 minutes in other major cities such as New York, Sydney and London. Consistent power enables strong broadband capacity and an established fiber-optic network. Another boast is Hong Kong’s low latency transfer in cloud computing – the speed at which information travels from place to place.The government has supported construction of data centers, by offering large financial incentives for companies to set up shop and specifying three locations to build such facilities. Unlike technology hubs such as Silicon Valley, these locations were intentionally set aside to accommodate the sector – no small feat, considering the diminishing supply of available land. Last year, Sunevision bought the last designated plot with a winning bid of $697 million – 45% higher than the estimate of Colliers International Group Inc., the South China Morning Post reported.The sale highlighted the perceived growth prospects for Hong Kong's data-center business. Companies such as Nvidia Corp. and Digital Realty Trust Inc. are also eyeing Hong Kong for expansion opportunities (though the city’s land shortages and red-hot property market may make that easier said than done).These advantages may count for little unless the government sustains confidence in the ability and willingness of authorities to protect data privacy. The leaking by hospitals of protesters’ identities – an apparently blatant privacy breach – caused widespread unease. In the case of the police hack, eight people were eventually charged with dishonest intent and criminal destruction. Still, the ease with which the intrusion took place shocked politicians and the public. Fears of further breaches could scare businesses away.Hong Kong needs to strengthen its data-security laws or risk international companies abandoning the city for more privacy-oriented locations, according to Padraig Walsh, a partner at legal firm Tanner De Witt who focuses on fintech and data privacy. Having been in the vanguard when it passed the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance in 1996, Hong Kong has been overtaken by jurisdictions such as the European Union, which adopted its General Data Protection Regulation in 2017, Walsh said.To remain competitive, the government should consider amending the Hong Kong ordinance to require data users to report breaches and to give the Privacy Commissioner stronger enforcement powers. Singapore will update its privacy laws next year, according to Walsh. If Hong Kong doesn’t adapt, companies will go elsewhere.(Ronald W.

2019-08-16,"Shares of CyrusOne Inc. , a date center real estate investment trust, rose more than 8% Friday, after a Bloomberg report that the company is exploring a sale after drawing takeover interest. The news sent rivals higher with QTS Realty Trust Inc.  up 3.3%, Digital Realty Trust  up 2.7%, CoreSite Realty Corp.  up 2.9% and Equinix Inc.  up 1%. Wells Fargo analysts said the report is likely true and there is a reasonable probability the company will be taken private by a group of private infrastructure investors. Among the reasons that a take-private deal would make sense for CyrusOne is that investors have been paying premiums for hyperscale assets compared with where they would trade in public markets, the analysts wrote in a note to clients. They tend to take a longer-term investment horizon and are less focused on quarter-to-quarter volatility and could lever up the company to enable it more aggressively expand in Europe and other international markets, said the note. &quot;On the other hand, CONE itself has noted that large hyperscale customers prefer to work with other public companies and that their access to public capital should open up dramatically once they get a second investment-grade rating,&quot; they said. CyrusOne is trading at abut 19 times Wells Fargo's next twelve month EBITDA estimate, which compares with Digital Realty's acquisition of REIT DuPont Fabros Technology , which came at a roughly 20 times multiple. &quot;CyrusOne in many ways deserves a premium over DuPont Fabros given it has a strategic international platform, less customer concentration than DFT (which had a large pending rent roll-down with Facebook) and a more diversified business model,&quot; said the note. &quot;On the other hand, this would be an acquisition of significant size for a private infrastructure consortium, which could merit a slight discount (for instance, ZAYO sold at a notable discount to many smaller-scale fiber assets).&quot; CyrusOne shares have gained 32% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 15%.",Data REIT CyrusOne shares soar after report company is exploring a sale

2019-09-18,"One of the best ways to invest for longer-term growth is to identify massive, ground-shifting developments. Once you identify these, find companies which are set to become leaders in the new market.Technology is one of those sectors which tends to present many new developments. These companies mint billionaires from founders and make millions more for the savvy individual investors who get into them early. And one of the big new-new things in technology is Artificial Intelligence stocks, or AI.AI is a big blanket of technology and application. Even some of the most mundane bits of mechanicals can be called AI. Take most modern transmissions in cars. Transmissions used to be dumb. They shifted in pre-determined patterns if automatic -- or merely followed the shifts from manual inputs from drivers. But today's automatic units including from ZF (a public-private company in Germany) have learning capabilities which adapt, learning how the driver of the car operates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThen there is the example that I use on a daily basis involves artificial intelligence (AI). I have a Bloomberg Terminal, which is a vital tool for pulling all sorts of data and information on any economy, market or security. But it also comes with over 2,700 journalists around the globe generating news and other stories each and every day.But interestingly, Bloomberg has adopted AI which combs basic company news releases as well as economic data releases and other basic news and lets its army of robotic writers do the work which increasingly provides a larger percentage of its posted stories.Nothing yet subjective in the robotic writing -- but you never know how this will develop. By the way, I am not a robot.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars But AI has a lot further to go. It can and will lead to autonomous cars and new medical and surgical treatments, as well as design of goods and a host of other applications. This also includes trading of stocks, bonds and other securities. But like for any newer, developing and evolving technology, AI has a lot than can go wrong for individual companies. So, I'll present some artificial intelligence stocks that are proven in their capabilities and will be there for the longer run. And to boot, they also pay dividends. Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: Hercules Capital (HTGC)Hercules Capital Total Return Source BloombergHercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) is based in the U.S. tech mecca of Palo Alto, California, with offices around the nation. It focuses on working with technology companies and has a good track record of financing startups that become bold-faced names in the tech market. The company makes loans and provides other financing, and it also takes equity participation in its portfolio companies. It then works with them like bankers used to do by guiding them along to an exit strategy of being bought or through an IPO.It has numerous hardware and software companies that are part and parcel of the AI sector.Its net interest margin (NIM) which is measure of the cost of funding against interest earnings is ample at 8.9% and the efficiency ratio is good at 52.5% (the lower the ratio, the greater the profitability). Revenues are up 8.8% for the trailing year. That feeds a nice annual dividend stream, including regular special distributions, yielding around 10%.It is a proven performer -- including for the year to date, with a return so far of 18%, before you count in the dividends. Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft Total Return, Source: BloombergMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a major provider of all sorts of software and services which are mission critical for AI. The company offers software and systems which are used to design and operate AI components and whole systems. And to make AI truly work -- particularly with remote devices, including autonomous cars -- you need cloud computing. And Microsoft is currently the second largest cloud company with its Azure services unit.The company continues to move to further its reformation as the poster child for successful tech companies. It's moving from one-off hardware or software sales to recurring revenues from subscriptions as well as contract sales.Revenues are climbing, gaining 14% in the trailing year. Operating margins are fat at 34%, and in turn, these drive a return on equity of a whopping 42.4%.The dividend is a bit less at 1.34% but the distributions continue to rise, with five-year annual gains at 10.44%.And the stock market continues to recognize its very real performance, with the Microsoft stocki price gaining 37% year to date. AT&T (T)AT&T Total Return, Source: BloombergYes, Ma Bell. AT&T (NYSE:T) is also vital for AI. Sure, chip makers might get a lot of the attention. But just like for Microsoft, it is the mainstream companies that provide the guts for AI to operate. And as Hercules provides the next up-and-comers' products, Ma Bell and its wireless services will make them all be able to get access to data to operate.The company is the leading wireless communications company and provides fixed-line data communications for data centers and cloud operations. It also has cable and satellite transmission and content units, including Warner Brothers. Warner Brothers, of course, provides AI engineers with visions of what could be from science fiction films and series.Revenues are a little tamer for now, gaining 6.4% in the trailing year. But operating margins are good at 15.3% which makes for a good return on equity for a big company at 9.5%.The dividend is running at a whopping 5.5% and the distributions keep rising year in and year out by an average of over 2% per year.And thanks to more in the market figuring out what's under the hood of the company including some activist investment funds - the shares have returned 39.08% year to date. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Digital Realty Trust Total Return, Source: BloombergAs noted above in Microsoft, cloud computing is vital to AI. And to make the cloud work, you need massive data centers everywhere.This is where Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) comes in.This is a real estate investment trust (REIT) which owns data centers around the U.S. and in major markets around the world where AI is being developed and implemented. And data centers are hard to quickly replicate -- making the assets of the REIT all the more valuable.Revenues are up in the trailing year by 23.9%. And the return from its funds from operations (FFO), which measures the return just from the actual revenues from its properties, is a very high for a REIT rate of 16.40%.And like for REITs in general, the dividend is higher than the general stock market at 3.38%. It has been on the rise just over the past twelve months by 7.32% in distribution amounts.Digital Realty Trust is also a good performer for shareholders with a total return for just the year to date of 23.04%. That is right on track with the returns over the past 10 years at 330.91% for an average annual equivalent return of 15.72%. And one more word on that nice dividend. Thanks to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 and a particular line item, the dividend comes with a 20% deduction for individual investors from their income tax liability, making the yield even higher on a tax-equivalent basis.Those are my picks for artificial intelligence stocks with proven companies with less risk and attractive dividends.

2019-09-19,"(Bloomberg) -- New suitors have emerged for CyrusOne Inc., the data-center company exploring a sale.The Dallas-based real estate investment trust has drawn interest from rival Digital Realty Trust Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. The investment firms EQT Partners and Digital Colony Partners have also partnered to pursue a potential deal for the company, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public.Discussions are ongoing and may not lead to a deal, the people said.CyrusOne, which began exploring options with advisers this summer after receiving takeover interest, closed up 2.6% in New York trading Thursday, for a market value of about $8.6 billion. The shares have gained more than 53% this year.Representatives for Digital Colony, Digital Realty and EQT declined to comment. Representatives for CyrusOne didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.A bidder group including KKR & Co., Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and I Squared Capital was also considering an offer for CyrusOne, Bloomberg reported last month.Demand for data center assets has intensified as infrastructure managers flush with cash look to capitalize on the trend of companies relying on third parties for managing their data. REITS that specialize in data centers have also been seeking to expand globally through acquisitions.Founded in 2001, CyrusOne has a network of 48 data centers serving about 1,000 customers in the U.S., the U.K., Singapore and Germany, according to its most recent annual report.Digital Colony is a communications infrastructure-focused investment firm and EQT is one of the largest buyout firms in Europe. In May, they partnered to buy fiber network owner Zayo Group Holdings Inc. for more than $8 billion.Digital Realty, like CyrusOne, is a REIT focused on data centers. Last year, it acquired Brazil’s Ascenty for about $1.8 billion.Brookfield, among the world’s largest alternative-asset managers, has also been increasing its technology-related infrastructure bets, buying a portfolio of data centers from AT&T Inc. last year for $1.1 billion.(Updates share price in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Scott Deveau.To contact the reporters on this story: Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.net;Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, ;Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Daniel TaubFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",CyrusOne Draws Interest From Rival Digital Realty

2019-09-26,"As we highlighted recently, the best place to find dividend stocks could the tech sector. Need an example? Just take a look at Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent wins on the shareholder rewards front. MSFT just announced that it plans on increasing its payout by 11% and is conducting a whopping $40 billion buyback program.When you add this huge increase to its payout, Microsoft quickly becomes one of the best dividend stocks ever. In fact, MSFT raises its quarterly dividend every year since it began paying one in 2004. And MSFT isn't alone when it comes to tech-sector dividend stocks.Like Mr. Softy, there are countless others that have become cash flow and profit machines. With service revenues driving the show, margins in the sector have never been higher. This has only filled tech stocks coffers to the brim. With so much cash now overflowing their balance sheets, they can't help but return it. In turn, the sector has become fertile ground for finding dividend stocks. And while initial yields may not be as high as utilities or consumer staples names, the sector can't be beaten when it comes to dividend growth. MSFT's big quarterly jump is a testament to that.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Next-Gen Growth Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains Which tech stocks are rewarding their shareholders just like Microsoft? Here are five dividend stocks to consider in the sector. Microchip Technology (MCHP)Dividend Yield: 1.62%You may not realize it, but your coffee pot and the most complex supercomputer do have something in common with each other. They both are able to operate courtesy of semiconductors. Given that the modern world runs on this important backbone, the semiconductor sector has long been a great place to comb for tech dividend stocks. And one of the best and earliest payers in the sector could be Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP).MCHP produces what are known as analog and microcontroller semiconductors. Truth be told, there's nothing too special about analog chips. But if it wasn't for these boring chips, modern society wouldn't function. But boring is beautiful when it comes to dividends and cash flows.As the world continues to modernize and lean on technology, demand for analog chips of all kinds have grown. That has benefited Microchip's bottom line in a big way. Year-over-year sales clocked in 9.1% higher last quarter and over the longer term, MCHP has seen profitability for 114 consecutive quarters. That's pretty much unheard of in the semiconductor sector which tends to have wild swings in profits and losses.That sort of consistency has made MCHP a dividend stalwart among tech stocks. Since its initial payout in 2002, Microchip has managed to grow its dividend by 1725%.More could be in store for investors as well. Thanks to some smart acquisitions, MCHP has started to pivot into more advanced semiconductors. Chips like automotive power units, battery and green technologies and networking semis all come with bigger margins. These could help boost its 1.62% yield much further. Garmin (GRMN)Dividend Yield: 2.72%A few years ago, Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) was knocking on heaven's door. Not really, but that was the perception. Thanks to the rise of smartphones, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Maps and other GPS applications, GRMN's perceived main bread-and-butter in automotive navigation was dying a quick death. However, the reality is that GRMN is much more than a GPS.The firm makes a host of marine and aviation GPS navigation equipment that is the standard for many end-users. This includes consumers and industrial applications. Meanwhile, its line of wearable devices has also become one of the standard brands for serious athletes and runners. The truth is, Garmin continues to succeed in these other markets -- with the proof in the pudding. With revenues jumping 7% overall and aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor sales growing by 12% last quarter, management at GRMN have been able to raise its annual guidance for fourth consecutive year in a row.The best part is that profits at Garmin continue to jump as these divisions come with higher profit margins. A recent pivot to include more services and reoccurring revenues hasn't hurt either.  * 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Set for Growth This has allowed Garmin to generate plenty of free cash flows. After holding onto that extra cash for a bit in order to reinvest and overcome its auto woes, GRMN is back on the dividend growth front. It never actually cut its payout, it just held it steady for a bit. With a 2.72% yield and new product launches coming down the line, GRMN stock makes a compelling stock for dividend seekers. OpenText (OTEX)Dividend Yield: 1.70%Because it's excluded from many international indexes, most ignore our neighbors in the Great White North. But Canada has long been a great place to find technology firms and dividend stocks. Take OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX), for example.The firm has been around for more than a decade and provides enterprise information management software and solutions. Basically, it's digging into a firm's data and coming up with insights into that information. Companies can use this in a variety of ways to make decisions, design new products, cut costs, etc.The win is that OTEX's platform is able to mine all varieties of data together -- from HR and CRM to security and supply chain metrics. And thanks to the birth of cloud computing, OTEX's services continue to be in hot demand.The firm counts more than 74,000 customers -- both big and small. And those customers continue to drive new revenues into OpenText's coffers. Overall sales jumped by 3.8% last quarter. The real star was cloud computing revenues, gaining 10.2%. OTEX itself has started to offer plenty of cloud solutions for its own products. Because of this and the popularity of its products, in just five years annual recurring revenues have doubled.What all of this has done is make OTEX stock a cash flow and dividend machine. Since in initiating a steady payout in 2015, OpenText has managed to grow its dividend by nearly 150%. This makes the Canadian firm a powerful dividend stock in the tech sector. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Dividend Yield: 3.38%Since it's a real estate investment trust (REIT), having Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) on a list of tech dividend stocks may seem out of place. That is until you realize what kind of REIT DLR is. The firm owns and operates data center locations.It doesn't matter the technology trend -- cloud computing, mobile commerce, big data, etc. -- all require massive computing systems and storage. The problem is that it is awfully cost-prohibitive to buy all the necessary hardware and the specialized buildings this can require. This is where data center specialists like Digital Realty come in. DLR currently owns more than 210 of these locations across the world. Top tech firms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) basically rent space inside its specialized buildings to store their computers and server equipment.It turns out this is a very profitable niche to be in. As tech has grown, so has DLR's cash flows. Since its founding in 2005, Digital Realty has had its core funds from operations (FFO) grow by 13% per year. And as a REIT, that rising FFO number directly translates into higher dividends. DLR has managed to grow its payout every year for the last four years straight.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Under $10 More growth could be on the way. DLR continues to buyout smaller and larger rivals as well as construct new data centers. However, even this isn't enough satiate demand. That means there could many years of dividend increases still to go from this tech stock. Broadcom (AVGO)Dividend Yield: 3.84%Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Talk about a transition. Looking at Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) history of buyouts, spin-offs, and mergers is enough to make your head spin. This continues with its last two major deals: its acquisition of CA Technologies and its recent buyout proposal of security firm Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC).But the focus is the same and that's &quot;connecting everything.&quot; Today, AVGO is a provider of both semiconductors and infrastructure software products. Its collection of products puts it right in the crosshairs of some big trends -- this includes data center networking, home connectivity, smartphones, factory automation, broadband access, you name it. AVGO is able to provide the hardware to connect devices, dig into that connection and manage data with its CA software. If the buyout goes through, it can also protect those connections with SYMC.It's really becoming an all-in-one shop for other tech firms looking to build their own networks and products.The key to all of this comes to down to licensing. While chips drive sales, both CA and SYMC have huge backlogs of steady reoccurring revenues. The integration of CA has helped Broadcom boost its bottom line as well as margins. SYMC should do the same.Because of this and overall strong profit growth, AVGO has continued to share the wealth with shareholders. Since offering an interim dividend in 2010, Broadcom has managed to grow its payout significantly. Today, the tech stock yields 3.84%, but with the addition of SYMC, that payout should grow further down the road.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-12-02,"Real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a way for investors to gain access to assets such as apartments and office buildings while often collecting generous yields - had a disappointing 2018. With just a few days left to go in the year, the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) had lost 13.5% compared to a 12% decline for the broader market. This contrasts with 10-year average annual gains of just more than 12% for the VNQ.Will REITs bounce back in 2019? Well, the same fear that hampered these real-estate plays in 2018 - rising interest rates - still is on the board for the coming year. And higher rates on bonds sometimes hamper the performance of REITs.However, these companies are not created equal. The best REITs for 2019 could benefit from other powerful trends in 2019. For instance, cloud computing's growth should continue to fuel robust demand for data storage services. A massive infrastructure spending bill could improve the fortunes of related REIT plays. And mobile-data growth, as well as the rollout of lightning-fast 5G technology, offers potential growth for cell-tower REITs.Here are the 13 best REITs to buy and hold in 2019. Not only should they benefit from broad trends that could help them outperform their brethren, but REITs as a whole are trading at much more palatable valuations lately. Moreover, average dividend yields in the space currently exceed 4%; all the more reason for investors to stick with REITs if market rockiness continues in the coming year.

The REIT sector is viewed by many as a bond proxy, given its relatively stable equity characteristics and high dividend yield. The XLRE's dividend yield is 2.84%, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note  was 1.581%, down 3.6 basis points from Thursday. The 10-year yield has lost 33.8 basis points since the end of 2019, and was approaching the 3-year low of 1.459% hit on Sept. 4, 2019. Meanwhile, the implied yield on the S&P 500  was 1.79%. Among the XLRE's biggest gainers Friday, shares of Digital Realty Trust Inc.  rose 3.1%, Public Storage  advanced 1.8% and Extra Space Storage Inc.  tacked on 1.7%.",REIT stocks stretch win streak to another record as bond yields fall

2020-02-20,"Jason Clark is a contributing editor to the industry-leading, value-oriented advisory service, The Prudent Speculator. Here, he looks at two recommendations in the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector.",Value in REITs- Digital Realty and Regency Centers
2020-02-25,"Shares of real estate investment trusts (REITs) suffered a broad selloff in afternoon trading Tuesday, despite another tumble in the 10-year Treasury yield to a record low. REITs tend to outperform when Treasurys rally and yields fall, as their relatively high dividend yields make them more attractive in a lower yield environment, and their usual relative price stability makes tends to make them attractive in a volatile market environment. The SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF  dropped 2.4%, with 30 of 31 components losing ground, just a little better than the S&P 500's  2.8% decline. The REIT ETF's yield is 2.93% while the implied yield for the S&P 500 is 1.94%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield  fell 6.0 basis points to a record low of 1.317%. Within the REIT sector tracker, the biggest loser and most active stock was Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. , which slumped 5.8%. Among other more-active components, shares of Ventas Inc.  declined 5.3%, Digital Realty Trust Inc.  slipped 0.2% and Simon Property Group Inc.  gave up 3.7%.",REIT stocks suffer broad weakness despite drop in 10-year Treasury yield to record low
2020-02-27,"While the economy is booming, there are some warnings signs starting to flash. Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin – who started trading at age 19, and now at 51 has amassed a fortune worth $15 billion – spoke about some of the near- and long-term risks in a recent interview.Griffin sees inflation as a danger in the longer term, mostly because the financial experts lack tools to determine when inflationary trends are starting. Griffin recounts how his firm’s best analysts were caught flat-footed in 2018 when the Fed started raising rates. Regarding the lack of accurate predictive foresight, Griffin says, “If there were inflation, the markets are utterly and completely unprepared for that.”But inflation, being invisible for now, is a long-term worry. Griffin sees the coronavirus outbreak has a larger threat, at least for the present. Griffin notes that a number of major companies – Apple is a particularly good example – have already announced lower Q4 and Q1 earnings, disrupted supply chains, and even store closings in response to the viral epidemic as it expands out of China. Griffin describes the epidemic as “probably the most concrete short-run risk we see in the financial markets globally.”The coronavirus is even impacting diplomacy. Griffin points out that specific terms of the US-China Phase 1 trade agreement have not yet begun implementation. The agreement puts an obligation on China to increase imports of US products on the order of $200 billion for the next two years – but that is on hold with large parts of China paralyzed by quarantines and global trade and travel patterns facing growing disruption.So, it may be interesting to see which stocks Griffin is willing to buy, given his view of the risks ahead. A look at the most recent 13F filing by Citadel, his hedge fund, reveals three new positions that TipRanks’ Stock Screener reveals as “strong buys.” Let's take a closer look.NexTier Oilfield Solutions (NEX)The first of Griffin’s new positions, we’ll look at is NexTier, a player in the oil field support services sector. Companies like NexTier don’t actually drill for oil, but they provide the support that the exploration and drilling operators need get the oil out of the ground. Without this support – the rig services, well completion, pumps and piping for fracking operations, and fluid management and disposal – the great oil fracking boom that has helped to power the US economy over the past 15 years could not have occurred.NEX is a new ticker in the market, formed during the third quarter last year when Keane Group and C&J Energy Services merged. The name change to NexTier reflects that the transaction was a merger of equals. NEX inherited the performance legacy of Keane, and the combined company reported Q3 earnings and revenues above the forecasts. It was the second quarter in a row that the company beat expectations. Looking ahead, the company will be reporting Q4 results on March 10, and is guiding for a net loss of 2 cents per share. The company is also guiding revenue in the $640 to $660 million range, slightly higher than previous guidance.So, we have a well-positioned services company in the oil industry – and Griffin’s fund bought up 6.169 million shares. That purchase represents a new stake for Citadel, and it’s worth over $30 million dollars at today’s prices.Conventional wisdom says the move is worth it. Sean Meakim, reviewing the stock for JPMorgan, is even more bullish. He writes, “We view NexTier as a leader in the industry in terms of driving technology improvements, and think it can continue to make strides in 2020to offset the macro headwinds. We model NEX delivering FCF of ~$50mm in 4Q19, sufficient to provide fuel for the company’s $100mm capital distribution plan…”Meakim puts a $9 price target on NEX shares, suggesting room for an impressive 84% upside potential. (To watch Meakim’s track record, click here)Overall, NexTier has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target of $7.90 implies an upside of 74% for the coming year. (See NexTier stock analysis at TipRanks)Aon Plc. (AON)Next on our list of new Citadel positions is Aon, a $50 billion player in the professional services and risk management industry. Aon is known as a major insurance broker, and works with large-scale clients to negotiate and place insurance policies, advise on health and other benefits, organize retirement compensation schemes, and even outsource human resources.Aon’s revenues and stock performance have been on an upward trajectory over the past year. In Q4 2019, the company reported $2.89 billion in total revenue, in line with the forecast and the year-ago number by 4%. EPS, at $2.53, was 1.6% higher than expected and most impressive 74% above the Q4 2018 figure.Share gains have been impressive, too. AON is up over 30% in the past 12 months. Complementing the share gains, AON also offers a modest dividend. At 0.79%, the yield is nothing to write home about, the share price is high enough that the annualized payment is $1.76 per share. It’s small addition for investors to count among the gains.Griffin clearly is impressed by the prospective gains here. His fund snapped up over 350,000 shares of Aon, which are now worth $77.9 million.Covering AON for Wells Fargo, analyst Elyse Greenspan writes, “We think AON is positioned to outperform as a stand-alone company or if they acquire WLTW. We believe a stand-alone AON is positioned to see industry-leading organic revenue growth and has several tailwinds to its FCF in 2020. If there is a deal, it would likely be because AON believes they can pull a healthy level of expenses out of WLTW without significant revenue disynergies. Recall AON and WLTW entered into deal negotiations last year that were called off in March 2019 and the one-year stand still on discussions ends on 3/6/20. Further, AON’s CEO has been an expense master during his tenure at AON and has been able to consistently pull expenses out of the company.&quot;Greenspan's $265 price target suggests an upside potential for AON of 20%. More importantly, she upgraded her stance on the stock, shifting from Neutral to Buy. (To watch Greenspan’s track record, click here)Aon’s Strong Buy consensus rating is supported by 5 analyst reviews, including 4 Buys and just 1 Hold. The stock is selling for $237.25, and the average price target of $237.25 indicates room for a modest 7% upside. (See Aon stock analysis at TipRanks)Digital Realty Trust (DLR)The final stock on our list is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), specializing in data center and other tech-related properties. DLR owns properties around the world, in 15 countries, and boasts over 210 operating data centers. Like all REITs, Digital is required by US tax law to pay back the bulk of its profits to investors.Those profits can be substantial, as the company brings in over $3 billion annually on the top line. Earnings were robust in Q4 2019, at $1.62 per share. Estimated EPS for Q1 2020, to be reported in April, is $1.59.With robust earnings, DLR has no problem maintaining its dividend payments. Most REITs pay out strong dividends, as it is an easy way to remain in compliance with tax code regulations on profit sharing. DLR offers a 3.3% dividend yield, paid out quarterly at $1.08 per share. The payout ratio, which compares the quarterly dividend payment to the quarterly earnings, is 66.7%, indicating that the company can easily sustain the dividend given current income levels. DLR has raised its payment in each of the last three years.Strong earnings, a reliable dividend, and a pattern of long-term gains (this stock is up 34% over the last three years) are exactly the features that will attract attention from a hedge fund. So, it should be no surprise that Griffin’s fund picked up over 249,000 shares of DLR in Q4. Like the other stocks in this article, this is a new position for Griffin. At current prices, the fund’s stake in Digital Realty is worth $35.6 million.Weighing in on the stock for SunTrust Robinson, 5-star analyst Greg Miller is upbeat, saying, &quot;We believe investors will continue to respond favorably to the execution of the business model. Sequentially higher 4Q signed leasing is not typical, underscoring DLR’s momentum… we believe the stock will continue to move higher.&quot;Miller’s Buy rating is supported by his $152 price target, which suggests room for 16% upside growth to the stock. (To watch Miller’s track record, click here)Wall Street’s analysts have given DLR 6 Buys and 2 Holds recently, making the consensus view a Strong Buy. The average price target is $137, which implies a small premium of 5% from the current share price of $130.38.

2020-03-19,"When stocks go from setting all-time highs to tumbling 20% into a bear market in only three weeks, there are precious few places for equity investors to hide. But that doesn't mean defensive, low-volatility stocks aren't doing their jobs.Investment professionals helping people construct a diversified portfolio always harp on the need for stocks that will hold up better in hard times. Well, hard times are here, and so it's time to see exactly how much defense the top performing defensive stocks are actually providing.We screened the S&P; 500 for stocks in classically defensive sectors: consumer staples, utilities, health care and real estate. Next we limited ourselves to low-volatility stocks with a ""beta"" of less than 1.0. Beta is a measure of volatility that indicates how closely a stock's price movement correlates with a benchmark.For example, the S&P; 500 has a beta of 1.0. Any stock that has a beta less than 1.0 can be said to be less volatile than the broader market. What this means in practice is that low-beta stocks tend to lag the broader market when stocks are going up, but - critically - they also hold up better when the S&P; 500 is in decline.Recent market carnage means it's time for defensive, low-beta stocks to shine. Even if they lose value in a selloff, they should lose less value than the broader market.

The company provides co-location and interconnection services and owns 225 data centers.",3 Stocks to Buy if You're Worried About a Recession
2020-05-22,"The coronavirus crisis has effectively reset the board. While both the economy and stock market will someday return to their earlier-year strength, neither will look the same. That means some of the best stocks to buy right now might look much different from top picks just a few quick months ago.The market might very well have another leg down. It's far too early to say we're out of the woods given that most of America is under quarantine and we have yet to see what first-quarter earnings and second-quarter guidance looks like. But we're getting late in the game for a truly defensive posture. That's closing the barn door after the horse has already bolted. While a few protective picks might be in order, now is the time to start planning for the next bull market.Even professional bears are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;I'm selectively buying in my personal accounts,&quot; says John Del Vecchio, co-manager of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (HDGE). &quot;There were plenty of companies that went into this crisis on life support, kept alive by cheap debt. You're going to see a lot of these companies fail. But at the same time, a lot of high-quality blue chips are on sale right now at prices we may never see again in our lifetimes.&quot;Many companies will be gutted. It might take years for airlines to return to pre-crisis passenger numbers, and they might go through bankruptcy or a government conservatorship in the meantime. Likewise, retailers and restaurants might be dealing with the fallout from lockdowns for months or years, as will their banks and landlords.However, some of Wall Street's best stocks could come out of this with relatively minor scratches. Many have massive stores of cash that will help them weather short-term profit drops. Some might actually benefit from a coming recession by picking up market share when its competitors fold.  Many of these beneficiaries are tech stocks, but certainly not all. Plenty are in the gritty, old-fashioned real economy.Today, we'll look at 20 of the best stocks to buy now as investors shift their focus to the recovery. These companies boast a blend of well-positioned businesses, strong balance sheets and/or leading positions within their industries.

2020-05-28,"The real estate sector has, simply put, been a loser in 2020.Real estate investment trusts (REITs), which own and operate various types of properties and facilities, are off nearly 11% versus a 6% decline for the S&P; 500&#92;. But there's a world of difference separating the sector's best REITs and its worst.Much of the pain in real estate has come courtesy of retail-focused companies, many of which have lost more than 50% of their value as investors correctly surmised that stay-at-home orders would minimize shopping trips and curtail customer spending. Office REITs have experienced outsized struggles, too, as shuttered businesses are unable to pay rents, and as large-scale work-from-home strategies have investors rethinking the future of office space.Not every REIT sector has been equally affected, however. Some REITs are riding out the pandemic shutdowns relatively unscathed - and some are even benefiting from the recent sea changes.However, while defensive business models are an important characteristic to have when determining REITs to buy, other qualities should be considered, too. Solid balance sheets are a must. Conservative payouts, which leave room for dividends to be easily covered in the event of a shock, and raised in the future when all is well, are ideal, too.Here are nine of the best REITs to buy not just for their durable businesses, but also their financial strength and dividend coverage.

But that is changing and 5G stocks are quickly becoming a hot investment theme.All major phone makers are making sure their newest models are 5G-ready. And telecom equipment makers are running a full speed to build out 5G equipment and networks around the globe.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat's more, there's another feud between the U.S. and China on 5G technology. While China has been a leader in 5G development and has already woven into telecom systems in the rural U.S., Washington is voicing concerns over the security of the networking equipment.China says it's simply a ploy to hamstring Chinese companies, while U.S. and European companies catch up in the 5G market.Wherever the truth lies, there's plenty of opportunity with 5G stocks, since China's privately held Huawei isn't likely to run away with all the global 5G business.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand My selection of the best 5G stocks includes the following seven stocks:  * Telefon AB LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC)  * Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF)  * Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR)  * Corporate Office Properties (NYSE:OFC)  * BCE Inc (NYSE:BCE)  * AT&T (NYSE:T)  * Verizon (NYSE:VZ)For an in-depth look at the biggest winners in the 5G revolution, InvestorPlace advisor Matt McCall's 5G Highway Super Portfolio considers many facets to the movement that investors are overlooking. But these seven stocks in particular remain among the best 5G stocks to buy. 5G Stocks to Buy: Ericsson (ERIC)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com One Huawei's major competitors in the 5G equipment space right now is this Sweden-based telecom firm.You may remember this company way back in the dotcom days (a whole 20 years ago!) when it was a juggernaut in setting up wireless networks around the globe and even offering some pretty popular mobile phones.After the dotcom bubble burst and the first wave of mobility was over and a number of companies saw opportunity in the sector and moved in, ERIC hung on for dear life. But now, Ericsson is again a leading 5G equipment provider, supporting 55 live 5G networks, in 27 countries, including China.ERIC stock is finally getting the attention it deserves, which means it's still one of the and it's up 35% in the past 12 months, near its 52-week high. There's plenty more growth to come. Samsung Electronics (SSNLF)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com There's little doubt that you haven't yet heard of this South Korea-based electronics giant.But it's not in this list because all of its mobile phones will be 5G-ready by the end of the year. Or that 90% of its phones will be Internet of Things (IoT) enabled.In fact, 5G is about much more than just faster mobile phone connectivity. It will enable the next steps in multiple technological revolutions, which is a large part of why identifying the best 5G stocks to buy is so important for today's investors.The biggest benefit of Samsung from a 5G perspective is its 5G chipsets. It is a massive chip maker.According to B2B networker BizVibe, Samsung is the largest semiconductor chipmaker by revenue in the world by a large margin. It has 44.8% of the global chip market, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) far behind in second place, with 15.5%.The fact is, Samsung makes chips for all its own devices as well as a lot of others. Its consumer electronics is its most obvious business but its dominance in chips is significant.And if its phones are all 5G enabled, it is also selling those chips to other phone makers.What's more, it also sells the networking equipment that makes 5G run.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks Ready to Become Large Caps SSNLF stock is a little more difficult to buy because it is only listed in South Korea, but its ADR is available and worth the trouble. SSNLF is up 33% in the past year and will be a strong player for many years to come. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Source: Shutterstock This real estate investment trust (REIT) is one of the leaders in hosting secure, reliable and state of the art data center properties for cloud computing, artificial intelligence, financial services, healthcare and networking.In that laundry list you can include 5G networking equipment.DLR estimates that there will be 75 billion mobile phones in use by 2025. And by that point they will all be using 5G technology, which is 100x faster than current 4G technology. That's the difference between downloading a movie in 7 minutes with 4G, versus 10 seconds with 5G.That's a game changer. And DLR will be the company that carriers and networkers turn to for data centers that are ready for the coming 5G boom.With 280 data centers in 22 countries on 6 continents, Digital Realty Trust will be a major player.DLR stock is up 30% in the past year and still delivers a respectable 2.8% dividend. Corporate Office Properties (OFC)Source: Shutterstock This is another REIT that is in the office property and data center sectors, but it is less than a tenth of the market cap of DLR.However, it has a very specific niche that makes it a key 5G stock to consider. Specifically, it operates around the Washington, D.C. area to government agencies, defense and intelligence agencies and contractors.Its top 3 tenants include the General Services Administration (the U.S. government's real estate department) with 34% of total 2019 revenue, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 7.9% and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) at 4.9%.That is the ideal tenant in today's market. What's more, working with the defense and intelligence communities means OFC can build out secure data centers to exactly the specifications that their clients' need and know that they'll get pricing to make it profitable.However, as McCall reminds us, 5G &quot;road builders&quot; like OFC, DLR and others on this list are just the tip of the iceberg. They will be among the power players in the 5G revolution, but the key players he identifies with his research team are the ones that will drive on that road for years to come with their breakthrough technologies.  * The 7 Best 5G Stocks to Buy Now OFC stock is off 5% in the past year, but it delivers a 4% dividend. And many analysts are beginning to upgrade the stock in recent weeks. BCE (BCE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Investors often look to telecom stocks like BCE for income. After all, telecoms often pay some of the largest dividends. But that's not the only way to find income. My book, Income for Life details more than 60 different revenue streams anyone can collect.While you sift over all of those unique ways to make money, I'd also like to change the way you view BCE stock. Instead of looking at it as just a telecom stock, imagine its role in our upcoming 5G future.It has been a dominant carrier for almost 40 years, it's a household name and it doesn't have a ton of competition.BCE is the Baby Bell of Canada. For those of you too young to remember, AT&T (aka, Ma Bell) dominated the entire North American phone market until it was broken up into the &quot;Baby Bells&quot; in 1984 through an anti-trust lawsuit.Bell Canada Enterprises was formed in 1983 and remains one of Canada's largest companies and a dominant player in the nation's telecommunications industry.And now it's set to be one of the key road builders in 5G networks. In June, it launched the largest 5G network in Canada. It's using equipment from Nokia (NYSE:NOK), so there won't be any trade issues with the U.S. or Europe regarding its 5G infrastructure in the future.BCE stock is off a bit over 7% in the past year, but it has a 5.7% dividend and will be a reliable and important telecom stock in the long term. AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock Ma Bell was such a powerful force before its breakup that there was a movie in the early 1970s where it was simply called (tongue in cheek of course) The Phone Company.After the breakup, AT&T lost its local markets, but kept its international markets and national U.S. market. No one was thinking about mobile phones back then, so they weren't in the deal.The Baby Bells had a good run until the mobile wave hit. And then AT&T dove back in and became a dominant player almost immediately.Today it has a market cap of $212 billion and is one of the bluest blue chips around. But it also has a lot more competition. That's why it has diversified into content and streaming services.All this has been new to this traditional telecom and it has proven to be a bumpy ride. But this is a long-term play.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand T stock is off 13% in the past 12 months, but it has a secure dividend of nearly 7%. There are some near-term concerns about consumer belt-tightening and defaults, but it will endure. Verizon (VZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com This company was one of the Baby Bells that flourished after the breakup. Bell Atlantic, as it was called operated in a very important corridor -- Virginia to New Jersey.That meant it had all the U.S. government, all the New York businesses and offices in New Jersey, as well as Philadelphia and other key Mid-Atlantic business and population hubs.When the mobile telecom revolution hit, it went on an acquisition spree buying up mobile territories where weaker Baby Bells couldn't afford to launch mobile divisions.Soon it was neck and neck with AT&T and optimizing its fiber optic network to deliver content which directly competed with cable providers.It now carries a $240 billion market cap, yet trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 12x. And it's the No. 1 mobile carrier in the U.S.It's suffering the same challenges as AT&T regarding competition and defaults, but it has found a way to keep out of the content side (aside from online platforms AOL and Yahoo!) and maximize its platform for content providers.VZ stock is up almost 4% in the past year and also has a rock-solid 4.2% dividend.If you're looking for the most profitable stocks to buy on 5G prospects, the list doesn't end with these seven stocks.

2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is betting on data centers.The New York-based firm’s infrastructure arm, part of its merchant bank, agreed to invest an initial $500 million in Global Compute Infrastructure LP, a platform helmed by Scott Peterson, the former chief investment officer at Digital Realty Trust Inc.“We think the industry has tremendous tailwinds amid continued penetration of cloud service providers,” Scott Lebovitz, global co-head and co-CIO of Goldman’s infrastructure investment group, said in an interview. Digital migration trends, already under way before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, have accelerated, he said.Including debt, Global Compute will have a roughly $1.5 billion war chest to do deals in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. As future opportunities arise, Goldman and its fund investors may contribute additional capital toward the venture, Lebovitz said.Data-center transaction valuations have risen in recent years as the sector won favor with institutional investors in part because of expected ongoing growth. Lebovitz said Goldman Sachs has confidence in Global Compute’s operating expertise in various areas. Peterson, Global Compute’s chief executive officer, oversaw some $17 billion in deal volume across both organic development and mergers and acquisitions during his tenure at Digital Realty.“There’s so much capital chasing deals, but based on the breadth of our track record, we believe we can find, evaluate and underwrite transactions as well as serve the critical needs of our customers,” Peterson said in an interview.Peterson and Global Compute Chief Operating Officer Chris Kenney were longtime executives at real estate investment trust Digital Realty. Another Digital Realty veteran, Stephen Taylor, is Global Compute’s head of Europe.Global Compute separately agreed to acquire ATM SA, a Polish data center and communications infrastructure business, from a group led by MCI and Mezzanine Management. Both Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. have announced plans to invest heavily in Poland.Following the Global Compute investment, Goldman’s third infrastructure fund -- at $2.5 billion - is now more than 70% deployed. The firm is preparing to raise a fourth fund, likely dubbed West Street Global Infrastructure Partners IV LP, early next year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on fundraising plans.Global Compute isn’t Goldman’s first foray into data centers. Its special situations arm previously owned a stake in AirTrunk, which it sold earlier this year to an arm of Macquarie Group Ltd.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Goldman’s Infrastructure Arm Makes $500 Million Data-Center Bet

2021-01-15,"China is a massive economy, and one that continues to be a major engine of global growth. It’s armed with massive amounts of domestic capital to fund major economic expansion now and for years to come. It has been a compelling place for businesses to start, develop and thrive. And in turn, it is drawing the attention of domestic and international investors looking for stocks to buy. The Chinese stock market as measured by the China Stock Index 300 had been lagging the S&P 500 Index until this past year. Over the trailing year, the CSI 300 Index has returned (in U.S. dollar terms) 41.75%, compared to the S&P 500 Index’s return of 18.40%. Source: China CSI 300 & S&P 500 Indexes Total Return – Source: Bloomberg But China and its economy are not just about the domestic market. There are also numerous companies there that are based in the broader Asian region, or beyond.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips I have worked in China going back to the early 1990s and have served major manufacturers and financial companies in capitalizing on the opportunities in the nation. And in November, China led a major regional trade deal that has set the stage for a massive further development of the economy and markets. I see this, along with the pending changes in the U.S. Administration, bringing less capricious economic and market policies. That’s setting up major opportunities for investors. So let’s talk about the ones to keep an eye on now. The Biggie Deal The biggest trade deal in the world was signed in November after more than nine years of planning and negotiations. It is called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, which to me calls to mind the word reciprocal. Reciprocal is how I view this treaty that involves fifteen nations representing nearly one third of the world’s population and nearly the same portion of the globe’s gross domestic product (GDP). That means more than 2.2 billion people and $26.2 trillion in a U.S. dollar equivalent amount. Source: Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RECP) Members — Source: RCEP. RCEP has nothing to do with the U.S. Instead, it focuses on what matters to nations and leading economies of the Asia-Pacific region. It includes China, Japan, South Korea and Australia and New Zealand as the biggies of the region. And it also includes major transitioning economies, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand. Vietnam and even Brunei. It will end nearly all tariffs between members on imports. This will allow input goods, resources, energy and other items to be able to freely flow across borders facilitating the benefits of Adam Smith’s economic theory of competitive advantage of nations. And for exports beyond the trade block, it will have a unified origin that will be used in identifying goods shipped and sold throughout the rest of the globe including the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the U.S. And it isn’t just about physical resources and goods. Electronic commerce and everything from standards and procedures to cross-border access through all of the fifteen nations will be freed up and made easier to develop, deploy and expand throughout the biggest block of the globe’s markets. And it also sets up standards for intellectual property rights to protect companies inside the pact. RCEP members believe that the agreement will result in significant economic development amounting to the building of multiples of their current GDP over the coming decades. And it works for the members and without any meddling by the U.S., EU and other non-Asian nations and political blocks. This last point is perhaps why the traditional and financial medias in the U.S. has paid little attention or ink (electrodes) to the deal. And when it has been mentioned, it has often come with major criticisms that to me are unfounded and miss the point that RCEP is all about China and its partners and not the U.S. The Best Stocks to Buy Now Now, over the recent past years inside my Profitable Investing, I have been focusing on the U.S. markets for stocks and bonds, given the U.S. economic outperformance as well as ongoing trade negotiations (disputes) that has put many other economies and markets at a disadvantage. But with pending changes in political leadership in the U.S. and with the RCEP deal, I see expanding opportunities for many companies — particularly with strong customer bases in China and its Asian RCEP partners. All About Assets I start this look at stocks to buy with two of my favorite asset management companies — AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). Both continue to be strong performers in the Chinese market, which aides the stronger stock performance in their shares in the U.S. Source: AllianceBernstein (AB) & BlackRock (BLK) Total Return – Source: Bloomberg First up is AllianceBernstein. It’s well-situated in Asia with major offices in China, Japan, South Korea and other RCEP nations. AB should continue to both gain intelligence for stock and fixed income investing in the region. And even more important – it should gather more assets under management (AUM). AUM is what fee income is generated from, and over the past two quarters, it has surged by 16.64%. I’ve seen a 45.65% return on AB since adding it to the portfolio of my Profitable Investing, and at a mere 2 times intrinsic value and a discount to sales along with a yield of 8.7%, it makes for a great RCEP buy under $34.95 in a taxable account. Second is BlackRock, one of the biggest asset managers in the world. The company is the go-to for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as well as active funds. And of course, it runs trillions of government money, and not just in the U.S. as it runs Chinese sovereign investment funds and does very well with the leadership in Beijing. AUM keeps climbing — especially over the past two quarters — but that’s just the ongoing trend. Over the past five years, it averages 11.54% gains annually (CAGR). BLK is a bit more pricey than AB at 3 times intrinsic value. And the yield is less at only 2.20%. But it keeps proving itself with a return since added of 111.78%. It remains a buy under a raised price of $795.00 in a tax-free account. RCEP Technology Next is technology stocks to buy. And China remains at the center of technology development, deployment and adoption of all of the latest in technology. Two companies that are embedded in China and the RCEP members include Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) and Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR). Both have been strong performers for investors both recently and are set up to deliver more with the major tailwinds of China and RCEP member growth. Source: Ericsson (ERIC) & Digital Realty Trust (DLR) Total Return – Source: Bloomberg Ericsson is the leader in fifth generation (5G) equipment, including patents. And with China and South Korea leading 5G deployment, ERIC should continue to gain equipment and maintenance sales. And this includes the patents that are used by Huawei (private) in China. And RCEP should further codify intellectual property rights for this company. ERIC has done well so far since being added to Profitable Investing — returning 37.30%. And its rising sales should be further amplified for RCEP markets. It should be bought under $13.50 in a taxable account. Joining ERIC is Digital Realty Trust — the leader in data centers throughout the U.S. and very much in RCEP nations. With facilities in China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other RCEP markets, data flows and storage are already humming along securely — generating lots of lease and fee income. And that income keeps climbing with gains over the trailing five years, averaging 16.27% on a CAGR basis. This in turn feeds a tax-advantaged dividend yielding 3.10%. And yet the stock is still a cheap real estate investment trust (REIT) that is only valued at 2.5 times its intrinsic value made of all of those hard-to-replicate data centers and licenses. It has returned 43.38% since being added to Profitable Investing and remains a buy under $142.25 in a taxable account. Feeding RCEP With China and RCEP nations having a third of the world’s population, that means that there are many billions of mouths to feed. I want to draw your attention to two behind-the-scenes companies that make the actual food show up in stores and kitchens throughout RCEP. They include FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) and Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS). Both of these impressive stocks to buy have been delivering triple-digit returns for investors over the past years. Source: FMC Corporation (FMC) & Zoetis (ZTS) Total Return – Source: Bloomberg FMC Corporation is the global leader in agricultural technology for crop protection and yield enhancement. It has a century-plus of history of pesticide and herbicide developments and patents on some of the first machines to deploy them. Unlike many of its lesser peers, FMC is well-regarded and received in Asia, especially in China. China is a tough market when it comes to agriculture, as it is very concerned over food safety. And with RCEP, it will further enable FMC to broaden its reach. Revenue keeps climbing, especially post its refocus solely on ag, running at 7.6% over the past year. And the stock has returned 58.63% since being added to the Profitable Investing portfolio. It is a buy under a raised price of $124.00 in a tax-free account. Joining FMC is Zoetis, which provides for the safety of livestock for food production throughout Asia. It has generated a return during its more brief holding period inside Profitable Investing of 60.02%. And it is a buy under a price of $169.50 in a tax-free account. RCEP Is All About Logistics Trade is not just about making stuff for export, but the actual shipment, storage and tracking all of that stuff. And the leader in logistics, including the world’s greatest collections of warehouses and trade facilities inside the RCEP partner markets, is Prologis (NYSE:PLD). Prologis continues to be as successful a stock as it is in the logistics markets. Source: Prologis (PLD) Total Return – Source: Bloomberg Prologis has facilities throughout China, Japan and Singapore. And China is where PLD really shines. It has facilities throughout the nation in and near all of the major manufacturing and shipping cities and provinces, from Guangzhou in the Southeast to Tianjin and the major industrial hub of Wuhan along the Yangtze river and out to the technology mecca of Chengdu. Revenue was surging even before RCEP, with the trailing year seeing gains of 18.8%. And I see a lot more in the pipeline for this logistics leader in the REIT market. Yielding 2.30% and valued on the cheap side again for a REIT at only 2.31 times its intrinsic value it is a core investment in RCEP under $104.90 in a taxable account. Local Leaders Asia continues to be one of the greatest sources for technology as noted earlier in this report. Sure, the U.S. has some brainiacs in and around Palo Alto — but without core specialties and development capabilities along with foundries and factories, little would show up in your pocket or desktop. There are two local Asian leaders that are based in South Korea and Japan – but have massive operating business facilities inside China. They include Samsung Electronics (SSNLF,005930 Korea) and TDK (OTCMKTS:TTDKY). Both of these companies are flat out the innovation leaders in multiple technologies that are critical for China and the RCEP region. And both have done well for U.S. investors. Source: Samsung Electronics (SSNLF,005930 Korea) & TDK (TTDKY) Total Return – Source: Bloomberg Samsung Electronics is a company that I keep recommending . While it is based in South Korea, it has foundries, factories and all sorts of other facilities around the RCEP member nations as well as around the globe. And in China, it is the very-well respected company with abundant facilities throughout the nation. The company and its products are ubiquitous. It has its branded products everywhere, from around the kitchen to smartphones to tablets and laptops and televisions. And even other branded products, including from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), can include Samsung components. Its facilities are dominant throughout not just Korea but China and nearly every other RCEP member nation. So, easier trade will be a massive boon to the company. And having a unified origin documentation will make it also much easier for global market sales beyond Asia. Then there’s the intellectual property protections of the deal — again major savings in legal battles are in the works. The stock is a pain for some to buy in the U.S. market. Some brokerages make you call in the order rather than clicking through on online sites. And then they level a fee for the call and potentially an added fee for trading on a foreign exchange. It is worth it. Since it was added to the Profitable Investing portfolio, it has returned 84.90%, including its dividend yielding 2.20% which is pretty high for a high-tech stock. But the compelling bit is how cheap the stock is valued. At barely more than its intrinsic value and trailing sales value — the stock is one of the biggest bargains of the major tech stocks on the globe. It is a buy in a taxable account under a further raised price of $85. TDK is a recently added stock to the portfolio. But it is already proving its worth with a return so far of 46.57%. This Tokyo-based company known for its classic tape-recording products has long transformed itself into a cutting edge and must have technology company. It leads the markets with batteries and battery technology that makes everything from smartphones to electric cars hum along. And its sensors and processors make those same phones and cars work, including autonomous cars. And it also has all of the must have inductors and capacitors to make electric motors actually turn and move. So, take any technology product and TDK is what is inside or powering it to work. RCEP will make TDK’s foundries and factories work and trade to flow all the more efficiently. And this will add to the operating efficiency adding to its already positive operating margin. And like for Samsung, TDK’s stock is very, very cheap at less than 2 times intrinsic value and barely more than 1 times what it sold over the trailing year. Bargain, made more so with RCEP and is a buy under a price of $146.00 in a taxable account. China Commerce Chief Those who think that the U.S. is the most advanced when it comes to technology need to plan a post-Covid-19 trip to China. In China, cash is long gone. Virtually everything is done electronically especially via smartphones. Shopping is all done via phone and online. Payment systems are seamless linking bank accounts, credit lines and everything else all centrally. Communications are all done through unified systems, including social media. And media is all done through subscription simply and unified for both videos and games. Everyone that you would get to know is on the network and easily accessible. WeChat got well known in the U.S. for being used by everyone who has personal or professional ties and connections in China. WeChat is the core hub for communications, payments, investments, insurance and so much else that its hard to fathom not having it inside China or in the region or even in the U.S. if you deal with anyone in China. It is owned by Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) which is one of the biggest technology companies in the world headquartered in Shenzhen. I have been eager to bring Chinese companies — and specifically Tencent — into the Profitable Investing portfolio for some time. But I hesitated, as I saw plenty of event risks for even the more financially and reporting responsible companies in China, plus the added risk of restrictions on share listing and trading in the U.S. With the changes now and pending in U.S. politics and the major changes in China and its trade and financial relations in Asia with RCEP, it is now time to buy Tencent. The company is genuinely ubiquitous in China and is used by all who interact with China, particularly in the RCEP member markets. The company organizes its operations and investments in several external companies including JD.com (online commerce) and many others into six core platforms. It starts with communications. WeChat forms a major base for Tencent. It is joined by QQ, which is an app that runs on all operating systems around the world and expands online services of Tencent including payments. Next up is its gaming platform. Mobile and online games are already huge around the globe — that’s why I added Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) to the model portfolio with its offerings. But Tencent has its own platform and games. It it the largest gaming company globally by revenue generated by its gaming offerings. Media is next with video, news and literature. And then there’s music, where Tencent rules streaming and owned music under Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME). Again, Tencent is the regional number one for this platform and also has global reach. As for its FinTech division, Tencent provides everything from wallets to banking and credit facilities including insurance and investments. Again, if sensing a theme here – it is the largest in China. Then there’s Tencent’s version of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) which provides the nation’s leading browser complete with all of the ad revenue that has made Google work so well beyond China. And it also is a leader in locking down its customer’s smartphones, tablets and PCs with its class-leading security. Cloud technology rounds out the platform. And with games, media, financial transactions and accounts and everything else that works in the cloud — Tencent rules this market that beyond China is similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). So, when looking at Tencent, you get the leader in communications, financial transactions and products, browser and data security, media and entertainment all in one company. And this company gets along very, very well with Beijing, which is important for Chinese companies and investors in Chinese companies. And it also comes with venture capital and investment funds that have current major holdings in many of the bold-faced technology and commerce companies in China and the region. It not only provides capital and takes equity stakes, it also nurtures and provides preferential access to its platforms for company developments. Tencent shareholders benefit from this both in current revenue generation and longer-term appreciation in these investments. And in ESG (environmental, social & governance), Tencent continues to address the environment, which is rapidly becoming a primary goal of the Chinese government. It is also focused on local communities and constituents. And Tencent works on its governance not just in China — but with global financial and government regulators and continues to (outside of the recent spat over WeChat in the U.S.) be well-received by authorities beyond China. WeChat About Profits Revenue for Tencent makes for a great conversation. Sales growth over just the trailing five years is averaging growth by 34.70% annually (CAGR). Source: Tencent Revenue – Source: Bloomberg And with such scale from its platforms, margins are very, very fat at 29.5% on an operating basis. This works to drive shareholder wealth with a return on shareholder’s equity of 24.9%. It would be great just to focus on the revenue and profits, but Tencent is focused on building value. Each of its platforms, including the core WeChat and related services, has major barriers to competitors. Even Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), as good as it is, still trails Tencent on many fronts. These continue to have bigger business values. And as noted, its investments also continue to build in value. Source: Tencent Intrinsic (Book) Value – Source: Bloomberg And this shows up in the intrinsic value of Tencent. This is the meltdown value of the assets net liabilities, also known as book value. And over just the trailing five years, Tencent has built up the intrinsic/book value for shareholders on an average annual basis of 38.59%. Think about this. If the company’s intrinsic value rises by this significant amount — along with the current revenue and profits — it makes for a compelling case to buy and own it. Source: Tencent (TCEHY) & S&P Information Technology Index Total Return – Source: Bloomberg And for investors in Tencent, the return has been proof of the capability of the company. It has returned 1,506%, which is near triple the return of the go-go technology market index of the U.S. over the trailing 10 years. You will be buying a stock that is highly valued at 8.27 times intrinsic value and 10.40 times trailing sales. But both of those values are a snapshot of trailing intrinsic and revenues – both should continue to prove to expand. And when compared to the price to book of the S&P Information Technology Index – it is at a discount. And on a price to trailing sales it is comparable. The dividend, yes it has a dividend that is paid – but isn’t much as the company retains and reinvests it with a good track record. It is a buy as it is now as I have it in the Profitable Investing portfolio in a taxable account under $85.
