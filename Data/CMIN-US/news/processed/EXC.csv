FirstEnergy’s forward PE ratio, based on analysts’ 2019 EPS estimate, is 14x. The company’s five-year historical average is ~17x. First Energy’s peers’ average is also close to similar levels. FirstEnergy is among the top-gaining utility (XLU) stocks in 2018. The company’s business mix improved last year. FirstEnergy became an entirely regulated utility. The company’s earnings and dividend profile are expected to stabilize in the coming quarters.

## Are utilities a good bargain?

American Electric Power (AEP) stock is trading at a forward PE ratio of 17.7x based on its EPS estimates in 2019.

Xcel Energy (XEL), one of the top regulated utilities, is trading at a forward PE ratio of 18.5x—marginally lower than its five-year historical average.

Exelon (EXC) stock has a forward PE ratio of 14x, which is lower than many of its peers’ ratios and its five-year average of ~17x. Exelon reported solid earnings growth in 2018.

2019-04-23,"Earth Day came and went, but hopefully not without leaving a positive impression on individuals and their day-to-day actions. But if you want to make a constructive impact on your investment portfolio, two buys and one short in the following energy stocks should be on your trading radar right now.Ironically, and many will say perversely enough, the price of oil -- that non-renewable and dirty fossil fuels -- spiked to fresh five-month highs to kick off the trading week on Earth Day, a celebration of sustainability for our planet.Who says the market doesn't have a sense of humor?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Still, while black gold is enjoying sunnier conditions, the trend toward using cleaner alternatives within the energy industry shouldn't be overlooked. This includes being informed of the price charts of energy stocks Chevron (NYSE:CVX), First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and Exelon (NYSE:EXC). Here's how to capitalize on this necessary industry revolution with two longs and one short. Chevron (CVX)  Click to EnlargeCVX, the first on this list of energy stocks, is the largest, dirtiest and most unsustainable outfit of the three industry players. And it's also my short play within the group.As the monthly chart of CVX stock reveals, Wall Street remains enthusiastic about Chevron. Shares have been trending higher since 2003 and are only a handful of percentage points have been removed from last month's narrow miss of taking out January 2018's all-time-high.But just as trends like how we go about sourcing our electricity change, so do price charts for energy stocks like Chevron. And I think today's long-standing uptrend is bound to unravel … and it could start with something as simple as CVX stock's developing double top pattern.With earnings on tap later this week on Friday, my recommendation is to short CVX beneath this month's low of $119. This entry would put shares back below the March candlestick as key lateral support becomes resistance and April puts the finishing touches on an engulfing bearish formation. First Solar (FSLR)  Click to EnlargeFirst Solar is the country's largest player in the solar energy industry. And if the price chart has any say in those matters, FSLR stock is about to become larger.Since cratering to an all-time-low in 2012, shares of First Solar have, while volatile, been moving higher over time. The price action in this energy stock has taken on a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.A neckline breakout and pattern confirmation of a much larger move still have some distance to go before FSLR stock is in position for that sort of technical challenge. But I'm bullish on this energy stock today.Shares of First Solar have been consolidating laterally for the several sessions while using the 50% retracement level for technical support. My recommendation is to buy FSLR stock above the pattern high of $61.23 in anticipation of a quick move toward the larger formation's neckline.  * 7 Small-Cap Growth ETFs For Adventurous Investors With a potential earnings catalyst around the corner and FSLR stock known for its volatile reactions, I'd also suggest buying any pre-earnings breakouts in conjunction with a collar strategy to guard against uncontrolled and potentially much larger-than-expected portfolio risk. Exelon (EXC)  Click to EnlargeYou may not have heard of Exelon, but ignorance is not bliss. EXC stock is a controversial alternative within the trend of more sustainable and cleaner energy alternatives. Despite not being a household name, Exelon is the country's largest operator of nuclear plants in the U.S with a portfolio of 23 reactors under its care.Nuclear energy, of course, doesn't emit greenhouse gases. That's really good news. But in its most widely used form to generate electricity there are real issues like safely housing radioactive waste, dealing with possible harmful meltdowns, weapons proliferation and high operating costs. Still, don't let that stop you from buying EXC stock today.While we wait on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates' TerraPower or other startups such as Terrestrial Energy and Oklo to solve nuclear energy's shortcomings, for now, EXC stock is the $46 billion elephant in the room. And it's not one to shut the doors on. And Wall Street appears to agree.The monthly chart of EXC stock shows that following a steep and prolonged bear market from 2009 through 2013, shares have been moving higher and increasingly, within a steadier uptrend as investors open their eyes and wallets toward this energy stock.Now, with shares of Exelon safely above the 62% retracement level, it looks like &quot;all systems go&quot; for this nuclear play. My recommendation would be to buy EXC's current pullback, which barely shows up on the monthly view. As a safety measure, and to avoid any potential meltdowns, using an initial stop-loss of 7% also makes good sense.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Exelon Generation previously announced that the station would  prematurely shut down, absent policy reform, due to economic challenges  and market flaws that fail to recognize the environmental and resiliency  benefits from TMI and other zero-carbon nuclear energy plants across the  Commonwealth.","Three Mile Island Unit 1 to Shut Down by September 30, 2019"

2019-05-08,"Shares of utility companies were broadly lower Wednesday, with the sector the only one of the S&P 500&apos;s  11 sectors to lose ground, weighed down by a big bounce in Treasury yields. The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF  shed 1.0% in afternoon trade, with 27 of 28 equity components losing ground. The biggest decliner was NRG Energy Inc.&apos;s stock  which slumped 5.1%. Among other more active utilities ETF components, shares of AES Corp.  lost 2.3%, Excelon Corp.  gave up 0.9% and Southern Co.  shed 0.6%. The lone gainer was Sempra Energy&apos;s stock  which tacked on 0.6%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3.6 basis points to 2.484%, after falling 10.4 basis points the previous three sessions, as a bounce in the stock market helped calm risk-off trades. Utilities stocks tend to have relatively high dividend yields, so a rise in yields on low-risk Treasurys make them less attractive.

2019-05-24,"Utility stocks include companies that provide essential services -- electricity, energy and water -- to communities across the U.S. Because doing this in a country as big as the U.S. is no mean feat, most states have one or two exclusive providers. For this monopoly power, the utilities are regulated not only by the state government but also by the federal government.Their rates are set and their growth plans have to be approved by state regulators since utilities' expansion plans are generally funded by their customer bases.In return for reining in their operations, the state provides a healthy annual growth target for the utilities and also allows them to operate unregulated businesses that can sell power to customers in the open market. This gives utilities good avenues for profits above and beyond their regular business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat investors get are rock-solid companies that have no trade war drama attached to them, only growing demand for electricity and reliable dividends to add to their capital gains.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy The seven utility stocks to trust for retirement below are all A-rated in my Portfolio Grader for momentum. That means the smart money is starting to roll in and will continue to as global growth and tech stocks lose their shine. PNM Resources Inc (PNM)PNM Resources Inc (NYSE:PNM) is an electric utility that operates in Texas and New Mexico.While this doesn't seem to be a top place to get into the power business, just remember two words: Permian Basin.The Permian is one of the hottest oil and gas regions in the U.S. today. There is a huge amount of activity going on there now and housing is going up to hold all the workers and supply them with what they need, and want.Tales of waitresses earning $15 an hour and oil workers in the six digits is already happening and the boom is just starting.That spells huge growth for PNM, since it's selling all this new power to the industry and all the businesses that are coming to the region.This explains why PNM is up more that 20% in the past 12 months, which is a pretty nice run for a utility. Its 2.4% dividend may not be spectacular, but right now, this is about the safest energy play around for long-term investors. Evergy Inc (EVRG)Evergy Inc (NYSE:EVRG) is a classic example of a solid energy company that posts reliable returns and delivers a solid dividend. It's the poster child for compounding.Having started its life as Kansas City Power & Light and serving the Kansas market for many years, in 2018 it merged with Westar Energy. Now it has 1.6 million customers in both Kansas and Missouri.This merger will help EVRG grow its base and exercise greater efficiencies that will help it squeeze more profit from its production.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains The stock is up 6% in the past year and delivers a solid 3.1% dividend, which adds up to a steady near-10% growth return annually. That's a lot better than a money market or a CD without taking on a great deal of risk. Middlesex Water (MSEX)Middlesex Water Co (NASDAQ:MSEX) is a water utility. There aren't a lot of these, but they had a run in the 1990s when the economy was weak and municipalities were finding it hard to run and maintain their water systems.After some consolidation over the years, MSEX remains a long dependable player in the sector. Basically, instead of a city or county managing water resources -- wastewater, filtration, distribution, maintenance, etc. -- they contract out the work to MSEX.It currently operates in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania and has been doing so since 1897.This is an enduring business, because, like electricity, potable water and wastewater management are crucial to operating a city or town. But it's generally overlooked by Wall Street.That's good news for us. Although a few investors have seen the opportunity here since the stock is up 40% in the past year. Its dividend comes in just shy of 1.6%.With the U.S. in a steady growth mode, that's good news for local governments and that's good news for MSEX. Exelon Corp (EXC)Exelon Corp (NYSE:EXC) is a $36 billion utilities network that operates throughout the United States supporting existing utilities as well as operating power generation, marketing and delivery businesses.Instead of having a traditional home market, EXC moves into markets where the current utility isn't able to manage its base or can't find a way to make it.For example, in Washington, D.C., Potomac Gas & Electric was having a hard time balancing its growing demand with its ability to deliver electricity efficiently. EXC took over the utility and because of its scale, could modernize and upgrade the aging utility.The company's flexibility to run or help support utilities is a unique part of EXC's strategy. And it has been working.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them The stock is up almost 23% in the past year and it delivers a reliable 2.9% dividend. And there are still plenty of opportunities out there. Sempra Energy (SRE)Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is another hybrid energy company. It has utility operations in the U.S. -- San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company -- but it also has a variety of other operations that fall more on the unregulated energy side.For example, it has natural gas pipelines in the South and Southeast. It has a division that focuses on generating renewable energy in the Midwest that it distributes around the country. It also has significant operations in Latin America, supplying infrastructure equipment and gas utilities operations.It also just signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia to provide 5 million tons of liquified natural gas (LNG) to the kingdom for the next 20 years out of the Port Arthur, Texas LNG export terminal when it's completed.Its exposure to the natural gas market, especially the export sector makes this a great choice for anyone interested in stepping into the energy patch without all the volatility that would go along with a dedicated natural gas exploration and production company.Up 28% in the past 12 months and still delivering a 2.8% dividend, this is a great long-term play on growing energy demand. Duke Energy Corp (DUK)Duke Energy Corp (NYSE:DUK) has been delivering power to the people of the Carolinas and beyond since 1900. Today, it remains a classic example of the traditional energy utility that has grown up with the region and has great relations with its state regulators.Today, DUK has operations in the Carolinas -- it started and is based in North Carolina -- as well as Florida, Indiana and Ohio. It has also developed a strong group of unregulated energy businesses that help add a little juice to earnings.While there are some legacy challenges that come along with a utility that has been around so long, they're not as challenging for DUK because it has such a long history with regulators. Plus, its former longtime CEO Jim Rogers was very far-sighted when it came to investing in renewable energy and a decentralized grid.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy And remember, the Research Triangle in North Carolina is the Silicon Valley of the East, so there's plenty of growth in its backyard. Up 17% in the past year and delivering a 4.1% dividend, this is a blue chip utility. Southwest Gas Holdings (SWX)Southwest Gas Holdings Inc (NYSE:SWX) represents a pure play on the natural gas sector.Coal was the traditional fuel for most utilities' power plants but as natural gas supply has grown in the U.S. and environmental laws became stricter, cleaner burning and cheap natural gas became increasingly popular.Now, natural gas is the go-to fuel for most utilities and large companies. SWX focuses its operations in Nevada, Arizona and California. It also has distribution channels to supply other customers around the U.S., but the lion's share of its business comes from these states.The natural gas focus is a good way to diversify these long-term picks, since each region and each piece of the grid brings on its own challenges and opportunities. The natural gas market should continue to grow for many years to come and as tensions in Asia and the Middle East grow, an accessible supply of domestic natural gas becomes a prized asset.SWX is up almost 19% in the past year and delivers a dependable 2.5% dividend. That is a great return for a &quot;boring&quot; utility stock.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-06-20,"The utilities sector eased slightly Thursday, to buck a broader stock market rally, as a sharp drop in longer-term Treasury yields was balanced with a rally in AES Corp.'s stock  after an analyst upgrade. The Dow Jones Utility Average  inched less than 0.1% lower, although 8 of 15 components traded up, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  jumped 222 points, or 0.8%.

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended the White House take steps to protect the domestic production of uranium after finding the nation’s reliance on imports was a national security risk, said three people briefed on the matter.Among the trade remedies recommended is to require nuclear power plants to purchase a minimum of 5% of the radioactive fuel from U.S. mines, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss non-public deliberations. Two of the people said an option under consideration would see the quota escalate by 5 percentage points a year.A decision to impose the quotas would be a boon to the two small mining companies that petitioned the Commerce Department to take action, Energy Fuels Inc. and Ur-Energy Inc. The move would increase costs for nuclear reactor operators that are already struggling in the face of competition from cheaper sources of power generated by natural gas and renewables. Domestic nuclear providers rose on the news, with Uranium Energy Corp. up as much as 3.9%, Energy Fuels rising as much as 3.5% and Ur-Energy paring earlier losses to rise less than 1%.The Commerce Department concluded in April that the imports harmed national security, delivering a confidential report on the matter to the White House at the time, the people said.The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Commerce Department declined to comment on the contents of the uranium report and said it is at the White House. Confidential MeetingThe recommendations have yet to be presented to President Donald Trump, and a meeting on the matter between him and advisers on the issue that had been scheduled for Thursday was delayed, two people said.The matter is far from final, but one person said it is certain that the White House appears poised to take action. Other options being considered include doing nothing or putting limits on uranium from specific countries, one of the people said.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met with Trump on Thursday, was expected to make the case against import quotas on uranium, which his country produces.The Trump administration was asked by the two domestic uranium producers to impose a 25% domestic market quota on the grounds imports of uranium are a threat to national security. Wide Latitude A finding that the imports of uranium are harming U.S. national security gives Trump wide latitude to impose a trade remedy of his choosing -- or do nothing at all -- using the same trade law the administration has successfully used to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.While the domestic uranium producers, both of which are based in Colorado, initially asked the administration for a 25% quota, a lower amount could be a compromise that he utilities and the producers could live with, analysts have said.Nuclear utilities, which have estimated a 25% quota could cost them as much as $800 million annually, remain hopeful Trump will decide against any trade action.“President Trump is a longstanding champion for the U.S. nuclear industry, rightly recognizing the enormous economic and energy benefits that U.S. nuclear power delivers to American consumers,” said the Ad Hoc Utilities Group, which counts Exelon Corp., Duke Energy Corp., and Dominion Energy Inc. as members. “The U.S. nuclear industry supports 100,000 jobs while the two petitioners support a total of 150 jobs.” Australia, RussiaCurrently, the nuclear power industry gets nearly all of its uranium from sources such as Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, and Russia.The U.S. uranium industry produced roughly 700,000 pounds in 2018, according to Chris Gadomski, a nuclear industry analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. A 5% quota would translate to between 2 million and 2.5 million pounds, he said.The two miners who petitioned for the case have already begun expanding their mines in anticipation of a favorable decision.Executives from both companies said in a statement they were pleased “the administration continues to recognize the unique national, energy and economic security role of domestic uranium production.”“We continue to believe that reserving 25% of domestic demand for U.S. uranium is the most effective tool for sustaining domestic production of this critical mineral,” they said.

2019-07-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Two U.S. Navy warships will soon be protected from dangerous mines with the same technology that will be used to keep Chicago’s power grid humming along.American Superconductor Corp., known largely for its wind-turbine systems, also sells wires able to carry much more electricity than standard copper wires now generally in use. The company has deals in place to deploy the technology in both the ships and the grid, starting in 2021, Chief Executive Officer Daniel McGahn said in an interview in New York.The superconducting wires will be used in a resiliency project by utility Exelon Corp. to jump added capacity among substations should one go down. The Navy will use the wires to help change the magnetic profiles of their two ships, potentially cloaking them from metal-seeking mines.The company is hoping the ship-protection technology will lead to future deals to install additional systems to manage ships’ electrical systems, a strategy McGahn said would make the vessels comparable to utilities’ power grids.“The ship is a microcosm of the grid,” McGahn said at Bloomberg News headquarters. “It’s a great test-bed for our technology.”The anti-mine technology, a technique called degaussing, dates back to World War II. The company’s version is as much as 90% lighter than the systems currently in use, and needs about about half the electricity to work. The systems cost about $10 million a ship and are being installed in San Antonio-class vessels designed for transporting troops and equipment into war zones.Modern mines have a variety of ways to detect ships, and changing the magnetic field won’t counter all of them, said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic & Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based research institute.However, the new technology is going into vessels that cost more than $2 billion each, and its relatively cheap price tag makes it a “good investment” for the Navy, he said.McGahn has been expanding AMSC’s offerings for utility grids and and ships, and eventually expects them to each generate about one-third of sales. “We think 2021 is going to be a very big year for us,” McGahn said.To contact the reporters on this story: Will Wade in New York at wwade4@bloomberg.net;Christopher Martin in New York at cmartin11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, David MarinoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",The Same Technology Used in Power Grids Will Cloak Navy Ships

2019-07-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Three Mile Island’s Unit 2 has been closed since 1979, when it was the site of the worst ever U.S. reactor accident. Now a Salt Lake City-based nuclear services company is in talks to buy and dismantle the facility.Energy Solutions Inc. has signed a term sheet with FirstEnergy Corp. to acquire the Pennsylvania site, according to a statement Tuesday. Terms weren’t disclosed and the deal doesn’t include Unit 1, the Exelon Corp.-owned reactor that’s scheduled to be closed in September.Three Mile Island’s Unit 2 is arguably the nation’s most infamous nuclear plant. In March 1979, a pump failure triggered an emergency shutdown that resulted in a partial meltdown and a radiation leak. It remains the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history.Seven U.S. nuclear plants have gone dark since 2013 and at least six more are expected to be closed in the next few years as the facilities struggle to compete against cheap electricity from natural gas and renewables. That’s spurred the emergence of decommissioning specialists that buy the plants and tear them down.Energy Solutions is already handling other decommissioning projects, but this would be the first time it assumes full ownership of a reactor. It’s forming a joint venture with the New Jersey-based construction company Joseph Jingoli & Son Inc. to handle the Three Mile Island project.The job won’t include handling the plant’s spent nuclear fuel rods, which were removed in the 1980s.Other nuclear services companies have pursued similar deals, including Northstar Group Services Inc., which is currently at work on the Vermont Yankee plant it bought in January from Entergy Corp., and Holtec International, which has acquired or agreed to buy four plants from Entergy and Exelon Corp.To contact the reporter on this story: Will Wade in New York at wwade4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, Joe CarrollFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Infamous Three Mile Island Reactor Set to Be Sold, Dismantled"

2019-08-15,"(Bloomberg) -- It started with a pump failure early on the morning of March 28, 1979.Steam generators were unable to draw heat out of a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pennsylvania. While an emergency shutdown was triggered, another problem—a stuck valve—was letting coolant escape from the reactor core.The core’s fuel began to overheat, causing the partial meltdown and release of radiation that remain the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The reactor, one of two at the plant, has been silent ever since. To this day, it stands as an enduring symbol of all that can potentially go wrong with American nuclear energy.But just across the complex, which sits 100 miles west of Philadelphia along the Susquehanna River, the other unit is one of the region’s biggest power sources, churning out electricity for 45 years without incident. Next month, that too will come to an end. Plant owner Exelon Corp. is scheduled to shutter the entire facility, 15 years before its license is set to expire.One reactor was brought down by mechanical failures and human error; the other by the economics of the modern utility industry.The shale revolution has made America the world’s biggest producer of natural gas. The abundance of the fossil fuel has dragged down its price, making it the largest source of the nation’s electricity. At the same time, wind and solar have been booming as the costs of components and installation fall.It’s a state of affairs that makes it tough for nuclear reactors to compete. Seven U.S. power plants have shut down since 2013, and owners have announced plans to close several more. States that include New York, New Jersey and Illinois have offered subsidies for nuclear power, but legislation to do the same in Pennsylvania foundered in the face of strong opposition from residents—and from supporters of renewables and gas. Hollywood isn’t helping, either. The demise of America’s most notorious commercial facility comes amid renewed public interest in the downsides of nuclear energy, largely due to the hit HBO miniseries “Chernobyl.” The five-episode drama that first aired in May laid out the events surrounding the April 1986 explosion at a power plant in Ukraine—then part of the USSR. It was the worst nuclear accident the planet has ever seen.While the program was criticized for getting some details wrong, it received praise for showing the terrible effects of radiation poisoning, and for explaining the enormous geographic impact of a full-scale nuclear disaster.Compared with the release of radiation at Chernobyl, which the United Nations estimated in 2005 may eventually kill 4,000 people, the accident at Three Mile Island was minor. Only a small amount of radioactive material was released, and it was later determined that the 2 million people in the surrounding area were exposed to less radiation than they would have received from a chest X-ray.However, the immediate reaction to the event was characterized by fear and confusion. Schools were closed, people were told to stay indoors and state officials urged children and pregnant women to voluntarily evacuate. In the aftermath, public support for nuclear energy fell dramatically, and government oversight of the industry increased significantly. Today, nuclear energy in the U.S. is at the center of a complicated debate. While cheap gas has upended the economics of operating reactors, whether to shut one down involves more than the bottom line.U.S. President Donald Trump has taken steps to support unprofitable nuclear and coal power plants, citing national security issues because they generate electricity around the clock. Some of his efforts have been rejected by federal energy regulators.Meanwhile, environmental groups have mixed feeling about reactors. Some are concerned about the accumulating nuclear waste that will remain deadly for thousands of years, as well as the potential for mishaps. Still, others are alarmed by the intensifying threat of climate change tied to the burning of fossil fuels—even cheap kinds such as natural gas.In the fight to slow global warming, there’s a growing recognition that the biggest sources of carbon-free power have an important role to play in helping smooth any eventual transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.States, including California and New York, have passed laws requiring 100% emission-free electricity. Many experts agree that, based on the technology available today, such lofty goals will be all but impossible without nuclear energy. They argue that shuttering reactors for purely financial reasons ignores their ability to produce clean energy. New plants are hugely expensive to build; once shut, old plants cannot be brought back on line.Either way, Three Mile Island won’t be part of the future of American energy. Exelon will be switching off Unit 1 in a few weeks, and a decommissioning company is in talks to begin dismantling Unit 2. But even though the plant will no longer be producing electricity, it’s certain to remain part of the conversation about nuclear energy for many years to come.  To contact the author of this story: Will Wade in New York at wwade4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.net, Eugene ReznikFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Where America Flirted With Its Own Chernobyl

2019-10-16,"(Bloomberg) -- The head of Exelon Corp.’s utility unit has abruptly retired amid a federal probe involving its lobbying in Illinois.Anne Pramaggiore, senior executive vice president and chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, is leaving “effective immediately,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. Calvin Butler Jr., chief of Exelon’s Baltimore Gas and Electric utility, was named as her interim replacement.Pramaggiore’s departure comes less than a week after Exelon disclosed in a regulatory filing that it received a subpoena from federal prosecutors asking for information related to communications with Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval. In July, Exelon disclosed it received a subpoena related to its lobbying activities in Illinois.Exelon fell as much as 2.3% Wednesday.Pramaggiore’s sudden exit following the subpoenas “cannot be interpreted in any other way as being directly related to each other,” Greg Gordon, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a research note. It increases the risk that the company could be under scrutiny for criminal behavior, he said.“The situation looks unpalatable in the short term but a lot of risk looks priced in,” Gordon said.The Chicago Tribune reported earlier this month that federal agents had raided Sandoval’s office and were searching for information related to concrete and construction businesses and lobbyists and public officials. Officials were also looking for “items related to any official action taken in exchange for a benefit,” the Tribune reported, citing documents released by the Illinois Senate.Exelon’s statement on Pramaggiore’s retirement Tuesday didn’t reference the subpoenas.

2019-11-27,"Ken Griffin built his impressive reputation as an investor early in life, founding Citadel Advisors when he was just 22, with $4.6 million in seed money. By 2003, when became the youngest self-made millionaire on the Forbes 400 list, his hedge fund controlled well over $1 billion in investment capital. Today, Griffin’s Chicago-based fund holds $212 billion in equity assets under management.In the third-quarter, Citadel made 9-digit purchases in three particularly interesting stocks. All three are rated Strong Buys in the TipRanks database, and all three show unique combinations of strengths and weaknesses. We’ve pulled up the data on each, to find out what drew them to Griffin’s attention.Baker Hughes Company (BKR)America’s oil and gas industry has generated a slew of headlines and rightly so, for the increased oil and gas drilling – across the continent – pushed the US into the top spot among global oil producers six years ago. Drilling, however, is only one of many oil-related industries that has benefited. A whole service sector has evolved to support oil and gas operations, and Baker Hughes in a major player in it.BKR provides the products and services that drilling companies need to complete their operations, from evaluating geological formations to completing the wells. The company deals in tools, machinery, and IoT technology for one of the country’s most important economic sectors. The scale of Baker Hughes’ operations is clear from the company’s sales numbers – in fiscal 2018, BKR brought in over $22.8 billion in revenues.Between July 2017 and September 2019, BKR was affiliated with General Electric in a merger. Earlier this year, however, GE had divested itself of the controlling interest in BKR, and Baker Hughes was an independent company again before the end of September.And now we get to the interesting point: In Q3, ending on September 30, Citadel bought just over 13 million shares of BKR stock. It’s not a controlling interest, but the holding is worth $293.9 million at today’s share prices.Wall Street’s analysts have also been showing the stock some love. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Snyder initiated coverage on BKR, writing, “Given our expectation of soft, range-bound commodity prices through at least 1H'20, we are drawn to BKR’s business lines which feature long-cycle businesses (LNG), more stable and diversified end-markets, strong international exposure and a service portfolio focused on technology and levered to production services… We forecast BKR will grow EPS at a 40% CAGR over the next two years, an impressive feat given the challenging backdrop.”Snyder set a &quot;buy&quot; rating on BKR stock along with a $32 price target, suggesting room for 44% upside from the current share price. (To watch Snyder's track record, click here)Also bullish is Cowen analyst Marc Bianchi, who took care to point out the recent C3.ai partnership. He wrote, “[We are] impressed with the C3 business and think BKR could be the first OFS company to take a meaningful bite out of the ~$39B TAM for Oil and Gas IoT… We continue to rate the stock among our top picks in OFS.” Bianchi gives BKR a $30 price target, implying an upside of 35%. (To watch Bianchi's track record, click here)BKR get a unanimous vote from Wall Street’s financial experts, with 9 Buy reviews on record. Shares are selling for $22.61, and the average price target of $29.38 indicates a 32% upside potential. It also doesn't hurt that the company provide a healthy 3.18% dividend yield -- more than 50% higher than the S&P average. (See Baker Hughes stock analysis on TipRanks)Exelon Corporation (EXC)Exelon is a major producer in the US electricity and natural gas sectors, with six utilities delivering power to 10 million customers across 5 states and the District of Columbia. The company puts more than 32,000 megawatts on the grid, and its combination of nuclear, gas, wind, and solar generation capability makes it one of the cleanest power providers in the US.All of that sounds like a commercial, but well-planned marketing attracts both customer and investors, and Exelon leverages its marketing to good effect. Unfortunately, the company also practices an older form of political lobbying, and has been implicated in the state of Illinois in connection with “communications” directed at a State Senator from Chicago. A second probe, at the Federal level, has been opened by the SEC, and may expand the investigation of the company’s lobbying to other states. Exelon CEO Chris Cane declined to answer questions on the matter, saying only that the company is cooperating with investigators.To the company’s credit, earnings are steady and positive, showing again the value of providing an essential commodity. In the Q3 report, EXC showed 92 cents EPS, beating the forecast by 4.5% and exceeding the 80 to 90 cent guidance range. The positive earnings came despite a drop in revenues, which at $8.9 billion were down the $9.04 year-ago figure.During the third-quarter, Griffin’s Citadel saw fit to boost its holding in the stock by 61%. The fund bought 1,599,064 shares of EXC, worth $70 million at current prices. The purchase brings Citadel’s stake in the company to 4,259,392 shares, valued over $187 million. This is $18 million lower than the disclosed purchase price, but Citadel stands in a good position to recoup that loss. Exelon pays a 3.3% dividend, and the stock is expected to show strong gains in the next 12 months.Despite describing the stock as “remaining in the penalty box” due to the investigations, 4-star Well Fargo analyst Neil Kalton remains bullish on the stock, reiterating a &quot;buy&quot; rating and $54 price target. He writes, “Our Outperform rating reflects our belief that shares do not adequately reflect the value of the nuclear fleet given potential policy support.” His price target implies a 22% upside. (To watch Kalton's track record, click here)Steve Fleishman, from Wolfe Research, gives some additional detail in his note on EXC: “The utility offers attractive 6-8% EPS growth that can be funded internally with help from strong cash flows at the merchant business.  EXC’s integrated generation-retail model has provided stability and strong cash flows for debt reduction and utility growth funding… we see value from either expanded credits or portfolio rationalization.  EXC is growing the dividend 5%/yr.” Fleishman’s $55 target suggests potential growth of 25%. (To watch Fleishman's track record, click here)These opinions form the bullish end of the continuum on EXC, but the stock does hold a Strong Buy consensus rating. While the analysts are not unanimous, they give Exelon 7 Buys against just 2 Holds. The average price target of $51.56 indicates that there is room for 17% upside to the current trading price of $44.01. (See Exelon stock analysis on TipRanks)Willis Towers Watson (WLTW)The third stock we’re looking at here is a big name in the insurance industry. Willis Towers Watson is the world’s third largest insurance broker, and offers services in multinational risk management. The company was previously known as Willis Group; in 2016, it conducted a merger of equals with Virginia-based Towers Watson to form the current corporate iteration. After the merger was compete, Willis Group shareholders owned 50.1% of the combined entity.Insurance is a lucrative industry and WLTW’s earnings reflect that. The company beat the forecasts for both revenues and EPS in Q3. Quarterly revenue came in at $1.99 billion, $130 million higher than the year-ago quarter, and earnings were reported at $1.31, just above the $1.30 estimate. While the beats were only modestly higher than the estimates, they were solid. In addition to the steady earnings, the company also paid out its 65-cent quarterly dividend. While not spectacular, the dividend has been increased steadily over the past 3 years, and is easily sustainable at current EPS levels.So, Willis Towers Watson has gigantism on its side, giving it an inertia that makes current growth rates likely to continue. This is the background to Citadel’s 1,437,846 share purchase of WLTW in the third quarter. The purchase brought the firm’s total holding to more than 1.439 million shares, worth more than $280 million. This is almost $3 million more than Citadel’s declared purchase price, so this move by Griffin is already profitable.Jay Gelb, 5-star analyst from Barclays, sees WLTW as a good buy. He puts a $235 price target on the stock, writing as his justification, “We view WLTW as a strategically favorable combination that shifts Willis from being a pure-play global insurance broker to adding core capabilities in consulting, employee benefits and private health insurance exchange.” His target suggests a 20% upside to the stock.Assessing WLTW for Jefferies is 4-star analyst David Styblo, who writes as his bottom line, “WLTW is delivering on its commitment to produce more consistent results. The +6% marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 5-6%. Operating margins also expanded 120bps and are up 150bps YTD, recognizing ASC 606 has driven about half the expansion. The solid performance is broad-based, again another marker of consistency. Management continues to expect at least 15% FCF over the next 3 years…” Styblo gives Willis a $234 price target, in line with Gelb’s stock price forecast.Like Baker Hughes above, WLTW has a unanimous consensus rating – 6 analysts have given this stock an up-check in recent weeks. Shares are not cheap, at $195.43, but the $223 average price target suggests a 14% upside for investors.

2019-12-31,"Even with declines on Monday, U.S. stocks are closing out a remarkably strong 2020. The S&P 500 has gained 28.5% so far this year, and the NASDAQ Composite has performed even better. On the whole, American equities, barring a disaster on Tuesday, should post their second-best year since 1997.Source: Shutterstock As noted in the space before, the rally has been both broad and deep. Nearly 80% of stocks with a market capitalization over $300 million are positive in 2019. Almost 20% of those stocks have risen at least 50%. But that still leaves a few names that have been left out of the rally.  * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places Tuesday's big stock charts focus on that group. Two of these stocks have declined so far this year, amid broad pressure on their respective industries. Another has gained less than 1%. But all three of late have shown support, which suggests at least some optimism heading into the New Year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips DuPont de Nemours (DD)Source: Provided by Finviz DuPont de Nemours (NYSE:DD) has been one of the most disappointing stocks of the past few years. In a complicated feat of financial engineering, chemical giants Dow and DuPont first merged into DowDuPont. DowDuPont then spun off the 'new' Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) and agricultural play Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) before renaming itself DuPont de Nemours.If that wasn't enough, DuPont this month announced it would combine its nutrition unit with International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF). Yet, as the first of Monday's big stock charts shows, none of that movement has created any shareholder value.DowDuPont was a popular pick for sum of the parts upside, but DD stock is down 18% this year (adjusted for the spins). DOW stock has gained 9% since becoming independent, while CTVA is basically flat. The question heading into 2020 is whether the stock finally can stabilize:  * Technically, a double bottom around $62 does provide some hope. A Relative Strength Index of 39 isn't quite in oversold territory, but it's not far off. Monday's 2%-plus decline doesn't help the cause, but it's possible that some investors were looking to book tax losses to offset gains elsewhere. Hedge funds may also want the disappointing stock off their books at year-end. There may be buyers willing to step in.  * Fundamentally, there is an attractive case here. Earlier this month, I highlighted both DD stock and IFF stock as 2019 losers that could be 2020 winners. The nutrition merger will give DuPont a cash payment of over $7 billion that can be used to pay off debt and buy back stock. And after the sell-off, DuPont stock trades at a reasonable 14.6x forward price-to-earnings multiple.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz But this may be a stock that still has further to fall. The weekly chart still shows a persistent downtrend. End markets remain volatile, and earnings multiples across the chemicals sector usually are below those of the market as a whole. It's possible investors are waiting for the calendar to turn to step into the decline here. But it's also possible that DuPont stock will continue to disappoint in early 2020 as well. Excelon Corporation (EXC)Utility Exelon Corporation (NYSE:EXC) has had a disappointing 2019 as well. Utilities as a sector, as measured by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), have gained 21%. EXC stock has risen just 0.62%. There are some reasons for the underperformance -- but as the second of our big stock charts shows, investors of late have bet on an improved 2020:  * A multiple bottom has been established at $44 and Excelon stock has shown some strength in the last two weeks. Shares have cleared near-term moving averages as well. Utility stocks are usually much less volatile, so a huge breakout is unlikely. But, technically, EXC has a path to the 200-day moving average above $47, and then could challenge the top of a descending triangle pattern.  * There are two core worries here. Exelon is facing a federal investigation of its lobbying efforts in Illinois, a probe that may be linked to the sudden resignation of the company's chief executive officer in October. In addition, Exelon's nuclear business is waning: the company shut down its Three Mile Island reactor earlier this year. Both factors have pressured Exelon stock in recent months, and explain in part why shares have lagged the sector.  * That said, there's some value here. On an earnings basis, EXC is one of the cheaper large-cap utility stocks in the market. A 3.2% dividend yield should be safe, and remains attractive in an environment where the 10-year Treasury bond yields less than 2%. Federal investigations are hardly welcome, but this is a company with a $44 billion market capitalization. Penalties relating to any untoward actions are likely to be relatively minimal in that context. There's a case that the sell-off has gone too far. Some investors are acting on that case as 2020 approaches. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)Source: Provided by Finviz Shale exploration plays like Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) have had a difficult 2019. Low oil and natural gas prices have hurt profits. The acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum by Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) was supposed to unleash a wave of merger activity in the sector. But OXY stock wound up hitting a 14-year low in November, potentially scaring off other buyers.Despite the sector weakness, investors have tried to time the bottom in COG stock on a few occasions in the second half of 2019. At the moment, that looks like a potentially dicey bet:  * COG stock is fading again after bouncing off support at $16 earlier this month. That fade re-establishes the bearish descending triangle pattern. Near-term moving averages need to provide some help to the stock; otherwise, COG is testing $16 again, and this time around, support may not hold.  * On an earnings basis, Cabot Oil & Gas stock does look somewhat cheap, at a little over 10x 2019 EPS estimates. But that multiple hardly is out of line for shale plays. Those same analysts project a roughly 25% decline in profits next year. And a core cyclical worry hangs over COG stock and much of the shale sector. If West Texas Intermediate crude prices are barely holding $60 in a booming economy, what happens when the macro picture inevitably reverses?  * It's certainly possible that COG shares improve in 2020, after a 23% decline so far in 2019. That said, caution seems advised, at least in the early going. The shale boom has delivered for consumers. But whether it's explorers like Cabot or even services providers like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), it hasn't done so yet for investors. It seems too early to believe that 2020 will be notably different.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-01-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Everywhere you look, it seems there’s another ad trying to persuade people that natural gas is the key to a clean energy future. The American Petroleum Institute (API) is running a seven-figure campaign touting its climate benefits, despite the fact that natural gas is a fossil fuel with a significant carbon footprint.The industry conducts misleading campaigns like this one because pressure to reduce greenhouse emissions is building. People are coming to realize that we need a 100% clean economy, and they increasingly want pollution-free energy.To be sure, gas can be lower-emitting than other fossil fuels: For example, gas releases about half as much carbon dioxide as coal during combustion. But natural gas is made of the potent greenhouse gas methane, and methane leaks are far too common across the industry. The result is emissions that can be staggeringly large, threatening to undermine whatever near-term climate advantages gas offered in the first place.And even as the industry promotes natural gas as an eco-friendly alternative to coal, it’s fighting rules to curb those harmful leaks. Groups like the API are championing the Trump administration’s plans to abolish EPA regulations on methane emissions across the oil and gas supply chain, and to remove all federal air pollution rules for pipeline and storage facilities. Together, that could result in 5 million metric tons of methane entering the atmosphere each year — equivalent to the emissions from 109 coal plants. So much for that clean energy future.Fortunately, not everybody wants to roll back the environmental clock. Leading producers like Shell, BP, Equinor, Pioneer and Jonah Energy have indicated opposition to Trump’s proposal, with some even calling for stronger federal regulation. Leading gas customers — more than a dozen electric and gas utilities, including Calpine and Exelon — support the standards, too.But the vast majority of American oil and gas companies, collectively responsible for nearly 90% of total U.S. production, have stayed conspicuously quiet in the face of a rollback that will make their product dirtier.Consider the implications for climate change. Methane from human activities is responsible for more than a quarter of the global warming we’re experiencing today, and the oil and gas industry is responsible for a quarter of that. Each pound of methane released has more than 80 times the warming power of the same amount of carbon dioxide the first 20 years after it is released.That means every company with an interest in natural gas — producers, users, distributors — has a vital stake in reducing methane emissions and supporting the policies necessary to do the job. This includes the electric utilities banking on gas to meet their own climate targets, along with investors in each of these areas.Worldwide, oil and gas companies release an estimated 79 million metric tons of methane each year. A five-year series of studies organized by EDF recently concluded that emissions from the U.S. oil and gas sector were a full 60% higher than EPA estimates. And much of that research predates the massive production boom in the Permian Basin, where research suggests the amount of methane escaping has tripled in just the past two years.Some operators are setting targets and implementing straightforward measures like replacing leaky valves and inspecting more regularly for leaks. But in a fragmented industry with thousands of companies, regulations are essential to raise the bar for everyone.The best science tells us that to have a fighting chance at climate stability, the U.S., European Union and other advanced economies need to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, with the rest of the world following soon after. While there are different scenarios for achieving that goal, there’s no doubt industry’s methane pollution must be virtually eliminated.And there’s no doubt it can be done.The International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas methane emissions can be cut by 75% using technologies available today, and that two-thirds of that can be achieved at no net cost. And according to the IEA, the environmental upside is staggering: Those no-cost reductions alone would have the same climate benefit as immediately shutting all the coal-fired power plants in China.That’s one reason why investors managing more than $5.5 trillion across both sides of the Atlantic have opposed the rollback, and have called on the industry to speak up in support of the U.S. methane rules. A growing number of leading oil and gas firms have acknowledged that methane is a major challenge, but also an important opportunity to demonstrate real, measurable climate progress.The private sector has a critical role to play in opposing rollbacks in the U.S., and supporting new policy in the EU, which has a unique opportunity to leverage its role as a major gas buyer. If oil and gas companies really want to be part of a cleaner global energy future, it’s time for them to step up and support strong methane rules.To contact the author of this story: Fred Krupp at fkrupp@edf.orgTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tracy Walsh at twalsh67@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Fred Krupp is the president of Environmental Defense Fund and has guided EDF for three decades.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Methane Rules Are Good for the Energy Industry

2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Bonnie Rippingille looked out at the wisps of steam curling from the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant across Biscayne Bay with a sense of dread. In December federal regulators approved Florida Power & Light Co.’s request to let the facility’s twin nuclear reactors remain in operation for another 20 years beyond the end of their current licenses. By that point they’ll be 80, making them the oldest reactors in operation anywhere in the world.“That’s too old,” said Rippingille, a lawyer and retired Miami-Dade County judge who was wearing a blue print shirt with white sea turtles on it. “They weren’t designed for this purpose.”With backing from the Trump administration, utilities across the nation are preparing to follow suit, seeking permission to extend the life of reactors built in the 1970s to the 2050s as they run up against the end of their 60-year licenses.Read More: Nuclear Reactors Could Run as Long as 80 Years Under Trump Plan“We are talking about running machines that were designed in the 1960s, constructed in the 1970s and have been operating under the most extreme radioactive and thermal conditions imaginable,” said Damon Moglen, an official with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “There is no other country in the world that is thinking about operating reactors in the 60 to 80-year time frame.”Indeed, the move comes as other nations shift away from atomic power over safety concerns, despite its appeal as a carbon-free alternative to coal and other fossil fuels. Japan, which used to get more than a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power, shut down all its plants in 2011 after a tsunami caused a nuclear meltdown at three reactors in Fukushima. Only a handful have restarted while others that can’t meet stringent new standards are slated to close permanently. Germany decided that year to shutter its entire fleet by 2022 and is now having trouble meeting its ambitious climate goals. Other nations such as France and Sweden are allowing reactors to retire while they diversify into solar and wind power.By contrast, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is poised to decide this year on requests by subsidiaries of Exelon Corp. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at its Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, about 100 miles from Washington, and Dominion Energy Inc. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at a power plant in Surry, Virginia.Dominion has notified the commission it intends to ask permission to extend the life of two more reactors north of Richmond, Virginia. Duke Energy Corp. has said it plans to seek license extensions for its entire fleet of 11 nuclear reactors, starting with three in Seneca, South Carolina.“There are economic benefits,” said Rounette Nader, Duke’s director of nuclear license renewal. “Continuing to operate our existing nuclear fleet is cheaper than replacing it.”The nuclear industry has been buffeted by a wave of early reactor retirements in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and subsidized renewable power. Constructing a new nuclear plant—the only one being built in the U.S. is years behind schedule and over budget—can cost billions of dollars. Retrofitting an existing one is more likely to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars range.Read More: America to Decide Whether a Nuke Can Outlive a Human “It just makes sense,” said Maria Korsnick, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a Washington-based trade group that represents nuclear utilities. “I don’t think you should look at a plant just on calendar years, but rather the way that plant has been maintained, so many components have been replaced over the years. There is nothing magic about 80.”Critics such as Edwin Lyman, a nuclear energy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, argue that older plants contain “structures that can’t be replaced or repaired,” including the garage-sized steel reactor vessels that contain tons of nuclear fuel and can grow brittle after years of being bombarded by radioactive neutrons. “They just get older and older,” he said. If the vessel gets brittle, it becomes vulnerable to cracking or even catastrophic failure. That risk increases if it’s cooled down too rapidly—say in the case of a disaster, when cold water must be injected into the core to prevent a meltdown.Other concerns surround the durability of components such as concrete and electric cables, but an advisory board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent government agency that gave Turkey Point the green light to operate into the 2050s, said those risks could be managed safely “without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.”The commission’s decision doesn’t sit well with Philip Stoddard, a bespectacled biology professor who serves as the mayor of South Miami, a city of 13,000 on about 18 miles away from the Turkey Point plant. He keeps a store of potassium iodide, used to prevent thyroid cancer, large enough to provide for every child in his city should the need arise.“You’ve got hurricanes, you’ve got storm surge, you’ve got increasing risks of hurricanes and storm surge,” said Stoddard, 62, from the corner office in a biology building on Florida International University’s palm-tree lined campus. All of this not only increases the likelihood of a nuclear disaster, it also complicates a potential evacuation, which could put even more lives at risk. “Imagine being in a radiation cloud in your car and you’re sitting there running out of gas because you’re in a parking lot in the freeway,” he said.Gabriel Ignetti, a 72-year-old Miami resident and retired music teacher, views nuclear power as a lesser evil than climate change and welcomes extending the life of the plant. “We have a climate emergency,” he said, “and if you have a climate emergency you can’t say we are not going to use that tool.”That’s a point backers also highlight to make the case for extending the lives of nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy provides about 20% of the nation’s electricity and about 55% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Climate change is also one of the main cases against extending the life of Turkey Point, said Kelly Cox, the general counsel for Miami Waterkeeper, a six-person environmental group that has joined with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Friends of the Earth to challenge the NRC’s approval in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. New data show sea level rise in the area reach as high as 4.5 feet by 2070, but regulators from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission didn’t take those updated figures into account, said Cox.“They are going to be flooded,” Cox said. “If we are relicensing a major utility we need to be preparing for the impacts of sea level rise.”Scott Burnell, a NRC spokesman, said the agency’s review process did take into account the most recent information available on sea level rise, but that “the projected rate of sea level rise and associated revisions in flood hazard are slow enough that the plants will have ample time to appropriately analyze and address possible future effects.”Read More: U.S. Nuclear Power Plants Weren’t Built for Climate ChangeOther concerns exist about the condition of the plant’s unlined earthen cooling canals, a unique system that sprawls over nearly six thousand acres. Salty water from the canals is leaking underground toward the Biscayne aquifer, the source of drinking water for about 3 million Floridians, at a rate of about a foot a day, Cox said.Peter Robbins, a spokesman for Florida Power & Light Co., a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc., said the utility is addressing that problem using a series of pumps to decrease the salinity in the cooling canals. The main power plant and its critical component are elevated 20 feet above sea level and are protected by concrete and reinforced buildings designed to withstand hurricanes and floods.“At the end of the day it’s a very clean, reliable source of electricity,” Robbins said. “More than anything we think this is a win for our customers. It helps keep their reliability high, it helps keep their bills low, and there are no greenhouse gases as part of nuclear.”In the city of Homestead, not far from the Turkey Point plant, Brian Goodwin, a burly 52-year-old farmer, said he didn’t believe in climate change, but supports the reactors’ extension nonetheless. “I hope they build another one,” said Goodwin. “It’s good clean power.”(Updates location of the challenge petition in the 17th paragraph; corrects Edwin Lyman’s name in the 11th paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Ari Natter in Washington at anatter5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanJillian GoodmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The U.S. May Soon Have the World's Oldest Nuclear Power Plants

2020-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Nuclear power plants can now implement longer shifts for workers and delay some inspections, raising concerns that as the coronavirus pandemic upends basic operations the industry may be bending the rules too far.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is already allowing six U.S. power plants to extend workers’ shifts, to as long as 12 hours a day for two weeks, and more may be coming. That’s up significantly from current standards that require people to get two-to-three days off a week when pulling shifts that long. Employees can also work as many as 86 hours in a week now, up from 72 hours.To curb transmission of the virus, utilities also say they want to delay inspections that require people to work in close proximity. Environmental groups, though, warn the changes could have disastrous results, and worry they could lead to further deviations from safety rules.“This is a step backward,” said Eric Epstein, chairman of Three Mile Island Alert, a Pennsylvania non-profit group. “It’s not a good idea to stretch workers and marginalize safety standards.”The new rules come as at least 42 construction workers have tested positive for the coronavirus at a nuclear plant in Georgia where Southern Co. is building two new reactors. Last week, the utility and its partners announced they would reduce the 9,000-person workforce by 20% to slow the spread of the virus. The government considers nuclear power plants to be essential, and reactors will supply almost 21% of the country’s electricity this year.Exelon Corp., operator of the biggest U.S. nuclear fleet, says it “can no longer meet the work-hour controls” at four of its reactors, including the Braidwood plant in Illinois. NextEra Energy Inc. said the same thing about its Seabrook power plant in New Hampshire. The companies say that the extended work hours won’t have an adverse impact on safety.“The work-hour rule exemption is an important contingency that may be implemented to allow healthy workers to remain on site for more hours, reducing the need to bring in outside travelers and vendors,” Exelon spokeswoman Linsey Wisniewski said by email.But watchdog groups are concerned that employees may be overworked, leading to fatigue and potentially errors. “You want an alert workforce,” said Paul Gunter, a director at Beyond Nuclear. “You don’t do this with bus drivers, but they’re saying it’s OK for nuclear power plant workers.”The NRC is also granting utilities utilities permission to defer some inspections as dozens of reactors go through the annual spring refueling cycle. These projects can involve more than 1,000 people converging on a power plant for a month or more of maintenance and testing.Postponed InspectionPinnacle West Capital Corp. also has approval for longer hours and is postponing an inspection of components on the bottom of the reactor vessel at the 3.9-gigawatt Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, the biggest U.S. nuclear plant. The company had initially planned to conduct the evaluation during its refueling outage this spring, but has now pushed that out until the next one, in late 2021. The utility owner determined that the task posed a potential risk of spreading the deadly virus, and could be safely delayed.“Only work that is absolutely required for refueling the unit to safely and reliably operate for the next 18 months is being conducted,” Jill Hanks, a spokeswoman, said by email. The plant has not imposed longer shifts, but now has the option to quickly do so if necessary.New RealityThe NRC is on board with the new reality of operating nuclear plants during a global pandemic and is developing guidance for deferring maintenance work. “There are some ancillary activities during an outage that can be deferred,” said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the agency.Entergy Corp. is planning to defer some leak tests at pipes at its Grand Gulf reactor in Mississippi. The tests typically are due every 11 1/2 years, but will now be rescheduled for the next refueling outage in 18 months. Pushing that period out to 13 years won’t affect safety, the company said by email. And at the Indian Point facility north of New York City, Entergy is also seeking permission to postpone annual physical evaluations for firefighters.Nuclear watchdogs are paying close attention to four sites that have requested permission to delay tests on steam generator piping, including Exelon’s Braidwood. The agency already approved NextEra’s request for its Turkey Point plant in Florida.The pipes carry water at high pressure, allowing it to stay liquid even as temperatures reach 600 degrees Fahrenheit (316 degrees Celsius). They are supposed to be inspected every three years, with the job requiring people working in close proximity. Because of the virus, the operators are seeking to delay this until the next refueling cycle in 18 months.Fraught HistoryThese components have a fraught history. In 1999, Consolidated Edison Inc. sought a similar delay to inspect the generator piping at Indian Point, which it owned at the time. The company was granted a 12-month deferral, but eight months later one of them started to leak. While a small amount of radioactive gas escaped into the air, the incident was quickly contained and the NRC concluded it didn’t pose a threat to health.A report by the NRC’s Office of the Inspector General later found that the agency’s original evaluation, approving the delay, was “not adequate.” The NRC’s Burnell said the agency has learned a lot about those systems in the past two decades and there’s little chance that kind of accident would be repeated now.Requests for delays must be accompanied by significant documentation, and “the NRC will only consider deferring the required inspections if that information clearly shows it’s reasonable to expect continued safe operation of the steam generators until the next inspection,” Burnell said by email.‘Speculative to Compare’NextEra said “it would be speculative to compare conditions at Turkey Point to conditions at other nuclear plants,” spokeswoman Lindsay Robertson said by email.Beyond Nuclear’s Gunter says the Indian Point leak may have been prevented if the inspection had taken place on schedule, and the incident points to the potential risks of extending maintenance reviews. As the coronavirus affects the entire global economy, he’s concerned that a wave of extension requests from utilities may lead to other incidents.“It’s a gamble,” Gunter said. ”Our concern is that they’re creating the conditions for a perfect storm. There could be a catastrophic incident that results from postponing inspections combined with fatigue from people that are overworked.”(Updates with EIA forecast in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",New Rules for Nuclear Plant Workers: 12-Hour Days for Two Weeks Straight

Utilities Stocks to Buy: Duke Energy (DUK)Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com Like just about every company in the United States, Duke Energy is dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. This particular company seems to be taking the situation in stride, however.Consider Duke's first-quarter net income, which came out to $899 million. That's just about exactly in line with the same quarter of the previous year, when Duke's net income was $900 million. Meanwhile, this year's first-quarter revenue totaled $5.95 billion, which is not too far below the $6.16 billion reported in the first quarter of the prior year.So, while there is some pressure being felt during the pandemic, it's not too severe. For the time being, DUK stockholders can ride out the crisis with a decent 4.54% forward annual dividend yield. Southern (SO)Source: Shutterstock &quot;Critical infrastructure businesses like ours never take a day off,&quot; observed Thomas A. Fanning, the president and CEO of utilities giant Southern. Fanning's 100% right about that as Southern is an essential utilities provider for around 8 million customers.Southern remains in good fiscal health, as well.

Dominion Energy (D)Source:  Riccardo Annandale Via UnsplashIf you said that D stock is recession-proof, you'd by exaggerating but only slightly. The shares have held up fairly well during the novel coronavirus crisis. Besides, the 4.77% forward annual dividend yield is a strong incentive to hold the stock.Fiscally, Dominion Energy has held up reasonably well despite the pandemic. For the first quarter of this year, Dominion reported total revenues of $4.5 billion. That's actually a marked improvement over the revenues of $3.9 billion Dominion generated in the year-ago quarter.With over 7 million customers across 20 U.S. states relying on Dominion for their energy needs, this company's a mainstay in the utilities sector and D stock is a highly reliable income generator.

The answer would be yes as the company's adjusted earnings for the first quarter totaled $451 million.

Plus, EXC stock is the only name on this list that's traded on the Nasdaq.So, it could be argued that Excelon is a more &quot;modern&quot; utilities company. Its true strength, however, is that it's diversified with fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar segments.With 87 cents per share in operating earnings for 2020's first quarter, Excelon remains on par with its results from the same quarter of last year. Additionally, a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 13.79 and a forward annual dividend yield of 4.17% indicate a compelling value with EXC stock.David Moadel has provided compelling content - and crossed the occasional line - on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, Finom Group, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

The U.S. Attorney found that the electric utility between 2011 and 2019 “offered, and agreed to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and monetary payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts, for the benefit” of a public official with the aim of influencing the official.“We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior.

It implemented four new mandatory policies for employees who interact with public officials, which lay out specific procedures and tracking mechanisms governing vetting and monitoring of lobbyists and political consultants. The policies also prohibit subcontracting of third-party lobbyists and political consultants.Following the settlement agreement, Exelon rose 3.5% to close at $39.40 on Friday.

2020-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Back-to-back bribery scandals involving utility giants in Ohio and Illinois over the last five days have given a black eye to efforts to prop up struggling U.S. nuclear plants.On Tuesday, federal officials arrested the speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives on racketeering charges tied to a bailout of two nuclear plants owned by Energy Harbor Corp., a former FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. Four days earlier, Exelon Corp.’s Commonwealth Edison unit agreed to pay $200 million to resolve a lobbying probe in Illinois, where nuclear plants also receive aid.The fallout in Ohio has been swift, with Democratic and Republican lawmakers calling on Wednesday for the nuclear bailout law to be repealed immediately. Shares of FirstEnergy, which received subpoenas related to the investigation, plunged 21% Wednesday, the most on record. Taken together, the two scandals could undermine future efforts by utilities to seek support from lawmakers.“Fairly or not, these events add a level of regulatory risk,” said Karl Rabago, founder of consulting firm Rabago Energy LLC and a former regulator on the Public Utility Commission of Texas. “That is, more questions, more time, more cynicism, more covering one’s exposure.”Read More: FirstEnergy Bonds Sink on Former Subsidiary’s Ohio Scandal TiesThe charges come as reactor owners have lobbied for state subsidies to help them compete with natural gas plants, wind and solar farms. Aside from Ohio and Illinois, they’ve won them in New York and New Jersey, where lawmakers see the massive plants as crucial employers and, since they don’t emit greenhouse gases, key to fighting global warming.The Ohio nuclear bailout law, which Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder championed, was enacted in 2019 and carved out $150 million annually for the Davis-Besse and Perry plants, which the company had said it would close without aid.FirstEnergy no longer owns the reactors and isn’t named in the affidavit filed by federal authorities. In the charging document, prosecutors said an Ohio-based utility owner -- identified only as “Company A” -- steered almost $61 million over three years to Householder, a Republican, and others.Read More: Ohio Lawmaker Arrested in Alleged $61 Million Bribery SchemeThe law is controversial and deeply unpopular with environmentalists. The arrests are apt to make debate over repealing it a top issue in the 2021 Ohio legislative session, Height Securities analyst Josh Price said in research note.Overturning the law won’t be easy. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Wednesday that he still supports the legislation despite the allegations. But the scandal will increase pressure on the legislature to enact changes to the law that could make it “less friendly” toward Energy Harbor and FirstEnergy, Price said in a note.In the meantime, FirstEnergy’s reputation among policy makers has taken a hit.“They are going to have a credibility deficit with folks in Ohio,” Katie Bays, an energy analyst and managing director at FiscalNote Markets, said in an interview.FirstEnergy declined to comment Wednesday. Energy Harbor, which now owns the reactors, said it was cooperating with the probe. The company was formerly named FirstEnergy Solutions and changed its name when it emerged from Chapter 11 earlier this year.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“The biggest risk for FirstEnergy may be frayed relationships with critical contacts in the Ohio Legislature and regulatory commission.”Kit Konolige, senior industry analystClick here to read the reportIllinois enacted a $235 million-a-year lifeline in 2016 for reactors owned by Exelon. In a statement Friday, prosecutors said employees of its Commonwealth Edison unit tried to gain influence by arranging jobs and payments from 2011 to 2019 for the benefit of “Public Official A.” Prosecutors said the official was the speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives but did not identify current House Speaker Mike Madigan, a Democrat, by name.The statement also didn’t specify that the influence was for the nuclear subsidies but rather for “legislation concerning ComEd and its business.” Still, the probe made it more difficult for the utility to lobby for pending clean energy legislation in Illinois that would benefit the company’s nuclear plants, Bays said.Exelon said that the matter only relates to its ComEd utility, and its deferred prosecution agreement didn’t involve any alleged misconduct by Exelon or Exelon Generation, which owns the company’s nuclear power plants in Illinois.(Adds analyst comment in the ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bribery Scandals Taint Efforts to Save U.S. Nuclear Plants

2020-07-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Power companies are loaning out Teslas in Washington, electrifying bus fleets in Virginia and lobbying for electric vehicle tax credits on Capitol Hill.San Diego Gas & Electric Co. even went so far as to help train salespeople on how to convince consumers to buy electric cars and then paid them as much as $500 per sale. It’s all part of a $1.5 billion effort by utilities such as Exelon Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc. to promote vehicles that run on electricity.The companies see it not just as a chance to sell more power, but to balance electricity demand and meet sustainability goals, said Max Baumhefner, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.“The grid is built for the one hour of the year when electricity demand peaks,” Baumhefner said. Pushing energy consumption to after hours, when many drivers charge their cars at home, helps smooth out the swings in usage and could even reduce power costs for everyone, he said.But some aspects of the industry’s campaign -- such as lobbying for tax credits or against President Donald Trump’s rollback of efficiency standards -- put the companies at odds with powerful oil interests. Half of U.S. oil demand is for gasoline.Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are a threat to that, even if they currently account for about 1.4 million, or 0.7%, of the vehicles on U.S. roads. Within five years, BloombergNEF predicts they will represent as many as 7% of U.S. car sales due to declining battery costs and a growing number of options.That’s a promising figure for utilities, which have seen electricity demand flatten as household appliances become more efficient. According to BloombergNEF projections, 10% of electric demand will come from electric vehicles by 2040.Electric Vehicles Set for Rapid Growth, Defying Recession: ChartYet some motorists still have qualms.“When we did focus groups, customers were telling us, ‘We have apprehension. We’re uneasy,’ whether it’s range anxiety or the upkeep,” said Calvin Butler, the chief executive of Exelon Utilities.That’s led to some extraordinary efforts on the part of the electric companies to put consumers at ease, such as San Diego Gas & Electric’s collaboration with pro-EV PlugStar to train showroom salespeople.“Who better to sell somebody on an EV than the salesperson?” said Estela de Llanos, San Diego Gas & Electric’s chief environmental officer.“By incentivizing some of these dealer employees, we like to think we planted the seed for more of that to happen,” de Llanos said.An Exelon startup called EZ-EV has helped motorists take test drives, calculate mileage needs and winnow down options -- then score discounts at local dealerships. And motorists who sign up for a monthly car subscription with Exelon’s Steer can shift between electric models, from a Tesla Model X to a Porsche Cayenne.Utilities also have asked state regulators to approve more than 80 plans for advancing electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, according to Atlas EV Hub, which tracks the efforts. The bulk of the programs - some 78% of the requested initiatives -- have won approval, said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.But the proposals are meeting steep resistance from the oil industry, in some cases joined by the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity and large power consumers wary of higher costs. With about half of U.S. oil demand today tied to gasoline, the sector is fighting electric vehicles on all fronts, from statehouses and state regulatory commissions to Capitol Hill.In Congress, oil and utility interests have squared off over efforts to expand a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. The utility industry’s leading trade group, the Edison Electric Institute, has lobbied alongside automakers Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co. to expand the tax credit, while oil interests argue climbing sales and the surge in Tesla’s value show subsidies are no longer needed to jump-start a new industry.Refiners and their trade associations “have waged a state-by-state campaign” to block utility investments in electric vehicle infrastructure, the Edison Electric Institute said in a May court filing. They are using “all available tools in all available forums to attempt to slow or stop the general move toward electric and other clean energy transportation, which they view as an existential threat.”National GridLast October, Massachusetts regulators turned back much of National Grid Plc’s $167 million plan to install thousands of charging stations at parking lots, government offices, apartment buildings and other spots, after the American Petroleum Institute, gas station chain Cumberland Farms Inc. and fuel supplier Global Partners LP blasted the initiative.And in Minnesota, a coalition including Marathon Petroleum Corp., and Koch Industries Inc. refining company Flint Hills Resources Pine Bend have mounted a legal challenge to Xcel Energy Inc.’s $25 million electric vehicle plan.Oil industry interests also lobbied states to impose annual fees on electric vehicle users they argue are needed to ensure electric car drivers who don’t pay gas taxes help fund roads and bridges.“It’s fundamentally unfair to take the monopoly power that the utility has and charge everybody higher rates to build out infrastructure that 2% of today’s purchasers use,” said Derrick Morgan, senior vice president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. “It’s a very big gamble with other people’s money.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Test a Tesla or Buy a Bolt With Help From Your Electric Company

2020-08-11,"(Bloomberg) -- More than one million homes and businesses lost power across the U.S. Midwest after a wall of lightning, hail and deadly winds ripped through Chicago and elsewhere, tearing apart trees and houses.The line of storms, 160 miles (257 kilometers) wide, cut a path of destruction across Iowa, Illinois and Indiana Monday. Wind gusts of 100 miles per hour and more were clocked across Iowa, damaging corn crops and knocking down silos. At least one brief tornado formed in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago before heading into Lake Michigan, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service.Most of the outages are in Iowa and Illinois, including about 280,000 in Chicago and its suburbs, according to Exelon Corp.’s Commonwealth Edison. They come on the heels of Tropical Storm Isaias knocking out power to more than 2 million customers on the East Coast, leaving some without power for a week.Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Cargill Inc. crop-processing complexes in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, were knocked offline. Heartland Co-op in Iowa said late Monday it had serious damage at 21 locations. “Several locations are rendered inoperable and we are making contingency plans for managing the fall harvest,” the company said in a statement on its website.Read More: ADM Says Iowa Corn Processing Facility Offline After StormJarod Creed, owner of farm advisory JC Marketing Services LLC in Hudson, Iowa, estimated that as much as 100 million bushels of grain storage space was damaged or ruined in Iowa, and as many as 1.5 million to 2 million acres each of corn and soybeans across the state could be affected.Kinder Morgan Inc.’s Argo, Illinois, ethanol terminal outside of Chicago, a key hub for the biofuel market, was running on generator power on Tuesday as the local utility worked to restore service.The storm almost certainly meets the definition of a powerful system known as a derecho, said Rick Otto, a forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.Derechos are characterized by their large size and capacity for destruction. They can scour a landscape with damaging hail, dangerous wind gusts capable of throwing two-by-fours through walls, and even tornadoes.The storm got its start from thunderstorms and instability in the atmosphere across South Dakota and Nebraska Monday, then picked up strength and began ripping its way through Iowa and beyond.In recent years, hail has caused from $8 billion to $14 billion a year in insured losses, according to insurance giant Aon Plc.(Updates with Chicago tornado in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",One Million Lost Power in Storm That Spawned Chicago Tornado

2020-08-14,"So much is uncertain these days. The coronavirus has came back, but the ‘second wave’ already shows signs of fizzling out. China was in the headlines again recently, as President Trump promised to ban Tik Tok from US access unless it was purchased by a US company. With the November election less than three months away, no one can truly say what the political landscape will look like come year’s end. And to top it off, we don’t even really know how our kids will be going back to school. By remote? In person? It all comes back to the coronavirus.Looking at the clouded landscape from Wells Fargo, head of equity strategy Chris Harvey isn’t worried about the virus or China – he believes those factors are baked into the economic picture by now. He does see risk, however, from the elections and the coming school year: “What we worry about more is the narrative of negative interest rates coming back, the fact that we think that political risk is underpriced, and back to school is going to have a ton of fits and starts, which could play into the economy and the job picture.”On a more immediate note, Harvey sees the markets peaking near their current levels, and then pulling back in the run-up to the elections.Yet, even though Wells Fargo sees markets nearing their upper resistance levels, the firm is still suggesting value stocks to buy. The firm's analysts have been pointing out opportunities in the market, and we’ve pulled the info on them from the TipRanks database. Some of the recent picks are an eclectic bunch from a range of sectors. Let’s find out why they’re so compelling to Wells Fargo.Exelon (EXC)Up first is Exelon, a US electrical utility producer. Exelon is a parent company, with subsidiary utilities providing electrical services in five states plus DC. The company is active in all parts of the electric industry, from power generation to distribution to sales and delivery. Exelon serves some 10 million customers from its 31,000 megawatts of power, generated by a combination of gas, hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, and wind facilities.Entering 2020, Exelon saw earnings rise slightly in Q1, bucking the usual trend of the first ‘corona quarter.’ The second quarter results showed a sequential drop in earnings and revenue, but projections for Q3 show a return to normal levels. The essential nature of Exelon’s business – we need electricity, even during times of virus and lockdowns – shielded the company from the brunt of the recessionary pressures.The fundamental strength of Exelon’s business shows in the dividend. At a time when many companies were cutting or suspending dividends, EXC raised its payment in Q1 and has kept it at the higher level ever since. This is in-line with the company’s pattern of raising dividends in the first quarter of the year. The current payment, at 38.2 cents per share, annualizes to $1.53 and gives a yield of 4%.Neil Kalton, in his coverage of EXC for Wells Fargo, sees the company’s nuclear power developments in Illinois as a net positive, writing, “We continue to believe that the combination of IL’s ambitious clean energy goals combined with the economic importance of the IL nuclear fleet (jobs, property taxes) will prompt legislative action…”Kalton rates the stock Overweight (i.e. Buy) and his $50 price target implies a 32% upside for the coming year. (To watch Kalton’s track record, click here) &quot;Our Overweight rating reflects our belief that shares do not adequately reflect the value of the nuclear fleet given potential policy support,&quot; Kalton noted. The analyst consensus rating on EXC is a Moderate Buy, based on 7 Buys, 2 Holds, and a single Sell set in recent weeks. The shares are selling for $37.85; the average price target of $45.44 suggests it has room for 20% growth in the year ahead. (See Exelon stock analysis on TipRanks)Five9 (FIVN)With our next stock, Five9, we enter the cloud computing tech sector. Five9 uses intelligent cloud services to power a scalable contact center platform. It’s an important niche that has grown more important during the corona crisis when so much routine business has moved online. Five9’s stock barely noticed the market collapse and has risen steadily during the economic downturn and subsequent recovery. Shares have more than doubled since the market hit bottom in mid-March.Earnings, while turning negative in 1H20, generally conformed to the company’s historical pattern. Q4 is typically the firm’s strongest of the year, by a wide margin, with EPS falling off sharply in the other three quarter. Recent performance has been consistent with that – and has also beaten expectations. In Q2, the EPS loss was less than forecast.Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin is impressed with Five9, both the company’s performance and its path for future prospects. He writes of the latter, “We think the $30Bn contact center software market is being transformed … with Five9 one of the best positioned pure-play cloud vendors standing to benefit. We estimate this market is ~20% cloud today, but our recent industry conversations suggest this number could reach &gt;50% within the next 3-5 years, representing a long runway of new cloud revenue which we think can continue to drive FIVN shares higher over time.”Turrin maintains his Overweight/Buy rating on the stock, and raises his price target to $155. The new target indicates a 30% upside potential.With 10 Buys and 4 Holds on record, Five9 shares get a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock’s average price target of $140.69 suggests a 18.5% upside from the current trading price of $118.87. (See Five9 stock analysis on TipRanks)L Brands (LB)Last on our list is a retail company, the owner of Bath and Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. Earlier this year, the company tried to sell of the majority share of VS, planning to keep a 45% stake. The deal fell through in May, after the retail sector had been slammed by three months of the ‘coronavirus recession.’ Earnings were grim in Q1, when net sales fell 37%, but the company’s stock has been rising since the end of May and is now trading above its late February/early March levels.L Brands has managed to outperform the broader markets even as its business fell due to the social lockdown policies. Online sales were bright point, with Bath and Body Work’s Q1 online numbers increasing 85%. The company expects Q2 numbers to return to more normal levels, reflecting the reopening of economy and the (at least partial) lifting of restrictions in most markets. It’s important to note that LB’s earnings show a high degree of seasonal cyclicity, with Q4 – including the holidays – generally outperforming the rest of the year put together.Despite the collapse of the Victoria’s Secret sale, L Brands recently reiterated that it remains committed to separating the lingerie retailer from Bath and Body Works. BBW has long been the more profitable of the company’s two brands.Earlier this year, LB took steps to shore up liquidity for the crisis period, closing an offering of secured senior notes. The offering was in two tranches, the first for $750 million at 6.875% and the second for $500 million at 9.375%. Both are due in 2025; proceeds were used to redeem a previous note issue and to fund general operations.Ike Boruchow reviews this stock for Wells Fargo, and believes that LB is conducting a successful turnaround. He says of the company, “…over the past few years, LB has generated meaningful comp deceleration and margin erosion. However, we believe that the company may be poised for improvements in the upcoming year as they take a more critical eye to their business, and we believe they could see meaningful multiple expansion and numbers moving higher as the company makes progress towards resuming profitability.”Boruchow reiterates his Overweight/Buy rating on LB, and his newly raised price target, $35, implies a robust 33% upside potential for the year. (To watch Boruchow’s track record, click here)L Brands’ Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 18 reviews, including 9 Buys, 7 Holds, and 2 Sells. The split reflects the headwinds the stock has seen in the past year, and investor caution as a result. Share are selling for $26.40, and recent appreciation has pushed the share value above the average price target of $24.65.

2020-10-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Two Illinois communities are getting a lesson in the dangers of relying too heavily on one taxpayer as Exelon Corp. prepares to close a pair of nuclear power stations next year, eliminating thousands of well-paying jobs and eviscerating local budgets.Illinois’s largest electric utility announced in August it will close a money-losing plant near Byron next September and its Dresden generating station a hundred miles away two months later. The company blames federal regulators for changing rules and making nuclear power less competitive in the biggest U.S. regional power market that stretches across 13 states. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has indicated he’s not going to let one company that’s looking for more subsidies dictate energy policy in his state.The shutdowns underscore the deep financial risk to small communities with economies tethered to single employers or industries, a dependence that’s likely to get increasingly perilous nationwide as the deepest recession since World War II drives a wave of corporate bankruptcies. Carlton, Wisconsin, lost almost 70% of its revenue when a nearby nuclear plant was shut in 2013.The Byron Community Unit School District 226, about 96 miles (154 kilometers) west of Chicago, relies on the local Exelon plant for about three fourths of its property taxes. Revenue from the stations also funds libraries, fire districts and forest preserves.“It would be devastating,” said Buster Barton, superintendent of the school district, where roughly a quarter of the almost 1,500 students are low income.Exelon and other nuclear operators have shut at least 11 U.S. reactors since 2013 and pressed legislatures for subsidies to keep others running. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut implemented subsidies to keep stations open. Exelon closed its Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania last year after a proposed bailout bill foundered.The Byron plant has operated in Ogle County for three decades and the Dresden facility in Grundy County for 40 years, and the two counties together are home to about 102,000 residents. Combined the two plants employ more than 1,500 full-time and 2,000 supplemental workers and pay nearly $63 million in local taxes, according to Exelon.“Nothing on the horizon that would replace that amount,” said Dean Marketti, treasurer for the Coal City Fire Protection District, which serves 10,000 residents from two stations. The Dresden station makes up half the tax receipts for the fire district and more than 10% of surrounding Grundy County’s gross domestic product.Clean EnergyTax revenue from the Dresden facility provides about $16 million of the $34 million annual budget for Coal City Unit School District 1. The district, which doesn’t get as much state aid as its peers for classroom needs or extracurricular activities, now has to figure out whether it will need to cut services, raise taxes or take on debt to make up for the loss.“We are not going to be able to find enough revenue or cuts to keep everything stable,” said Superintendent Kent Bugg, who added many of the district’s families depend on the “high quality jobs and high quality benefits that are hard to come by.”Illinois legislators were expected to consider a clean energy law this year that might have included subsidies to nuclear plants, but much of the legislative agenda has been derailed by the pandemic. Nuclear power is considered clean energy because it produces little carbon emissions.To keep the plants open, the legislature now has about six months to vote on a bill and put on Pritzker’s desk. But helping Exelon comes with political risk after the company’s Illinois utility unit Commonwealth Edison admitted to bribery and agreed to pay $200 million to resolve a federal probe that’s entangled state House Speaker Mike Madigan.Lawmakers have been looking at the creation of a market for clean energy that’s separate from the current auction process that looks for the cheapest priced fuel, which often isn’t nuclear, according to state Senator Sue Rezin. The Republican’s district includes three of Illinois’s six nuclear power plants.“The clock is ticking,” Rezin said.Snap DecisionsWhile Pritzker is all for adding more clean energy jobs, he’s not interested in increasing subsidies for Exelon, which has threatened to close plants before, said Pritzker spokesperson Jordan Abudayyeh. Exelon gets a ratepayer-funded subsidy of $235 million a year to run other Illinois plants, she said.Michael Pacilio, chief operating officer of Exelon Generation, the company’s unit that oversees the Illinois plants, said plans to close the plants “aren’t snap decisions” and the decisions were made because they aren’t profitable anymore after fracking and natural gas changed the game, he said.“It’s really a matter of recognizing the societal benefits those plants bring, to America and to the world, and compensating them,” Pacilio said.(Updates with names of company units in 12th and 16th paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Illinois Nuke-Plant Exits Poised to Gut Small-Town Budgets
2020-10-08,"(Bloomberg) -- The August heat wave that scorched the U.S. West and triggered blackouts in California appears to have been lucrative for some commodity traders playing the region’s power market.Mercuria Energy America LLC, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Tenaska Power Services Co. and Berkshire Hathaway’s PacifiCorp utility were among traders who sold power above $1,000 a megawatt-hour, the price cap set in the Western Electric Coordination Council, which oversees the regional energy market. Together they made at least 40 sales, according to filings they submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday.In some cases, the sales called for exporting electricity from California at a time when supplies there were already scarce. Some of those exports were curtailed by authorities.The disclosures come as California regulators dissect the causes behind the state’s first rolling blackouts since the 2001 energy crisis. During the heat wave, electricity prices skyrocketed as grid operators struggled to meet rising demand and as power plants tripped offline. State officials on Tuesday said that flaws in the state’s power markets contributed to the outages.In their filings, the traders said the extreme conditions justified the sales. They also said there were no signs of market manipulation, such as megawatt laundering or gaming strategies, in their trades. Finally, they all noticed prices rose to at least $1,600 a megawatt-hour at the Palo Verde hub in Arizona, with some of them citing financial contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange, according to the filings.Tenaska said in a statement that the unprecedented heat wave drove prices above $1,000 a megawatt-hour for two days and that it complied with rules requiring it to explain to regulators why its sales above the price cap were justified. Mercuria and PacifiCorp didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment sent outside normal business hours. Conoco didn’t have an immediate comment. Shell declined to comment.More on the transactions:Mercuria made seven spot sales to DTE Energy Trading Inc. and two each to Uniper Global Commodities North America LLC and Conoco.Tenaska made six spot sales which included some exports. Those were curtailed by California’s grid operator on Aug. 18. The trader said it faced significant losses if its own suppliers failed to deliver.Shell did 13 bilateral spot sales on Aug. 18 and 19 above $1,000 at Mead, Palo Verde, Four Corners and Mona.Berkshire Hathaway’s PacifiCorp said it was a price taker on seven transactions that were priced above cap, citing the higher prices that settled on the Intercontinental Exchange contracts.Conoco made spot transactions at Palo Verde and the Mead delivery point in Nevada. On Aug. 18, one of its scheduled deliveries was cut for three hours because of a transmission curtailment. Discussions about potential damages between it and two parties are ongoing.Exelon Corp. identified a single transaction that came in above the cap, which took place after being asked by a broker to help execute a transaction as a credit-worthy counterparty. The day-ahead sale involved 14 megawatts from Rainbow Energy Marketing Corp. to a unit of Citigroup Inc. to be delivered at the Palo Verde hub on Aug. 19. Exelon made a $112 profit on that trade through a fee. Exelon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside normal business hours.(Adds Tenaska statement in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Conoco, Mercuria Cashed In on Power Trades During Heat Wave"

2020-10-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Exelon Corp. is considering a breakup that would involve separating its non-utility assets, according to people familiar with the matter.The Chicago-based company is working with advisers to evaluate the split, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. No final decision has been made and Exelon could opt to keep its current structure, they said.“As we most recently communicated on our second quarter earnings call, we regularly review our corporate structure and overall mix of businesses to determine how to best create value and position our businesses for success,” William Gibbons, a representative for Exelon, said in a statement.Exelon’s non-utility operations include 21 nuclear reactors as well several solar, wind and natural-gas generating assets, according to its website. A potential split would leave Exelon focused on the regulated power market, with a portfolio that includes a half-dozen utilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and elsewhere.Power companies are increasingly unloading unregulated assets to focus on their utilities, in part because investors prefer pure-play businesses. DTE Energy Inc. is considering unloading its non-utilities businesses, people familiar with the matter said last week. Dominion Energy Inc. agreed to sell its natural gas infrastructure earlier this year to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Activist investor Corvex Management said last week that Exelon could be worth roughly $60 a share, and that the company should separate its utility business to unlock that underlying value.Exelon rose 2% to close at $39.98 on Monday, giving the company a market value of about $38.9 billion. The stock rose about 7% in late trading.During Exelon’s earnings call in August, Chief Executive Officer Christopher Crane said the company regularly evaluates whether to split up its utility and non-utility assets.“One thing I can tell you is there’s an annual review on all the non-nuclear assets to see if they propose more value to others than we have projected for ourselves, and that annual review will continue,” he said. “And as we see assets that could perform better in somebody else’s portfolio and we could monetize those assets, we’ll do that.”Potential BuyersFinding a buyer for Exelon Generation, the company’s non-utility arm, would be tough, and a spinoff to shareholders is a more likely result, said Kit Konolige, utilities analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.While Exelon’s gas plants would probably be attractive to potential buyers, its nuclear reactors would complicate any deal, he said.The company has lobbied for subsidies in states including New York and Illinois, arguing that some of its reactors are uneconomic and would close without bailouts. That means the facilities have little value beyond the amount they receive from the states, Konolige said.The most likely potential buyer would be another utility that wanted to bulk up its generation, he said, adding that such a buyer would likely face the same struggles as Exelon.“Most utilities would note that Exelon hasn’t been able to prove that it’s a good thing to have a utility combined with merchant plants and a bunch of nuclear plants,” said Konolige. “There might not be that many interested buyers.”(Updates with analyst comment starting in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Exelon Weighs Shedding Nuclear Plants, Other Non-Utility Assets"

However, over the past month, the stock decreased by 3.85%, and in the past year, by 8.73%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 41.39%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Electric Utilities stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

Who Is Facedrive?
Facedrive (OTCMKTS:FDVRF) company has a total of five verticals: Facedrive Rideshare (ridesharing), Facedrive Marketplace (sustainable e-commerce platform), Facedrive Foods (food delivery), Facedrive Social (e-social platform), and Facedrive Health (contact tracing and health services).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips


					9 Long-Term Stocks for the Next Decade				

That’s a lot of businesses for a company that doesn’t have much revenue. Needless to say, plunking any money down on Facedrive stock is a riskier proposition than buying inflated shares of DoorDash.
That said, I do find its Steer electric vehicle subscription business, which it acquired in September 2020 for $3.5 million of its shares, interesting. Facedrive acquired the business from an affiliate of Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC), the Chicago-based utility. As part of the deal, the Exelon affiliate made a $2 million strategic investment in Facedrive.
This business has many moving parts, so you might want to wait a few quarters to see which of the five verticals seem to stick.
Is Facedrive Cheaper Than DoorDash Stock?
I’ll be the first to admit that I had never heard about the Toronto-based ridesharing company until I saw an article in Oilprice.com discussing why DoorDash was the hottest IPO of 2020.
Thanks to Oilprice.com contributor Paul Fisher for the tip on Facedrive.

As someone who loves to point out different options for InvestorPlace readers, I couldn’t resist taking a closer look at the Canadian company that’s been on an acquisition binge in 2020.
According to the company’s Q3 2020 Management Discussion and Analysis from Nov. 27, Facedrive acquired certain Foodora Canada assets out of bankruptcy in July for 562,000 CAD ($438,360). In October, it acquired Food Hwy, Canada’s leading ethnic and student-focused food-delivery service, for 1.5 million CAD ($1.17 million) in cash and 7.6 million CAD ($5.93 million) in Facedrive stock.
While it’s been swamped acquiring other businesses, investors shouldn’t confuse Facedrive with DoorDash in terms of sales.
In the first nine months of 2020, DoorDash had $1.92 billion in sales, almost four times higher than a year earlier. By comparison, Facedrive had 748 million CAD ($585 million) in its first nine months through the end of September.
InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer recently pointed out that DoorDash was trading more than 10 times the analysts’ 2021 sales estimate. That was based on a market capitalization of $51 billion. At the current market cap of $44.5 billion, it’s got a price-to-sales ratio of 8.7, slightly less expensive, but still not cheap.
Ramer points out that both GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and Postmates have been acquired in recent deals that valued the businesses between 4-5 times sales. So, yes, DoorDash isn’t cheap.
As for Facedrive’s Q3 2020 financial statements at Sedar, the company had 91.4 million shares outstanding at the end of September. Based on a share price of $13 as I write this, it has a market cap of $1.19 billion and a P/S ratio of 1,500 based on trailing 12-month sales of 980,000 CAD ($764,000).

The short answer is that Facedrive is not cheaper than DoorDash, but they both lose a boatload of money.
The Bottom Line
If I were going to invest in a money-losing large-cap stock, DoorDash would definitely not be it. I don’t care what the future looks like for food-delivery services.
As for Facedrive, it doesn’t appear to know what it wants to be when it grows up, and that means your investment is going to be severely diluted in the future as it continues to sell stock to finance its grand plan to provide services that bring about a healthier planet.
If I had a few thousand dollars in fun money to play with, Facedrive, despite its obvious lack of any real revenues, is an intriguing stock to play. You might want to put it on your “Fun Money” watchlist.

2021-02-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Exelon Corp. plans to separate its power-generation unit from the U.S. company’s utilities business in an effort to streamline operations and increase shareholder value.The Chicago-based utility owner plans to structure the deal as a tax-free spinoff that will be completed in the first quarter of next year, according to a statement Wednesday. Existing Exelon shareholders will receive shares in the new entity, but the company hasn’t yet determined the distribution ratio.Exelon is the latest company to unload power-generating or pipeline assets to focus on regulated utilities that are guaranteed more predictable returns. The company owns more than 31 gigawatts of capacity including the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear plants, which has faced pressure as reactors struggle to compete against natural gas, wind and solar. That’s been a drag on the shares and the public markets will likely see benefits in separating the units, according to Katie Bays, an analyst at FiscalNote Markets.“The market doesn’t assign a lot of value to merchant fleets,” and boosting the company’s share price is probably one of the main drivers for the transaction, Bays said. “A hybrid company like Exelon will trade at a discount.”Exelon shares fell 0.5% to $40.61 at 11:35 p.m. in New York. The company’s six utility units provide electricity and natural gas to 10 million customers in five states and the District of Columbia.Exelon’s shares have closed below $45 since the U.S. went into lockdown last March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Corvex Management, an activist investor, estimated in October the company could be worth about $60 a share if it separates its assets. Exelon said in November it was conducting a review of its operations and that it had advisers to evaluate such a move.Exelon’s advisers on the spinoff include Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and Centerview Partners.“This morning’s announcement is a very good strategic move for us,” Exelon Chief Executive Officer Christopher Crane said on a conference call Wednesday.(Updates with comment from CEO in last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Exelon to Separate Power-Generation Business Via Spinoff

2021-02-25,"Shares of Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) fell by 3.01% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Exelon has. Exelon's Debt According to the Exelon's most recent balance sheet as reported on February 24, 2021, total debt is at $39.33 billion, with $35.48 billion in long-term debt and $3.85 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $663.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $38.67 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Exelon has $129.32 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.3. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-03-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Exelon Corp. called on Texas regulators to reset electricity prices from last month’s grid crisis, becoming one of the biggest generators to contest record-high energy costs.The utility owner, which expects to take a $710 million hit from the Arctic blast that knocked half of Texas generation offline, asked the Public Utility Commission of Texas to rescind its Feb. 15 and 16 orders that set the price of electricity at $9,000-a-megawatt-hour, the maximum allowed.The impact of those orders on power providers and industrial energy consumers “is crushing,” Exelon said in a petition Friday.Exelon joins a chorus of state leaders, companies and individuals asking for changes to the way electricity was priced during the energy crisis that’s already pushed some power providers into bankruptcy. But while most critics have called for the price cap to be rolled back starting on Feb. 18, when the rotating outages ended, Exelon is one of the first to ask for prices to be reset during the height of the crisis, Feb. 15-16.Those calling for repricing contend that had rates been set by the market, prices would have not have stayed as high as $9,000 for four straight days. The week before, the average spot price of wholesale electricity in Houston was $10.12 a megawatt-hour.Texas’ power market now faces a $3 billion shortfall as more than a dozen companies grapple with sky-high power bills. An independent market monitor hired by the state has recommended reversing about $5.1 billion of $16 billion in overcharges stemming from the grid emergency -- but the utility commission has so far declined to do so.Texas Leaders Press Utility Regulator to Correct Power PricesThe commission, as well as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the grid, both maintain that the $9,000 price order was necessary to ensure that generators stayed online during the cold blast. But Exelon argues that such scarcity pricing simply does not work “as an emergency tool during weather-driven shortages.” The grid operator had other tools to ensure that generation stayed online, the company said.“There was no nexus between the commission’s action and the peril at hand,” Exelon said in its filing. The company also argued that the commission had no authority to issue the orders, and that the orders themselves violated state law.Generator Vistra Corp., which initially opposed repricing, has also said that some prices should be re-evaluated. The grid operator “violated one of the most fundamental, common-sense principles of energy regulation when it undercut prices early in the storm” and then raised them later in the week, a Vistra spokesperson said in an emailed statement.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Exelon Calls for Repealing $9,000 Power Prices From Texas Crisis"

2021-03-19,"(Bloomberg) -- A move in Texas to wipe out more than $4 billion in electricity overcharges from last month’s devastating blackouts appears dead in the water after deeply divided lawmakers left town without taking final action on the proposal.“Repricing push ends with a whimper,” Josh Price, an analyst for Height Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. He added that the House is adjourned until Monday with no plans to pass the Senate repricing bill ahead of the Saturday deadline.The move is a blow to retail electricity providers and generators including Exelon Corp. that were forced to buy power at sky-high rates during the outages, which at its peak left more than four million homes and businesses without power. At least four companies have filed for bankruptcy.Texas’s independent market monitor had recommended that the utility commission correct $4.2 billion of about $16 billion in overcharges that occurred when the state’s grid operator left power prices at a $9,000 megawatt-hour cap for 32 hours after blackouts stopped.Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the state’s second most powerful politician, led the charge to roll back prices and called it the “right thing to do.” Patrick pushed a measure quickly through the state senate on Monday that required the pricing changes after the chairman of the utility commission refused to order them.Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican, originally appeared cool to the idea of repricing, calling it an “extraordinary government intervention into the free market.”Adjusting the prices could prompt some investors to avoid the Texas energy market for fear of future retroactive price changes, and may even mean some proposed power plants don’t get built because of a lack of confidence over future payments, Brianna Lazerwitz, a BloombergNEF analyst, wrote in a report Friday. The concerns could even spill into other commodity markets, raising doubts about contracts for oil and natural gas, huge industries in Texas.“A resettling of prices now could completely undermine faith in the market,” Lazerwitz said. “It would mean undermining the integrity of investing in Texas, with adverse impacts rippling far outside of the state’s power market.”Retroactively rolling back prices would have been an unprecedented and controversial move, and some large power providers and the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. warned it could undermine confidence in Texas markets.A House committee advanced five bills on Thursday meant to prevent a repeat of the energy crisis.(Updates with comment from analyst in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Texas Plan to Claw Back $4 Billion in Power Charges Fizzles
