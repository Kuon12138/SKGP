The stock has rocketed more than 7-fold since closing at $22.39 on its first day listed on the Nasdaq on July 19, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF  has run up 55% and the S&P 500  has lost 1.9% over the same time.","Tilray&apos;s stock surges after Benchmark starts coverage with bullish rating, $200 target"

Four days later, Tilray announced that it was partnering with Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) to research cannabis-infused drinks. That news also created a buzz around Tilray stock.

Inevitably, as cannabis companies in Canada and elsewhere stake their claims to different parts of the cannabis industry, comparisons will be made to the Gold Rush of the 1800s.

  * 7 Stocks at Risk of the Global Smartphone Slowdown 



And as in the days of the Gold Rush, there will be winners, losers, and posers. 

### Is Tilray Stock a Winner, a Loser or a Poser?

Unlike Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) and Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Tilray isn't interested in getting investments from large companies, as TLRY prefers to remain completely independent. 

&quot;We obviously want to partner with other global pioneers and other leaders in their respective sectors,&quot; Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy said about the partnerships. &quot;We think it's too early to give up control of our own destiny.&quot;

Those appear to be the words of someone who's going to remain CEO of an independent TLRY for a long time. Of course, it could also be PR speak for &quot;We haven't gotten the right offer just yet.&quot;

Whatever the true motivations of Tilray's CEO and board, its partnerships could prove to be very beneficial for Tilray stock over the long-term.

However, it's not uncommon for big, multinational companies to blow hot and cold. Either of Tilray's partners could lose interest, pay a breakup fee, and end the partnership.

Getting a big investment like the one that Canopy's gotten from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) is far more permanent; it's also a sign that Canopy is serious about being a smaller piece of a much bigger pie. 

Tilray might believe that it's in control of its destiny at the moment, but it can lose that control very quickly.

TLRY had operating losses of $34 million on $27.6 million in sales through the first nine months of its fiscal year. To win the cannabis wars, companies need deep pockets and experience. 

Canopy has both. Tilray doesn't. 

### It's Not a Poser

I don't think there's any way you can consider Tilray a poser. Anheuser-Busch and Sandoz wouldn't have signed on to these deals if they had a sniff of doubt about Tilray's bona fides. 

However, as InvestorPlace's Luke Lango pointed out in late December, the BUD partnership is not a huge catalyst that can move TLRY stock back into triple digits.

&quot;A $50 million commitment from AB InBev (a $130 billion company) is a drop in the ocean,&quot; Lango stated in an article published on Dec. 28. &quot;The language in the press release also doesn't imply that AB InBev and Tilray will be 'lifetime partners,' and that stands in stark contrast to the bullish language in the Cronos and Canopy deal press releases.&quot;

Tilray's CEO, Brendan Kennedy, believes that there will be three cannabis companies with $100 billion valuations, and he hopes that Tilray stock will be one of them. He also thinks that Tilray will be one of three companies in the sector with annual sales of $50 billion. 

That seems brash for a company that's projected to generate just $140 million of sales in 2019. Kennedy might want to tone down the rhetoric because it likely will come back to bite him in the rear end. 

### The Bottom Line on Tilray Stock

While Tilray has been in the news a lot in recent weeks, the company's dealmaking has done little to move TLRY stock. 

Tilray stock can only rise meaningfully if the company delivers better results in the fourth quarter or if it changes its philosophy and sells a chunk of its business to a company like Diageo (NYSE:DEO).

Investors want results now. 

That's a terrible situation for companies like Tilray that have long-range plans. 

As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-23,"Even before the marijuana business is legal in most of the U.S., it's consolidating. The financial frenzy continued Jan. 22 as Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), the first such company to launch a U.S. public offering, agreed to buy Natura Naturals Holdings for $52 million. The deal doubles Tilray's production capacity and, since Natura grows in large greenhouses, should improve the uniformity of its product. Tilray stock was down 5.7% on the deal, and open for trade Jan. 23 at about $73 -- a market cap of $6.8 billion.

Why a company that probably can't sell its product to you is worth $6.8 billion and was worth twice that before the bear market started in September, illustrates just how fast the pot gold rush is moving. The TLRY stock price has achieved its valuation while the company was on track for revenues of just $50 million for all of 2018.

### Tilray Stock: A Little Help From Its Friends

Tobacco and alcohol companies both see marijuana as a legal high they want to take advantage of, but Tilray prefers to talk about its alliance with a unit of Novartis A.G. (NYSE:NVS), the Switzerland-based pharmaceutical company, which signed a distribution deal with TLRY in December. The company also has a $100 million joint venture with AB InBev (NYSE:BUD) to research cannabis-infused beverages.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



Tilray's products page treats marijuana as a drug, not a high, with liquid extracts and dried flower in small medicine bottles. CEO Brendan Kennedy doesn't smoke the stuff, and the only picture of him smiling in a recent Fortune profile saw him leading the Nasdaq IPO. While Tilray is Canadian, the private equity firm behind it, Privateer Holdings, which holds 73% of the common, is based in Seattle.

TLRY is the second-largest legal pot company by market cap, trailing Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC), which has drawn $4 billion in investment from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), the liquor company. Another rival, Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), recently sold board control to Altria (NYSE:MO), the cigarette company, while smaller HEXO Group has a joint venture with the Canadian unit of Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP).

### How Fast Is the Market?

Pot stocks are hot thanks to predictions like one in May from Grandview Research predicting this will be a $14.6 billion market by 2025. Tilray's growth -- quarterly sales for December are expected to be double those of the previous quarter -- would seem to justify optimism. But sales in Colorado seem to have peaked at between $120 million and $140 million per month. Numbers in Washington state have also leveled off.

There are predictions of full U.S. legalization around 2020, but there is no certainty. For now, all the leading pot companies continue to have headquarters and production facilities in Canada, which legalized recreational marijuana in October and won't have a network of private shops in place until this spring.

The pattern of sales, of growth followed by stability, is just what TLRY and other pot sellers are selling regulators, although the story they're selling investors is something quite different. Tilray does extensive research to see where legalization may hit next -- South Korea legalized medical marijuana last fall -- in order to grab market share quickly.

### The Bottom Line on TLRY Stock

The marijuana gold rush is real, but its size and stability are still unknown.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Lost 20% Over Past 90 Days 



Tilray gives the product a veneer of respectability, but we're still talking about pot, and whether that veneer is the right strategy once recreational marijuana becomes common is a question.

For now, those questions are all in the future, which is why all pot stocks are highly speculative. When you buy one, you're buying corporate image and strategy. Tilray's is very corporate.

2019-02-05,"Shares of Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) have been on fire lately, more than doubling in less than six weeks. What's up with CRON stock and can it advance further?

Cannabis stocks are very fascinating to watch. While the group certainly has long-term potential as the U.S. and the world continue to go through the legalization process, the group's stocks have become a trader's paradise.

The stocks' moves are extreme, in both directions, and they're being fed purely by sentiment. These swings can be difficult for investors emotionally, as they suffer paper losses and enjoy enormous gains, but that's exactly what traders like to see.

  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday 



So what's been happening to CRON stock? Cronos Group stock went from about $10 to about $13 after it was announced that Altria (NYSE:MO) would take a $1.8 billion stake in CRON. That news came on Dec. 7, but by Christmas, CRON stock was back down to $10.

Once the market started to rebound from its Christmas Eve lows, Cronos Group stock really flew. Now, with Cronos Group stock over $21 per share, some are wondering if it's too late to buy the shares.

### Evaluating CRON

Cronos Group has been in focus lately because of a few of its positive catalysts. First, cannabis stocks have regained momentum recently, with names like Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), New Ages Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) and others shifting into &quot;rally mode.&quot;

Second, after a large, well-known firm takes a multi-billion stake in a company, the company's stock price usually rises. That's been the case with CRON stock. Altria is buying $1.8 billion of Cronos Group stock in exchange for 40% of its equity. It has a warrant to buy another 10% stake at a premium of about 17% to its initial purchase price.

The strategic-equity investment leaves investors in a conundrum: Cannabis stocks, generally speaking, are overvalued when viewed in the context of the next 12 to 24 months. Beyond that point, though, many may feel they are undervalued compared to their potential over the next three to five years.

With Altria investing $1.8 billion in the space, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) spending $4 billion on its own cannabis investment, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in talks with Aurora Cannabis and Tilray developing products with Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) and Sandoz, a unit of Novartis (NYSE:NVS), it's logical for investors to feel optimistic about the sector's future.

### Trading CRON Stock

With all that said, it's no wonder CRON has been shooting higher. When big-name international companies are taking big stakes in a stock, demand for the shares obviously rises. When demand goes up, so does the share price.

After almost hitting $22 on Friday and grazing $25 on Monday, CRON stock is clearly in demand, even though it's down around 4.5% in early-afternoon trading today. However, Cronos Group stock  does look a bit toppy over $20.

If investors went long CRON stock near $10, they've more than doubled their money. Taking profits is hard to do if investors think the stock could rise further. To make it easier, investors can consider using a trailing stop-loss, thereby ensuring that they will keep the bulk of their gains but giving them the opportunity to ride the stock higher.

Those who aren't long CRON yet should wait. With an RSI reading of about 89, it's clear that Cronos Group stock is overbought in the short-term.

That doesn't make Cronos an outright sell or a short, but investors should keep in mind that the rally is a little long in the tooth. On a pullback of CRON stock, look to see if its short-term uptrend support, depicted by the blue line on the chart, holds. If not, l am curious to see if the support level around $18, which was previously a consolidation zone, holds up.

2019-02-15,"Under a new proposal by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Medicare program would cover FDA-approved CAR-T therapies. CAR-T, or chimeric anitgen receptor T-cell, therapies use genetically-engineered immune cells called T cells to more specifically target cancer cells. CMS said the proposal, announced Friday, would require Medicare to cover the cancer treatment when it is offered in a CMS-approved registry or clinical study, as long as data is collected from the patients for at least two years after treatment. CMS said it plans to use the information to decide what treatments are most beneficial to patients and which CAR-T therapies to fund in the future. &quot;Today's proposed coverage decision would improve access to this therapy while deepening CMS's understanding of how patients in Medicare respond to it, so the agency can ensure that it is paying for CAR T-cell therapy for cases in which the benefits outweigh the risks,&quot; said CMS Administrator Seema Varma in a statement. There are currently only two approved CAR-T therapies in the U.S., and both are very expensive. Novartis's  Kymriah has a list price of $475,000, while and Gilead Sciences Inc.'s  Yescarta is priced at $373,000. There is no national Medicare policy for covering the expensive new cancer treatment, so it is currently up to local Medicare administrative contractors to decide whether to pay for it. Shares of Novartis have gained 4.3% in the year to date, while shares of Gilead have gained 6.3%. The SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF  has gained 13.5% and the S&P 500 has gained 10.4%.",Medicare would cover CAR-T therapies under new CMS proposal

Should investors keep holding Spark stock now and after the deal is done? Probably, and here's why.Source: Shutterstock  Spark Stock and the MergerTo assess the merits of the deal, look at the price Roche paid. Both Roche and Spark investors need to ask why the former was willing to pay a premium of over 200% to acquire the latter. The total value of the deal, at the time of the announcement on Feb. 25, is $4.8 billion.Spark's acquisition risk is high, too, because it only has one marked product. Voretigene neparvovec, or Luxturna, is a gene therapy that treats Leber's congenital amaurosis. Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) is responsible for the marketing aspect of the therapy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Trade War Stocks to Sell on U.S.-China Deal News Roche has plenty of strong sales growth in its two main divisions: pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. In the fourth quarter, sales grew in the high single digits. In fact, sales grew for seven consecutive years. It stands to reason that Roche wants Spark to get ahead in the gene therapy market.When it comes to treating genetic diseases, Spark has a fully integrated offering. Plus, Spark is the only biotechnology company that successfully commercialized a gene therapy in the U.S. market. With that achievement, Roche needs Spark Therapeutics to get ahead.Spark's CEO Jeffrey D. Marrazzo said that genetic diseases are immediate and vast, so it will need Roche's resources and reach to accelerate the development of more gene therapies. Spark's ProgramsSpark will have full autonomy under The Roche Group and will build on its hemophilia A program. In 2018, Luxturna launched in the U.S. with great success. The company demonstrated it could commercialize the drug and secure patient access.It cut most of the risk with the launch and after establishing treatment centers, patients have a channel for market access and reimbursement. Completing a licensing agreement with Novartis will help drive uptake for the therapy outside of the U.S.Spark has a few products whose developments within the hemophilia programs progressed. SPK-9001 for hemophilia B was transitioned to Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). SPK-8001 and SPK-8016 for hemophilia A progressed last year.The FDA designated SPK-8001 breakthrough therapy designation. And last December, the company shared the drug's safety profile at ASH; 9.7 years after follow-up, subjects showed no inhibitors, no thrombotic events, and no persistent or unresolved transaminase elevations.Spark's Phase I/II study of 8016 are underway. When the company shares the updated data in mid-2019, it may further validate Roche's purchase of the company.Spark is also targeting the inhibitor population, which would increase the addressable market of the therapy. Inhibitors, or neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII, occur in as many as 30% of the population who have severe or moderately severe hemophilia A. Earnings and Spark StockSpark reported revenue of $64.7 million last year, with $27 million from net product sales of Luxturna. $37.8 million comes from the company's agreement with Pfizer and Novartis.Despite R&D costs falling after the commercialization of Luxterna, SG&A costs still rose last year. It rose to $124.9 million, up from $111.1 million from the prior year. These costs are due primarily to higher salaries and stock-based compensation. For the year, Spark lost $78.8 million, or $2.11 a share. Investing StrategyInvestors may look at holding Roche stock for the long-term in light of the Spark acquisition. Roche is well-diversified and has a healthy cash flow to fund the costs related to this deal. Still, the pay-off will likely take at least a year, if not more.This is due to shares trading close to yearly highs, plus unforeseen write-offs related to this acquisition that may shake investor confidence. Fortunately, shares pay a dividend yielding 3.1%, so investors will still earn regular income while waiting patiently for the stock to go up.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The analysts at Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) see evidence of a turnaround taking shape, but remain concerned that Teva's generics business and pipeline aren't quite as robust as the firm would like.In taking a closer look at the analyst community's changing consensus, though, it's possible these professionals are quietly pointing toward more potential than most investors currently see in Teva stock. Disguised BullishnessBMO analyst Gary Nachman doesn't believe recent launches of Huntington's disease treatment Austedo and migraine treatment Ajovy will &quot;be enough to put the overall company on a solid growth trajectory,&quot; adding concern about the limited &quot;visibility on the generic pipeline, where we believe TEVA is behind its peers.&quot;  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 Still, there's enough potential in Teva Pharmaceuticals stock for BMO to initiate coverage on it, rating it a Market Perform … a call that leaves the door wide open to updated ratings in either direction.Nachman had a valid point, too, about the company's generics pipeline. From what can be gleaned about it, it's not necessarily scintillating.That's not exactly news though, to investors or to the company, or to other analysts for that matter. That's been a lingering problem at Teva to most professional and amateur observers.It may also be the groundwork for upgrades driven by the very pipeline BMO is concerned about.Even if unintentionally, most other analysts are doing the same. As of the latest look, the pros collectively rate TEVA stock at only a little better than a &quot;Hold&quot; but simultaneously sport a consensus price target of $20.50. That's 30% better than the stock's current price.  Click to EnlargeThe superficial mismatch isn't stunningly unusual; most stocks are priced below their consensus targets regardless of the collective buy/sell opinion on those names.This particular disparity, however, is also mismatched with the &quot;read between the lines&quot; rhetoric. Teva stock has been upgraded three times so far this year, with two new-coverage initiations at Hold that may be precursors to expected upgrades.If those upgrades are going to materialize, though, they're going to do so thanks to only a handful of names in the company's drug portfolio and pipeline. Identifying Growth DriversWhile its bench of drugs is deep, Teva's flagship product is multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.In its prime, Copaxone had no peers. It's past its prime though, largely thanks to generic alternatives that have hit the market just in the past couple of years. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) got the nod from the FDA in late 2017; Novartis (NYSE:NVS) is in the MS treatment race with its own version of Copaxone as well.Those rival drugs have taken a measurable toll. In 2016, Teva sold $4.2 billion worth of Copaxone, but that volume was almost halved to a little less than $2.4 billion last year.The bulk of the adverse impact of the generic multiple sclerosis treatment, however, is likely in the rearview mirror. Going forward, Teva shouldn't be fighting as much of a headwind on at least that one front.In the meantime, Ajovy and Austedo may be bigger growth drivers than BMO's Nachman is currently be letting on.Migraine drug Ajovy taps into a relatively underserved market. While Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)/Novartis are also in the same market with Emgality and Aimovig, respectively, analysts at Israel's IBI anticipates peak sales of between $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion for Teva's Ajovy. Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky forecasts peak sales of $1.3 billion for Austedo.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business That level of success, along with the rest of the company's portfolio and pipeline, should restore solid growth even as the benefit of Copaxone shrinks.Also keep an eye on subsidiary Anda, which saw sales growth of 26% last quarter, reaching $363 million.The upshot for owners of Teva stock is that it's crystal clear where growth needs to come from. It won't be difficult to see what's working, and what's not, given the relatively small portfolio and pipeline. Bottom Line on Teva StockAgain, without saying as much, most Teva stock analysts may be quietly expecting a respectable turnaround, but are thus far unwilling to say as much without more tangible proof it's taking shape.Analysts' careers don't just depend on quality analysis, but on being 'right' even if that standard is unspoken. These professionals may be cautiously leading investors to a marketwide conclusion that the forward-looking P/E of 6.0 for Teva stock is simply too cheap to pass up, given the potential -- even if not the assured promise -- of a turnaround.Undoubtedly though, the rhetoric about slowing Copaxone's deterioration and the growth of Austedo and Ajovy will help shape investors' and analysts' opinion. Investors would be wise to focus on those three drugs as a barometer of how the market feels about Teva stock.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-11,"Canadian-based marijuana company Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) soared earlier this year, but Cronos stock is falling back to earth as the frenzy dies down.Source: Shutterstock The rise in CRON stock mostly is attributable to interest from Altria (NYSE:MO). The owner of veteran cigarette brands Marlboro, Parliament, and Virginia Slims got into the game with a $1.8 billion investment in Cronos.At the time of transaction, Altria's $1.8 billion investment translated roughly to a 45% ownership of Cronos with warrants to own up to 55% of the company, which Altria has the option to exercise anytime in the next four years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Altria's controlling interest in Cronos takes place on the heels of two high-profile investments in marijuana stocks in 2018. Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), the maker of Corona and Modelo beer, was arguably the first-mover in sealing a deal for a 38% stake in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC).Late in the year, it was Switzerland-based Big Pharma company, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) that threw its hat in the cannabis ring, announcing a partnership with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY).As the above transactions show, suitors interested in investing in the cannabis sector run the gamut. From alcoholic beverage companies to large pharmaceutical companies and now to Big Tobacco. Many industries are already feeling the initial wave of marijuana legalization across certain states within the U.S. impact sales.Amidst declining sales, Altria was left then, with no choice but to get on the bandwagon. CRON Stock Hits the Big TimeLooking closer at the data though, in Altria's case there seems to have been a case of FOMO (fear of missing out). To begin with, publicly-traded cannabis companies on major U.S. are a recent novelty. Before, Canadian-listed marijuana stocks that wanted to appeal to the broader U.S. investor base were relegated to over-the-counter exchanges. This change has made these cannabis investments more palatable for shareholders.Because U.S. exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and tech-focused NASDAQ will not list companies that break U.S. federal law, U.S.-based cannabis companies find themselves at a disadvantage in raising capital compared to their northern counterparts. Marijuana is legal in Canada, so as long as these Canadian-based marijuana companies stick to operating there, they aren't violating any laws in the jurisdictions they operate in. While U.S. companies salivate over the kinds of money and high valuations that Canadian companies have gotten, the fact is that I can see a future in which U.S. competitors in the space no longer have to go to the Canadian TSX to raise money. Once they are able to list on U.S. Exchanges, companies interested in the cannabis space will have a larger pool of partners to choose from.Potentially, these partners will generate more synergies as well given their knowledge and scale within the domestic market.Before that future comes to pass, however, Altria may have felt that it was a do or die situation. MO seemed like to would be willing to pay any amount to get a toehold in the rapidly-growing cannabis sector. Altria Overpays for CRON StockWith CGC and TLRY already off the market, Altria jumped for CRON.There are certainly synergies across Altria's core business with cannabis than with beer. Still it is hard to justify paying a price to sales multiple of 267x (compare that to CGC's 86x).If we look at a less conventional metric: market capitalization to kilograms of cannabis sold, it gives an idea of the comparatively stratospheric valuation that Altria paid.Last fiscal year, CRON sold 2,737 kilograms of dry cannabis. Using an estimated price of $15 per share from when Altria announced the deal late last year and March of this year when they closed the deal and outstanding shares of 333 million, a market cap figure emerges of $5 billion. Do the division and Altria paid an estimated $1.8 million per kilogram of cannabis sold. Sound high?Doing the same exercise with CGC while adjusting for an earlier timeframe since the acquisition closed last year, I use trailing twelve months kilograms sold of 9,750 and 177 million outstanding shares. The result is $545,000 market capitalization/kilogram, less than a third of what Altria paid for CRON. The Final Word on CRON StockRight now, there are a lot of projects underway that will decide if the CRON investment is ultimately accretive. There is the much-touted supply agreement with Cura Cannabis Solutions, for example.Remember though, this five year take-or-pay supply agreement to purchase a minimum of 20,000 kilograms of cannabis per annum from Cronos can only take place after Cura receives all necessary licenses from Health Canada.There's also the potential 120-acre facility in Australia that is under review. If completed, the expected annual production capacity is 2,000 kilograms. And let's not forget the 850,000 sq. ft. Ontario-based greenhouse that is expected to have a 70,000 kilograms capacity.Overall, this is probably still a net positive for Altria shareholders as they'll benefit from the growth profile and exposure to cannabis. The price tag, however, will be hard to justify if CRON stock doesn't deliver on its growth projections.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-22,"When Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) won its first approval for cancer drug Ibrance back in February 2015, as a treatment for ER+/HER2- breast cancer, investors were cautiously optimistic. PFE stock holders knew it worked well enough for a narrow subset of breast cancer patients, but expectations for the then-nascent therapy were clearly high.Source: Maciek Lulko (Modified)The drug hasn't disappointed. Since early 2015, Ibrance has been approved for three more indications, with the most recent one taking shape just this month. As it turns out, the treatment has proven effective as a therapy for some of the rare cases where men develop breast cancer.It's a testament to the drug's incredible versatility and efficacy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd yet, while Ibrance is still in trials looking for even more approved uses, the company's future hardly hinges on what's quickly turning into a blockbuster drug. The market is largely overlooking much of Pfizer's pipeline. Catalysts AheadBank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Gerberry made the point of making the call three weeks ago, upping the brokerage firm's price target on PFE stock from $45 to $48 on upcoming catalysts related to the development of two orphan drugs.Orphan drugs, in short, take aim at underserved areas of the pharmaceutical market. In many cases there are so few cases of a particular illness that no pharmaceutical company bothers developing an option, so when one does, the FDA facilitates an easier path to approval; something is better than nothing.One such drug in Pfizer's pipeline is Vyndaqel.It's not a new drug. In fact, it was first approved back in 2011. Its potential use as a treatment for cardiomyopathy, however, is in the works, and is expected to launch later this year to a receptive caregiver environment.All told, BofA-ML's Gerberry sees peak sales of $2 billion for Vyndaqel.Gerberry also notes that a Pfizer gene therapy candidate -- PF-06939926 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy -- is closer to the endzone than many current and would-be owners of PFE stock may realize. Though in Phase 1 testing right now, should the R&D update slated for the middle of the year go as well as expected, the drugmaker may be able to leap straight to Phase 3 trials and catch up with a similar development from DMD rival Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT).  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Again, it's not only another catalyst that could draw a bullish crowd, but it's also a development that could put real revenue growth on the table real soon. The Duchenne muscular dystrophy market could be worth more than $4 billion by 2023.Outside of Gerberry's discussion, Pfizer's Vizimpro was approved earlier this month in Europe as a first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.Pfizer's still got its R&D, or at least its therapy-acquiring, chops. Heavy HittersThough PF-06939926 and Vyndaqel should prove to be solid bolt-on revenue and profit centers, there's still little doubt that Ibrance will be the company's heavy hitter -- and growth driver -- for the foreseeable future.As of the company's most recent quarterly report, 12-month revenue for the wonder drug reached $4.1 billion, up 32% from the trailing-12-month figure reported a year earlier. New approvals and expanded usage for previously approved indications both helped.The drug, though, has still only scratched the surface. Some analysts are calling for peak revenue of around $8 billion before Ibrance runs out of room to grow and is crimped by rival drugs.Again, that potential is a testament to the drug's flexibility.Ibrance isn't the only heavy-hitter still in growth mode in Pfizer's lineup though. While Enbrel (sold by Pfizer in Europe), Sutent and Celebrex may all be major names with declining revenue, sales of fibromyalgia treatment Lyrica appear to have stabilized around an annual pace of $4.6 billion. Ditto for pneumococcal bacteria treatment Prevnar, which has driven more than $5 billion in sales over the course of the past four reported quarters.In the meantime, Pfizer has started to shine in an area that had quietly gnawed at PFE stock owners… biosimilars. The company has sold $642 million worth of ulcerative colitis, arthritis and plaque psoriasis drug Inflectra/Remsima over the past year, up 50% year-over-year, and suggesting it doesn't have to yield to the pharmaceutical industry's biosimilar powerhouses like Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Pfizer's got five biosimilar drugs in the works, positioning it for deeper penetration of an admittedly-crowded market forecasted to be worth more than a stunning $60 billion by 2024. Bottom Line for PFE StockPFE stock is down 15% from its November peak, never really rebounding with the rest of the market beginning in January. Shares are down 10% just since early April, as the future of U.S. health care has become blurred by political rhetoric. Indeed, Pfizer stock hasn't made net progress since the middle of last year. Clearly there's something wrong with the company.Or, maybe there isn't.Though the headlines and sentiment seem dire, that pessimism is largely rooted in investors' collective view that sees a glass as half-empty rather than half-full. Pfizer's got a quietly potent pipeline, though, with a mix of already-approved and new drugs closer to wrapping up clinical trials than many investors might realize.That may not be enough to stave off headline-driven headwinds in the short run. But, there's a reason a streak of downgrades late last year has been countered this year with a couple of upgrades to an &quot;Outperform'&quot; rating.One of those upgrades came from Credit Suisse, with analyst Vamil Divan noting that patent woes working against aforementioned therapies like Enbrel and Celebrex are starting to abate at the same time new therapies are reaching their full stride.It's just a story not many investors are paying attention to right now.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned companies.

2019-04-30,"While the biotech sector saw early gains in 2019, the selling pressure has picked up steam recently as the government continued its scrutiny over the Medicare system and the pricing model for drugs. Not only are biotechnology stocks lower, but so are drug stores and drug plan suppliers. But this could be creating an interesting entry poinnt. Investors could invest in all of those sectors but the biotechnology stocks could prove the most rewarding.Biotechnology companies spend enormous amounts of money and time developing drugs. They will eventually prove to the government that rising product prices are a necessity in developing novel and better drugs. Should they succeed and a drug comes to market, everyone wins.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Patients who need the drug will have another treatment option. Drug plan providers may negotiate better prices and offerInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Biotech Stocks to Buy: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Source: Shutterstock Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) fell 14% on news that its competitor, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), secured a speedy review for brolucizumab for use in wet, age-related macular degeneration. In August 2018, the FDA approved Regeneron's marketing for Eylea. But if Novartis has a superior product, this could put pressure on one of Regeneron's major product lines.In 2018, Eylea sales topped $4.1 billion, up from $3.7 billion in 2017.Markets chose to ignore the ongoing success of Regeneron's Dupixent drug. In 2018, sales topped $922 million. The high efficacy and safety profile of the injectable drug will surely drive sales higher this year and beyond. Dermira (NASDAQ:DERM) may have announced good Phase 2b study results last month but the company is a long way away from releasing a competitive product. Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)Source: Shutterstock Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT) lost about one-third of its value from 52-week highs. Markets are still unhappy over the company's $350 million share offering announced in March. The company said that it would use the proceeds &quot;for the continuation and initiation of further clinical trials, commercialization, manufacturing, business development activities, including the potential licensing or acquisition of complementary products, technologies and entities.&quot;More recently, Sarepta presented a positive development in its gene therapy. With four patients involved in the age group of 4-7, the study met the primary end-point for safety. Secondary endpoints included a decrease in CK and a change in micro-dystrophin expression before and after treatment.In the fourth quarter, Sarepta reported revenue increasing 47.3% Y/Y to $84.4 million. Still, even though the company reported a loss of $2.05 a share (GAAP), EXONDYS 51 revenue for the year topped $301.1 million. The company's NDA filing for golodirsen with priority review and a PDUFA of August 19 is notable. Golodirsen advances Sarepta's RNA strategy. The drug is for patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Amenable to Skipping Exon 53.If the company receives approval, it would gain another 8% of the Duchenne community.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 In the fourth quarter, Sarepta tripled its R&D spending, to $146.2 million. $10.4 million of the costs in clinical and manufacturing expenses also include a ramp up in manufacturing activities for Golodirsen.Sarepta is scheduled to report first-quarter results on May 29, after market close. Incyte Corporation (INCY)Source: Eastern Washington University via Flickr (modified)Incyte Corporation's (NASDAQ:INCY) 14% monthly drop on the stock market, to a recent closing price of $73.52, should pique value investor interest. In the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue growing 25.2% to $468.4 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 40 cents.The markets may have a memory that is too short-term. In the quarter, it saw a growth of 22% from Jakafi, 19% from Iclusig and 28% growth in Jakavi royalties. Jakafi is used for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. Management forecast Jakafi sales of $1.58 billion to $1.65 billion in 2019. Olumiant is now adding meaningfully to the company's top-line results. The drug is used to treat adults with moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.Incyte forecasts the royalty revenue for both Jakavi and Olumiant growing by around 20%. Overall, sales are expected to grow by between 14% and 19% in 2019.Management is confident that its rich product portfolio will accelerate revenue growth. Already, top-line growth is due to revenue growth exceeding expense growth.Incyte's strong balance sheet, with cash growing to $1.4 billion last year, gives the company the flexibility to develop products. Pursuing Phase 1 products will take a few years to pay off. Investors who are patient and buy and hold INCY stock will get rewarded if these projects are successful. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Source: Shutterstock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) traded in a narrow range of between $180-$190 for most of 2019, only to fall below $168 in recent sessions. Investors may be getting nervous over its valuation, where its forward P/E is 28 times.Vertex grows through investing in transformative medicines that offer a benefit, regardless of modality. It develops drugs for cystic fibrosis while expanding its pipeline. In 2018, it initiated clinical development of CRISPR-Cas9 treatment in Beta -Thalassemia and Sickle cell disease. This year, it aims to advance one or more compounds from research into clinical development.Vertex reported revenue from the CF product line topping $3.04 billion in 2018, up from $2.17 billion in 2017. The company saw a sharp increase in the number of patients being treated by its approved medicines. The launch of Symdeko in the U.S. and multiple label expansions for Kalydeco and Orkambi also added meaningfully to results.In 2019 and beyond, the company forecasts that with a triple combination regimen, it has the potential to increase treatment from ~44,000 to ~68,000 worldwide.Non-GAAP operating income also grew sharply, from $564 million in 2017 to $1.11 billion in 2018. For 2019, Vertex forecasts operating income of $1.35 billion.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now The 15 analysts who cover VRTX stock have, according to Tipranks, $209 price target, which implies the stock could rise by 23% in the next year. Investors should look at Vertex after the stock's recent drop. Bluebird bio (BLUE)Source: Shutterstock Bluebird bio (NASDAQ:BLUE) fell about 12% in the last week alone, on no company-specific news. Just as markets quickly forgot the strong quarterly earnings report for the other biotech stocks mentioned, investors did the same with BLUE stock.Bluebird expects LentiGlobin in TDT, a gene therapy, to win approval in 2019. But the company said the launch will be country-by-country progressive in Europe. The upside of this approach is that the company will not commit any major hiccups on the launch. The downside is that the revenue growth from sales will be slow. However, this should not concern investors who have a long-term time horizon in mind.Last December 2018, the company presented new data for LentiGlobin in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT). It also discussed results for its Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study. And in November 2018, it completed enrollment for its Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bb2121 in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.Bluebird ended the fourth quarter with $1.9 billion in cash equivalents and marketable securities. With the most recent cash raise of $600.6 million in July 2018, the company is unlikely to issue any more shares in the short-term. Instead, the company may invest prudently in its clinical studies to advance drug development. Any good news from these studies will drive the stock price back to yearly highs.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-16,"Cannabis company Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) desperately needed a win with Tuesday's release of its first quarter of 2019 earnings report. Not only is Tilray stock down more than 38% since the end of March, the share price is only one-sixth of its peak value from September of last year.Source: Shutterstock It got the win. Although the net loss per share widened year-over-year, revenue almost tripled. The top line also topped analyst estimates.Perhaps the biggest driver behind Wednesday's initial gain, however, was the discussion of Tilray's growth prospects. Already partnering with beverage giant Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) to create cannabis-infused drinks, Tilray stock has massive potential. Company CEO Brendan Kennedy fueled those fires, commenting during the conference call about being &quot;inundated&quot; with partnership requests from Fortune 500 companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Still, significant challenges remain, spurring a sharp reversal of Wednesday's initial rally in the TLRY stock price. TLRY Earnings RecapTilray wasn't the only name to report last quarter's earnings on Tuesday. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) did as well.Tilray was decidedly the better performer of the two, however. As evidence, Tilray stock gained nearly 5% on Tuesday and was up another couple of percentage points early on Wednesday. ACB stock rallied about as well as TLRY stock did on Tuesday but unwound those gains and more on Wednesday.The market celebrated Tilray's sales. The company's top line of $23.0 million, even adjusted downward to $21.5 million to account for excise taxes, still topped the consensus outlook of $20.16 million. The adjusted loss of 27 cents per share of TLRY stock, while much worse than the 7-cent loss per share in the year-ago quarter, essentially met analysts' consensus target.Gross margins improved sequentially, from 20% to 23%. However, they were well off the 50% level seen during Q1 2018, before Canada had legalized recreational marijuana.The volatile margins figure reflects investments made in cultivation facilities and accounting rules about inventory valuations. To meet demand, Tilray is buying marijuana from third-party suppliers. This costs the company more than it would to grow that supply itself. That third-party supply, though, may not be a high-quality leaf.Expenses related to the acquisitions of Manitoba Harvest also took a toll on profitability.When all was said and done though, investors couldn't get over the subtle but telling shift in selling prices. While sales volume more than doubled to 3,012 kilograms, the average selling price fell from $5.94 per gram a year ago to $5.60 per gram last quarter. That slide at least partially reflects the ongoing commoditization of marijuana. Unfortunately, this trend will continue to drive prices lower until only the cost-conscious, high-scale players are left. Perspective Required for TLRY StockTake last quarter's numbers for Tilray stock with a grain of salt, for better or worse. It, like all other marijuana stocks, represents a moving target for several reasons.One of them is the simple fact that the cannabis market in Canada is new. Prior to October, there was no legal adult-use revenue to report.The purchase of Manitoba Harvest also added food sales of $5.6 million to the mix, but only for part of the quarter. It's also arguable that Tilray may be able to better distribute Manitoba's goods better than Manitoba could on its own. If so, it could set the stage for tremendous growth going forward.One area where Tilray is lacking is its international exposure. Overseas sales only totaled $1.8 million last quarter. The right tweaks, however, could readily change that for the better.Still, Tilray boasts some of the primo deals with major names. Aside from the Anheuser Busch partnership, Tilray has inked a supply deal with pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NYSE:NVS). Both could be game-changers once their upsides are fully realized. But it could take several quarters for either large company to decide what they want with their cannabis journey.Selling more marijuana at ever-shrinking prices isn't necessarily a big step in the right direction.Whatever the case, Tilray's most immediate problem is clear. &quot;Our growth internationally and in Canada continue to be limited by lack of supply that we expect to improve over time,&quot; explained Tilray Chief Financial Officer Mark Castaneda during the earnings conference call. The company believes it could take up to two more years before supply and demand find an equilibrium. It remains to be seen where the TRLY stock price will stabilize once that equilibrium is met. Looking Ahead for Tilray StockTLRY shares may have initially shot higher in response to first-quarter earnings, but the bounce appears almost pre-planned. It was poised to take shape no matter what due to the sheer severity of the selloff leading into Tuesday's news. Little revealed about the quarter implies much has actually changed since the end of Q4. Everything has just scaled up, including the loss, and the bears were relentless.Those same bears dug in again on Wednesday, recognizing that simply selling marijuana doesn't ensure meaningful or even modest profitability.That's also true of rival marijuana companies, by the way. The entire industry is spending huge sums of money to garner a piece of a market that may not justify the expenditures.Though he was speaking of the decision to establish more capacity rather than arrange for more cultivation, Kennedy's comment about believing &quot;all the hype 18 months ago&quot; rang out alarmingly. He essentially summarized the hype surrounding the cannabis market for the past year-and-a-half.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-17,"After a revenue beat Tilray Inc (NASDAQ:TLRY) saw its stock jump 5% for the day. However, that optimism has faded rather quickly, and Tilray stock has not been able to capitalize on that momentum.Source: Shutterstock Unequivocally, it has been a wild ride for Tilray investors. Last fall, against a very frothy overall market and marijuana stocks going more mainstream, the stock price exceeded the $200 mark before getting cut down by three quarters, trading at less than $50 per share as of this writing.  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal Still though, I remain cautious on Tilray stock. The company hit a major milestone by landing a partnership with Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), the Swiss pharmaceutical company, late last year. That's certainly been a positive catalyst, but after all the hype, investors need to see meaningful progress toward a more profitable future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tilray Stock Has a Mixed First QuarterA lot of the focus immediately after earnings was around revenues. TLRY delivered a massive 195 increase in year-over-year revenues. The legalization of marijuana use in Canada for adults last year in addition to hemp food sales from Tilray's acquisition of Manitoba Harvest were big drivers.Gross margins also saw a slight increase, but despite these positive signs, net losses for the quarter increased dramatically. Last quarter $5 million to $30 million most recently. For a growth company, it's not necessarily unexpected. Expansion costs money as companies need to lay the foundation for future endeavors, but the point is that it's naive to look only at the revenue beat and think TLRY stock is headed for the sky.Total kilogram equivalents sold did double to 3,012 kilograms, but compare that to fellow competitor Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) that sold 10,102 kilogram equivalents in the most recent quarter and has a higher pricing structure.TLRY is still doesn't have pricing figured out seeing as average net selling price per gram decreased over the prior year period. As the space gets more and more competitive, TLRY needs to optimize this quickly as increasing supply toward medical and consumer purposes will put pressure on prices. The trend is not going in the right direction. Tilray Stock Is OvervaluedUltimately, TLRY stock looks lofty in terms of valuation. This, of course, does not mean the stock cannot get more expensive from here, but it's not a screaming buy despite some decent first quarter numbers.Tilray's consensus forward P/E is the kind of number that makes you triple check because you don't think it can be right: 1,111x. Compare that 357x for CGC. It's a relative game with P/E ratios, so even though 357x may also sound extraordinarily rich, it goes to show that 1,111x is completely irrational.There is just so many ways for that multiple to get rerated downward, again and again. Final Note on Tilray StockThe first quarter earnings was a bit of a mixed bag. The market gave credit where it was due but no more than that, recognizing the weak points in the financials.Tilray has made progress on expansion via M&A, which may bolster future earnings, but only time will tell. There is a lot of success already built into the current valuation, meaning that TLRY can't miss a beat.

2019-05-20,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in April 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Marijuana stocks are all the rage these days as legalized cannabis has hit the scene. Analysts now project that the market for both medical and recreational cannabis use will reach a staggering $200 billion in global sales in just five years. As a result, stocks in the sector have surged on the wave of optimism.The problem is, marijuana stocks aren't exactly a slam dunk.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMany are fraught with some big-time risks, hefty volatility, zero profits, etc. At this point, many marijuana stocks are just speculative bets. They could pay off or they could crash and burn. But one thing many of the top cannabis stocks do have is partners. Specifically, major corporate partners that are as far from speculative plays as you can get.It's here that more conservative investors can cash in on the marijuana stock mania and benefit from everything it has to offer. Sure, these stocks won't rise as much as some of the pure marijuana stocks. But, you know what? They won't fall as much either and they'll still be able to reap potential billions in revenues derived from cannabis.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) With that, here are the three top partners of the marijuana stocks and why they are good stocks to buy. Constellation Brands (STZ)Source: Shutterstock Seemingly overnight, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) become one of the biggest marijuana stocks out there. That's thanks to its big partnership with Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). For a cool $4 billion, STZ purchased a 38% stake in Canopy last year. The firm now owns warrants that would allow it own a majority stake in 2021.The end game for STZ is pretty simple. Marijuana would be a perfect &quot;fourth leg of a stool&quot; to the company's beer, wine, and spirits operations. Constellation owns over 100 world class beverage brands including Corona beer, Svedka Vodka, and Robert Mondavi wines. These are highly regulated consumer products. The end goal is for STZ to do the same with cannabis. That is, apply its vast branding knowledge and distribution network to get various pot products into the hands of the masses.Constellation has already started working with Canopy on cannabis-infused drinks. At the same time, it's looking to parlay is vast marketing knowledge into other cannabis areas such as edibles and other consumable products. These can and will all be major sources of revenues once the switch is flipped and full legalization happens.In the meantime, STZ is no slouch with regards to what it already generates money on and its recently undergone some moves to shore up its balance sheet and pay for CGC purchase. This allows it to be a safer play than any of the marijuana stocks. Novartis (NVS)Source: Shutterstock One of the main reasons why marijuana stocks have surged so far has been the growing use of medical marijuana and cannabis treatments. Demand in that area has already begun to surge, and it could grow further as doctors look for alternatives to addictive opioids for pain relief.International drug giant Novartis (NYSE:NVS) saw the writing on the wall and decided that it needed to get into the cannabis game. This prompted it to partner with major grower Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY).That partnership allows for NVS division Sandoz to develop and distribute TLRY's medical marijuana in legal jurisdictions around the world. With the deal, Tilray is able to tap into Novartis' vast distribution network and will allow TLRY to help commercialize its non-smokable/noncombustible medical cannabis products. For NVS, it's able to collect fees and revenues from sales. Moreover, the deal allows it to co-brand some products to help enhance sales further.For both partners, the deal seems like a win-win. NVS gets its hands-on fast-growing medical marijuana, while Tilray can actually sell its products to more consumers. Given how good the deal is, both firms decided to expand more on those partnerships and look into developing new cannabis-related drugs.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) The win for investors by choosing NVS over TLRY is that you get the backing of one of the largest drug manufacturers on the planet.   Altria (MO)Source: Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)Big Tobacco has been eyeballing legalized cannabis sales for what seems like decades, so it's no surprise that cigarette-king Altria (NYSE:MO) would be looking at the marijuana stocks for a partnership. That came from a $1.8 billion investment in pot grower Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON). MO now has a 45% stake in the firm.Traditional cigarette sales continue to fall and MO has been looking for ways to expand its portfolio and reduce potential revenue loss. This helps explain its major purchase of vaping specialist Juul Labs. Its CRON buy helps expand on that vaping tech.Speculation has already begun that Altria could fill Juul Pods with CBD once pot is legal everywhere or add it to its other vaping/e-cigarette brands. Meanwhile, MO's huge production facilities could instantly be flipped towards smokable marijuana products. The deal also allows for CRON to co-develop new products that could be sold on Altria's large network. Together, it gives Altria an instant foothold in a growing business.And that's important for the firm. Potentially, it gives Big Tobacco a way to really reduce its multi-year declines. Last quarter again, Altria managed to miss analysts' consensus  sales estimates.Meanwhile, investors buying MO over other marijuana stocks getsplenty of stability, profits and a hefty 5.93% dividend yield.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the marijuana stocks mentioned.

2019-05-23,"Even among marijuana stocks. a volatile bunch, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) has been the ultimate roller coaster. Tilray stock IPOed in the U.S. last August at $17 per share. &#92;By the beginning of September, TLRY stock price was crossing $50 per share. Incredibly, over the next two weeks, it spiked to as much as $300 per share. Since then, it's been all downhill. TLRY stock fell back to $100 in October. It slid to around $75 by year-end. In April, Tilray stock crossed the $50 mark, and it's now fallen under $45.Can anything stop Tilray's slide? The main issue, at least at this point, has been that Tilray's business execution has been extremely lackluster. Sure, the $300 peak price for Tilray stock was crazy. But  Tilray stock  need not have crashed quite this far.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend  Tilray's Earnings ReportSome TLRY stock bulls looked at its first-quarter earnings report as a positive. Tilray stock rose for a short time following the release.It's not hard to see why. Its revenues surged from $7.8 million in Q1 of 2018 to $23 million last quarter. That was well ahead of expectations; analysts, on average, were expecting closer to $20 million. On the income side, the company's losses widened, and they were not better than the consensus outlook. But like so many marijuana companies, TLRY's focus is on scaling up its revenues for the time being.But this report was underwhelming in other ways. The annualized revenue rate was around $100 million, which still leaves Tilray stock trading at an exorbitant price/sales ratio. And much of the revenue growth came from non-organic growth after Manitoba Harvest, which TLRY acquired in February, began contributing to Tilray's results. Further, it's worth looking at the company's whole business, as not everything is booming. Its medical marijuana sales, for example, were merely flat year over year. Losing Its Leadership PositionThe earnings report was hardly a home run. In fact,  it shows just how far Tilray's star has fallen. The company now has low-to-mid-single-digit-percentage- market share in the Canadian recreational space. That puts it outside of Canada's top five players.Less than a year ago, TLRY was duking it out with Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) for the largest market cap among marijuana stocks. Now TLRY stock price has shriveled, and it has failed to turn last year's excitement into a leading position in the Canadian pot market.Importantly, Tilray failed to lock in a key partnership with a big backer from the alcohol or tobacco industries. This has given rivals like Canopy and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON), which did make such deals,  a big advantage compared with Tilray.TLRY did sign a deal with Novartis (NYSE:NVS) to collaborate globally on medical marijuana distribution. This partnership, signed late last year, is certainly better than nothing. But it's a far cry from the large equity cash infusions and distribution deals that other, bigger players have been able to obtain. Slower Progress by Design?Earlier this year, TLRY CEO Brendan Kennedy made some interesting comments. He said on the company's Q4 earnings conference call that: &quot;We will not purchase or invest in what we believe to be overpriced supply assets in Canada, which we believe will erode in value in the medium to long term, as the market normalizes.&quot; That's a reasonable position. Supply has already exceeded demand in some legal markets in the United States. And in the long run, there's little to constrain the output of commodity marijuana producers.Still, however, the owners of Tilray stock are going to demand more progress. People need Tilray to grow  rapidly before they can get excited about TLRY stock again. So far, the company hasn't done enough to stand out from the pack. The Verdict on Tilray StockTilray's major shareholder, Privateer Holdings, announced earlier this year that it wouldn't sell any TLRY stock in the first half of 2019. That was huge news, as Privateer holds 75 million shares of Tilray stock. Even with the bad  performance of Tilray stock lately, that stake is still worth more than $3 billion. But it was worth more than $12 billion at one point.How long will Privateer, which owns the majority of Tilray, be willing to watch its stake keep shriveling away? It said it wouldn't sell any stock in the first half of 2019, but that limitation expires in less than two months. If Privateer starts selling shares, TLRY stock price could fall much lower.As it is, the company's last earnings report showed real progress. But it also showed just how far away Tilray is from being a leading marijuana company at the moment. The company has to do far more to justify even a $50 share price, let alone its former highs.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-24,"It was a quiet trading session on Friday, with U.S. stocks rising modestly ahead of a three-day holiday weekend. Will we see more selling pressure next week or will positive trade talk give stocks a lift? When one tweet can move the market, it's impossible to say. So let's look at a few top stock trades out there. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Roku  Click to Enlarge The other day we opted to cover PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) over Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), but promised to look at the stock on Friday. Well, here we are and this beast has gotten even stronger. Shares are up more than 6% on the day and have risen above $95. The run has been nothing short of amazing.We've been pounding the table on Roku, calling it a buy in Q4 and Q1. Now it's almost up to $100 a share. Should you get long now?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNo. Shares are up more than 70% in about five weeks. It has almost quadrupled from its December lows (not that it deserved to be that low in the first place). But the point is still the same: you've missed the boat.I love ROKU over the long term, but to think that we won't see sub-$95 prices again is absurd. With the stock overbought in the short-term and coming into possible resistance, hedging and/or taking some profits doesn't seem like a bad idea at this point … at least until lower prices come around. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Splunk  Click to Enlarge Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is going splat, falling 7% on Friday after reporting earnings. The move forced a test of the 200-day moving average, which held as support.Aggressive bulls who feel compelled to go long SPLK stock can do so against Friday's low.I would love a lower open near the 200-day on Tuesday that quickly reclaims Friday's close and goes green. Preferably, SPLK would also reclaim the 50% retracement at $120.78 in the process.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer If it falls under Friday's low, SPLK can go even lower. On a rally, we need to see if it can climb back to Friday's highs near $130, and/or the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Autodesk  Click to Enlarge  Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is off by more than 5% on Friday after disappointing earnings results. Shares are bouncing off that $157.50 to $158 area, but are now meaningfully below the 50-day moving average for the first time since early January.Below $155.56 -- the 38.2% retracement -- aggressive bulls who are getting long on Friday's decline may want to consider stepping out. It would put ADSK below several key support levels and suggest that sellers have not yet exhausted themselves. In that case, look for a possible test of the 200-day.Reclaiming the 50-day would repair some of the damage, but beware that this level may act as resistance. That would give short-sellers an entry, with a retest of the $158 area in mind. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Novartis  Click to Enlarge Novartis (NYSE:NVS) stock is up almost 4% after getting approval for its $2 million-plus gene therapy treatment.The move has NVS hitting new highs in Friday's session. The stock has been largely limited by channel resistance and buoyed by channel support. As it hits channel resistance, we'll have to watch to see if NVS will break out to a new range, or be limited in upside as a result.As long as $84.50 to $85 holds as support, NVS looks good to buy on the dips.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-29,"Marijuana stocks are hot these days. And there's a good reason why. As Canada and several U.S. states have legalized cannabis for both recreational and medical use, the sector has plenty of potential. In fact, some analysts think that by 2025, the cannabis sector could grow to be a $146 billion industry. That means it will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% from today. Naturally, many start-ups and early stage marijuana stocks have jumped into the fray to take advantage of that growth.But the truth is, many of the winners in the cannabis sector are already here and cooking. Thanks to their really early mover status, growing moats and big deals, several marijuana stocks are already emerging as winners in the surging industry. The reality is, investors may not need to dabble in penny stocks and up-listed pot stocks. The only three marijuana stocks you need to own are already here.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June With that said, here are the three real winners in the cannabis sector.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Marijuana Stocks to Buy: GW Pharmaceuticals PLC- ADR (GWPH)Source: Shutterstock One of the biggest uses of cannabis continues to be for medicinal purposes. There are plenty of marijuana stocks out there looking at using the power of cannabis to cure and treat various ailments. But only GW Pharmaceuticals PLC- ADR (NASDAQ:GWPH) has an approval under its belt.Last summer, GWPH received approval for its cannabinoid drug Epidiolex, which is used to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. An approval is an impressive feat for any biotech firm, let alone for marijuana stocks. The drug was officially launched in November and it was off to the races for GWPH stock. Year-to-date, shares are now up around 86%.And it looks like the gains could keep coming for GW Pharmaceuticals.Prescriptions of Epidiolex have surged in its first quarter of issuance and physicians seem to love the medication. GWPH stock generated more than $33.5 million in sales of the drug during the first quarter. Meanwhile, the biotech has been able to pivot the drug successfully in other trials. A phase III trial for Epidiolex in treating seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex has proved to be amazing so far. All in all, GW Pharmaceuticals may have a true blockbuster on its hands. The end market for treating epilepsy is just that massive and the firm should be able to pivot its medicine accordingly.For investors looking at marijuana stocks in the medical sector, GWPH is a sure thing. Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC)Source: Shutterstock Given that it's a budding industry, those marijuana stocks with big partnerships are more likely to succeed these days. And no one has been racking up deals faster and better than leading cannabis firm Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC).First of all, CGC is a massive grower of pot. This scale provides it plenty of potential to serve other, larger, more established corporations. And that's just what Canopy has done. The firm's $4 billion deal with beverage and spirit maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ ) set the industry standard. The duo has already started working on cannabis-infused drinks as well as edibles and other consumable products.The deal also provided CGC plenty of cash to grow and make acquisitions of its own. CGC has smartly moved into the pet care arena via a deal with Martha Stewart. Meanwhile, a buyout of U.S.-focused Acreage Holdings will give it instant access to pot here at home when it legalized for recreational use.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement With these major partnerships in tow, CGC has already cemented itself as the top player among the marijuana stocks. It has the scale, partnerships and cash available to actually make the cannabis dream a reality. For investors, it may be the only pot stock you need. Tilray (TLRY)Source: Shutterstock If Canopy is a play on recreational marijuana use, than leading cannabis stock Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) could be a play on the growing medical use around the world. Medical marijuana and cannabis treatment demand has already begun to surge in many locations. That's because doctors look for alternatives to addictive opioids for pain relief. TLRY is on the leading edge of that trend, as one of the largest medical dispensaries around.And it's only getting bigger.TLRY has partnered with major pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NYSE:NVS ). Through its Sandoz division, TRLY is able to tap into one of the largest pharmaceutical distribution networks in the world as well as provide guidance on how to navigate these various regulatory environments. Having a Novartis stamp on your medical products certainly can go a long way with doctors and consumers using medical marijuana. As a result, Tilray has been able to export its weed to far off places like the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and parts of South America.All of this has shown up in the firm's torrid revenue growth. Last quarter, sales at Tilray surged a blistering 195%. With its focus on being the global leader and having a major pharma stock in its corner, further sales and profits could be had.In the end, TLRY could be the best of the marijuana stocks when it comes to being a major medical player.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

2019-05-30,"This is the time of year when stocks are sleepy at best, and at worst, prone to pullbacks.That's not necessarily true of all equities, however. Some groups are very active and perform quite well in the summer months. Pharmaceutical stocks - and especially biotech stocks - fare pretty well this time of year.Part of that cyclical strength stems from how the Food and Drug Administration schedules key decision-making dates for new drugs. Another part of it may be the result of recurring industry conferences, where many drug-development updates are unveiled.Here are 11 biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies to watch over the next few months. Because biotechnology companies' shares tend to hinge heavily on product updates, this seasonal tide of news could move their respective stocks well before (and even long after) the day the news is posted. Just be cautious; smaller biotechnology stocks with one or just a couple of trial products can move drastically on new data - for better or for worse.

2019-06-05,"Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has been rangebound for awhile, but things are brewing in the industry that could help Canopy stock break out of its current range.Source: Shutterstock All the cannabis companies continue to make strides on the M&A front, positively impacting production volumes and overseas footprints. In particular, many of the news releases have been medical-related. After all, cannabis is viewed by many has having the largest market potential in the medical field.So, it was not a big surprise when Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), a large global pharmaceutical company, was one of the first to invest in growing Canadian cannabis companies after they were able to list on major U.S. stock exchanges when they took controlling interest in Tilray Inc (NASDAQ:TLRY).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, the medical opportunity is massive, but Tilray competitor Canopy Growth has been aggressively pursuing a multi-pronged approach that inherently diversifies the future revenue streams. CGC's vision for THC as an ingredient in an array of consumer products separates them from an increasingly crowded industry.  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge As a result of the company's innovative thinking, CGC is expanding the total addressable market when other companies are merely operating within the confines of conventional cannabinoid products. This is a strategy that should serve it well both in the short and long-term.Canopy stock has not been immune to the selloff in May, down almost 16 percent over the last month. However, it has faired far better than Tilray stock for example, which is down over 50 percent over the same period. It is a testament to better fundamentals and long-term prospects across multiple industries that CGC stock has weathered the correction much better than its peers. Cannabis as an IngredientIt bears repeating that cannabis as an ingredient in consumer products is pretty revelatory. Beyond vaping and pharmaceutical products, there has yet to be a major player truly re-imagining the future of cannabis. Enter Canopy Growth.They are a leader if not the leader in the Canadian medical market but also recognize the huge global market opportunity in consumer products. From sleep aids to beverages (alcoholic and athletic) and other health and wellness products, Canopy appears to believe that the sky really is the limit.Per the company, consumer products offer a $250 billion market opportunity. Just a few slices of that pie would do wonders for Canopy stock price.Right now, there are multiple human health clinical trials and animal health trials underway. Any positive news would be a catalyst for Canopy stock. And with the acquisition of Spectrum Therapeutics, it allows CGC to expand into the supplement business that complements the existing soft-gel business exceedingly well.The recent acquisition of This Works, takes CGC another step closer to realizing the latent potential in the wellness market. The Works Acquisition and Canopy Stock  In late May, CGC acquired This Works for a CDN $74 million. They market themselves as a skincare and wellness company, but it is clear from their product lineup that they have a broader array of consumer products that CGC can benefit from.It is the sleep solution products and loyal customer base that have me excited about the prospects of the two company's integration. Right now, This Works is known for its deep sleep pillow spray, which they have sold 4.2 million of across Europe, the United Kingdom, China and the United States since launching in 2011.Not only does CGC improve its presence in the UK, but this collaboration also sets the stage for accelerated product development for a line of skincare and sleep solution products infused with CBD.It may be too early to say whether or not CBD has the potential to disrupt the cosmetic business, but the sleep solution industry is ripe for CGC to make its presence felt. As products start to gain traction in This Works' existing markets, this should be a big positive for CGC.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09,"Over the last few months, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) appears to have broken from its downward trend. With a large shareholder choosing to keep stock in lock-up, a lower than anticipated supply of shares helped to propel Tilray stock.Source: Shutterstock Unfortunately, with little else to provide a catalyst, the recent move higher looks like a temporary interruption in its decline from the bubble territory of last September. TLRY Began to Recover in JuneI have long urged investors to avoid Tilray stock. Back in April, when the stock traded at about $60 per share, I reiterated this advice as lockouts preventing insiders from selling had expired. By early June, TLRY had fallen into the mid $30s per share level.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Since then, it has seen a slight recovery and currently trades at around $47 per share. As our own Tom Taulli mentioned, TLRY seems to have traded on the overall supply of available shares.The Tilray news that probably helped it move up revolved around Privateer Holdings. Privateer, Tilray's largest shareholder, agreed to extend a lock-up provision on 75 million shares to two years.Despite this recent recovery, the stock still has fallen more than 84% since the $300 per share high of last September. Year-to-date, it has lost nearly one-third of its value. Even after that steep drop, TLRY still trades at about 80 times sales.This does not make Tilray stock unique among marijuana equities. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) sells at about the same price-to-sales (PS) ratio. It might even look inexpensive compared to the approximate 338 PS ratio of Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON). Tilray's Multiple MattersHowever, despite the modest recovery, TLRY shows us one thing--even with hot stocks just as TLRY, fundamentals still matter. That does not mean that Tilray's PS ratio is going to the current S&P 500 average of about 2.2.Nor does it mean it will come close to the S&P's current price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just above 22 when it becomes profitable. Assuming Tilray survives in its current form, I think TLRY is years away from either scenario.However, to continue to justify its higher multiple, it has to move on prospects not yet priced into TLRY stock. The decline in recent months hinges on the fact that it no longer sees those new markets and lines of business.The only near-term prospect I see involves the one mentioned by my colleague, James Brumley. He noted that Tilray has begun to export cannabidiol (CBD) to the U.K. Britain has legalized the sale, but not the production of CBD products.Still, while that could give TLRY a near-term boost, I would not count on that prohibition on production remaining in place long term. Partnerships with Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) in 2018. But that was 2018.Worse for Tilray stock, investors have more choices. More countries continue to legalize. The market price of marijuana continues to fall steadily in its home market.Given these factors, I see nothing on the horizon that can send TLRY higher. As gravity begins to take a stronger hold on the equity, it becomes increasingly likely it will mostly move in a downward direction. The Bottom Line on Tilray StockThe recent reprieve in the long decline in Tilray stock will likely not last. Over the last month, Tilray stock moved higher by almost 20% as its largest shareholder chose to keep more shares from hitting the open market.Unfortunately, fundamentals have begun to catch up to TLRY. With cannabis prices falling, competition increasing, and prospects for added growth diminishing, the 80-plus sales multiple has become more difficult to justify.Revenue growth remains robust, and Tilray should remain one of the larger companies in Canadian cannabis. However, with TLRY at its current valuation, investors should either look at market leader Canopy Growth or hold out for a lower price.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-10,"It looks like there is no end is sight to the EpiPen shortage and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) stock is taking a beating Wednesday on the news.Source: Shutterstock Recent statements from the company note that it continues to expect the EpiPen shortage to continue. This is leaving many parents without a way to purchase the medicine as they prepare for the next school season to begin.The reason behind the EpiPen shortage is that the company had production issues back in 2017. Following these problems, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) announced that there was a shortage of the devices in the following year. The FDA still has EpiPens listed as in short supply.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo what exactly can parents do to get around the EpiPen shortage? There's always the option of going with the generic version of the drug, which is also made by Mylan. The FDA does not list this one as being limited in supply.Another option that parents may want to consider are rival products. This includes those made by Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) or Novartis (NYSE:NVS). However, there are concerns about the difference in using these devices and them not being as recognizable as normal EpiPens, reports Bloomberg.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 The Novartis option may be the best one for parents on a budget.

2019-07-18,By Geoffrey Smith,StockBeat: A Sea of Red as Earnings Live Down to Expectations
2019-07-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Novartis AG raised its earnings outlook for the second time this year, driving the shares to an all-time high, and said the launch of its $2.1 million gene therapy is on track despite concerns over coverage barriers.Earnings excluding some items are expected to increase by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage this year, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said. Novartis previously forecast a high single-digit percentage increase. The stock climbed as much as 3.4% in Zurich.The Swiss drugmaker also boosted its outlook for sales, new medicines and the Sandoz generics unit as Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan work to reshape the company’s strategy begins to pay off. Narasimhan has spun off the Alcon eye-care division, ditched a stake in a consumer-health venture and unveiled a series of acquisitions after taking the helm early last year.Novartis at the same time has sought to sharpen its focus on cutting-edge drugs for cancer and rare illnesses, rolling out products like gene therapy Zolgensma aimed at a devastating muscle disease. Approved in the U.S. in May, the treatment has experienced “strong uptake,” Narasimhan told reporters.While analysts have flagged restrictions with U.S. health-care providers, the CEO said on a call that the launch is progressing in line with expectations. Novartis has contracts with insurers covering about 40% of patients with commercial health plans, Narasimhan said. The company said in May it expected to have 30% coverage in the first month after approval. He added that four state Medicaid plans have Zolgensma coverage in place.Nearly all patients who have sought the therapy and are eligible based on the drug’s label “have achieved an approval to be treated with the medicine after the appropriate steps are taken,” he said. “We’re continuing to advance our efforts, both getting medical policies in place and contracts in place with key payers.”Novartis shares have climbed about 24% this year, doubling the gain in the Bloomberg index that tracks European pharma companies.Novartis also has set aside about $700 million for a potential settlement in a U.S. case involving allegations it paid kickbacks to doctors who prescribed its drugs. A letter made public last month said the parties had made “significant progress” on reaching a deal.Psoriasis treatment Cosentyx, poised to become the company’s top seller this year after a 25% sales boost last quarter, is also in focus amid rising competition in the immunology field.Novartis already raised its profit forecast in April, saying it expected earnings excluding some items to increase by a high single-digit percentage. At the time it left its sales outlook unchanged. Sales are now expected to grow by a mid to high-single digit percentage.To contact the reporter on this story: James Paton in London at jpaton4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, John LauermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Novartis’s Brightened Outlook Pushes Shares to All-Time High
2019-07-18,"Novartis boss Vas Narasimhan raised full-year targets on Thursday and announced that $700 million has been set aside in the hope of settling a decade-old lawsuit alleging that the Swiss drugmaker bribed U.S. doctors.  Shares in the company rose about 5% to their highest since 2015, buoyed by second-quarter results, earnings guidance and the prospect of avoiding trial in a case that began in 2011 as a whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former employee.  The lawsuit, since joined by the U.S. government, contends that Novartis paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to doctors so they would prescribe its products, including hypertension treatment Lotrel and diabetes drug Starlix.","Novartis raises full-year targets, aims to settle U.S. lawsuit"

2019-07-23,"Earnings were well above the consensus forecast on Wall Street, and management raised its forecast for 2019 revenue.","Biogen’s Earnings Beat Forecasts, but 1 Key Drug Fell Short"
2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Biogen Inc. raised its financial forecast for the year after topping second-quarter sales and earnings estimates, but the good news masks a worrying longer-term outlook for the biotechnology giant.Part of the reason why the company was able to boost guidance Tuesday was due to lower spending on research. Biogen stopped a late-stage trial of an Alzheimer’s drug in March, a failure that has sent its shares into a monthslong slump. That drug was the most watched of its experimental therapies.In the pharmaceutical industry, spending on R&D is an expensive necessity. While a drug’s failure may temporarily improve the bottom line thanks to lower costs, it’s disastrous for long-term growth. In the past 12 months, Biogen has lost more than $30 billion of market value, making it among the lowest-valued companies in biopharma.The shares rose 5.3% to $244.86 at 9:49 a.m. in New York.The company said it expects revenue this year to be between $14 billion and $14.2 billion, up from a January forecast of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion. Its adjusted earnings-per-share for the quarter were $9.15, while analysts had anticipated $7.53.It now stands to be seen which of the other treatments in Biogen’s research pipeline might replace sales from its aging multiple sclerosis franchise, which remains the backbone of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company’s sales.Biogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said on a call with analysts that the company was “refining” its R&D strategy and would look to make some changes to its pipeline of drugs. Biogen now sees ophthalmology as a core franchise, and sees immunology as an emerging research area. It will also increase its focus on neuromuscular disorders.For now, the company’s key growth driver is Spinraza, a therapy that treats the deadly childhood disease spinal muscular atrophy. While Spinraza is highly effective, a recently approved competitor from Novartis AG appears to cure the disease.Biogen’s drug will serve as either a case study or cautionary tale of how legacy drugs will fare in the age of genetic cures for dire diseases. Spinraza’s second-quarter sales were $488 million, down from a quarter prior, and below the $530 million projected by analysts. Biogen said that Novartis’s gene therapy, which was approved in May, had yet to have a meaningful impact on its drug’s sales.“Results were overall good and we like the general execution,” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a note to clients. “However, investors aren’t looking to invest in Biogen for quarters and buybacks -- but for an improving financial outlook and better visibility on 1-5 year growth trajectory.”(Updates with share price in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Rebecca Spalding in Boston at rspalding@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net, Timothy Annett, Mark SchoifetFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Biogen’s Good Quarter Delays Drugmaker’s Future Reckoning

2019-07-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Drugmakers AstraZeneca Plc and Roche Holding AG joined major European rivals in raising their estimates for full-year results as new medicines begin to pay off.Sales and core earnings per share at Switzerland’s Roche will rise by a percentage in the mid- to high-single digits this year, the company said, as new drugs for cancer and multiple sclerosis offset pressure on older products. At Astra, product sales for the year are now expected to increase by a low double-digit percentage, helped by demand for the U.K. drugmaker’s roster of new cancer treatments. The stock surged in London trading.Like Astra and Swiss rival Novartis AG, Roche is seeing a handful of new medicines take over as the blockbusters that buoyed sales for a decade fade. Sales of Roche’s hemophilia therapy Hemlibra and Tecentriq for cancer breezed past analysts’ estimates in the first half. Astra’s cancer franchise saw sales surge by 51% last quarter amid demand for newcomers Lynparza and Imfinzi.GlaxoSmithKline Plc lifted its earnings forecast for the year on Wednesday, helped by a new shot for shingles that has quickly become a blockbuster. Glaxo is starting to encroach on Roche and Novartis’s turf by expanding into the cancer field. Novartis last week said earnings excluding some items would grow by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage this year, the second boost to its estimate since the start of the year.Astra in ChinaRoche had previously nudged its estimate in April, saying it expected mid single-digit growth. The stock rose as much as 1.6% in Zurich trading. Glaxo gained as much as 1.9% in London, and Astra climbed as much as 6.5%, reaching a record.Astra’s second-quarter profit came in at 73 cents a share, well above analysts’ expectations, while net operating cash flow rebounded for the first half. The company remains open to acquisitions where it can add value, like its deal with Daiichi Sankyo Co. earlier this year for rights to a breast cancer drug, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.Sales in China, one of the company’s most important markets, rose 34%. Soriot had said earlier this year that performance there would be hurt in the second half by the country’s bulk-buying drug program for major cities.“The impact of those price pressures hasn’t been really coming as quickly as we thought initially, but they are coming,” he said in the interview.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“We continue to see Astra as the preeminent large-pharma growth story.”&#92;-- Sam Fazeli, pharma analystClick here to read the pieceRoche said its planned acquisition of Spark Therapeutics should close this year as it works with U.S. and U.K. regulators, but didn’t provide an explanation for the holdup.CEO Severin Schwan said the competition for Roche’s aging blockbuster cancer drugs will likely intensify in the fourth quarter. Rivals Amgen Inc. and Allergan Plc last week announced the availability of two cheaper biosimilar versions of Roche’s Avastin and Herceptin.In terms of stock performance, Novartis is ahead so far this year with a 23% gain. Glaxo has gained about 11% in the period, beating Roche’s and Astra’s 8% increases.(Updates with Astra CEO’s comments in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Tim Loh in Munich at tloh16@bloomberg.net;John Lauerman in London at jlauerman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Marthe Fourcade, Thomas MulierFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Astra, Roche Join Rivals in Boosting Forecasts as New Drugs Prosper"

2019-08-12,"Shares of Amgen Inc.  rose another 4.5% on Monday after gaining nearly 6% on Friday, when a U.S. judge upheld two patents related to the pharmaceutical company's best-selling drug Enbrel. The two patents protect Enbrel's active ingredient until 2029, and the Friday ruling denied a challenge by Novartis AG's  Sandoz unit, which is looking to release a biosimilar version of the blockbuster drug. Sandoz plans to appeal the ruling. Amgen's Enbrel, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, brought in more than $5 billion in world-wide sales in 2018, with $4.8 billion of that from U.S. sales. &quot;The ruling removes a critical overhang for the company as Enbrel... is a significant component of the base commercial business and a meaningful contributor of revenue, cash flows and dividend capacity,&quot; Evan Seigerman of Credit Suisse wrote in a note sent out to clients on Saturday.

2019-08-14,"The topsy-turvy ride for stock traders continues this morning with U.S. stock futures pointing toward a sizeable down gap at the open. Yesterday's gains are being completely unwound.Source: Shutterstock Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 1.46%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 1.42%. Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 1.57%.In the options pits, call volume spiked sharply yesterday underlying the excitement surrounding the market rally. Specifically, about 19.9 million calls and 17.5 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe enthusiasm was felt at the CBOE as well, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio falling to 0.66. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average held its ground at 0.74. Based on the wickedness of today's open, however, I suspect both metrics to end with bearish readings today.Options traders came after calls throughout the session, boosting volumes in Amgen (NYSE:AMGN), American Airlines Group (NYSE:AAL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Let's take a closer look: Amgen (AMGN)The direction of Amgen shares reversed in a big way this week after the biotech behemoth won a patent dispute against Novartis (NYSE:NVS). Over the past three sessions, AMGN stock has rocketed 12% higher on massive volume. The rally pushed shares back to last year's highs, and they now stand a whisper from breaking out to record levels.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul In the short run, AMGN is extended and deserving of a breather. Consolidation or a pullback will allow its moving averages to catch-up and make for a more sustainable uptrend. That said, any weakness should be viewed as a buying opportunity.On the options trading front, traders went cuckoo for calls. Activity ballooned to 1,314% of the average daily volume, with 275,296 total contracts traded; 96% of the trading came from call options alone. The catalyst for such a groundswell in call demand is the company's looming ex-dividend date. Amgen's next quarterly payment of $1.45 will be paid out to shareholders of record and investors used call options to snatch-up short-term control of the stock to gain access to the payout.Implied volatility has been falling this week and now sits at 24% or the 29th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $3.08 or 1.5%, so set your expectations accordingly. American Airlines (AAL)The news was light for American Airlines Group, but that didn't prevent traders from swarming its options. In an otherwise ordinary day, we saw options activity jump to 270% of the average daily volume, with 107,237 total contracts traded. Calls slightly outpaced puts to claim 55% of the session's sum.Ever since last month's earnings took the wind out of its sails, AAL stock has been declining. It has now lost 21% in three weeks and will soon test its 52-week low at $27.02. Of course, weakness isn't new for AAL. It has been in a cyclical decline for two years and has already lost over 53% of its value. Until we see resistance levels breached, buyers should cast their lines elsewhere. There are much more attractive fish to catch.Implied volatility remains, tucked near the middle of its 2019 range. It's at 41% or the 31st percentile, and premiums are pricing in daily moves of 71 cents or 2.6%. Apple (AAPL)Apple stock led the charge during Tuesday's roaring rally in the Nasdaq for one simple reason. It dodged Chinese tariffs for this year's iPhones. Here's the skinny if you want all the details.Before we get too excited over yesterday's jump, keep in mind the overnight whacking for stocks is taking a bite out of Apple's gains. The stock is set to open down 2.4%. Time will tell if the positive news is enough to keep AAPL stock aloft while the rest of the market grapples with growing recession concerns.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale The post-earnings slide found support at $192.50, so that's the line in the sand to watch. If broken, this year's ascent is in a heap of trouble. Until then, ignore the chop and focus on the bigger picture, which still points higher.On the options trading front, traders favored calls throughout the day. Total activity swelled to 137% of the average daily volume, with 686,707 contracts traded. Calls added 59% to the day's take.With uncertainty easing, implied volatility sunk to 29% or the 35th percentile of its one-year range. That means traders are now pricing in daily movement of $3.87 or 1.9%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-14,"On the stump, if there's one thing that both Republican and Democratic politicians have long claimed to support, it's lower drug prices. And when rumors start buzzing that the government may be about to intervene, then biotech stocks often get slammed…some fairly, and some not (as we'll see).That's just what happened in the past week.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a tougher proposal on her agenda than, say, President Trump. While the Trump administration is more interested in importing lower-priced versions of the drugs from Canada, Pelosi wants to apply direct pressure to pharmaceutical companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSpecifically, Pelosi wants to allow the Dept. of Health & Human Services to negotiate prices for Medicare Part D drug plans directly with drug manufacturers. (That would, effectively, eject pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies from the negotiating table.)Several biotech stocks have taken big hits on the regulatory rumors. Some of the Big Pharma crowd even showed up on the list of three-year lows last week! Let's review - because while some deserve to be sold, one big mover is actually on my Top 5 Stocks list for Breakthrough Stocks.  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession First we have Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), a potential target of Pelosi's proposal. With its famously pricey drug for spinal muscular atrophy, Spiranza, Biogen may well come into Democrats' crosshairs here. BIIB stock dropped sharply last Friday and again on Thursday.You may think that with pricing like $750,000 for your first year of Spiranza, Biogen would be printing money. But Spiranza just picked up a competitor from Novartis (NYSE:NVS). And below is the full picture on BIIB stock from my Portfolio Grader:While Biogen passes some of my profitability tests, it gets an F for Earnings Momentum, and Sales Growth is lackluster as well. Most concerning is the fact that BIIB stock got a D for its Quantitative Grade - my proprietary measure of institutional buying pressure.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) is looking even worse. The stock got off to a rough start this week, and while it's clawed back somewhat, it's still down 8% in the past month. For its part, Regeneron has a cholesterol drug (Praluent) that was so expensive that it eventually succumbed to pressure, reduced prices by 60%, and yet it still costs $5,850 a year.Here's REGN's Report Card:As you see above, Regeneron just does not measure up on Operating Margin Growth, Earnings Growth, Earnings Momentum or its Quantitative Grade.Then there's Repligen (NASDAQ:RGEN). While it may have a similar name and ticker, RGEN has much stronger fundamentals. Shares took an even bigger hit - but this is a much more interesting case.Repligen is a unique biotech: This company actually has no drugs of its own, but rather, its products are used in drug manufacturing.Repligen hit the biotechnology scene back in 1981, as it started to develop Protein A ligands to aid in the production of biologic treatments. The company has expanded rapidly since then, and was even named one of the Top 100 fastest-growing companies in the U.S. in 2018. Today, along with Protein A ligands, Repligen offers several products and solutions to enhance the production of biologic drugs.Strong demand for Repligen's biologic solutions was apparent in the company's second-quarter earnings report. The company reported 48% annual revenue growth and 121.4% annual earnings growth. Plus, second-quarter earnings of $0.31 per share crushed estimates for $0.25 per share by 24%.Given the strong second-quarter results, analysts have increased full-year 2019 forecasts in the past two months.

Tilray stock traded as high as $300 per share during the run-up in marijuana stocks, which preceded Canadian legalization in 2018. Since then, it has lost more than 92% of its value. This includes a nearly 35% drop in less than a week following its August earnings report.Source: Shutterstock To be sure, declines have hammered marijuana stocks across the board. Also, once the dust settles, the company holds key assets and partnerships that could eventually take TLRY stock higher.However, Tilray stock needs both changing sentiment and a more discernible path to stability before it can stem its decline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sector Selloff Hits TLRY StockTLRY trades at just over $22 per share. Despite this massive drop, TLRY stock still appears overvalued. Currently, it trades at about 24.3 times sales.In fairness, cannabis stocks have dropped across the board. Both Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) trade near 52-week lows. Moreover, companies such as Aphria (NYSE:APHA), which just beat earnings by 10 cents CAD per share, have also struggled. Many blame both changing sentiment against marijuana stocks as well as an oversupply of dried cannabis.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock In short, stocks that could do no wrong 18 months ago can now do no right. This bodes poorly for Tilray stock. InvestorPlace's Mark Hake even floated the possibility that TLRY could go bankrupt. Investors cannot write off that possibility as its reserves dwindle.TLRY holds about $180 million in cash. Since it lost $35 million in the last quarter, it can only maintain its current pace for so long. Moreover, Tilray cannot assume further debt will be an option. As of the previous quarterly report, the company held $430 million in long-term debt and $360 million in total equity. Hence, the financials indicate that the company may have to dilute its already beleaguered stock further when it comes time to seek more funding. TLRY Could Recover -- EventuallyDespite a bleak outlook and a lack of profits, investors still have reasons to keep watching Tilray stock. Much like the positive sentiment surrounding marijuana stocks did not last, investors should not assume the negative outlook will remain forever. When attitudes change, Wall Street may again pay attention to Tilray's attributes. Analysts forecast a 313.9% increase in revenue for this year. They also believe revenues will rise an additional 85.5% in fiscal 2020.Moreover, its partnerships and assets could eventually help TLRY. The company has partnered with a subsidiary of Novartis (NYSE:NVS) to distribute and sell branded medical cannabis products. It also entered into a joint venture with Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) to research THC and CBD-infused beverages. Tilray also owns Manitoba Harvest, the world's largest hemp food manufacturer.This bodes well for continuing revenue growth. However, getting to the point where rising revenues can finally yield profits will probably lead to actions that place more strain on both the balance sheet and TLRY. Until the company can get to a place where it stops diluting Tilray stock, investors have little reason to buy. My Final Thoughts on Tilray StockTilray stock will struggle to move higher without improving its financials and without a more positive outlook from Wall Street on the cannabis sector. The bubble in TLRY continues to pop. The stock still appears pricey despite trading more than 90% below its all-time high. Sentiment has turned against marijuana stocks as losses continue and the industry contends with a glut in dried cannabis.Despite these obstacles, an eventual bullish scenario could develop for Tilray stock. It has built partnerships with established players in other industries. This could bode well for the Nanaimo, British Columbia-based firm as medicinal marijuana and cannabis-infused beverages find a market.However, for now, TLRY stock faces challenges as losses mount and liquid assets dwindle. Options for more funding will probably strain both the balance sheet and Tilray stock itself. For this reason, investors should probably brace for further near-term declines.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-11-19,A Bloomberg report said pharma giant Novartis was looking into a potential acquisition of the company.,The Medicines Company Stock Is Soaring Because Novartis Might Want to Buy It
2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Medicines Co., the developer of a promising cholesterol drug, has attracted takeover interest from suitors including Novartis AG, people familiar with the matter said.Novartis has been holding talks about a potential acquisition of Parsippany, New Jersey-based Medicines Co., according to the people. The Swiss drugmaker is conducting due diligence on the company, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.Other potential acquirers have also expressed interest in a purchase of Medicines Co., and there’s no certainty an agreement will be reached, the people said. Shares of Medicines Co. have more than tripled in New York trading this year, giving it a market value of about $4.7 billion.The stock surged as much as 26% New York, the biggest intraday gain since 2010, and was up 19% to $69.96 at 10:51 a.m. Novartis showed little change in Zurich, down less than 1% to 89.15 Swiss francs, valuing the company at about 225 billion francs ($228 billion).Representatives for Medicines Co. and Novartis declined to comment.Novartis Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan has relied on deals to sharpen the company’s focus on innovative drugs for cancer and rare diseases. The Basel, Switzerland-based company has announced close to $16 billion of acquisitions since he took over as CEO in February 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He has also spun off the Alcon Inc. eye-care division and ditched a stake in a consumer-health venture.Medicines Co.’s injectable drug inclisiran cleared a key hurdle this summer as a late-stage study showed it cut bad cholesterol levels in half over 18 months. High levels of the substance are a leading cause of heart attacks.“Novartis currently has a rapidly growing heart failure drug, so the addition of another cardiovascular medicine would fit,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli.The company said Monday that the treatment achieved all of its goals in the latest study, showing durable and potent results in lowering patients’ cholesterol. Medicines Co. plans to submit the drug to regulators in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and in Europe in the first quarter of 2020.The data bolstered the treatment’s prospects to compete with older therapies from Amgen Inc. and partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sanofi. Two years ago, Medicines Co. announced it would lay off most of its workers as it restructured to focus on developing inclisiran.At Novartis, the medicine would join a stable of therapies that includes Entresto, a treatment for heart failure.Novartis is betting on cutting-edge drugs, rolling out products like gene therapy Zolgensma aimed at a devastating muscle disease. The company gained Zolgensma by acquiring drugmaker AveXis Inc. for $8.7 billion in 2018. Last year, it also bought Endocyte Inc. for $2.1 billion.(Updates Medicines Co. shares in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Marthe Fourcade, Bailey Lipschultz, Aaron Kirchfeld, Manuel Baigorri and James Paton.To contact the reporters on this story: Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.net;Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.net;Dinesh Nair in London at dnair5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Scent at bscent@bloomberg.net, ;Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Jeff Sutherland, Eric PfannerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Medicines Co.

2019-11-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Novartis AG is close to a deal to buy Medicines Co., the developer of a promising cholesterol drug, for $85 a share, according to news reports.An agreement could be announced today, according to the Wall Street Journal, which assigned a $7 billion price tag to the deal. Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, put the transaction value at $9.1 billion when taking the fully diluted shares into account.The Swiss drugmaker has been conducting due diligence on the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company, Bloomberg reported last week. At $85 a share, Novartis would be paying about a 45% premium over where the stock traded before the Bloomberg report.Snapping up Medicines Co. would complement Novartis’s stable of drugs to treat heart failure. Medicines Co.’s injectable drug inclisiran cleared a key hurdle this summer as a late-stage study showed it cut bad cholesterol levels in half over 18 months. High levels of the substance are a leading cause of heart attacks.“This will be a major execution story,” Raffat wrote in a note. “The asset itself is very elegant, but the market needs to be majorly developed.”Novartis Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan has relied on deals to sharpen the company’s focus on innovative drugs for cancer and rare diseases. The Basel, Switzerland-based company has announced close to $16 billion of acquisitions since he took over in February 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

2019-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Novartis AG agreed to buy Medicines Co. and its promising heart drug for $9.7 billion, the latest move in the Swiss drugmaker’s push to amass novel treatments for complex conditions.Medicines Co.’s experimental treatment inclisiran uses a new approach to lower bad cholesterol in especially hard-to-treat patients. Novartis Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan was willing to foot the bill, which includes stock options and convertible debt, for a medicine that appears to be moving quickly to the U.S. market where it will compete against existing products from Amgen Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sanofi.Drugmakers are targeting conditions and technologies that can set them apart from rivals, leaving more room for sales growth and allowing them to charge higher prices in an increasingly cost-conscious market. Narasimhan is adding Medicines Co. to a list of purchases that includes AveXis, maker of the $2.1 million gene therapy Zolgensma, and Endocyte, developer of targeted cancer treatments.The 43-year-old CEO has moved to spin off contact-lens maker Alcon and to ditch a stake in the consumer-health venture with GlaxoSmithKline Plc that makes Panadol painkillers and Theraflu cold remedies.Medicines Co. gives Novartis entry into a realm where at least one drug, Repatha, is forecast to achieve blockbuster status by 2021. Another similar cholesterol treatment, Regeneron and Sanofi’s Praluent, hasn’t fared as well, and prices on both drugs were recently cut as studies questioned their cost-effectiveness.New TechnologyThe medicine at the heart of the Novartis transaction is based on a technology discovered in the last few decades, called RNA interference, which stops cells from making specific proteins. The therapy is injected just twice a year, unlike existing treatments that need to be administered once or twice a month. Should it be approved by regulators, annual sales might reach a peak of $4 billion, according to Peter Welford, an analyst at Jefferies in London.Medicines Co. shareholders will get $85 a share, Novartis said in a statement. That’s a 45% premium to the closing price on Nov. 18, before Bloomberg reported the two companies were in talks.Shares of Parsippany, New Jersey-based Medicines Co. surged as much as 23% in early New York trading. The stock had already tripled in 2019 with anticipation building over the blockbuster potential of inclisiran. Novartis rose 0.7% at 3:40 p.m. Monday in Zurich.Narasimhan is paying a high price for a deal that essentially delivers a single treatment, analysts said.The transaction doesn’t bring a research platform or other significant assets besides inclisiran, said Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research. “For an outlay of $9 billion, it would be nice to have the latter,” he wrote in a note.At Novartis, inclisiran will join a stable of products that includes the heart-failure treatment Entresto. High levels of bad cholesterol, also known as LDL, are a leading cause of heart attacks and millions of people take statin drugs to keep them under control. Novartis is targeting a patient population of around 50 million people, according to a presentation.The medicine could become one of Novartis’s biggest sellers and help boost profit margins in the company’s innovative drugs division to a percentage in the mid- to high-30s in the medium term, Narasimhan said. Medicines Co. plans to submit an application for the drug in the U.S. before year-end.‘Cause for Caution’Recent data on the cholesterol treatment, a partnership with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., suggest RNA interference will help inclisiran stand out from Repatha and Praluent.The only approved drugs that use the gene-silencing approach come from Alnylam, which licensed rights to inclisiran to Medicines Co. The success of the drug, which has shown few side effects in clinical trials, is good news for Alnylam, whose Onpattro treatment for a rare inherited protein abnormality was the first therapy approved in the field. Givlaari, another one of Alnylam’s RNA products that treats a rare liver disease, was approved last week and will carry an annual U.S. wholesale price of $575,000.“Novartis hopes to leverage its growing cardiovascular might and inclisiran’s differentiated profile,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Sam Fazeli wrote in a note. “The lackluster performance of drugs targeting the same mechanism from Amgen and Sanofi is cause for caution.”At 11 times consensus 2023 sales, Novartis is paying a high price relative to recent deals, according to Fazeli.Medicines Co.’s drug cleared a key hurdle this summer as a late-stage study showed it cut bad cholesterol levels in half over 18 months. Two years ago, the company said it would lay off most of its workers as it restructured to focus on developing inclisiran.(Updates shares in eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Cristin Flanagan and John Lauerman.To contact the reporters on this story: James Paton in London at jpaton4@bloomberg.net;John Lauerman in London at jlauerman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Marthe Fourcade, Anne PollakFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Novartis to Pay $9.7 Billion in Latest Bet on New Technology

2019-12-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Zhang Haitao was a basketball-loving teenager who dreamed of going to a specialized sports high school when he got a pain in his right arm that just wouldn’t go away. It turned out to be acute lymphoblastic leukemia.The discovery set Zhang and his family, from a village deep in the mountains of southwestern China's Sichuan province, on a journey familiar to most cancer patients — a revolving door of hospital visits, blood tests and three rounds of chemotherapy. It was then that Zhang’s doctor suggested a last-ditch option: an experimental gene therapy being trialed by a Chinese startup called Gracell Biotechnology Ltd.After spending three weeks in the hospital in May — during which white blood cells were removed from his body, genetically engineered, and then infused back in — an analysis of Zhang’s bone marrow in June showed his body was clear of cancer.Seven months later, monthly medical tests conducted at a hospital in the nearby Chinese metropolis of Chongqing show he remains cancer free. “I don’t remember much about the treatment as I had a fever throughout,” said Zhang, who’s now almost 16 and spends his days playing video games and texting his friends. “It seems like a new solution that will give people hope.”Read more about how China is overhauling its healthcare systemThe therapy Zhang received was Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cells, known as CAR-T, and it’s being hailed as one of the most exciting developments in the quest to cure cancer. First developed by Israeli scientist Zelig Eshhar in the 1980s, CAR-T re-works the genes of the body’s own immune cells so that they actively seek out and destroy cancer cells. While it’s been embraced by researchers and drugmakers around the world, perhaps nowhere is CAR-T having more impact — and being pushed dangerously close to its limits — than in China, home to the world’s biggest cancer population and some of the most ambitious experiments.CAR-T works by supercharging T-cells, the body’s main line of defense against disease, so that they latch onto and destroy cancer. In clinical trials, leukemia patients who failed to respond to other therapies have shown remission rates of over 90% within two months of treatment.Though drug giants Novartis AG and Gilead Sciences Inc. have been marketing CAR-T globally since 2017, it’s expensive. The process of engineering an individual’s cells in a laboratory and then replicating them has also meant that some patients with more aggressive cancers can die waiting for treatment.That’s where Gracell’s therapy was revolutionary. Instead of the two to three weeks taken by current treatments from American and European drug makers, the Shanghai-based company — set up by a group of veteran Chinese cell-therapy researchers — is churning out cancer-killing immune cells overnight.And they’re doing it much cheaper in some cases than global pharmaceutical giants. Gracell has developed a process using genetic engineering that speeds up the cell production stage, according to founder William Cao Wei. Gracell plans to price its CAR-T treatment for about 500,000 yuan ($71,000), well below the $475,000 price tag for Novartis’ Kymriah, the Swiss company’s CAR-T therapy used to treat the type of blood cancer that Zhang had. A similar treatment from Gilead, based in Foster City, California, costs $373,000.The aging population and a raft of lifestyle factors mean that more new cancer patients are emerging in China than anyplace else in the world, giving the country a significant stake in the global fight to find a cure. Emboldened by the government’s push to become a scientific superpower and to dominate the field of genetics, Gracell and other Chinese biotech startups are racing ahead, with China likely to approve CAR-T for widespread use as early as next year. Up for grabs is a market for cancer drugs and experimental treatments that has exploded to $133 billion a year worldwide, according to life sciences researcher Iqvia Institute.“There can be both cooperation and competition between us and CAR-T developers in developed markets,” said Cao, who is also Gracell’s chief executive officer. “But there will definitely be competition.” That drive to forge ahead — and in front — can be seen in the way China is approaching regulation of CAR-T. The country is weighing new rules that would loosen oversight of the revolutionary technology, allowing academic ethics committees within hospitals to approve new CAR-T treatments and then administer them to patients for a fee.That would markedly loosen China’s current framework, which is presently in line with the approach taken by regulatory bodies like the U.S Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. These entities are the sole authorities in their jurisdictions that evaluate and approve all CAR-T therapies before they are cleared for public use.There is concern among researchers, regulatory experts and drugmakers themselves that allowing hospitals to market treatments for a fee could cause profit-making to trump ethical considerations. In a 2016 case widely reported in the Chinese media, a 22-year-old college student with a rare type of tissue cancer called synovial sarcoma died after going through an experimental cell therapy at a Beijing hospital.“Hospitals can become both players and referees at the same time”Before his death, the patient posted an essay online claiming the hospital had falsely advertised the treatment’s effectiveness, and that Chinese search engine Baidu Inc. had displayed the hospital’s advertising so that it appeared like a credible search result rather than a paid commercial. The essay went viral and sparked an outcry on Chinese social media over the ethics of private hospitals and the regulation of therapies for serious illnesses.Censured by the Cyberspace Administration of China, Baidu responded by restricting the number of sponsored posts to 30% of a results page, and established a 1 billion yuan fund to fight fraud. The hospital did not respond to requests for comment.It’s not the only death allegedly linked to genetic cell therapy in China. Last year, a hospital in the eastern city of Xuzhou was sued over the death of a lymphoma patient who died after receiving a CAR-T treatment. The patient developed severe side effects, including bleeding within the abdomen. The patient’s family argued that the treatment led to his death, but the hospital and doctor said it was the result of late-stage cancer. A court is yet to rule on the case.China’s proposed new framework is reminiscent of its wider approach to the regulation of science, an area President Xi Jinping has prioritized as part of his ambition to cement the country as a world power.The research of He Jiankui, an American-educated Chinese scientist whose revelation last year that he’d edited the genes of twin baby girls ignited a global firestorm, was signed off by the ethics committee of a Shenzhen hospital. The experiment, which He claimed made the twins immune to HIV, wasn’t backed by peer-reviewed data and still hasn’t been verified. Scientists around the world have condemned it as an irresponsible use of a technology that has the capacity to alter the very building blocks of life. The long-term effects of Crispr, the gene-snipping tool used by He and embraced by Chinese researchers, are also yet to be fully understood.China’s new draft rules on CAR-T could give rise to the same scenario, critics say.There’s no guarantee that the hospital committees have the qualifications to evaluate such a complicated therapy, said Tao Xin, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer at Hogan Lovells LLP who specializes in the health-care regulatory law of both the U.S. and China.“The proposal indicates that hospitals can charge a fee for the therapy, in addition to approving its own therapy,” he said. “With these two combined, are we going to see a replay of the 2016 incident? If there’s money to be made and I get to decide whether to do it or not, that’s really controversial.”Read about how Crispr is being used in China’s quest to make a super pigGracell’s Cao is also critical of the new framework as it removes the role of an independent entity that evaluates the therapy’s safety and efficacy: “Hospitals can become both players and referees at the same time.”Novartis and Gilead declined to comment on China’s regulatory plans, while a spokesman for the National Health Commission, the body in charge of governing the country’s health sector, said that the proposed new rules are still under discussion.Read about how Chinese parents are using DNA tests to map out their children’s livesMeanwhile, Chinese companies are racing ahead on CAR-T and attracting hundreds of millions of dollars from investors like Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, as well as global pharmaceutical giants. Venture capital investment in Chinese biotech firms climbed to $17.6 billion last year, quadruple the amount from 2015, according to consultancy ChinaBio LLC. Gracell — which counts Temasek and Lilly Asia Ventures, the venture capital firm spun off from Eli Lilly & Co. as investors — says 32 of the 35 patients it’s enrolled in its China-based trials over the past year have gone into complete remission “with minimal residual disease tested negative” four weeks after the CAR-T infusion — a clinical term that basically means there was no evidence of disease remaining in their bodies, the highest possible efficacy level for a therapy.Other Chinese startups like Nanjing Legend, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Genscript Biotech Corp., and U.S.-listed Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc., have developed similar capabilities.In 2018, Novartis paid $40 million for a 9% stake in Shanghai-based Cellular Biomedicine, and will use their cell therapy facility to manufacture its Kymriah treatment, which is currently being assessed for approval by China’s drug regulator. The startup is also developing its own CAR-T therapies and testing their potential against solid tumors, not just blood cancers. Chief Executive Officer Tony Liu Bizuo said Cellular Biomedicine’s digitized and automated process cuts the cell engineering time from four weeks to less than 10 days.Cellular Biomedicine is now mulling building a bigger cell production facility with the Shanghai government, as demand for cell therapy grows and on expectations more commercial CAR-T treatments will be approved in China in the coming years. In a sign of the support startups are getting from the authorities, the city’s government has earmarked a 4 million square feet space for cell therapy research. Of the 21 cell therapies currently in clinical trials approved by China’s drug regulator, 11 are being conducted in the lab, which is fast becoming the nation’s CAR-T Ground Zero.The next frontier is to make CAR-T as accessible as any other drug, and Chinese startups are at the leading edge. Dubbed “universal CAR-T,” this involves finding a way to take T-cells from healthy people and engineering them so that they can be infused into any cancer patient. Gracell is studying the use of donor white blood cells, marking a step toward that goal. Other startups like French company Cellectis SA are also racing to make universal CAR-T a reality.“I’m very impressed with the pace of technological progress in China and the expansion of CAR-T research coming so rapidly,” said Bruce Levine, a professor specializing in cancer gene therapy at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.“We all want these therapies to move fast and some are very good, but we need to be aware that some could be moving too fast for their expertise, even if they have very good intentions,“ he said.Read about how a Chinese genetics giant wants to tailor drugs to people’s DNAAfter a year in and out of hospital, Zhang, the teenage cancer patient in Chongqing, is starting to make plans for the future. If it wasn’t for the leukemia, he’d be in his first year of high school now.“I don’t think I can go to sports school anymore, but I hope to learn a professional skill,” said Zhang, who’s now a foot taller than his aunt, Chen Chunhua, his primary caregiver. “I want to grasp this chance I have.”While China’s approach to CAR-T may be criticized as moving too fast, Chen, who left her job at a ceramics factory to care for Zhang when he got sick, is thankful he had access to the treatment, which wouldn’t have been possible in China had the boy fallen ill just a year earlier.“I’m so happy we had this option within China,” she said. “It really helps to lessen our burden.”  &#92;--With assistance from Dong Lyu.To contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, Anjali CordeiroFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s Curing Cancer Faster and Cheaper Than Anywhere Else

2020-01-10,"Heading into the new year, only one word matters for the biotech stocks: buyout.Already, we've seen a fury of activity this past year, as many of the larger pharmaceutical and biotech giants look to plug holes in their aging pipelines. This activity accelerated at the end of the end, with Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) all making big blockbuster buys over the last month or so.And, the buys could continue into the new year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor one thing, many of the big biotech stocks are flushed with cash. Thanks to the tax cuts of 2017, repatriation of cash and continued sales of blockbuster drugs, many of the biggest biotech stocks are holding billions on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, pipelines and approvals of new drugs are starting to dry up. According to investment bank JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), over the last 20 years, the FDA has only approved an average of between 20 and 25 new drugs per year. Most of those approvals have come from advanced drugs, new cancer fighters and a hefty dose of biologics.With the need to fill pipelines and replace aging blockbusters, the major biotech stocks are in a bind. And that means buying their way out of these issues.  * The Top 15 Stocks to Buy in 2020 For investors, this poises an interesting scenario. Plenty of gains can be had betting on the right biotech stock with a promising pipeline as the bigger fish start spending their cash. However, which biotech stocks have the promise?Here are three biotech stocks that make for great buyout targets. Biotech Stocks That Are Buyout Targets: Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR)Source: Shutterstock It's no secret that gene therapy has quickly become all the rage, with pharmaceutical firms trying to tackle rare and orphan diseases. And while there are a ton of new technologies that fall under this umbrella, RNA interference (RNAi) has the potential to be a real game changer.Basically, it's a mechanism that uses a &quot;gene's own DNA sequence of gene to turn it off.&quot; With Novartis spending nearly $10 billion on RNAi buyouts in recent months, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARWR) could be an intriguing stock to look at it.ARWR's sole specialty is RNAi drugs and features a big pipeline of therapies in various stages of development. These drugs include tackling aliments like liver disease, Cystic Fibrosis and cancerous tumors. So far, the biotech has been pretty successful at navigating the various phases of clinical trials. Data from many of its late-stage drugs seem very promising.However, the real reason to be excited that ARWR could be bought out is that it already counts a very deep-pocketed biotech among its development partners. Arrowhead has already cut deals with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for development of treatment for chronic hepatitis B infections. The deal provides ARWR with plenty of upfront cash, development and milestone rights. However, given the rush to buyout RNAi providers, JNJ has every reason to consider snagging the firm outright.Now, Arrowhead isn't unknown at this point. In fact, the stock has surged over the last year -- especially since October. Some of that was do to the NVS buyouts in the sector. But, a lot of it was do to ARWR's own wins and progress. But, with plenty of potential and market cap of just $6 billion, Arrowhead could provide more gains in the year ahead -- buyout or not. Amarin (AMRN)Source: Shutterstock A lot has been written about Amarin (NASDAQ:AMRN). The biotech stock has been a roller coaster the last few years, going from obscurity to being on hot lists. The reason comes down to its only medicine -Vascepa.Vascepa is really just a fish oil pill. But man, is it good. Data for the drug was stellar, with patients experiencing a 20% less chance of cardiovascular death, 31% less heart attacks and 28% less strokes. All in all, Vascepa was able to reduce cardiovascular risk by 25%. With its big cache of data and FDA approval, AMRN now has a blockbuster on its hands. Patients facing cardiovascular events who are already on statins now have another line of defense to fight. With that, AMRN now predicts that it'll be able to accumulate $650 to $700 million in sales this year.So, why buyout potential? That's an easy source of bolt-on revenue with some decent growth prospects.Cardiovascular disease remains a huge threat that only continues to get worse as diet and genetics play an increasing role. Vascepa has the potential to be the next Lipitor in that fight. And that blockbuster potential makes it a great add-on for drug companies with big cardiovascular portfolios. With a market cap of only $7 billion, Amarin is a pretty easy pill to swallow for a larger biotech stock looking to boost its sagging growth potential.  * 3 Oil Stocks That Are Worth Looking Into Now In the end, Vascepa could be a blockbuster and that could lead to a sale of ARMN stock. Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT)Source: Shutterstock Non-alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH) remains a tough nut to crack. The progressive liver disease can destroy the organ, and is projected to become the leading cause of all liver transplants this year. For nations with fatty diets, prevalence of NASH is estimated to be as much as 20% of the total population. The problem is that most potential treatments for the disease have fallen flat.And, that could make Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT) the only boat in the sea.Intercept's drug Ocaliva is used to treat a rare, chronic liver disease known as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PBC is very similar to NASH. This allowed ICPT to pivot the medicine and results were pretty great. So great, that ICPT recently submitted the drug for review with the FDA.Perhaps even better is that the agency granted Intercept priority review for the drug. That could lead to quicker approval time and reduce the headaches ICPT needs to get the therapy out to market.Given the potential size of NASH and the need for the drug, ICPT could be looking at a major blockbuster on it hands. And as the only man standing in the sector, that could lead to plenty of buyout activity for the stock. This is especially true as shares of the firm have slipped over the last year, but gained traction in October. With a market cap of about $4 billion, Intercept is a very digestible for many other biotech stocks.In the end, ICPT is sitting right in the sweet spot for mergers and acquisitions activity. With strong growth potential, first-mover status and a low market cap all being factors. At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2020-03-27,"The world is progressing towards a vaccine for the coronavirus with multiple large-scale and properly controlled studies exploring the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan said on CNBC.Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter.Narasimhan said ongoing studies consist of giving doses of hydroxychloroquine to hospitalized patients and other people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus. The trials are moving at a rapid pace, including a Novartis-sponsored study and other investigative trials and &quot;a lot more data&quot; should come out within the following month.Narasimhan said it's already known from pre-clinical studies involving animals so far have shown that hydroxychloroquine is &quot;quite active against the coronavirus.&quot; Meanwhile, the drug is currently being used across the world as doctors are vying to give patients &quot;any option they can.&quot;Why It's ImportantIt's too early to declare hydroxychloroquine is a proven therapy for coronavirus and this conclusion can't be reached until the properly controlled and randomized studies are completed, he said.Novartis and its rivals are also actively testing existing medicines to see if it can &quot;kill the virus&quot; in people or help boost the immune system that the virus targets, Narasimhan said.What's Next Novartis along with multiple other companies announced Thursday a new partnership with the Gates Foundation in which Narasimhan will serve as co-chair. He said the objective is to find novel therapies to treat the infection. But any working vaccine is likely 18 to 24 months away and this is the &quot;definitive way&quot; to deal with the pandemic.The one important aspect of a vaccine to keep in mind is that it is given to healthy people and needs to be proven before to be both safe and effective, he said. As such, the more pressing near-term priority is to take existing drugs to treat the virus or treat the auto-immune reaction. A &quot;realistic&quot; timeline for this achievement is over the next 12 months.See more from Benzinga  * General Mills CEO: Everyone Is 'Doing The Job They Need To Do'  * Mondelez CEO Talks Global Food Demand And More  * GrubHub CEO: Independent Restaurants Are 'Really Hurting'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Autoinflammatory diseases are caused by abnormalities of the immune system, which trigger an inflammatory response that can damage the body’s own tissues. Characteristics of AOSD include fever, arthritis, rash and inflammation.Ilaris was previously approved for Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and older.“Prior to today’s approval, patients had no FDA-approved treatments for their disease, which can include symptoms such as painful arthritis, fevers and rash,” said Nikolay Nikolov, MD, of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval provides patients with a treatment option.”Common side effects reported by patients treated with Ilaris are infections (colds and upper respiratory tract infections), abdominal pain and injection-site reactions. The prescribing information for Ilaris includes a warning for potential increased risk of serious infections due to IL-1 blockade.Ilaris was granted Priority Review designation, under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition.Shares in Novartis are currently trading down 8% year-to-date, and as a result Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum is taking an increasingly bullish view of the stock. He has just upgraded his NVS rating from Hold to Buy with a $109 price target (25% upside potential).According to Baum, the stock is now trading at attractive levels and looks undervalued given its cardiovascular franchise potential post-Covid-19 and backlog of product launches in China.

Novartis has agreed to pay $223.9 million to the Justice Department and $112.8 million to the SEC. &quot;To resolve the SEC investigation, Novartis AG has reached an agreement pertaining to internal controls and books and records violations in Greece, Vietnam and South Korea,&quot; the company said in a statement. The company was alleged to have bribed Greek employees of state-owned hospitals to increase prescriptions of its Lucentis treatment for macular degeneration. It is also alleged to have made improper payments to health providers in Vietnam and South Korea. The settlements mean that all outstanding FCPA investigations into the company are closed. Novartis' U.S.-listed shares were up 0.7% Thursday, but have fallen about 6% in the year to date.","UPDATE: Swiss drug company Novartis settles with DoJ, SEC in case brought under Foreign Corrupt Practices Act"
2020-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- The Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG and two subsidiaries admitted to overseas bribery schemes and agreed to pay about $347 million to settle U.S. investigations under a law that President Donald Trump has criticized as unfair.A Novartis unit in Greece bribed doctors and hospitals to prescribe its products, and Alcon, a unit that Novartis sold last year, kept false records to cover bribes paid to advance its business in Vietnam, according to U.S. authorities.“Novartis AG’s subsidiaries profited from bribes that induced medical professionals, hospitals, and clinics to prescribe Novartis-branded pharmaceuticals and use Alcon surgical products, and they falsified their books and records to conceal those bribes,” Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said Thursday in a written statement.Novartis Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan set out to rebuild the company’s reputation after revelations that it paid $1.2 million to Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as earlier allegations of improperly paying thousands of doctors.Narasimhan took steps to raise standards and manage risk while also naming a new ethics chief. He said the company made a mistake in signing up Cohen, which came before he took over in 2018.Novartis shares rose less than 1% to $89.54 in New York, joining a late rally among U.S. stocks.Investigations under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act have slowed since the 2016 election of Trump, who has called it a “horrible law.” In a 2017 Oval Office meeting, Trump ordered Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to abolish the law, according to a book by Washington Post reporters.“It’s just so unfair that American companies aren’t allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas,” Trump said, according to “A Very Stable Genius” by the reporters Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig.In the deal announced on Thursday, Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I., the Greek unit, agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $225 million. Novartis AG will pay $112.8 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Alcon Pte Ltd., a former Novartis subsidiary, will pay a criminal fine of $8.9 million.Both the Greek unit and Alcon were charged with crimes in federal court in New Jersey, but prosecutors agreed to defer prosecution in exchange for commitments by the companies to reform their practices. The companies are cooperating with authorities. The conduct described by authorities dates back more than a decade.“We are pleased that all outstanding FCPA investigations into the company are now closed,” Shannon Thyme Klinger, Novartis’s group general counsel, said in a written statement. “Today’s settlements represent another milestone in our commitment to resolving legacy compliance issues and ensuring that Novartis truly lives its values.”Still, the drugmaker’s U.S. legal problems aren’t over. The U.S. sued the company seven years ago, joining in a case filed by a former sales representative who accused the company of using its speakers programs to pay kickbacks to doctors who prescribed its drugs.The lawsuit claims that Novartis paid thousands of doctors with speaking fees, fishing trips and even outings at Hooters restaurants to boost sales of hypertension drugs Lotrel and Valturna, along with the diabetes medication Starlix.Last year, the company set aside about $700 million for a potential settlement. The case is still pending.The settlements on Thursday were unrelated to the money paid to Cohen to enhance its understanding of and access to the Trump administration after his inauguration in January 2017. Novartis said it determined early on that Cohen wouldn’t be able to help with heath care policy matters, but it continued to make payments until the contract expired because it couldn’t be terminated for cause.Cohen pleaded guilty last year to tax evasion, making false statements to a bank, lying to Congress and violating campaign-finance law. He was sentenced to three years in prison and was recently released to his New York home because of the coronavirus pandemic.As part of the settlements on Thursday, prosecutors outlined a range of Novartis misdeeds.For instance, Novartis bribed eye doctors in Greece by paying for international conference sponsorships from 2012 to 2015 to boost sales of Lucentis, a drug to treat macular degeneration, according to an SEC order. The cost to attend these conferences often exceeded $5,000 per doctor. The company tied such payments to prescriptions and warned that trips would “be canceled if sales performance is not improved significantly.”MORE:Novartis’s Secret Settlement Talks Revealed in Accidental Filing(Updates with Novartis shares in the sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Novartis, Units Admit Violating Bribery Law Bashed by Trump"

Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases reported in the past week.Continental Resources Continental Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CLR) saw its founder and executive chair Harold Hamm return and purchase more than 3.13 million additional shares. At per-share prices between $15.18 and $17.92, that totaled more than $52.37 million. His stake is up to 9.61 million shares. The total float is about 74.5 million shares.Analysts at UBS raised their price target last week.Continental Resources stock rose more than 21% last week and was last seen at $18.30 a share. That is above Hamm's most recent purchase price range. The share price is up over 23% since the year-to-date low back in early March.T-Mobile Softbank Executive Chair Ron Fisher, a recently resigned T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) director, also stepped up to the buy window last week. He indirectly picked up 350,000 shares of this wireless services provider for $103 each. That cost him $36.05 million.T-Mobile has divested its Sprint Prepaid business as part of its merger agreement. T-Mobile stock closed up fractionally last week to $106.01 a share, nearly 3% above Fisher's purchase price. The stock is more than 56% higher than the year-to-date low during the pandemic panic selling in March.Novartis A former 10% owner purchased 125,000 Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) shares last week. The share price was $17, and the total for the transaction came to more than $2.12 million. That brought the stake to over 1.18 million shares, and it came on the heels of the settlement of a $678-million bribery lawsuit.Novartis stock ended last week at $87.57, in the same neighborhood as where it started the week. While the share price is about 21% higher since its year-to-date low in March, it is still well below its consensus price target of $104. That estimate is based on the response of just three analysts, though.See also: Insider Sells Ambarella's StockFurthermore, note that there was some amount of insider buying at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Cardtronics PLC (NASDAQ: CATM) and Principal Financial Group Inc (NASDAQ: PFG) last week as well.At the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities.Keep up with all the latest breaking news and trading ideas by following Benzinga on Twitter.See more from Benzinga  * Barron's Picks And Pans: Chipotle, Lululemon, Zoom Video And More  * Bulls And Bears Of The Week: Lululemon, Square, Tesla And More  * Barron's Picks And Pans: Biden, ESG And Reopening Picks(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Cocktails in lockdown helped to soothe the woes of distillers but the pandemic’s effect on hospital admissions is disrupting the pharmaceutical industry.France’s Remy Cointreau SA raised its profit forecast for the year as people buying its cognac and liqueurs to make drinks at home helped to offset a heavy hit from bar and restaurant closures. The auto industry also got some more good news with Volvo Cars predicting a rebound in the second half.Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG reported an influx of funds from wealthy clients and better-than-expected profit. Flavor and fragrance maker Givaudan SA topped estimates as the lockdown drove up demand for home staples such as cleaning products and snack foods.Still, in a worrying sign for an industry that’s been buffered from the impact of Covid-19, drugmaker Novartis AG trimmed its annual sales forecast as the virus disrupted demand for eye and dermatology medicines.Second-quarter earnings are off to a strong start, with a broad range of companies beating analyst estimates, Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a note on Monday. That indicates there may be modest increases to consensus expectations for 2020 and 2021 in the coming weeks, they said. The biggest revisions are coming from financial and commodities companies.Key Developments:European stocks rose with the Stoxx 600 index gaining 1.1%, led by banks, autos and tech stocksUBS Signals Worst May Be Over With Return to Dividend PayoutNovartis Trims 2020 Sales Forecast on Pandemic DisruptionAsian Infections Climb; EU Reaches Stimulus Deal: Virus UpdateHere’s the top virus-related earnings news for Tuesday by sector.BanksUBS signaled it may resume share buybacks and dividend payments as soon as the fourth quarter after new money flowing into its key wealth management arm topped estimates. You can follow the live blog for UBS’s second-quarter earnings here. The Swiss bank’s shares rose as much as 4% with analysts optimistic on the prospects for payouts.Health CareNovartis cut its 2020 sales forecast as the pandemic disrupted patients getting key drugs, including the eye medication Lucentis, and hit new patient starts for dermatology treatments. Earnings excluding some items will likely increase by a low-double-digit percentage, according to a statement, the higher end of the range given earlier this year. Analysts said the negative impact from destocking was expected and Bloomberg Intelligence said the miss reflects a degree of over-optimism. The stock fell as much as 1.7%.AutosVolvo Cars said it expects a strong recovery in the second half, after posting an operating loss in the first. The company, owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., gained market share in the Asian nation, the U.S. and Europe, despite a decline in revenue. Sales in July have been slightly above last year’s level in all regions, CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in an interview. Volvo’s outlook is the latest indication car markets may have turned a corner, after Daimler AG last week said it saw demand recover at the end of the first quarter.German tire and car-parts supplier Continental AG’s second-quarter sales dropped by nearly 40% but still came in ahead of more pessimistic estimates. The group refrained from giving an outlook for 2020, however. Citi said the earnings were well ahead of expectations, but cash flow was not. The shares rose as much as 4.5%.ConsumerRemy Cointreau said first-half profit will fall less than previously estimated, as more consumers bought its Cointreau liqueur to make cocktails in lockdown, offsetting the decline in sales for bars and restaurants. The French distiller expects a “strong” recovery for the second half, boosted by the U.S. and mainland China. Analysts praised the update, noting a good performance for Remy Martin cognac in China. The shares bounced as much as 5.2% before giving up the gains.Swiss chocolatier Lindt & Spruengli AG said sales for the year will be 5% to 7% lower than last year, assuming there won’t be a second virus wave that leads to extensive lockdowns. The company gained market share in all its key markets as it leaned on home deliveries, pick-up services and expanded e-commerce to offset shuttered stores. Vontobel said the results are better than expected but Lindt shares fell 3.4%.TelecomsTelecommunications masts operator Cellnex Telecom SA raised its 2020 outlook following a string of deals in the first half, including its entry into Portugal and the completion of the purchase of the U.K.’s Arqiva. Goldman Sachs said the results were reassuring, though attention will be on the firm’s new deal pipeline. Cellnex shares fell as much as 1.4%.U.K. telecom firm TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc’s fiscal first-quarter revenue fell but has seen a recovery in trading in June and July. It saw net additions to its fiber service in the quarter and improving trends as the period progressed. The shares fell as much as 3.6% and Berenberg said the revenue decline the firm saw was “steep.”TechComputer mouse and keyboard maker Logitech International SA raised its full-year profit forecast after its fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings easily topped estimates. The company is experiencing a significant boost in demand from customers working from home purchasing new equipment. The shares jumped as much as 6.5% and Goldman Sachs noted a good product mix and lower promotional spending for the beat.MediaPublishing and events group Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc said trading has been in line with expectations as it dealt with pricing pressures in its publishing arm and focused on cost controls as events were canceled amid the pandemic. Citi said the events business is still clearly facing challenges, though the firm’s net cash position provides some comfort. The shares rose as much as 2.5%.ChemicalsFragrances and flavors manufacturer Givaudan reported better-than-expected profit, buoyed by demand for ingredients in what are Covid-19 staples like household-cleaning products, shampoo, comfort food and snacks. That offset a slump in demand for perfume during lockdowns as people worked from home and duty-free shopping at airports ground to a standstill. Liberum said the results were impressive but the shares dipped as much as 0.7%.Business ServicesTransport group Kuehne + Nagel International AG’s first-half earnings beat estimates, aided by cost management as its revenue declined. It said significant uncertainty still exists for the second half. Citi said the results were a “strong” beat, driven by a good performance in sea freight. The shares rose as much as 3.5%, but gave up those gains later.Swiss testing company SGS SA reported first-half revenue that missed estimates, as operating income dropped by 33%. The main declines came in its oil and gas and industrial segments. Analysts at RBC said the firm has executed its strategy well, with earnings slightly ahead and cash flow still strong. The shares rose as much as 3.9% before paring gains.Dutch staffing firm Randstad NV said visibility remains “very limited” as it reported a decline in second-quarter sales but said this has eased more recently as lockdowns are lifted. It added that volume trends in July also indicates more positive momentum. Shares in the firm surged as much as 9.6% with Citi praising its gross margin and cash performances.IndustrialsSwedish engineer Alfa Laval AB posted second-quarter estimates ahead of expectations, though it said it anticipates demand in the third quarter will be somewhat lower. CEO Tom Erixon said the virus impact on supply chains and demand has been “significantly better” than feared and its shares rose as much as 6% in Stockholm.Bearings and seals maker SKF AB’s second-quarter earnings beat estimates but the group said it remains unfeasible to provide guidance for the third quarter. It said sales are being hit by both government-imposed restrictions and by weaker underlying demand. The shares dropped as much as 4.9% and Liberum said the cash flow looks disappointing and the outlook uncertain.Stora Enso Oyj’s second-quarter earnings topped estimates but it did not provide a guidance. The Finnish paper and packaging group said that despite some “optimistic signs,” visibility in its markets remains very low and the pandemic has accelerated the structural decline in all paper grades. The shares bounced as much as 6%.Swedish forestry company Svenska Cellulosa SCA’s second-quarter earnings missed estimates, with demand lower than in the first quarter. It also said most paper product areas have been hit by a decline in consumption for marketing and print advertising. The stock fell as much as 4.2%.Metals & MiningSwedish steelmaker SSAB AB said there are signs that demand may improve in the third quarter after second-quarter earnings beat estimates. It said demand for its special steels was stronger than for standard steels in the quarter. Morgan Stanley said the beat was driven by good cost management and shipments in the Americas and the shares bounced as much as 8.6%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Cocktails Boost Remy, Pandemic Disrupts Medicines: Earnings Wrap"

2020-07-24,"These five high yield drug stocks pay dividends with attractive yields, and also are undervalued. And as a result, these stocks offer good upside potential to investors. As a group, they are cheap. Yet, they have solid earnings that cover their dividends, plus good growth prospects.I wanted to find these high-yield drug stocks since there is a lot of news out there about pharmaceutical companies that are trying to find a vaccine. I figured some of these larger drug companies can be both innovative and also have a diversified level of income.This helps the pharmaceutical company satisfy the return objectives of its existing investors. However, they also offer enough growth prospects to provide upside potential for new investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor example, the average upside of this group of drug stocks is over 38%. Yet, the average dividend yield is 4.1% and the average price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is just 12.5 times. This is for earnings estimated for fiscal year 2021, and it is very cheap.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever That said, the five high yield drug stocks are:  * AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)  * GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)  * Novartis (NYSE:NVS)  * Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)  * Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)So, with all of that in mind, let's dive in. High-Yield Drug Stocks: AbbVie (ABBV)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $170 billionForward P/E: 8.3xDividend Yield: 4.8%Target Price Upside: 87%AbbVie stock is a large $170 billion market capitalization drug stock that is both cheap and has a very attractive dividend yield. In addition, its growth prospects are high. In fact, it recently closed on the $63 billion acquisition of Allergan.Allergan is well known for its Botox and other beauty products. In turn, the deal will help AbbVie diversify its earnings and &quot;buys time&quot; before its arthritis drug Humira goes off-patent in 2023.Overall, that is why AbbVie is so cheap. It accounted for over 54% of the company's sales as of first quarter of FY2020. The market assumes that generic drugs will eventually overtake that revenue stream for AbbVie, but things are not as bad as that.With Allergan, Humira will account for only 38.4% of sales. And given that other drugs in AbbVie's portfolio are likely growing faster than Humira, that portion will continue to fall.Moreover, ABBV stock has a history of paying consistent quarterly dividends that tend to rise each year. You can see this in the chart here.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 81% more than today's price.For example, the company's historical yield over the last four years is 4.22%. Given today's yield of 4.8%, that implies AbbVie stock is worth almost 15% more than today.Also, based on its historical P/E ratio, the stock is worth over double today's price. And lastly, based on a comparison with its peers, the stock should have an 80% higher price.  Averaging these three methods, AbbVie stock is worth $182.30, or 87% more than today.Therefore, ABBV stock is one of the top drug stocks available. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $100 billionForward P/E: 13.8xDividend Yield: 4.5%Target Price Upside: 24%GlaxoSmithKline is the world's largest vaccine maker, and the UK-headquartered company is relying on proven methods of making a vaccine.  In fact, Reuters says it prefers the &quot;slow and steady approach of focusing on an established technology that has the best chance of reaching the widest possible demographic.&quot;They recognize that the world will need billions of doses, and therefore are not worried if they are first to market with a vaccine. Many other vaccine makers will not have the capacity to match what GlaxoSmithKline can do quickly. And once its vaccine is ready -- which, only started its trials in June -- it can make large amounts.AAdditionally, GlaxoSmithKline believes its vaccine will have better efficacy and last longer. This may mean it can work better with the elderly.As Barron's points out, the company has a huge pipeline of drugs, including options for cancer and HIV prevention. GlaxoSmithKline also plans on spinning off its consumer health division, which makes Advil and Panadol.Moreover, GSK stock has a history of paying consistent quarterly dividends that tend to have a higher year-end dividend each year. You can see this is true in the chart here.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA So, based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 24% more than today's price.For example, the company's historical price-to-earnings over the last four years is 25 times. Given today's P/E ratio of 14 times this year and 13.8 times next year, that implies GSK stock is worth almost 84% more than today.And lastly, based on a comparison with its peers, the stock should be much higher. Averaging three valuations methods, GSK stock is worth $51.51, or 24% more than today.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks Ready for Big Growth Collectively, GSK stock is another one to keep your eye on. Novartis (NVS)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $194 billionForward P/E: 14.1xDividend Yield: 3.6%Target Price Upside: 17%Novartis, a Swiss company, owns Sandoz, a well-known drug company. Sandoz plans on giving away 15 of its generic drugs that treat symptoms of COVID-19 to developing countries. In June, it agreed to $729 million in fines with the U.S. government to settle charges it paid kickbacks to doctors and patients.Moreover, Novartis will start a Covid-19 clinical trial of their cancer drug, Jakafi, which was developed by Incyte Corp.(NASDAQ:INCY). In turn, Novartis sells the drug outside the U.S. Barron's recently described the use of this cancer drug for a Covid-19 trial, and how Jakafi could help patients suffering severe immune overreactions caused by Covid-19.Novartis and Incyte have a Phase 3 trial, comparing those who use it with Covid-19 and those with Covid-19 who don't. The drug could eliminate hospital intensive care and mechanical breathing assistance. In fact, this drug is one of many in the category of existing drugs that could potentially act as a treatment for Covid-19.Investors should also consider its attractive 3.6% dividend yield. NVS stock has consistently paid annual dividends that reflect its profitability,and you can see this in the chart.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Therefore, based on my analysis, it is worth at least 17% more than today's price.For example, its historical price-to-earnings over the last four years is 21 times. And given today's P/E ratio of 14 times this year, NVS stock is worth almost 46% more than today.Finally, based on a comparison with its peers, the stock should be much higher. Averaging three valuations methods, NVS stock is worth $100.62, or 17% more than today -- making NVS stock another great drug stock. Pfizer (PFE)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $204 billionForward P/E: 11.8xDividend Yield: 4.1%Target Price Upside: 34%Pfizer recently indicated that its Covid-19 vaccine trials will be rolled out very quickly. On that note, Barron's reported that analysts believe the aggressive timeline was &quot;laudable, but seems challenging.&quot; One analyst believes that the positive vaccine data and the trial timeline will act as a &quot;catalyst&quot; for PFE stock.Moreover, Pfizer is working in collaboration with a German company, BioNtech (NASDAQ:BNTX), on this vaccine. And according to Barron's, all 24 patients who received lower doses of the vaccine developed levels of neutralizing antibodies after 28 days. These levels were about two times higher than those found in patients who have recovered from the coronavirus.On July 13, the FDA gave the companies' vaccine trial a &quot;fast track&quot; status. The two vaccines, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, could get &quot;priority review&quot; leading to approval within six months. By comparison, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) which uses similar technology, according to Reuters, got this fast track status in May.Nevertheless, this could why PFE stock has been rising. There are also valuation-related reasons to buy the stock.PFE stock has a history of paying consistent quarterly dividends that tend to rise each year. You can see this in the chart here.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 34% more than today's price.For example, its historical yield over the last four years is 3.77%. And given today's yield of 4.1%, PFE stock is worth almost 10% more than today.  * 4 Underappreciated Tech Stocks to Buy Now Before They Rise Averaging three valuation methods PFE stock is worth $49.15, or 34% more than today. Sanofi (SNY)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $134 billionForward P/E: 14.4xDividend Yield: 3.2%Target Price Upside: 29%Sanofi is also in the Covid-19 vaccine race as well. In late June, Sanofi partnered with another company, Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO). The companies have worked together before, and use a messenger RNA technology like Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech for their Covid-19 vaccine drug. In turn, this technology induces antibodies for a specific protein related to the novel coronavirus.Also, Sanofi's Pasteur division is going to spend $1.9 billion to get a vaccine by mid-2021, with trials are expected to start in Q4. Therefore, Sanofi offers both capital and a huge vaccine manufacturing capability to Translate Bio.Moreover, SNY stock has a history of paying consistent annual dividends that reflect its profitability each year. You can see this in the given chart.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA So, based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 29% more than today's price.For example, its historical price-to-earnings over the last four years is 40 times. Given today's P/E ratio of 35 times this year and 14.4 times next year, SNY stock is worth almost 43% more than today.Lastly, based on a comparison with its peers, SNY stock should be 6 to 7% higher. Averaging three valuations methods, SNY stock is worth $68.80, or 29% more than today. And with all of that in mind, PFE is one of the best drug stocks on the market. Summary: High Yield Drug StocksThese high yield drug stocks are admirable in that most of them are developing Covid-19 vaccines. In addition, they also have attractive dividends with attractive upside potential.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Overall, these are not day trades or momentum stocks. On the other hand, though, they are solidly profitable and can afford their high-yield dividends. They are likely to reach their target upside.Moreover, this chart sows that the average dividend yield is 4.1% for this group of stocks. They also boast a low average P/E at 12.5 times, and offer a potential upside of almost 38%. That is a very respectable ROI for most investors.Therefore, for these reasons, these five high-yielding drug stocks could be great options for investors.Mark Hake runs the Total Yield Value Guide which you can review here. The Guide focuses on high total yield value stocks.

2020-07-27,"Novartis (NVS) generics and biosimilars division, Sandoz, has announced a joint investment with the Austrian federal government to 'strengthen the future of integrated antibiotics manufacturing in Europe'.Sandoz intends to invest more than EUR 150 million over the next five years to boost the competitiveness of its integrated antibiotic manufacturing operations at Kundl, creating innovative manufacturing technology for both active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished dosage forms (FDFs).According to Sandoz CEO Richard Saynor: “Antibiotics are the backbone of modern medicine and our Kundl facility in Austria is the hub and center of the last remaining integrated production chain for antibiotics in the western world. This joint investment will help to keep it that way.”Under the plan, which is still subject to formal approvals, the Austrian federal government would contribute or coordinate public funding of EUR 50 million towards the total investment, as part of its efforts to increase European-based production of essential medicines. Sandoz and the Austrian government hope to close the agreement before year-end.The government funding would primarily support new process technology to produce API for penicillin products at Kundl. Sandoz would commit to related penicillin API production in Europe for the next 10 years, despite fierce global price competition, particularly from China.Indeed, Sandoz currently produces enough penicillin products at Kundl to potentially meet all Europe-wide demand. Kundl is the Sandoz competence center for antibiotic FDFs and the focal point of its European antibiotics manufacturing network, the company says.Shares in Novartis are down 11% year-to-date, but Citigroup's Andrew Baum retains a bullish view on the stock with a $112 price target (33% upside potential). (See Novartis stock analysis on TipRanks).He cited the stock's recent under-performance as a driving factor in his recent upgrade, alongside a backlog of product launches in China and a cardiovascular franchise poised to expand post-Covid-19.Related News:  AstraZeneca To Pay Up To $6B For Daiichi Cancer Drug Deal  NuVasive Spikes 5% After-Hours On Sharp Procedure Rebound  TCR2 Therapeutics Releases Positive Solid Tumor Data",Novartis Unveils €150M Antibiotics Investment For Europe

2020-08-04,"* Global ELARA trial demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) as measured by complete response rate     * Kymriah previously received FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation in r/r FL based on preliminary ELARA trial findings, reflecting the unmet need for additional treatment options for this cancer type     * ELARA trial findings will be included in regulatory submissions, with filing in the US anticipated in 2021, and the EU following. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting     * Interim analysis comes alongside milestones of 3,000th batch of CAR-T cells manufactured for patients worldwide and approval for commercial manufacturing at two additional sites in EuropeBasel, August 4, 2020 — Novartis today announced positive results from the Phase II ELARA trial of Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL). At the interim analysis, the global study met its primary endpoint of complete response rate (CRR), as assessed by independent review committee. CRR is a standard measure of patient response to therapy in FL. No new Kymriah safety signals were observed. Results from the ELARA trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and included in US and EU regulatory submissions.Kymriah was the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, and the first-ever CAR-T to be approved in two distinct indications. It is a one-time treatment designed to empower patients’ immune systems to fight their cancer. Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of r/r pediatric and young adult (up to 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)1.“We are pleased that Kymriah is showing meaningful results and may provide a potentially definitive treatment option for patients with relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “These results further support our efforts to reimagine medicine in this incurable malignancy and reach this underserved patient population, who are historically burdened with several years of various treatments.”Kymriah was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a strategic alliance between industry and academia, which was first-of-its-kind in CAR-T research and development.Kymriah is currently approved for use in at least one indication in more than 25 countries and at more than 250 certified treatment centers, with the ambition for further expansion to help fulfill the ultimate goal of bringing CAR-T cell therapy to every patient in need. As Novartis prepares for the launch of a potential third indication for Kymriah, manufacturing capacity continues to ramp up. The Novartis global CAR-T manufacturing footprint spans seven facilities total, across four continents. This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the manufacturing and supply chain. With recent approvals from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), commercial manufacturing of Kymriah is now ongoing at the Novartis-owned facilities in Stein, Switzerland and Les Ulis, France, joining the Novartis-owned facility in Morris Plains, New Jersey, USA.About Follicular Lymphoma  Follicular lymphoma, the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is an indolent lymphoma, and represents approximately 22% of NHL cases2,3. Despite new treatments that improve overall survival, FL is regarded as an incurable malignancy with a relapsing and remitting pattern4,5. Throughout the lifetime of a patient with relapsing FL, they may be exposed to a median of five lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines6,7. Although patients in third or later line treatment for FL have multiple systemic therapies available, the efficacy of these regimens drops off rapidly in later lines5. Additionally, because of this relapsing and remitting pattern, patients who are refractory to treatment or quickly relapse may exhaust available treatment options5.About the ELARA trial  ELARA is a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r FL. This international trial has enrolled patients from over 30 sites in 12 countries worldwide.In Q2 2020, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Kymriah in r/r FL, based on preliminary results from the ELARA trial. RMAT designation is intended to expedite the development and review of Kymriah as a regenerative therapy for this underserved patient population.About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell & Gene   Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell & gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis has a deep CAR-T pipeline and ongoing investment in manufacturing and supply chain process improvements. With active research underway to broaden the impact of cell therapy in oncology, Novartis is going deeper in hematological malignancies, reaching patients with other cancer types and evaluating next-generation CAR-T cell therapies that focus on new targets and utilize new technologies.Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to significantly invest in pioneering CAR-T research and initiate global CAR-T trials. Kymriah, the first approved CAR-T cell therapy, developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the foundation of Novartis’ commitment to CAR-T cell therapy.Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information  Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient's healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah, and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.  Please see the full Prescribing Information for Kymriah, including Boxed WARNING, and Medication Guide at www.Kymriah.comDisclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-08-05,"* Ofatumumab is a targeted B-cell therapy that delivers superior efficacy with a similar safety profile when compared with teriflunomide, a commonly prescribed oral treatment for multiple sclerosis1      * ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrated significant reductions in risk of relapses, confirmed disability worsening and profound reduction of active or new brain lesions1     * The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency are currently reviewing ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults      * If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here:    Basel, August 5, 2020 — Novartis today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the positive results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab (OMB157) 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both studies met the primary endpoints where ofatumumab showed a significant reduction in the number of confirmed relapses, evaluated as the annualized relapse rate (ARR)1.“ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab and its potential to become a first-choice treatment option that offers RMS patients the flexibility as they continue to live their lives,” said Krishnan Ramanathan, Neuroscience Global Program Head at Novartis. “Ofatumumab is a testament to our commitment to advance science and investigate potential treatments that reimagine care and address significant unmet needs at all parts of the RMS journey.”Results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies showed that compared with teriflunomide, ofatumumab:   * Significantly reduced the ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (P&lt;.001 in both studies) (primary endpoints)1  * Showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS (disability-related secondary endpoints)1  * Showed significant reduction of both gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) T1 lesions with a 97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, (both P&lt;.001), and an 82% and 85% relative reduction in new or enlarging T2 lesions in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (both P&lt;.001) (MRI-related secondary endpoints)1  * Showed superiority in reducing neuroaxonal damage in both studies, as measured by neurofilament light chain (NfL) serum concentrations (biomarker secondary endpoint)1; axonal loss, which begins at disease onset, is a detrimental consequence of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and is a major determinant of irreversible neurological disability in MS patients2  * Demonstrated a favorable trend in rate of 6-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI) events but did not reach significance (disability-related secondary endpoint)1  * Showed the annual rate of brain volume loss was not significantly different (MRI-related secondary endpoint)1  * Demonstrated an overall safety profile similar to teriflunomide, the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms was similar across both treatment groups. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1,3“The ASCLEPIOS studies found that ofatumumab produced a significant reduction in new inflammation, as well as fewer clinical relapses and progression events,” said Professor Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies. “A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated that nearly 9 out of 10 patients experienced no evidence of disease activity in the second year of treatment4. Ofatumumab represents a potential new option for RMS patients with greater efficacy compared to teriflunomide, a comparable safety profile, and the convenience of once monthly self-administration without the need for infusions.&quot;These data were published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.In February, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults. If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients.Regulatory approval for ofatumumab in the US is expected in September 2020 and in Europe by Q2 2021. Novartis is committed to bringing ofatumumab to patients worldwide and additional regulatory filings are currently underway.About ofatumumab   Ofatumumab (OMB157) is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for RMS that is self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. As shown in preclinical studies, ofatumumab is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion5. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen6. Once-monthly dosing of ofatumumab also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers flexibility7. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 20158.About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies  The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries9. Ofatumumab demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P&lt;.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Ofatumumab also showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month CDW and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW compared with teriflunomide in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1. Ofatumumab showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P&lt;.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P&lt;.001) vs teriflunomide1. Ofatumumab demonstrated that it lowered NfL levels in serum at the first assessment at Month 3 compared with teriflunomide. There was no difference in slope of brain volume change from baseline between treatments. In a measure of 6-month CDI events, a favorable trend for ofatumumab was seen but this did not reach significance vs teriflunomide1. Ofatumumab had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms also being similar across both treatment groups1. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1.Overall, ofatumumab, a fully-human antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord10. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide11, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)12. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease10.Novartis in Neuroscience  Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and specialty neurology. Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-08-17,"Basel, August 17, 2020 — Novartis welcomes the decision by the US District Court for the District of Delaware to uphold the validity of the Gilenya® (fingolimod) dosage regimen patent, as our intellectual property reflects the innovation and investment needed to invent and develop treatments that improve and extend people’s lives.The decision also holds that the generic fingolimod product proposed by HEC Pharm Co., Ltd. and HEC Pharm USA Inc. (“HEC”) in its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) will infringe the dosage regimen patent (US Patent No. 9,187,405). The decision is appealable to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.This decision continues the injunction against the marketing and sale of this and other generics that was granted to Novartis in June 2019. The dosage regimen patent with the associated pediatric exclusivity expires on December 25, 2027; however, Novartis has previously entered into settlement agreements with a number of manufacturers which had filed ANDAs to market a generic version of Gilenya and who were active in this litigation. Under the confidential terms of these settlements, these ANDA filers will be able to launch a generic version of Gilenya on an agreed-upon date that is prior to the expiration of the dosage regimen patent. In separate proceedings, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit dismissed an appeal of the Inter Partes Review (IPR) decision from the US Patent and Trademark Office upholding the validity of the dosage regimen patent. That decision is subject to further appeal.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-08-20,"* Kesimpta delivers powerful efficacy with a favorable safety profile and can be self-administered at home, addressing significant unmet needs for people living with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS)1     * Approval based on two Phase III ASCLEPIOS studies demonstrating significant reductions in risk of relapses, confirmed disability progression, Gd+ T1 brain lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions1      * Kesimpta may halt new disease activity in RMS patients as shown in a post hoc analysis, with 47.0% and 87.8% of patients treated with ofatumumab achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) within the first (0–12 months) and second year (12–24 months) of treatment, respectively2The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here:      Basel, August 20, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kesimpta® (ofatumumab, formerly OMB157) as an injection for subcutaneous use for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that has shown superior efficacy with a similar safety profile compared with teriflunomide and is a first-choice treatment option for RMS patients1. Kesimpta is the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once monthly at home via the Sensoready® autoinjector pen3.“This approval is wonderful news for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In the key clinical studies, this breakthrough treatment produced a profound reduction in new brain lesions, reducing relapses and slowing underlying disease progression1,” said Professor Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies. “Through its favorable safety profile and well-tolerated monthly injection regimen, patients can self-administer the treatment at home, avoiding visits to the infusion center1.”One of the goals when managing RMS is to preserve neurological function to slow down the worsening of disability4. Despite the availability of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the treatment of RMS, the majority of individuals with RMS continue to experience disease activity5. Evidence suggests early initiation of high-efficacy treatment can improve long-term outcomes for patients with RMS6.“Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease, and response to disease modifying treatment will vary among individuals,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at the National MS Society. “This makes it important to have a range of treatments available with different mechanisms of action and routes of administration. We are pleased to have an additional option approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.”Traditionally, B-cell treatments, which bind to and deplete B-cells associated with disease activity in MS, have predominantly been available in hospitals or infusion treatment centers, which can add costs to the healthcare system and present a lifestyle burden for some patients7,8. Kesimpta provides patients the flexibility of self-administering via once-monthly subcutaneous dosing requiring no premedication, eliminating the need to travel to an infusion center. The positive results from the APLIOS study—an open-label Phase II study to determine the bioequivalence of subcutaneous delivery of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS—and the ASCLEPIOS studies show Kesimpta to be a highly effective B-cell therapy that can be easily self-administered at home1,3.“At Novartis, we challenge treatment paradigms and strive to offer the best treatment choice for patients,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “When treating patients with RMS, Kesimpta is a meaningful treatment option that delivers both high efficacy and safety with the ability for patients to have more freedom in managing their disease. The development of Kesimpta is a great example of our commitment, knowledge and understanding of multiple sclerosis, which enabled us to identify a targeted treatment that can significantly improve patient outcomes and experience.”Ofatumumab was first approved by the FDA in 2009 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as an intravenous infusion with a high dose, administered by a healthcare provider. Ofatumumab was then investigated in an entirely new development program in RMS, as B-cells are known to play a critical role in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as MS7. The clinical development program for ofatumumab in RMS took 10 years and has involved more than 2,300 patients around the world as part of rigorous studies that were reflective of the broad patient population. Kesimpta was found to work through a distinct mode of action, and the treatment regimen (dosing)—which was specifically designed for RMS—plays a critical role in the outcome9. This is a different dosing regimen and route of administration than was previously approved for the CLL indication. The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority versus teriflunomide in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR, primary endpoint), 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions1. Results from these two studies were recently published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.Kesimpta is expected to be available in the United States in early September.* Additional regulatory filings are currently underway across the world, and regulatory approval for Kesimpta in Europe is expected by Q2 2021.*Time of availability may vary as healthcare providers integrate Kesimpta into their practices.About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies  The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Kesimpta 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1,882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries10. Kesimpta demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 59% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P&lt;.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Kesimpta also showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (P=.002) in 3-month CDP compared with teriflunomide in pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1. Kesimpta showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (98% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P&lt;.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P&lt;.001) vs teriflunomide1.Kesimpta had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and malignancies also being similar across both treatment groups1. Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions, and local injection site reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions with Kesimpta (incidence greater than 10%)1.A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated Kesimpta may halt new disease activity  in RMS patients. It showed the odds of achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3; no relapses, no MRI lesions, and no disability worsening combined) with ofatumumab versus teriflunomide were &gt;3-fold higher at Months 0–12 (47.0% vs 24.5% of patients; P&lt;.001) and &gt;8-fold higher at Months 12–24 (87.8% vs 48.2% of patients; P&lt;.001)2. Overall Kesimpta, an antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1. About APLIOS study  The APLIOS study is a 12-week, open-label, Phase II bioequivalence study to determine the onset of B-cell depletion with Kesimpta subcutaneous monthly injections and the bioequivalence of subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe—as used in ASCLEPIOS I and II—and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS. Patients were randomized according to injection device and site including the abdomen and the thigh. B-cell depletion was measured nine times over 12 weeks and Gd+ lesion counts were assessed at baseline and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. Regardless of injection device or site, Kesimpta 20 mg subcutaneous monthly injections resulted in rapid, close to complete and sustained B-cell depletion; the proportion of patients with B-cell concentrations of &lt;10 cells/μL was &gt;65% after the first injection by Day 7, 94% by Week 4, and sustained &gt;95% at all following injections. Kesimpta treatment reduced the mean number of Gd+ lesions from baseline (1.5) to 0.8, 0.3 and 0.1 by Weeks 4, 8 and 12, respectively; the proportion of patients free from Gd+ lesions at the corresponding time points were 66.5%, 86.7% and 94.1%, respectively3.About Kesimpta® (ofatumumab, formerly OMB157)  Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that provides the flexibility of self-administration for adults with RMS. It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. Initial loading doses of Kesimpta are given at Weeks 0, 1 and 2, with the first injection performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As shown in preclinical studies, Kesimpta is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion9. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen11. Once-monthly dosing of Kesimpta also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers more flexibility12. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 201513. About Multiple Sclerosis   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord14. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide15, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)16. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease14. Novartis in Neuroscience  Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and specialty neurology.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-08-22,"* Phase III COMBI-i trial did not meet primary endpoint for patients with advanced BRAF V600-mutated melanoma  * Tafinlar + Mekinist remains an effective treatment option based on previously reported large, Phase III clinical trials1,2     * Spartalizumab development program continues, investigating the immunotherapy in combination with other anti-cancer agentsBasel, August 22, 2020 — Novartis announced today that the Phase III COMBI-i study evaluating the investigational immunotherapy spartalizumab (PDR001), in combination with the targeted therapies Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) and Mekinist® (trametinib), did not meet its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The trial was conducted among untreated patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600 mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma, compared to Tafinlar + Mekinist alone3.“While the COMBI-i trial did not reach its primary endpoint, the study’s findings give us valuable insights into the role the investigational immunotherapy spartalizumab may play in future cancer therapy combinations and underscore the previously established importance of Tafinlar + Mekinist for these patients,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “Novartis remains committed to melanoma patients through ongoing research, and we continue to deliver the approved combination therapy Tafinlar + Mekinist to patients around the world. We extend our gratitude to the patients and investigators who participated in the COMBI-i study. Their partnership has expanded our understanding of spartalizumab and its potential role in future cancer treatments.”Novartis and the COMBI-i study investigators will continue to review the data to learn more from the results, which are expected to be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting. Novartis remains committed to exploring new uses for immunotherapy in cancer treatment, including the ongoing development of spartalizumab, across a range of tumor types.  About the COMBI-i Study3  COMBI-i was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study comparing the combination of anti-PD1 spartalizumab with Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib) versus the combination of placebo with Tafinlar and Mekinist. The study was conducted among previously untreated patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. The COMBI-i study was conducted in three parts. Results reported today are from part 3 of the trial.About Spartalizumab (PDR001)  Spartalizumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody directed against the human programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor. Its development program continues investigating the immunotherapy across a range of tumor types.About Tafinlar + Mekinist Combination  Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to treat people with a type of skin cancer called melanoma:  * That has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and  * That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” (V600E or V600K mutation-positive) geneTafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to help prevent melanoma that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” gene from coming back after the cancer has been removed by surgery.Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic NSCLC), and that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF V600E” gene.Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of thyroid cancer called anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC):  * That has spread to other parts of the body and you have no satisfactory treatment options, and  * That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” geneTafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, should not be used to treat people with wild-type BRAF melanoma. Mekinist should not be used to treat people who already have received a BRAF inhibitor for treatment of their melanoma and it did not work or is no longer working.Your health care provider will perform a test to make sure that Tafinlar and Mekinist , in combination, are right for you.It is not known if Tafinlar and Mekinist are safe and effective in children.Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects such as the risk of new cancers, including both skin cancer and nonskin cancer. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider immediately for any skin changes, including a new wart, skin sore, or bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or color of a mole.When Tafinlar is used in combination with Mekinist, it can cause serious bleeding problems, especially in the brain or stomach, that can lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider and get medical help right away if they have any signs of bleeding, including headaches, dizziness, or feel weak, cough up blood or blood clots, vomit blood or their vomit looks like “coffee grounds,” or red or black stools that look like tar.Mekinist, alone or in combination with Tafinlar, can cause inflammation of the intestines or tears in the stomach or intestines that can lead to death. Patients should report to their health care provider immediately if they have any of the following symptoms: bleeding, diarrhea (loose stools) or more bowel movements than usual, stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness, fever, or nausea.Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause blood clots in the arms or legs, which can travel to the lungs and can lead to death.

2020-08-23,"Novartis AG announced on Saturday that its investigational spartalizumab immunotherapy drug combined with Tafinlar and Mekinist therapies failed to meet its primary endpoint in a late-stage trial for the treatment of a type of advanced skin cancer.Novartis (NVS) said that the Phase III COMBI-i study evaluating the investigational spartalizumab (PDR001) immunotherapy, in combination with prescription medications Tafinlar and Mekinist, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival.The trial was conducted among untreated patients with unresectable or metastatic (stage IV) BRAF V600 mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma, compared to the treatment of Tafinlar and Mekinist alone. Spartalizumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody directed against the human programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor.“While the COMBI-i trial did not reach its primary endpoint, the study’s findings give us valuable insights into the role the investigational immunotherapy spartalizumab may play in future cancer therapy combinations and underscore the previously established importance of Tafinlar + Mekinist for these patients,” said Novartis Chief Medical Officer John Tsai. “Novartis remains committed to melanoma patients through ongoing research, and we continue to deliver the approved combination therapy Tafinlar + Mekinist to patients around the world.”Novartis said that together with the COMBI-i study investigators, it will review the data to learn more from the results, which are expected to be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting. In addition, the Swiss drugmaker said that it will continue to explore new uses for immunotherapy in cancer treatment, including the ongoing development of spartalizumab, across a range of tumor types.Novartis shares have now recouped a large chunk of their losses from earlier this year but they are still down 8.8% year-to-date. (See Novartis stock analysis on TipRanks)Still, Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans retains a bullish view on the stock saying that the drugmaker has a diversified portfolio of medications, “with a lot of innovation in cancer development as well, in different areas from Merck: Gene therapy to transfer genetic material into a patient for a cure.”Evans added that these are “high-price, highly innovative, patient-specific treatments.”Related News:   Gilead Says FDA Could Broaden Remdesivir Use Despite Data; Analyst Slashes PT   Gilead Sinks After-Hours As FDA Rejects Arthritis Application   Verona Up 10% On Lung Trial Kick Off; Analyst Initiates Stock At ‘Buy’ More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Arcturus Inks Deal with Israel For Covid-19 Candidate; Analyst Sees 25% Upside   * Tesla Seeks To Market Sensor Device To Detect Child Left In Hot Car   * Gilead Says FDA Could Broaden Remdesivir Use Despite Data; Analyst Slashes PT   * Deere Gains 4% On Raised 2020 Profit Outlook",Novartis’ Skin Cancer Drug Candidate Fails Late-Stage Trial Target

2020-08-26,"Novartis drug candidate asciminib notched a trial win against Pfizer's Bosulif, the Swiss drugmaker said on Wednesday, as it pushes to expand medicines for chronic myeloid leukaemia in patients for whom other treatments stopped working.  Asciminib produced a major molecular response (MMR) rate at 24 weeks that was superior to Pfizer's already-approved rival medicine, Novartis said, in a late-stage study of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who had already gotten at least two so-called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs).  People with CML saw treatment revolutionised 20 years ago with TKIs like Novartis's Gleevec and later other medicines that turned the disease from a death sentence into a treatable condition in which many patients had good, long-lasting responses.",Novartis push to expand cancer arsenal gets trial win against Pfizer drug

The study evaluates asciminib – a novel investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP) – in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)1. Patients with failure or intolerance to the most recently administered TKI therapy were included in the trial1.“Our ability to treat patients with TKIs changed CML care forever. However, the risk of disease progression is a reality for many patients – especially those who experience resistance to sequential TKI therapy or those who cannot adhere to treatment due to the daily impact of intolerable side effects16,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We are incredibly grateful to the patients and investigators around the world who participated in this study. These results with asciminib are a testament to our commitment to further transform CML care – this time through STAMP inhibition, by exploiting a natural regulatory mechanism of the ABL kinase.”Data from the ASCEMBL trial will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting, and results will be shared with regulatory authorities. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for asciminib.Findings from earlier studies of asciminib were presented during past annual meetings of the European Hematology Association, and some details can be found here13,14.About asciminib (ABL001)  Asciminib (ABL001) is an investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP). As a STAMP inhibitor, asciminib may help address tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistance and intolerance in later treatment lines of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)8-14, and it is being studied in several clinical trials in hopes of helping patients across multiple treatment lines of CML7,10,11,13-15,17.About ASCEMBL  ASCEMBL is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the oral investigational treatment asciminib (ABL001) versus bosutinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)1. Patients with failure or intolerance to the most recently administered TKI therapy were included in the trial1.About Novartis Commitment to CML  Our ongoing research in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) has helped transform the disease from a fatal leukemia to a chronic condition in most patients. Novartis maintains an unwavering commitment to scientific innovation and access to care for patients worldwide. As an organization committed to patients, Novartis continues to reimagine CML care by pursuing ambitious goals with courage, passion and commitment for the global CML community.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Patients taking LNP023 as an add-on to eculizumab saw significant reductions in their lactate dehydrogenase levels, a biomarker of intravascular hemolysis, and marked improvement in their hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Compared with baseline values on eculizumab alone, LNP023 increased Hb by a clinically relevant 2.87 g/dL (p&lt;0.001), and all but two patients (80%) achieved Hb levels &gt;12 g/dL in the absence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. All patients required RBC transfusions prior to starting LNP023 treatment.“In the study, LNP023 given orally resulted in transfusion avoidance and meaningful clinical benefit in PNH patients who remained anemic and dependent on transfusions despite standard of care anti-complement treatment,” said Prof. Antonio Risitano, Federico II University, Naples, and Head of Hematology and the BMT Unit, Ospedale Moscati, Avellino, Italy, who with Prof. Régis Peffault de Latour, Head of the French Reference Center for Aplastic Anemia and PNH, Saint-Louis Hospital, and University of Paris, are principal investigators of the study.“These new data clearly highlight that LNP023 can control the mechanisms of hemolysis in this disease, and may potentially change the treatment paradigm for PNH,” said Prof. Peffault de Latour.PNH is a rare and life threatening blood disorder characterized by complement-driven hemolysis, thrombosis and impaired bone marrow function,6 resulting in debilitating symptoms that can impact patient’s quality of life.7,8,9To date, after at least six months of stable LNP023 add-on therapy, and at the investigators’ discretion, seven patients (70%) have discontinued eculizumab and remained on LNP023 as monotherapy. Importantly, all patients on LNP023 monotherapy retained their Hb levels with no changes in biomarkers of disease activity and no signs or symptoms of breakthrough hemolysis.LNP023 also demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no serious treatment-related infections or thromboembolic events. Following the cut-off date for the presented data, one participant, who had severe lymphopenia at study entry, discontinued treatment due to a serious adverse event (AE) of lymphoproliferative disorder. The most common AEs reported were headache, insomnia, rhinitis, and rhinorrhea.“These positive Phase II results are promising and pave the way for further evaluation of oral LNP023 as a potential monotherapy treatment and standard of care for PNH,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We will continue to develop LNP023 in this condition while exploring its use in a range of other diseases with complement system involvement.”About LNP023  LNP023 is a first-in-class, orally administered, potent and highly selective factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway.3,4 LNP023 is currently in clinical development for PNH and a number of renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy, complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and membranous nephropathy.In PNH, LNP023 acts upstream of the C5 terminal pathway, preventing not only intravascular hemolysis but also extravascular hemolysis. In doing so, LNP023 may have a therapeutic advantage over current standard of care by targeting the underlying pathophysiology.3,4 Novartis is conducting a second ongoing Phase II study (NCT03896152) to evaluate LNP023 as monotherapy for anti-C5 naïve PNH patients, with plans to start a Phase III study later this year.10The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designations to LNP023 for the treatment of PNH and C3G.About the Study  NCT03439839 is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, sequential 2-cohort trial to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of LNP023 in PNH patients (cohort 1: n=10) with active hemolysis despite treatment with eculizumab. The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of LNP023 on the reduction of hemolysis when administered in addition to standard of care (eculizumab) at Week 13.After 13 weeks of treatment with LNP023, patients could be entered into a long-term study extension, which also included the possibility of modifying or discontinuing eculizumab treatment, at the investigators’ discretion.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-08-30,"* Pooled data from Phase III ORION-10 and -11 showed highly consistent efficacy, tolerability and safety profile over 17 months on twice-yearly subcutaneous dosing in 2,300 patients (of which 1,164 were on inclisiran) 1     * New post-hoc analysis demonstrates 99% of patients treated with inclisiran showed placebo-adjusted reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of ≥30% with a mean reduction of 54.1% from baseline (observed values)2      * 88% of inclisiran-treated patients achieved LDL-C placebo-adjusted reduction of at least 50% at any time point during the study (observed values)2      * Inclisiran is currently under review by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia (including Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia) in adults who have elevated LDL-C while being on a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapyBasel, August 30, 2020 — Novartis today announced results from a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from the Phase III ORION-10 and -11 trials evaluating the individual responses of patients on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction with inclisiran, a first-in-class investigational treatment for hyperlipidemia in adults. This new analysis of inclisiran showed a highly consistent effect, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo, on a twice-yearly dosing schedule after an initial dose and one 3 months later, across individual patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or risk equivalents over 17 months of treatment.Presented at the ESC Congress 2020, the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology, the analysis evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of inclisiran on top of a maximally tolerated dose of statins, in two studies of more than 2,300 patients (of which 1,164 were on inclisiran) from the Phase III trials. Results demonstrated a low inter-individual variability, with 99% of inclisiran-treated patients showing a placebo-adjusted ≥30% reduction of their LDL-C levels with a mean reduction of 54.1% from baseline (observed values)2­ .“This analysis confirms that as a small interfering RNA (siRNA), inclisiran provides a remarkably consistent treatment profile. Nearly all patients from these trials achieved clinically meaningful reductions of their LDL-C levels over the 17 month period, and inclisiran had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo,” said ORION-11 principal investigator Kausik Ray, M.D., Professor of Public Health, Consultant Cardiologist, Imperial College London. “These efficacy and safety results showcase the promise of inclisiran as a therapy for those ASCVD patients who cannot reach their LDL-C goals.”An LDL-C reduction of at least 50% was reached by 88.4% of patients at any time point in the study (observed values). After 17 months, 66.4% of the inclisiran group had a reduction in LDL-C of at least 50% as compared to 2.5% from the placebo group (observed values) 2. Overall, inclisiran was well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. All patients were on twice-yearly dosing, following an initial dose and one 3 months later.“There remains an urgent need for innovative LDL-C-lowering therapies for patients not reaching their LDL-C target goals with current standard of care. This analysis reinforced our view of inclisiran’s therapeutic value and its potential as the first cholesterol-lowering siRNA,” said David Soergel, M.D., Global Head of Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Drug Development, Novartis. “With a unique twice-yearly dosing, if approved, inclisiran may fit seamlessly into patients’ regular healthcare visits and help us reimagine treatment for ASCVD.”Inclisiran is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia (including Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia) in adults who have elevated LDL-C while being on a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy.About the ORION-10 and -11 Phase III LDL-C Lowering Studies   ORION-10 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional in an initial dose, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,561 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), despite a maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C-lowering therapies (e.g. a statin or ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-10, inclisiran delivered mean placebo-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 52% (P&lt;.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 54% (P&lt;.0001) from 3 through 18 months (observed values). The study was conducted at 145 sites in the United States1.ORION-11 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional in an initial dose, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,617 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents and elevated LDL-C despite a maximum tolerated dose of statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-11, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted change in LDL-C reductions of 50% (P&lt;.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 49% (P&lt;.0001) from 3 through 18 months (observed values). The international study was conducted at 70 sites in seven countries1.About ASCVD  Atherosclerosis corresponds to the accumulation of lipids over time – mainly LDL-C – in the inner lining of the arteries. Unexpected rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque can cause an atherosclerotic cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke3. Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) accounts for over 85% of all cardiovascular disease deaths4. ASCVD is the primary cause of death in the EU and its burden in the US is greater than that from any other chronic diseases5,6.About Inclisiran  Inclisiran, an investigational cholesterol-lowering treatment, was added to the pipeline from the Novartis acquisition of The Medicines Company. Inclisiran will potentially be the first and only LDL-C-lowering small-interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment. It is intended to be administered by a healthcare professional by subcutaneous injection with an initial dose, again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter. Its twice-yearly dosing by subcutaneous injection may integrate seamlessly into a patient’s healthcare routine. As a siRNA, inclisiran is thought to harness the body’s natural process of clearing LDL-C from the bloodstream. Inclisiran is a double-stranded siRNA, conjugated on the sense strand with triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate uptake by hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, inclisiran increases LDL-C receptor recycling and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, thereby increasing LDL-C uptake by hepatocytes and lowering LDL-C levels in the circulation. Data from each of the Phase III studies was recently published online, ahead of print, in The New England Journal of Medicine. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORION-4, is ongoing.In the Phase III trials, inclisiran was reported to be well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. The most common adverse reactions reported (≥3% of patients treated with inclisiran and occurring more frequently than placebo) were, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, dyspnea, bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Adverse events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than placebo and were generally mild and none were severe or persistent1,7.Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.About Novartis in Cardiovascular-Renal-Metabolism  Bending the curve of life requires addressing some of society’s biggest public health concerns.

2020-09-01,"* 2025 target to increase patients reached in LMICs with strategic innovative medicines by 200% and the Novartis Flagship Programs by 50% - bringing potential reach to over 23 million patients across these initiatives      * Enhanced target for full carbon neutrality across all company operations and entire supply chain by 20301     * New collaboration with the African Union initiated Africa Medical Supplies Platform to aid supply of Novartis COVID-19 Pandemic Response Portfolio      * Company completed enrollment in the CAN-COVID Phase III clinical trial with expected readout in Q4 2020             Basel, September 1, 2020 — Novartis will host a virtual investor event today to provide a comprehensive overview of the company’s progress in its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy. “ESG is a key strategic priority for the Novartis Board and Executive Committee and we made progress in all of our key ESG strategic pillars,” said Joerg Reinhardt, Chairman of Novartis. “Moving forward, we are further reinforcing the way we measure our impact with a set of new ESG targets, increasing our ambition to drive more value for society.” Novartis focuses on 4 key strategic ESG pillars defined as material by stakeholders; Ethical Standards, Pricing and Access, Global Health Challenges and Corporate Citizenship. The company has developed ambitious and challenging targets against key elements in each of these areas. These include addressing access and global health challenges, which are areas with the highest unmet need worldwide and where Novartis can have the greatest material ESG impact. Novartis is also reinforcing its ambition to be a leader in environmental sustainability in the healthcare industry, further strengthening its already ambitious target for carbon neutrality to include its entire supply chain by 2030.Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, said “Novartis continues to take bold steps to deepen our impact on major global challenges, like access to medicines and climate change. By establishing targets to measure what matters most for stakeholders, we are further embedding ESG into the core of our business operations and strengthening our committment  to communicating our progress in a transparent way.”New targets to expand impact on access to medicines and climate change   As part of the company’s ambition to expand access to innovative medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) Novartis is committing to increase patient reach with its strategic innovative medicines by at least 200% by 2025. In addition, Novartis plans to increase patient reach of its global health flagship programs in Leprosy, Malaria, Chagas Disease and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) by at least 50% over the same time period. Novartis estimates achievement of these targets to result in a potential reach of over 23 million patients across both initiatives. Novartis also further strengthened its carbon neutrality target to aim for full carbon neutrality across its supply chain (Scope 1, 2, 3) by 2030, in addition to its already stated target for carbon neutrality in its own operations by 2025. This new target replaces the previous target aiming for a 50% reduction (vs a 2016 baseline) in carbon emissions across the supply chain. Novartis also announced a collaboration with the African Union (55 Member States which represent all the countries on the African continent) initiated Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP) to support the supply of medicines from the Novartis COVID-19 Pandemic Response Portfolio.  This portfolio of 15 medicines, including Dexamethasone, for symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 for LMICs was launched in July 2020 and is provided through Sandoz, the generics and biosimilar division of Novartis. AMSP, a non-profit initiative, provides an online platform that aggregates certified medical equipment, clinical management devices and medicines to supply African governments in need of critical COVID-19 supplies. This new collaboration aims to help alleviate supply and logistical constraints by ensuring efficient and rapid access of the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Portfolio medicines to African governments.Key highlights on progress in the last 12 months:  Novartis also highlighted the strong progress made in the last 12 months on a number of key areas, reinforcing ESG as a cornerstone of its strategy.Access Principles &#92;- Novartis launched its Access Principles2 in 2018 and committed to systematically integrating access strategies in how it researches, develops and delivers all new medicines. Through Emerging Market Brands (EMBs) and broader access strategies, Novartis reached 376,000 patients in the first half of 2020. Novartis also established a new business strategy and single organization to broaden patient reach and availability of its portfolio of medicines in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is home to the largest underserved patient population in the world. The newly formed sub-Saharan Africa unit is deploying innovative approaches to sustainably double patient reach across the full income pyramid by 2022. Adding to partnerships with Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and AMSP, Novartis SSA unit is also starting strategic partnerships with different governments to ensure better access to Novartis medicines.Response to COVID-19 Pandemic &#92;- Novartis has made significant contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. These include leveraging its R&D capabilities, clinical trials expertise, supply of medicines and philanthropic aid. There are in total over 15 Novartis medicines being studied in 35 investigator-initiated trials around the world. The company completed enrollment in CAN-COVID Phase III clinical trial, studying canakinumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with an expected readout in Q4 2020. Novartis also continues a Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the use of ruxolitinib in COVID-19 patients with a severe immune reaction. The company has agreed to donate USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis continues to be active in cross-industry research initiatives such as the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI).Ethical Standards &#92;- Continuing its long term journey to build trust with society, Novartis also resolved its material legacy litigation matters including the settlements related to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and US speaker programs. To further reinforce principles-based thinking and ethical decision-making in the organization and through interactions with external stakeholders, the new Novartis Code of Ethics which was co-created by thousands of our associates and is embedded in an innovative decision making framework, launches today, September 1, 2020.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-09-07,"* High-dose, once-daily Enerzair® Breezhaler® [IND/GLY/MF] reduced asthma exacerbation rates by 21% (moderate or severe) and 31% (severe) versus medium-dose, over 52 weeks1  * Once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler, which includes an optional digital companion (sensor and app), is the first LABA/LAMA/ICS* fixed-dose combination approved for patients whose asthma is uncontrolled with a LABA/ICS2     * Post hoc analysis complements findings from pivotal Phase III IRIDIUM study recently published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine3 Basel, September 7, 2020 — Novartis today announced that high-dose, once-daily Enerzair® Breezhaler® (indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate [IND/GLY/MF]) significantly reduces both moderate-or-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates in patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on medium- or high-dose long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA)/inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), when compared with a once-daily medium-dose of the same treatment. The post hoc analysis from the pivotal Phase III IRIDIUM study—presented virtually at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2020— also showed the safety profile for high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler was in line with previous studies in the Phase III/IIIb PLATINUM clinical development program.“This post hoc analysis supports the potential of high-dose IND/GLY/MF as an effective step-up treatment option to further reduce asthma exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled asthma,” said Kenneth Chapman, Professor of Medicine, University of Toronto. “These findings also complement the efficacy and safety data from the pivotal IRIDIUM study, which indicated the potential of high-dose IND/GLY/MF to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations compared with salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu), a LABA/ICS* standard-of-care.”The analysis showed high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler (150/50/160 μg) significantly reduced the annualized rate of moderate-or-severe asthma exacerbations by 21% (p=0.026) and severe exacerbations by 31% (p=0.003) in asthma patients not adequately controlled on current inhaled therapies, compared with medium-dose (150/50/80 μg) over 52 weeks.High-dose Enerzair Breezhaler also reduced the annualized rate of all exacerbations (mild, moderate and severe) by 14% (p=0.132) compared with medium-dose, but this finding was not statistically significant. Both doses tested presented with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.*LABA; long-acting beta2-agonist, LAMA; long-acting muscarinic antagonist, ICS; inhaled corticosteroid.About Uncontrolled Asthma  Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled4,5. Despite current therapy, over 40% of patients with asthma at Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 3, and over 45% at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled6,7. Patients with uncontrolled asthma may downplay or underestimate the severity of their disease and are at a higher risk of exacerbation, hospitalization or death8–10. Barriers, such as less than optimal adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, treatment mismatch, safety issues with oral corticosteroids and ineligibility for biologics, have created an unmet medical need in asthma11–14.    About Enerzair® Breezhaler® in the EU  On July 7, 2020, Novartis announced European Commission (EC) approval of Enerzair Breezhaler (QVM149; indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate [IND/GLY/MF]) 150/50/160 μg once-daily as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a high-dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year2. This formulation combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) and glycopyrronium bromide (a LAMA) with mometasone furoate (ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler device. Glycopyrronium bromide certain use and formulation intellectual property were exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Sosei Heptares and Vectura. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/GLY/MF (worldwide excluding the US).IND/GLY/MF will be administered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler device, which enables once-daily inhalation using a single inhaler. IND/GLY/MF is the first asthma treatment in the EU that can be prescribed together with a digital companion; the Propeller Health app and sensor custom-built for the Breezhaler device. The digital companion will provide patients with inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data that can be shared with their physician in order to help them make better therapeutic decisions. The sensor for the Breezhaler device was developed by Propeller Health and is a CE marked medical device, designed and licensed to Novartis for use with the Breezhaler inhaler worldwide. The sensor includes a microchip, a microphone, Bluetooth capabilities, an antenna and a battery. The sensor does not alter the drug delivery characteristics of the Breezhaler inhaler itself but produces a recording of each administered dose. Based on the patient’s recorded medication usage, personalized content is presented within the app to help the patient better self-manage their asthma.In keeping with the Novartis commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our asthma combinations, IND/GLY/MF will be available in the hydrofluoroalkane/chlorofluorocarbon (HFA/CFC)-free Breezhaler device. Novartis aims to drive sustainability and has set ambitious targets to minimize its impact on climate, waste and water, including targets to become carbon neutral in company operations by 2025.About the IRIDIUM Study3  IRIDIUM was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY/MF with IND/MF in patients with asthma.The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of IND/GLY/MF (high: 150/50/160 μg and medium: 150/50/80 μg), versus two corresponding IND/MF doses (high: 150/320 μg and medium: 150/160 μg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma, as determined by pulmonary function testing and effects on asthma control.All patients were required to be symptomatic at screening and to have one or more exacerbations in the previous year, despite being on treatment with medium- or high-stable doses of LABA/ICS. Approximately 3,092 male and female adult patients with asthma were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 (approximately 618 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive one of the following treatments:  * IND/GLY/MF 150/50/80 μg (once-daily)  * IND/GLY/MF 150/50/160 μg (once-daily)  * IND/MF 150/160 μg (once-daily)  * IND/MF 150/320 μg (once-daily)  * Sal/Flu 50/500 μg (twice-daily)             The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of both high-dose IND/GLY/MF versus high-dose IND/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF versus medium-dose IND/MF, all delivered once-daily, in improving trough FEV1 (volume of air that can be forced out in the first second of expiration approximately 24 hours post-administration of study drug) after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of both doses of IND/GLY/MF versus respective doses of IND/MF, in improving Asthma Control Questionnaire score after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.Other secondary analyses included reduction of exacerbation rate, comparing high-dose IND/GLY/MF with high-dose IND/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF with medium-dose IND/MF. Secondary analyses also included efficacy comparisons for both doses of IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu (50/500 μg).Disclaimer  This media update contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-09-08,"* Novartis will present 48 abstracts from its leading MS portfolio, including new data on recently FDA-approved Kesimpta® (ofatumumab)—the first and only self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for relapsing forms of MS (RMS)—Mayzent® (siponimod) and Gilenya® (fingolimod)     * New pivotal data from ASCLEPIOS trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Kesimpta in a subgroup of treatment-naïve RMS patients will be presented for the first time1     * Subgroup analyses of the EXPAND trial showed sustained benefits on disability, cognitive processing speed and relapse outcomes for up to five years in patients with active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) treated continuously with Mayzent, highlighting potential value of early treatment initiation2     * Findings from real-world study show MSProDiscussTM tool is valuable in facilitating MS progression-related conversations with patients in daily practice3Basel, September 8, 2020 — Novartis announced today it will present 48 abstracts at the upcoming MSVirtual2020: 8th Joint ACTRIMS-ECTRIMS Meeting, September 11–13, 2020. The breadth of data being presented highlights the strength and promise of the company’s MS portfolio to improve the lives of patients across the MS spectrum.“As a global leader in neuroscience, we have been committed to bringing life-changing therapies to people living with diseases like MS for more than 75 years,” said Estelle Vester-Blokland, Global Head Neuroscience Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “For the first time in our growing portfolio, we are proud to be presenting data from three of our approved MS treatments across the MS disease spectrum, which is a significant milestone of our commitment to reimaging medicine for the MS community.”Novartis key highlights at MSVirtual2020: 8th Joint ACTRIMS-ECTRIMS Meeting include:New efficacy and safety data on Kesimpta, the first and only self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for patients with relapsing MS (RMS), indicate potential benefits of starting high-efficacy therapy early with Kesimpta. Kesimpta was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment in RMS to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing–remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults, in August 20204:  * New findings from the ASCLEPIOS Phase III trials demonstrate Kesimpta’s superior efficacy vs teriflunomide in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients with low absolute relapse rates, very low magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion activity and prolonged time to disability worsening1.  * Additional safety and efficacy data on Kesimpta show that no new safety signals were identified in patients treated with Kesimpta. In this extended analysis, Kesimpta showed a safety profile that remains consistent with data reported in the Phase II and III clinical trials5.  * Results from the ASCLEPIOS trials also demonstrated that baseline serum neurofilament light levels (sNfL) were prognostic for lesion formation and brain volume loss for at least two years. These results support that sNfL can complement clinical assessments and help identify patients at high risk for future disease activity6.New scientific evidence on Mayzent, the first and only oral treatment studied and proven to slow disability progression in a broad range of secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients, highlight delays to disability progression and benefits in cognitive performance in patients treated with Mayzent:  * Results from EXCHANGE interim analysis showed a good safety and tolerability profile when patients switched from an oral or injectable disease-modifying therapy (DMT) to Mayzent7.  * Further EXPAND data continue to demonstrate improvements of cognitive processing speed in patients with active and non-active SPMS treated with Mayzent8.  * Long-term data analyses from the EXPAND trial showed sustained benefits on disability, cognitive processing speed and relapse outcomes for up to five years in patients with active SPMS treated continuously with Mayzent versus those who switched from placebo, highlighting the value of early treatment initiation2.New safety data on Gilenya, a cornerstone of MS treatment and the only oral DMT approved to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults and children from 10 years of age and older, were presented:                * Additional safety findings from studies on Gilenya highlight a low risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients receiving Gilenya, and prevalence estimates of major congenital malformations among live births are similar to those from an untreated MS population9,10.  * Results from the Phase IV FLUENT study, which assessed immune phenotype biomarkers in patients receiving Gilenya treatment, expand our knowledge of changes in immune cell profiles over the short and long term in RMS patients treated with Gilenya11.New data beyond transformative medicines on MSProDiscussTM, a first-of-its-kind clinically validated tool designed to facilitate physician–patient conversation on signs of progression in MS and to potentially allow earlier identification of patients transitioning from relapsing forms of MS to SPMS:  * Results from a large, real-world qualitative survey on MSProDiscussTM in 34 countries showed that MSProDiscuss is a useful tool which is easy to use in patient consultations3.              Throughout MSVirtual2020: 8th Joint ACTRIMS-ECTRIMS Meeting, Novartis will host dedicated content on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord12. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide13, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), SPMS and primary progressive (PPMS)14. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease12. Novartis in Neuroscience  Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and specialty neurology. Disclaimer  This media update contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-09-08,"Shares of Novartis (NYSE: NVS) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $86.58.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $95.00  * Volume: 3417  * Open Interest: 2759Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 1, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-11,"* New post hoc data from Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials showed newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients experienced reductions in annualized relapse rates, MRI lesion activity and reductions in time to disability worsening when treated with Kesimpta vs teriflunomide1  * Additional safety data in over 1,800 patients who continued Kesimpta treatment or switched therapy from previous studies reinforce the favorable safety profile of Kesimpta in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS)2     * Baseline serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in the ASCLEPIOS trials demonstrated a prognostic value for disease activity and worsening in all patients, including newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients3      * Kesimpta is the first and only FDA-approved, self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for adult with RMS4The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here: Basel, September 11, 2020 — Novartis announced today new post hoc data showing the efficacy and safety of Kesimpta® (ofatumumab), a targeted B-cell therapy, in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) who are newly diagnosed as well as ongoing safety study findings. These data—presented at the MSVirtual2020: 8th Joint ACTRIMS-ECTRIMS Meeting taking place on September 11–13, 2020—further support Kesimpta as a first-choice treatment option for adults with RMS.“These encouraging data show that newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients may benefit from lower disease activity when treated with Kesimpta,” said Dr. Amit Bar-Or, University of Pennsylvania.A post hoc analysis from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II trials (n=615) evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of treatment with Kesimpta in a subgroup of patients with early RMS (newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve). Baseline characteristics of the newly diagnosed (within three years before screening), treatment-naïve (no prior disease-modifying therapy use) subgroup were typical of early MS patients (median age and MS duration since diagnosis were 36 and 0.35 years, respectively). The study results showed Kesimpta significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 50.3% (0.09 vs 0.18) compared with teriflunomide (P&lt;.001). Kesimpta significantly reduced the mean number of both gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 lesions by 95.4% (0.02 vs 0.39; P&lt;.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions by 82.0% (0.86 vs 4.78; P&lt;.001) compared with teriflunomide. Kesimpta also showed a relative risk reduction of 38% (P=.065) in 3-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) and a significant relative risk reduction of 46% (P=.044) in 6-month CDW. An additional post hoc analysis presented in the same poster at MSVirtual2020 showed that the odds of achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3; no relapses, no MRI lesions, and no disability worsening combined) with Kesimpta versus teriflunomide in the same newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve subgroup were &gt;3-fold higher at the first year (47.0% vs 24.7% of patients; P&lt;.001) and &gt;14-fold higher at the second year of treatment (92.1% vs 46.8% of patients, P&lt;.001). Overall, Kesimpta had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide1.A separate safety analysis (n=1,873) of the ongoing Phase IIIb ALITHIOS trial reported on the extended exposure of Kesimpta in patients with RMS. The ALITHIOS trial included patients who either continued on Kesimpta treatment from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials or the Phase II APLIOS trial (continuous) or switched from teriflunomide in the ASCLEPIOS trials to Kesimpta (newly-switched). The results showed no new safety signals, highlighting that the safety profile of Kesimpta in RMS patients remains consistent with data reported in the core studies2.“Collectively, these data add to the body of evidence that shows Kesimpta to be a powerful B-cell therapy with a favorable safety profile for people living with RMS, including those who are newly diagnosed or previously treated,” said Krishnan Ramanathan, Neuroscience Global Program Head at Novartis. “Novartis is committed to reimagining care and bringing innovative treatment options for people living with this disease.”In addition, another analysis of the pooled ASCLEPIOS trials presented indicated the prognostic value of serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) in assessing future course of disease in RMS3. The value of measuring serum NfL is also supported by findings from the APLIOS study that demonstrate a clear association of NfL with disease activity, either in the form of new Gd+ T1 lesions or relapses5.All abstracts will be published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal following the meeting.In August, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Kesimpta as an injection for subcutaneous use for the treatment of RMS, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Kesimpta is the first and only targeted B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once monthly at home via the Sensoready® autoinjector pen4.Novartis is committed to bringing Kesimpta to patients around the world and additional regulatory filings are currently underway across the world, with regulatory approval for Kesimpta in Europe expected by Q2 2021.About Kesimpta® (ofatumumab)  Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that provides the flexibility of self-administration for adults with RMS. It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously4,6. Initial doses of Kesimpta are given at Weeks 0, 1 and 2, with the first injection performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As shown in preclinical studies, Kesimpta is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion7. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen8. Once-monthly dosing of Kesimpta also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers more flexibility9. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 201510.About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies  The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Kesimpta 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1,882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.54. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries11. Kesimpta demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 59% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P&lt;.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Kesimpta also showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (P=.002) in 3-month CDP compared with teriflunomide in pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS4.Kesimpta showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (98% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P&lt;.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P&lt;.001) vs teriflunomide4.Kesimpta had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and malignancies also being similar across both treatment groups. Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions, and local injection site reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions with Kesimpta (incidence greater than 10%)4.A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated Kesimpta may halt new disease activity in RMS patients. It showed the odds of achieving NEDA-3 with ofatumumab versus teriflunomide were &gt;3-fold higher at Months 0–12 (47.0% vs 24.5% of patients; P&lt;.001) and &gt;8-fold higher at Months 12–24 (87.8% vs 48.2% of patients; P&lt;.001)12.Overall Kesimpta, an antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide4.About ALITHIOS study  The ALITHIOS study is an ongoing open-label, single arm, multi-center extension Phase III study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of ofatumumab in subjects with RMS who have participated in a Novartis ofatumumab clinical MS study. The primary endpoint is the number of patients that experience an adverse event or abnormal laboratory, vital and/or ECG results and positive suicidality outcomes. Secondary endpoints include number of relapse rates per year, 3- and 6-month CDW, 6-, 12- and 24-month confirmed disability improvement and improvement until end of study. This study includes a vaccination sub-study investigating the effects of ofatumumab on the development of antibody responses to selected vaccines and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) neo-antigen in subjects with RMS13.About APLIOS study  The APLIOS study is a 12-week, open-label, Phase II bioequivalence study to determine the onset of B-cell depletion with Kesimpta subcutaneous monthly injections and the bioequivalence of subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe—as used in ASCLEPIOS I and II—and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS. Patients were randomized according to injection device and site including the abdomen and the thigh. B-cell depletion was measured nine times over 12 weeks and Gd+ lesion counts were assessed at baseline and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. Regardless of injection device or site, Kesimpta 20 mg subcutaneous monthly injections resulted in rapid, close to complete and sustained B-cell depletion; the proportion of patients with B-cell concentrations of &lt;10 cells/μL was &gt;65% after the first injection by Day 7, 94% by Week 4, and sustained &gt;95% at all following injections. Kesimpta treatment reduced the mean number of Gd+ lesions from baseline (1.5) to 0.8, 0.3 and 0.1 by Weeks 4, 8 and 12, respectively; the proportion of patients free from Gd+ lesions at the corresponding time points were 66.5%, 86.7% and 94.1%, respectively6.About Multiple Sclerosis   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord14. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide15, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)16. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease14.Novartis in Neuroscience  Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and specialty neurology.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-09-14,"* In Phase III KITE study, Beovu (brolucizumab) 6 mg achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to aflibercept 2 mg in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at year one (week 52)1     * In a key secondary endpoint, more than half of Beovu patients were maintained on a three-month dosing interval through year one, following the loading phase1     * Beovu showed superior improvement versus aflibercept in change of central subfield thickness, a secondary endpoint, over the period of week 40 through week 521      * Beovu demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile comparable to aflibercept; in addition the rate of intraocular inflammation was equivalent between Beovu and aflibercept1      * Novartis actively progressing full clinical development program of Beovu, with studies across wet AMD, DME, retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathyBasel, September 14, 2020 — Novartis today reported the first interpretable results of the Phase III KITE study, assessing the efficacy and safety of Beovu® (brolucizumab) 6 mg in diabetic macular edema (DME). The trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating non-inferiority for Beovu versus aflibercept 2 mg in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at year one (week 52)1.In a secondary endpoint, Beovu demonstrated superior improvement versus aflibercept in change of central subfield thickness (CST, a key indicator of fluid in the retina) over the period of week 40 through week 521. More than half of patients in the Beovu arm were maintained on a three-month dosing interval through year one, following the loading phase. All aflibercept patients were on a two-month dosing interval after the loading phase1. In KITE, Beovu demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile comparable to aflibercept1. In addition, the rate of intraocular inflammation was equivalent between Beovu and aflibercept1.“Living with DME has significant impact on patients’ lives and frequent treatment injections are needed to control the increased fluid in the eye,” said Dirk Sauer, Global Head Development, Novartis Pharma Ophthalmology. “This data confirms our strong belief in Beovu as a potential therapy for DME patients, and if approved, will provide patients with a new treatment option to control their disease through better resolution of retinal fluid and CST reductions.”The KITE pivotal trial is an ongoing two-year study that enrolled 360 patients with DME across 80 centers in 23 countries1. The data from KITE will be submitted for presentation at medical congresses and for peer-review publication. Novartis is currently conducting a second study in DME, KESTREL2, and anticipates results later in the year, when Novartis will assess next steps with health authorities.Novartis is actively progressing studies across wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), DME, retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The favorable benefit-risk of the Beovu development program was supported by a company-requested review of ongoing studies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Novartis has a comprehensive program of work underway to help support retina specialists with the latest data and understanding they need to make appropriate treatment decisions for their wet AMD patients. Beovu is currently approved in over 40 countries for the treatment of wet AMD.About Diabetic Macular Edema   DME is the leading cause of blindness in people with diabetes and affects 21 million people across the world, including 12% of people with type 1 diabetes and 28% of those with type 2 diabetes3,4.Consistently high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage small blood vessels in the eye, causing them to leak fluid5. The resulting accumulation of fluid (known as edema) in the macula can lead to vision loss6. The macula is the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision6.Early symptoms of DME include blurry or wavy central vision and distorted color perception, although the disease can also progress without symptoms at early stages5,6.About Beovu (brolucizumab)   Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is approved in more than 40 countries, including in the US7, EU8, UK8, Japan9, Canada10 and Australia11, for the treatment of wet AMD. Additional trials are currently ongoing which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with AMD, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Brolucizumab is the most clinically advanced humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv)12-14. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation and drug delivery characteristics14-16.The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms15. Beovu is engineered to deliver the highest concentration of drug, providing more active binding agents12-14. In preclinical studies, Beovu inhibited activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction15-17. Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular angiogenesis and retinal edema18. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and suppress endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability18.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-09-14,"* Novartis worked with the EMA to update the Beovu® (brolucizumab) label to guide physicians in their treatment of wet AMD       * The update includes the additional characterization of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation1     * Novartis has established a multidisciplinary panel of internal experts collaborating with external advisors to examine the root cause, potential risk factors and mitigation of these adverse events     * Novartis is confident that Beovu continues to represent an important treatment option for patients with wet AMD, with an overall favorable benefit/risk profile Basel, September 14, 2020 — Novartis announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), has approved an update to the Beovu® (brolucizumab) Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to include additional information regarding retinal vasculitis and retinal vascular occlusion1. Typically, these events occurred in the presence of intraocular inflammation. This approval follows Novartis’ announcement that it would pursue worldwide label updates after a review and further characterization of post-marketing safety events reported to Novartis.The update to the EU label includes the addition of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation under “Special warnings and precautions for use” (section 4.4) and “Undesirable effect” (section 4.8). The label notes that patients developing these events should discontinue treatment and the events should be promptly managed1.“This label update is one of the many efforts Novartis is taking to help physicians make informed decisions,” said Marcia Kayath, Global Head of Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Novartis is committed to fully understanding and transparently communicating the safety profile of Beovu. To this purpose, we have established a coalition, which is a fully dedicated internal team collaborating with top global experts to examine the root cause, risk factors, mitigation and potential treatment recommendations.”The label update is applicable to all 27 European Union member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein1. Beovu is now approved for the treatment of wet AMD in more than 40 countries, including in the US2, EU1, UK1, Japan3, Canada4 and Australia5.

We’re currently working to support global health efforts to address diseases like malaria and leprosy, to continue novel research into tropical diseases, and to ensure access to our new medicines in low- and middle-income countries,” said Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. “Today’s announcement is another important step on our journey to integrate ESG into the core of our business, measure our progress, hold ourselves accountable, and demonstrate our dedication to making good on our promise to broaden global access to our medicines.”Globally, approximately two billion people have no access to basic medicines and healthcare1, while 100 million people are impoverished by medical expenses each year2. Weak healthcare systems in LMICs also hinder timely diagnosis and treatment. Novartis is taking bold steps to increase patient reach in LMICs with its strategic innovative therapies by at least 200% by 2025. In addition, Novartis is taking steps to increase patient reach of its global health flagship programs in leprosy, malaria, Chagas disease and sickle cell disease by at least 50% over the same time period. Novartis estimates achievement of these targets to result in a potential reach of over 24 million patients across therapy areas. ESG is a key strategic priority for Novartis that rests on four pillars based on topics defined by stakeholders in our materiality analysis: Ethical Standards, Pricing and Access, Global Health Challenges and Responsible Citizenship3. The company has developed ambitious and challenging targets against key elements in each of these areas and has made significant progress over the past year. The SLB represents another bold step in the company’s journey to further embed ESG into the core of its business operations and to communicate progress in a consistent and transparent way. This move follows the recent launch of the new Novartis Code of Ethics, and the announcement of a new 2030 target for full carbon neutrality across the company’s entire supply chain. Novartis has obtained two separate second-party opinions that validate the robustness and relevance of the KPIs and targets. The first one is from the Access to Medicine Foundation, an independent non-profit organization focused on access to medicine in LMICs, on the social benefits of the 2025 Patient Access Targets. The second opinion is from Sustainalytics, a consultancy organization with recognized environmental, social and governance expertise, on the social benefits of the 2025 Patient Access Targets and on the alignment of this bond to the Sustainability-linked Bond Principles, published by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA).Novartis will provide annual reports on its performance against the KPIs underlying its 2025 Patient Access Targets, including limited assurance reports by an external verifier.

2020-09-16,"* COMBI-AD is first trial to demonstrate 5-year relapse-free survival with targeted therapy as adjuvant treatment in high-risk patients with stage III BRAF-mutated melanoma1     * Adjuvant treatment with standard-of-care targeted therapy Tafinlar + Mekinist reduced the risk of relapse or death by 49% compared to placebo1      * Updated data show Tafinlar + Mekinist improved distant metastasis-free survival, a secondary endpoint1               Basel, September 16, 2020 — Novartis announced previously reported data from the Phase III COMBI-AD study were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study shows more than half of high-risk patients with resected, stage III BRAF V600-mutated melanoma treated with Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) + Mekinist® (trametinib) were alive and relapse-free at 5 years1. Research suggests the majority of relapses in high-risk stage III melanoma generally occur within 5 years1,2.“Findings published today offer confidence that treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib following surgery provides a durable, long-term relapse-free survival benefit for those at high risk of cancer recurrence,” said Prof. Reinhard Dummer, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Zurich. “These findings add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the clinical value of dabrafenib and trametinib in the adjuvant setting.”Results showed 52% of patients (95% CI, 48-58%) treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist were alive and relapse-free at 5 years compared to 36% of patients (95% CI, 32-41%) who received placebo. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was not reached in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm (95% CI, 47.9 months-NR) compared to 16.6 months (95% CI, 12.7-22.1 months) in the placebo arm. Treatment with Tafinlar + Mekinist reduced the risk of relapse or death by 49% compared to placebo (hazard ratio, HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.42-0.61])1. These findings were presented at the 2020 ASCO Virtual Scientific Program.A subgroup analysis showed a generally similar RFS benefit across all substages, as assessed by AJCC-7 criteria. The five-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rate, a secondary endpoint, was 65% (95% CI, 61-71%) in patients treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist compared to 54% (95% CI, 49-60%) in patients who received placebo. COMBI-AD is ongoing to assess the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS); the OS analysis at the first interim analysis showed a 3-year OS rate of 86% in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm compared to 77% in the placebo arm. Overall survival results favored the combination therapy with Tafinlar + Mekinist over placebo, but the prespecified interim significance threshold of P = 0.000019 was not met.“Reaching the five year mark without relapse is a profound moment for a patient living with high-risk, stage III melanoma,” said Jeff Legos, Ph.D., MBA, Senior Vice President, Head of Oncology Drug Development, Novartis Oncology. “Tafinlar + Mekinist has helped patients and clinicians reimagine what is possible for patients living with advanced melanoma. We are proud of the deep and durable benefit demonstrated in COMBI-AD and remain grateful to the patients, investigators and their families who participated in this clinical trial.”During the extended follow-up, all patients had completed therapy. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the Tafinlar + Mekinist and placebo arms in the rate or severity of serious adverse events reported during the follow-up period.More than 285,000 cases of melanoma are diagnosed every year globally and about half of these have a BRAF mutation3,4. Patients who receive surgical treatment for stage III melanoma may have a risk of recurrence because melanoma cells may remain in the body after surgery5.About the COMBI-AD Study  COMBI-AD is a pivotaI Phase III study evaluating Tafinlar (dabrafenib) + Mekinist (trametinib) in patients with stage III, BRAF V600E/K-mutant melanoma without prior anticancer therapy. It is the longest follow-up, at 60 months, and largest dataset to date of patients with stage III melanoma receiving targeted therapy for adjuvant treatment1,6.                                                                                       It is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind Phase III study of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus two placebos in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma after surgical resection. Patients with completely resected, histologically confirmed, BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive, high-risk [stage IIIa (lymph node metastasis >1 mm), IIIb or IIIc as per AJCC 7th edition] cutaneous melanoma were screened for eligibility. Subjects were randomized to receive either dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg once daily) combination therapy or two placebos for up to one year. The primary end point is recurrence-free survival, and secondary endpoints include overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, freedom from relapse analysis and safety1,7.About Tafinlar + Mekinist Combination   Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to treat people with a type of skin cancer called melanoma:  * That has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and  * That has a certain type of abnormal ""BRAF"" (V600E or V600K mutation-positive) geneTafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to help prevent melanoma that has a certain type of abnormal ""BRAF"" gene from coming back after the cancer has been removed by surgery.Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic NSCLC), and that has a certain type of abnormal ""BRAF V600E"" gene.Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of thyroid cancer called anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC):  * That has spread to other parts of the body and you have no satisfactory treatment options, and  * That has a certain type of abnormal ""BRAF"" geneTafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, should not be used to treat people with wild-type BRAF melanoma. Mekinist should not be used to treat people who already have received a BRAF inhibitor for treatment of their melanoma and it did not work or is no longer working.Your health care provider will perform a test to make sure that Tafinlar and Mekinist , in combination, are right for you.It is not known if Tafinlar and Mekinist are safe and effective in children.Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects such as the risk of new cancers, including both skin cancer and nonskin cancer.

2020-09-18,"As one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, you probably would have expected Novartis (NYSE:NVS) to jump in the novel coronavirus vaccine fray. For one thing, the company has the capacity to mass produce a successful candidate. As well, it could leverage its expertise in addressing multiple diseases. Yet the pharma didn't follow its peers, which may turn out to be a positive for Novartis stock.Source: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.com At the time, it may have seemed like the wrong decision. Among the majors, you have names like AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) partnering with Oxford University to develop a viral-vector vaccine. Utilizing a similar approach is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Further, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has teamed up with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) to develop a messenger RNA-based vaccine. This approach competes with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), along with the partnership between Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).Rather than throw its hat into the mix, Novartis has supported Covid-19 vaccine developers by offering some of its manufacturing capacity. For instance, the company, through its gene therapy business AveXis, contributed adeno-associated virus vector (AAV) technology and manufacturing space to support a project led by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf recent trades are anything to go by, management's decision to avoid the vaccine race directly has allowed stakeholders of Novartis stock to sleep a bit easier.Since the beginning of August, some of the major vaccine players haven't performed well. Take a look at AZN, SNY, PFE and BNTX. These shares are either flat or are declining at the time of this writing. In contrast, Novartis stock has been steadily marching higher, albeit in a choppy fashion.  * 10 Education Stocks to Buy for the Fall School Season Given the uncertainties of vaccinations, it's a luxury to concentrate on core businesses. Novartis Stock Doesn't Have to Deal with Covid-19's Tough ScienceOne of the fascinating dynamics of the novel coronavirus vaccine race is just how difficult it will be for the Trump administration -- or perhaps the Biden administration -- to decide which candidate, if any, to support.Of the four major types of vaccines -- traditional, subunit, viral vector and nucleic acid -- each have extensive pros and cons. For instance, I've thrown out traditional vaccines in my mind because while they have a history of success, they take far too long to develop and distribute. Frankly, we don't have the time.Even Novartis' gene therapy subsidiary may run into problems supporting vaccine developers. As I mentioned above, AveXis specializes in AAVs. Eagle-eyed InvestorPlace readers will recognize the platform as the one Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) uses to address inherited retinal diseases.But the problem with AAVs is that patients may suffer a negative response to the virus vector (or carrier) that ""infects"" cells with the carried genes. As you know, AstraZeneca had a hiccup in its clinical trial when a U.K. patient came down with an unexplained illness.To be fair, AstraZeneca used an adenovirus as its vector (carrier), whereas Novartis' AveXis uses adeno-associated vectors. Further, we don't know exactly why the U.K. patient got sick. Nevertheless, the risk of a negative immune response against viral vectors has always been a risk factor for this process.Moreover, other leading vaccine types are not safe from scrutiny. For instance, while clinical data for Moderna's vaccine candidate looks promising, The New England Journal of Medicine reported that antibody titers increased significantly among early participants during the second vaccination.Should Moderna win out, its candidate will likely require two doses. That could be an issue. But for Novartis stock, none of this matters because the underlying company isn't involved in the race. NVS Isn't Completely DisassociatedWhile Novartis is staying out of the vaccination fray, it's lending its direct expertise to an area that might truly emerge victorious: treatments. With many Americans scared to take a Covid-19 vaccine, the treatment approach may be the better one, at least in this country.If so, Novartis would again win out. According to its website, NVS has a new indication for its canakinumab (ACZ885) drug, which ""significantly reduced the risk of a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke for patients with a prior heart attack and inflammatory atherosclerosis.""Now, ACZ885 is undergoing trials ""to demonstrate that early treatment with canakinumab prevents progressive heart and respiratory failure in patients with COVID 19 infection, myocardial injury and hyperinflammation.""To note, the study won't come out until around the end of this year. But if you believe that we'll have a second wave of coronavirus soon, Novartis stock might not be a bad bet. The underlying company will find itself relevant and it doesn't have to deal with the vaccination drama.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-09-19,"* In SOLAR-1 final analysis, Piqray (alpelisib) plus fulvestrant demonstrated 8 months clinically relevant improvement in overall survival (OS) in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (aBC) patients with a PIK3CA mutation compared to fulvestrant alone1      * 14+ months OS improvement was achieved in patients with lung or liver metastases, which are observed in 41% of postmenopausal women with HR+ aBC, and considered more aggressive and challenging to treat1-3      * Data add to growing body of evidence for Piqray, the first and only treatment specifically approved for aBC with a PIK3CA mutation  Basel, September 19, 2020 — Novartis today announced results of the final overall survival (OS) analysis from the SOLAR-1 trial, which evaluated Piqray® (alpelisib) in combination with fulvestrant, compared to fulvestrant alone, in hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer patients with tumors harboring a PIK3CA mutation. Piqray is the only treatment approved in Europe, the United States and 15 other countries specifically for people with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation. These data will be presented as a late-breaking oral presentation during the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020.In the study, there was a clinically relevant improvement in OS of eight months for patients with a PIK3CA mutation taking Piqray plus fulvestrant compared to fulvestrant alone (median OS 39.3 months vs. 31.4 months; one-sided p≤0.0161; HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.64-1.15; p=0.15)1. This difference did not reach the prespecified threshold of statistical significance set for the secondary objective of OS in patients with PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer. A more than 14 month OS improvement was observed in patients with lung or liver metastases, which signify more aggressive disease (median OS 37.2 months vs. 22.8 months; HR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.46-1.00)1-3.“These results build on previous data showing that alpelisib nearly doubled median progression-free survival in this patient population,” said Fabrice André, MD, PhD, research director and head of INSERM Unit U981, professor in the Department of Medical Oncology at Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, and global SOLAR-1 principal investigator. “Patients whose tumors have a PIK3CA mutation, particularly those with lung or liver metastases, have a more aggressive, harder to treat cancer, so these results showing alpelisib offers longer life, are promising.”  In addition, data showed the need for chemotherapy was delayed in patients taking Piqray plus fulvestrant by nine months compared to those taking fulvestrant alone (23.3 months vs. 14.8 months; HR=0.72; 95% CI: 0.54-0.95)1. Quality of life (QOL) was maintained for people taking Piqray plus fulvestrant.“These data demonstrating survival benefit give the 40% of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with PIK3CA mutations in their tumors more time to spend with loved ones and do what they value most,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “We are committed to reimagining a world where advanced breast cancer becomes a curable disease, and these data reinforce our confidence as we continue to explore the potential use of Piqray in other types of breast cancer with PIK3CA mutations.”No new safety signals were observed; adverse events were consistent with previously reported SOLAR-1 results.Visit https://www.virtualcongress.novartis.com/ESMO20 for the latest information from Novartis including our bold approach to reimagining cancer care, and access to our ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 symposia and data presentations (for registered participants).In July 2020, the European Commission (EC) approved Piqray in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after disease progression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy.About Piqray® (alpelisib)  Piqray is a kinase inhibitor developed for use in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with HR+/HER2-, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer following progression on or after endocrine-based regimen. Piqray is approved in 48 countries, including the US and European member states.About SOLAR-1  SOLAR-1 is a global, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying Piqray in combination with fulvestrant for postmenopausal women, and men, with PIK3CA-mutated HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer that progressed on or following aromatase inhibitor treatment with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor7-9.The trial randomized 572 patients. Patients were allocated based on central tumor tissue assessment to either a PIK3CA-mutated cohort (n=341) or a PIK3CA non-mutated cohort (n=231). Within each cohort, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive continuous oral treatment with Piqray (300 mg once daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg every 28 days + Cycle 1 Day 15) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Stratification was based on visceral metastases and prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment7-9. Patients and investigators are blinded to PIK3CA mutation status and treatment.The primary endpoint is local investigator assessed PFS using RECIST 1.1 for patients with a PIK3CA mutation. The key secondary endpoint is overall survival, and additional secondary endpoints include, but are not limited to, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, health-related quality of life, efficacy in PIK3CA non-mutated cohort, safety and tolerability7-9.About Novartis in Advanced Breast Cancer  Novartis tackles breast cancer with superior science, collaboration and a passion for transforming patient care. We've taken a bold approach to our research by including patient populations often neglected in clinical trials, identifying new pathways or mutations that may play a role in disease progression and developing therapies that not only maintain, but also improve, quality of life for patients. Our priority over the past 30 years and today is to deliver treatments proven to improve and extend lives for those diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.Important Safety Information from the PIQRAY EU SmPC   The most common ADRs and the most common grade 3 / 4 ADRs (reported at a frequency >20% and ≥2%, respectively) were plasma glucose increased, creatinine increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, rash, lymphocyte count decreased, nausea, alanine aminotransferase increased, anaemia, fatigue, lipase increased, decreased appetite*, stomatitis, vomiting*, weight decreased, hypocalcaemia, plasma glucose decreased*, activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged*, alopecia**, diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, hypertension, nausea, creatinine increased, and mucosal inflammation (*<2% grade 3/4 ADRs reported, ** no grade 3/4 ADRs reported).Piqray can cause serious side effects such as severe hypersensitivity, severe cutaneous reactions, hyperglycaemia, pneumonitis, diarrhoea and osteonecrosis of the jaw.The following should be taken into consideration prior to or during treatment with Piqray: Piqray should be permanently discontinued in patients with serious hypersensitivity reactions.Piqray should not be initiated in patients with a history of severe cutaneous reactions, should be interrupted if signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous reactions are present, and permanently discontinued if a severe cutaneous reaction is confirmed.Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels should be monitored frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment, and patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia.In case of new or worsening respiratory symptoms, the patient should be evaluated for pneumonitis.Patients should be advised to notify their physician if diarrhoea occurs.Caution should be exercised when Piqray and bisphosphonates or denosumab are used together or sequentially.

2020-09-19,"* Based on unprecedented progression-free survival results, Tafinlar (dabrafenib) \+ Mekinist (trametinib) confirmed as standard-of-care, targeted therapy for advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma1-4      * Data show positive durable responses and progression-free survival benefit for patients treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist in the comparator arm of the COMBI-i clinical trial despite the study not meeting the primary endpoint for the investigational triplet therapy      * Spartalizumab development program continues, investigating the immunotherapy in combination with other anti-cancer agentsBasel, September 19, 2020 — Novartis announced today detailed results from the Phase III COMBI-i trial evaluating the investigational immunotherapy spartalizumab (PDR001) in combination with the targeted therapies Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) and Mekinist® (trametinib) compared to Tafinlar + Mekinist alone1. The efficacy data achieved in the trial’s control arm among patients treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist represent the longest progression-free survival results (PFS) observed across multiple Phase III studies. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with the investigational triplet therapy1-4. The COMBI-i study was conducted among treatment-naive patients with advanced BRAF V600 mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Results were presented today as a late-breaking oral presentation during the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 20201.“For treating physicians and patients alike, the durable, progression-free survival seen with dabrafenib + trametinib in COMBI-i confirms that this targeted therapy combination remains a gold standard treatment for people with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma,” said Dr. Paul Nathan, consultant medical oncologist, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, United Kingdom, and COMBI-i principal investigator. “The good news is that the control arm of the study performed better than we originally expected, with the efficacy of dabrafenib + trametinib improving consistently over time. Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, an important trend was seen in favor of the triple therapy arm. There is clearly more for us to learn about patients who may benefit from the potential addition of an immunotherapy.”Findings from this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed a median time of PFS of 16.2 months for patients treated with the triple therapy (n=267) compared to 12.0 months for patients receiving the combination Tafinlar + Mekinist alone (n=265; hazard ratio [HR] 0.82; 95% CI 0.655-1.027; p=0.042)1. Overall response rate was 68.5% for spartalizumab with Tafinlar + Mekinist (95% CI, 62.6-74.1%) compared to 64.2% for Tafinlar + Mekinist alone (95% CI, 58.1-69.9%)1. A significant duration of response (DOR) was seen in the study as median DOR for the triple therapy was not reached at two-year data cutoff, compared to 20.7 months with Tafinlar + Mekinist1.“Working with our clinical investigator partners and melanoma patients around the world, we undertook the COMBI-i study to learn more about how we can continue to improve patient outcomes, and we are proud that it advanced the community’s scientific understanding about potential triplet therapies,” said Jeff Legos, Ph.D., MBA, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Drug Development. “The study results reinforce that patients taking Tafinlar + Mekinist continue to see durable responses and a meaningful progression-free survival benefit, consistent with data reported in previous Phase III studies.”“As we continue to deliver Tafinlar + Mekinist to patients around the world, Novartis will continue to advance the science with bold investigations into uses for immunotherapy in cancer, including the ongoing development of spartalizumab, across a range of tumor types,” Legos added.About the COMBI-i Study1  COMBI-i was a Phase III, double-blinded global study (NCT02967692) evaluating the investigational anti-PD1 therapy spartalizumab in combination with Tafinlar + Mekinist compared to Tafinlar + Mekinist and placebo as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. The study was conducted in three parts. In the safety run-in (part 1), the primary endpoint was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities, and in the biomarker cohort (part 2), the primary endpoint was immune microenvironment and biomarker modulation. In the randomized portion of the study (part 3), the primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.COMBI-i study participants were classified as having either Stage IIIC (unresectable) or Stage IV (metastatic) disease and received study treatments as first-line therapy. No new side effects were seen and the safety profile in the control arm was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. COMBI-i also evaluated a new side effect management protocol to address pyrexia – or fever – a common side effect seen among targeted therapies.Serious treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) grade ≥3 occurred in 23.2% of patients in the triple therapy arm compared to 11% in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events independent of treatment relationship observed in the triple therapy and Tafinlar + Mekinist arms were blood creatine phosphokinase increase (7.9% vs 7.2%), pyrexia (5.2% vs 3.0%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (3.7% vs 1.1%), fatigue (3.4% vs 1.9%), rash (3.4% vs 0.4%), asthenia (2.2% vs. 1.1%), headache (1.1% vs. 1.5%), diarrhea (0.7% vs. 1.9%), nausea (0.7% vs 0.4), arthralgia (0.7% vs 1.5%), and chills (zero vs. 0.8%). TRAEs leading to discontinuation of all 3 study drugs occurred in 12% compared to 8% of patients, respectively.Visit https://www.virtualcongress.novartis.com/esmo20/ for the latest information from Novartis including our bold approach to reimagining cancer care, and access to our ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 symposia and data presentations (for registered participants).About Spartalizumab (PDR001)  Spartalizumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody directed against the human programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor. Its development program continues, investigating the immunotherapy across a range of tumor types.About Tafinlar + Mekinist2-4  The combination of the targeted therapies Tafinlar + Mekinist, the worldwide leader in BRAF/MEK-inhibition, is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission based on data from the pivotal Phase III COMBI-d and COMBI-v trials.In COMBI-d, Tafinlar + Mekinist achieved a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit compared to Tafinlar monotherapy (median of 25.1 months vs 18.7 months; Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.71 [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.55-0.92], p=0.01). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.3 months in the 211 patients receiving combination therapy compared to 8.8 months in the 212 patients receiving monotherapy (HR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.57-0.99], p=0.035).In COMBI-v, Tafinlar + Mekinist demonstrated a statistically significant OS benefit compared to vemurafenib monotherapy (median not reached vs 17.2 months; HR 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.89], p=0.005). The median PFS was 11.4 months in the 352 patients receiving the Tafinlar + Mekinist combination compared to 7.3 months in the 352 patients receiving vemurafenib monotherapy (HR 0.56 [95% CI, 0.46-0.69], p<0.001).Tafinlar + Mekinist Indication and Important Safety Information   Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to treat people with a type of skin cancer called melanoma:  * That has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and  * That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” (V600E or V600K mutation-positive) geneTafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to help prevent melanoma that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” gene from coming back after the cancer has been removed by surgery.Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic NSCLC), and that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF V600E” gene.Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of thyroid cancer called anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC):  * That has spread to other parts of the body and you have no satisfactory treatment options, and  * That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” geneTafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, should not be used to treat people with wild-type BRAF melanoma. Mekinist should not be used to treat people who already have received a BRAF inhibitor for treatment of their melanoma and it did not work or is no longer working.Your health care provider will perform a test to make sure that Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, are right for you.It is not known if Tafinlar and Mekinist are safe and effective in children.Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects such as the risk of new cancers, including both skin cancer and nonskin cancer. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider immediately for any skin changes, including a new wart, skin sore, or bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or color of a mole.When Tafinlar is used in combination with Mekinist, it can cause serious bleeding problems, especially in the brain or stomach, that can lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider and get medical help right away if they have any signs of bleeding, including headaches, dizziness, or feel weak, cough up blood or blood clots, vomit blood or their vomit looks like “coffee grounds,” or red or black stools that look like tar.Mekinist, alone or in combination with Tafinlar, can cause inflammation of the intestines or tears in the stomach or intestines that can lead to death. Patients should report to their health care provider immediately if they have any of the following symptoms: bleeding, diarrhea (loose stools) or more bowel movements than usual, stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness, fever, or nausea.Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause blood clots in the arms or legs, which can travel to the lungs and can lead to death.

2020-09-23,"* Novartis Gene Therapies to initiate new pivotal confirmatory study to evaluate use of AVXS-101 intrathecal (IT) formulation in older patients with SMA to further support registration  Basel, September 23, 2020 – Novartis Gene Therapies recently received feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following their review of data from the STRONG study of the intrathecal (IT) formulation of AVXS-101 in older patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The FDA has acknowledged the potential of AVXS-101 IT in this patient population and recommends a pivotal confirmatory study to supplement the existing STRONG data and further support the regulatory submission for AVXS-101 IT.This guidance provides clarity on the path to registration for AVXS-101 IT. Trial design and other details are being evaluated and a comprehensive update on the overall Novartis SMA clinical development program will be provided at a future time following further discussions with health authorities. This request for a study is unrelated to the partial clinical hold on AVXS-101 IT, and the new study will not be initiated in the US until the hold has been lifted by the FDA. Novartis Gene Therapies remains confident in the overall benefit-risk profile for patients on treatment. This does not impact marketed Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) and the company continues to advance its regulatory filings and intravenous clinical studies. Novartis Gene Therapies reaffirms its commitment to the SMA community and to pursuing solutions for patients with all types of SMA, including older children and adults. All patients deserve a gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of their disease with a single dose. Zolgensma is approved in the US, Japan and, most recently, Brazil, for patients with SMA under the age of two. Zolgensma also continues to have a strong launch in Europe where it is approved for babies and young children with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1 or SMA with up to three copies of the SMN2 gene, with dosing guidance provided up to 21 kg. More than 600 patients have benefited from Zolgensma, including through clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. This number is expected to continue to grow as this transformative gene therapy is approved in additional markets and as the company pursues additional studies to fully explore the impact of Zolgensma across a broad population of patients with SMA. The company’s commitment to SMA extends beyond gene therapy to branaplam (LMI070), an oral, once-weekly RNA splicing modulator also currently under development, to expand the treatment options for SMA patients.     About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec)  Zolgensma® is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2019 and represents the first approved therapeutic in the company’s proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. In addition to the US, Zolgensma is approved in Japan, Europe and Brazil. More than 600 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. Novartis Gene Therapies is pursuing registration in close to three dozen countries with regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada, Israel, Australia, and South Korea in late-2020 or early 2021. About Spinal Muscular Atrophy  SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death. If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.   SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement. It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression. This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities. More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.About Novartis Gene Therapies  Novartis Gene Therapies (formerly AveXis) is reimagining medicine to transform the lives of people living with rare genetic diseases. Utilizing cutting-edge technology, we are turning promising gene therapies into proven treatments, beginning with our transformative gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This therapy is now approved in the US, Japan, Europe and Brazil, and additional registrations are being pursued in close to three dozen countries, with regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada, Israel, Australia, Argentina and South Korea in late 2020 or early 2021.

2020-09-25,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is incredibly cheap. For example, based on earnings estimates, BMY stock trades at just 7.8 times next year's earnings.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com In addition, it has an attractive dividend yield of 3.11%, which is likely to increase soon. I estimate the stock is worth at least $84.47, or 46% more than its present price.And that is after discounting its real worth significantly, to add in a margin of safety. The target price is primarily based on its expected earnings and dividends, its history, and comparisons with its peers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips BMY Stock Earnings and Dividend ExpectationsLast quarter, the company blew away analysts' earnings forecasts. It is likely to do so again this quarter. For example, Bristol Myers was supposed to hit $1.48 earnings per share in the second quarter, according to analysts' average estimates. But the actual EPS came in at $1.63, or over 10% higher than forecasts.This quarter it is likely to do the same thing. Analysts' expectations are again at $1.49 per share, just a penny higher than their low-ball expectations last quarter.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now Moreover, on Sept. 10, Bristol-Myers Squibb declared its fourth quarterly dividend of 45 cents per share. You can see this stellar dividend payment history in the chart below.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA By early December it is likely to announce a dividend increase, if its past history is a good guide. I expect the company will raise the payout by over 10% to $2.00 per share.Bristol-Myers Squibb's historical dividend yield has been 2.97% over the last four years, according to Morningstar. BMY stock is worth $67.34 per share. To get that result, divide $2.00 by 2.97%. That equals the target price of $67.34, or 16.7% more than today's (Sept. 21) price of $57.77. Historical P/E and CompsHistorically, Bristol-Myers Squibb has had very high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. You can see this in the chart on the right.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA It shows that the average P/E over the past seven years has been over 28x, but ranged from 9x recently to over 64x earnings.This analysis is based on figures provided on Morningstar's Valuation page for BMY stock.If we apply that earnings multiple to Bristol-Myers Squibb's EPS forecasts for 2021, $7.45, we would have a price target of $209.50. That is over 263% higher than today's price of $57.77.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Just to be safe, and to introduce a margin of safety, let's use just 50% of that number. So now the target price is $104.61 per share, or 81% higher than today.In addition, we compare the P/E ratios of a number of the drug maker's peers, we find the stock is worth much more as well, as seen on the right.It shows that the average of eight of Bristol-Myers Squibb's peers' P/E ratio is 13.7x forward earnings.By contrast, BMY stock trades at almost half that level at 7.8 times 2021 earnings.This implies that the stock should be worth $102.07, or 76.7% higher than today. But, again, to use a margin of safety I applied a 20% discount. That puts BMY stock's value at $81.47, or 41% higher than today. What to Do With BMY StockSo now we have three ways of valuing Bristol-Myers Squibb stock. Using its own dividend forecast and historical yield, the price target is $67.34, or 16.6% higher.Using a historical P/E ratio analysis, the price should be $104.61, using a 50% discount for a margin of safety. That is still 81% higher than today.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA And using a peer analysis, using comp P/E ratios, the price should be $102.07, using a 20% discount. That is still 41% higher.You can probably guess what's next. The average of these three price targets is $84.47, which represents a potential upside of 46.2%.Moreover, even if it takes two years for BMY stock to rise to that target, it still represents a compound annual gain of 20.9% each year.In addition, with its 3.1% dividend yield, the stock's total return each year will be 24%. That is a reasonably good return for most investors.The patient value investor will average cost into BMY stock. It has the potential to gain a substantial amount just based on a re-rating of its multiples.Last quarter the stock rose after its earnings came out, as Barron's Josh Nathan-Kazis reported in May. I suspect the same will happen this quarter. Moreover, the company has already guided for its earnings this year to be between $6.00 and $6.20 per share.Those are the numbers on which I based my valuation. Therefore, I expect that most serious value investors will average cost into this stock to participate in its expected re-rating.On the date of publication, Mark R.

2020-10-26,"* C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a rare renal disease, affecting young patients with a poor prognosis and significant unmet need.1–3   * Iptacopan (LNP023) is a potential first-in-class, oral, potent and selective factor B inhibitor of the complement system’s alternative pathway, targeting the underlying cause of C3G.4–6  * Data presented at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2020 Annual Meeting shows that investigational iptacopan effectively and safely reduced proteinuria in patients with C3G7.  * Iptacopan is in parallel development for a number of renal conditions, including C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and membranous nephropathy (iMN) as well as in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a hematological disease. Positive Phase II results in PNH were presented at EBMT in August8.  * The European Medicines Agency has granted iptacopan a priority medicines (PRIME) designation in C3G and an orphan drug designation in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).Basel, October 26, 2020 — Novartis today announced positive Phase II interim analysis results for iptacopan (LNP023), an investigational oral treatment for C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), presented at the virtually held American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2020 Annual Meeting. Data from the open-label Phase II study (NCT03832114), showed that after 12 weeks, iptacopan significantly reduced proteinuria by 49% compared to baseline values, as measured by 24-hour urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) assessment, in twelve patients with C3G (P=0.0005). Iptacopan strongly inhibited alternative complement pathway activity and improved plasma C3 levels. In addition, iptacopan stabilized renal function as assessed by eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) at week 12 and this effect was maintained in the seven patients that were treated for a total of six months after rolling over into the long-term extension study (NCT03955445)7.“Proteinuria indicates the presence of inflammation in the kidney. Results from this study demonstrate that iptacopan significantly reduces proteinuria in patients with C3G,” said the lead study investigator, Dr Edwin Wong, Consultant Nephrologist at the National Renal Complement Therapeutics Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle University. “This data also highlights iptacopan’s ability to strongly and specifically inhibit the alternative complement pathway, targeting the underlying cause of this disease and potentially providing a much needed treatment option for C3G patients who have significant unmet needs.”Iptacopan also had a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this Phase II study with no deaths, no serious adverse events suspected to be related to iptacopan and no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.“Iptacopan is the most advanced asset in our nephrology pipeline.” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “These data demonstrate that it has the potential to improve the lives of patients with C3G.”The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME designation for iptacopan in C3G. PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary program is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients earlier. In addition, EMA has also granted an orphan drug designation for iptacopan in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).      About C3 glomerulopathy (C3G)  C3G is an ultra-rare and severe form of primary glomerulonephritis, characterized by complement dysregulation.1,9 It has a worldwide annual incidence of 1–2 per million11 and an approximate prevalence of 10,000 in the US, ~10,500 in Europe, 3,200 in Japan and 32,000 in China12. C3G is commonly diagnosed in adolescents and young adults. The disease has a poor prognosis; about 50% of patient progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years, and 50–70% experience disease recurrence post kidney transplant.2Currently, there are no approved therapies specifically designed to target the underlying complement dysregulation that occurs in people with C3G. Current standard of care is with non-specific immunosuppressants with limited clinical evidence. Although antihypertensive or immunosuppressive agents and terminal complement pathway blockers are helpful in some patients, no treatment is universally effective or curative. 2,3,9,10 Therefore, novel treatment options are needed to address disease symptoms and slow the progression of C3G.About iptacopan  Iptacopan (LNP023) is a first-in-class oral, small-molecule, reversible inhibitor of factor B, a key serine protease of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade.4,5In addition to C3G, iptacopan is in parallel development for a number of other renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and membranous nephropathy. Novartis is also investigating iptacopan in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Following positive Phase II data presented at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress in August, a randomized, active-comparator controlled open-label Phase III trial (NCT04558918) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in PNH patients with residual anemia despite treatment with anti-C5 antibody therapy is planned to start in Dec 2020.13Iptacopan has the potential to become the first alternative complement pathway inhibitor to slow disease progression in a number of complement driven diseases.About the Study  The study (NCT03832114) is a Phase II, open-label, two cohort, non-randomized study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of iptacopan in patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) (Cohort A) and patients who have undergone kidney transplant and have C3G recurrence (Cohort B).14  On completion of the study, patients can roll over into a long-term extension study (NCT03955445).Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We continue to take strong actions to help address the pandemic. Our primary concerns remain the health and safety of our associates and patients.During the third quarter, overall market conditions have been recovering, though COVID-19 continues to weigh on certain therapeutic areas, most notably in dermatology, ophthalmology and the Sandoz retail business. Our operations remain stable and cash collections continue to be according to our normal trade terms, with days sales outstanding at normal levels. Novartis remains well positioned to meet its ongoing financial obligations and has sufficient liquidity to support our normal business activities. At present, drug development operations are continuing with manageable disruptions (please see Innovation Review Section of the Condensed Interim Financial Report for further information), with our range of digital technologies allowing us to proactively manage our clinical trials portfolio and rapidly mitigate any disruptions.Novartis continues to work closely with third parties to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. In September, we announced a collaboration with the African Union to facilitate the supply of COVID-19 related medicines – with a portfolio of 15 Novartis generic and over-the-counter medicines being offered at zero-profit to 55 African and 15 CARICOM eligible countries. Financials In order to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), Novartis has separated the Group’s reported financial data into “continuing” and “discontinued” operations. The results of the Alcon business in 2019 are reported as discontinued operations. See page 42 and Notes 2, 3 and 10 in the Condensed Interim Financial Report for a full explanation.The commentary below focuses on continuing operations including the businesses of Innovative Medicines and Sandoz, as well as the continuing Corporate functions. We also provide information on discontinued operations.Continuing operations third quarterNet sales were USD 12.3 billion (+1%, 0% cc) in the third quarter driven by volume growth of 7 percentage points, offset by price erosion of 4 percentage points and the negative impact from generic competition of 3 percentage points. Operating income was USD 2.4 billion (+2%, +9% cc) mainly due to lower spending, improved gross margin and gains on financial assets, partly offset by higher legal charges.Net income was USD 1.9 billion (-5%, 0% cc) as higher operating income was offset by a higher tax rate. EPS was USD 0.85 (-6%, 0% cc), in line with net income.Core operating income was USD 4.1 billion (+9%, +11% cc) due to lower spending and improved gross margin. Core operating income margin was 33.2% of net sales, increasing by 2.4 percentage points (+3.2 percentage points cc). Core net income was USD 3.5 billion (+8%, +10% cc) mainly driven by growth in core operating income. Core EPS was USD 1.52 (+8%, +9% cc), in line with core net income.Free cash flow from continuing operations amounted to USD 2.7 billion (-32%) compared to USD 4.0 billion in the prior year quarter. This decrease was due to lower cash flows from operating activities, including higher payments related to legal settlements.Innovative Medicines net sales were USD 9.8 billion (+2%, +1% cc) with volume contributing 9 percentage points to growth, pricing had a negative impact of 5 percentage points and generic competition had a negative impact of 3 percentage points mainly due to Afinitor and Exjade. Pharmaceuticals BU sales grew 2% (cc) driven by strong growth from Entresto, Cosentyx and Zolgensma. Growth was partly offset by declines in Established Medicines and ophthalmology brands. Oncology BU sales were broadly in line with prior year (-1% cc). Strong performance of Kisqali, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar \+ Mekinist and Piqray was offset by generic competition for Afinitor and Exjade. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively impact dermatology and ophthalmology.Sandoz net sales were USD 2.4 billion (-2%, -3% cc) with a volume decline of 1 percentage point (cc) impacted by ongoing disruptions to HCP practices due to COVID-19, which limited patient access to treatments for our retail business. There was a negative price effect of 2 percentage points (cc), despite the benefit from off-contract sales and favorable revenue deduction adjustments. The decline was partly offset by global sales of Biopharmaceuticals, growing 13% (cc), with strong growth across all regions.Continuing operations nine monthsNet sales were USD 35.9 billion (+2%, +4% cc) in the first nine months mainly driven by Entresto, Zolgensma and Cosentyx. Volume contributed 9 percentage points to sales growth, partly offset by price erosion of 3 percentage points and the negative impact from generic competition of 2 percentage points.Operating income was USD 7.5 billion (+3%, +11% cc) mainly driven by sales growth, improved gross margin and lower spending, partly offset by higher amortization and lower divestment gains.Net income was USD 6.0 billion (-1%, +6% cc) as higher operating income was offset by a higher tax rate. EPS was USD 2.62 (0%, +7% cc), growing faster than net income and benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. Core operating income was USD 11.9 billion (+12%, +16% cc) mainly driven by higher sales and improved gross margin. Core operating income margin was 33.2% of net sales, increasing by 2.8 percentage points (+3.6 percentage points cc). Core net income was USD 10.1 billion (+11%, +15% cc) mainly driven by growth in core operating income. Core EPS was USD 4.44 (+12%, +16% cc), growing faster than core net income benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.Free cash flow from continuing operations amounted to USD 8.3 billion (-12%) compared to USD 9.4 billion in the prior year period, primarily as higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items was more than offset by payments related to legal settlements and lower divestment proceeds.Innovative Medicines net sales were USD 28.8 billion (+4%, +5% cc) with volume contributing 12 percentage points to growth, pricing a negative 4 percentage points and generic competition had a negative impact of 3 percentage points. Pharmaceuticals BU grew 6% (cc) driven by Entresto (+48% cc), Zolgensma (reaching USD 0.7 billion) and Cosentyx (+12% cc). Growth was partly offset by declines in Lucentis and other ophthalmology products, primarily driven by lower demand due to COVID-19. Oncology BU grew 4% (cc) driven by Promacta/Revolade (+24% cc), Kisqali (+59% cc) and Piqray (reaching USD 0.2 billion).Sandoz net sales were USD 7.1 billion (-2%, 0% cc) as volume growth of 2 percentage points (cc) was impacted by ongoing disruptions to HCP practices due to COVID-19, which limited patient access to treatments for our retail business. There was a negative price effect of 2 percentage points (cc), despite the benefit from off-contract sales and favorable revenue deduction adjustments. Sales in Europe grew 2% (cc), while sales in the US declined 14%, driven by oral solids. Global sales of Biopharmaceuticals grew 20% (cc) to USD 1.4 billion, with strong growth across all regions.Discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the business of Alcon and certain corporate costs directly attributable to Alcon up to the spin-off date. As the Alcon spin-off was completed on April 9, 2019, the first nine months of the prior year included three months of operating results of the divested business.In the first nine months of 2020, there were no activities related to discontinued operations. In the first nine months of 2019, discontinued operations net sales were USD 1.8 billion, operating income amounted to USD 71 million and net income from discontinued operations was USD 4.6 billion, including the non-taxable non-cash net gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders which amounted to USD 4.7 billion. For further details see Note 2 “Distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders”, Note 3 “Significant transactions – Completion of the spin-off of the Alcon business through a dividend in kind distribution to Novartis AG shareholders” and Note 10 “Discontinued operations”.Total Group nine months For the total Group, net income amounted to USD 6.0 billion compared to USD 10.6 billion in the prior year, including the non-taxable non-cash net gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. Basic earnings per share was USD 2.62 compared to USD 4.62 in prior year. Cash flow from operating activities for the total Group amounted to USD 9.6 billion and free cash flow to USD 8.3 billion.Key growth drivers Underpinning our financial results in the quarter is a continued focus on key growth drivers (ranked in order of contribution to Q3 growth) including:Entresto (USD 632 million, +45% cc) sustained strong growth with increased patient share across markets, driven by demand as the essential first choice therapy for rEF heart failure.   Zolgensma (USD 291 million, +79% cc) delivered significant growth. Contributing factors included geographic expansion outside the US and increased newborn screening in the US.   Cosentyx (USD 1 012 million, +7% cc) saw continued growth despite lower new patient starts across the market in dermatology and rheumatology due to COVID-19.   Kisqali (USD 183 million, +50% cc) continued strong growth across all geographies, benefiting from the ongoing impact of positive overall survival data.   Promacta/Revolade (USD 442 million, +16% cc) grew across all regions, driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia in the US.   Beovu (USD 51 million) launch roll-out continued, with approval now in more than 45 countries.   Jakavi (USD 335 million, +18% cc) growth was driven by strong demand in the myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera indications.   Tafinlar + Mekinist (USD 397 million, +14% cc), continued to show solid growth driven by demand in adjuvant melanoma as well as NSCLC.   Mayzent (USD 49 million) continued to grow steadily. Growth is driven by fulfilling an important unmet need in patients showing signs of progression.   Piqray (USD 83 million, +95% cc) grew significantly in the US as the launch roll-out continued.   Kymriah (USD 122 million, +51% cc) grew strongly in Europe, US and Japan. Coverage continues to expand, with more than 260 qualified treatment centers and 26 countries having coverage for at least one indication.   Adakveo (USD 35 million) US launch continues to progress well, with close to 100% brand awareness among hematologists and expanding payer coverage decisions.   Biopharmaceuticals (USD 498 million, +13% cc) continued strong growth across all regions.   Emerging Growth Markets* Strong growth in China (+13% cc) to USD 667 million was offset by COVID-19 related declines in certain emerging markets. Overall, sales grew 4% (cc).  *All markets except the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand       Net sales of the top 20 Innovative Medicines products in 2020   Q3 2020                   % change 9M 2020 % change     USD m USD cc USD m USD  cc  Cosentyx 1 012 8  7  2 886 12  12   Gilenya 733 -12  -13  2 243 -7  -7   Entresto 632 47  45  1 781 47  48   Tasigna 478 -2  -2  1 445 4  5   Lucentis 515 3  0  1 403 -11  -10   Promacta/Revolade 442 16  16  1 267 22  24   Tafinlar + Mekinist 397 15  14  1 134 15  17   Sandostatin 361 -7  -7  1 076 -9  -8   Jakavi 335 20  18  963 17  19   Xolair 320 7  6  916 5  7   Galvus Group  289 -10  -8  906 -5  -2   Gleevec/Glivec 280 -13  -13  897 -6  -4   Afinitor/Votubia 262 -35  -34  824 -30  -29   Diovan Group  237 -7  -6  779 -2  1   Exforge Group  237 -5  -5  733 -6  -3   Zolgensma 291 82  79  666 nm  nm   Ilaris 220 24  25  633 28  30   Kisqali 183 49  50  503 55  59   Exjade/Jadenu 162 -36  -37  497 -33  -33   Votrient 160 -19  -19  488 -16  -14   Top 20 products total 7 546 3 2 22 040 5 6    nm = not meaningfulR&D Update - key developments from the third quarter New approvals and regulatory updateKesimpta  (Ofatumumab)  Received FDA approval as a subcutaneous injection for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease.

Beovu Phase III KITE study in diabetic macular edema (DME) met its primary endpoint, with Beovu 6mg demonstrating non-inferiority to aflibercept 2mg in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity at year one. In a secondary endpoint, Beovu demonstrated superior improvement versus aflibercept in change of central subfield thickness over the period of week 40 through week 52. More than half of patients in the Beovu arm were maintained on a three-month dosing interval through year one. Beovu demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile comparable to aflibercept; in addition the rate of intraocular inflammation was equivalent between Beovu and aflibercept.   Jakavi       Phase III REACH3 study in chronic GvHD met its primary endpoint of demonstrating superior overall response rate at week 24 in patients compared to best available therapy. The study also met key secondary endpoints, significantly improving failure-free survival and patient-reported symptoms.   Kymriah       Phase II ELARA trial met its primary endpoint (complete response rate) at the interim analysis, demonstrating clinically meaningful benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. No new safety signals were observed.   Iptacopan  (LNP023)       Data from two ongoing Phase II studies for iptacopan in PNH and C3G were presented at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the American Society of Nephrology, respectively.   In the PNH study, compared to baseline, iptacopan substantially improved hematological response as add-on therapy to eculizumab, including a clinically relevant increase of Hb by 2.87 g/dL (p<0.001) in the absence of red blood cell transfusions. These effects were retained in the seven of ten patients who discontinued eculizumab.   In the C3G study, iptacopan treatment led to a 49% reduction in urine protein/creatinine ratio at week 12 when compared to baseline as well as stabilization of renal function (assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate).   In both studies iptacopan showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile.   Zolgensma Phase III STR1VE-EU interim data, in SMA patients with more aggressive disease at baseline, demonstrated significant therapeutic benefit, including prolonged event-free survival, increased motor function and milestone achievement.   Leqvio  (Inclisiran)  Pooled data from Phase III ORION-10 and -11 trials, presented at the European Society of Cardiology, showed highly consistent efficacy in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.   Kisqali Phase III NATALEE trial protocol was amended to increase the sample size (from c.4000 patients to c.5000 patients). The final analysis (event-driven trial) is expected for end 2022 and submission to occur in 2023.   Spartalizumab (PDR001) combination with Tafinlar + Mekinist The Phase III COMBI-i study did not meet its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival for patients with advanced BRAF V600-mutated melanoma. However, the study underscores the importance of Tafinlar + Mekinist as an effective treatment option in such patients. Data from COMBI-i show positive durable responses and PFS benefit for patients treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist in the comparator arm of the trial, despite the study not meeting the primary endpoint.   Canakinumab The Phase III CANOPY-1 trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer passed the interim analysis; the study continues as planned.     ESG updateESG, a key strategic priority for the Novartis Board of Directors and Executive Committee, is integrated across Novartis operations. Novartis focuses on four strategic ESG pillars defined as material by stakeholders: Ethical Standards, Pricing and Access, Global Health Challenges and Corporate Citizenship. In each of these areas, the company has developed ambitious and challenging targets. These include addressing access and global health challenges, which are areas with the highest unmet need worldwide and where Novartis can have the greatest material ESG impact. Novartis is also reinforcing its ambition to be a healthcare industry leader in environmental sustainability, further strengthening its already ambitious target for carbon neutrality to include its entire supply chain by 2030. Novartis issued the healthcare industry’s first sustainability linked bond demonstrating its commitment to wider society. Recent ESG rating agencies upgrades were based on recent settlements, strong governance including extensive ethics policies, leading programs to expand access to healthcare to people in resource-constrained settings and comprehensive employee engagement strategy relative to peers. Capital structure and net debtRetaining a good balance between investment in the business, a strong capital structure and attractive shareholder returns remains a priority.During the first nine months of 2020, Novartis repurchased a total of 14.7 million shares for USD 1.3 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of associates. In addition, 1.6 million shares (USD 0.2 billion) were repurchased from associates. In the same period, 25.8 million shares (for an equity value of USD 1.4 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of associates. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding increased by 9.5 million versus December 31, 2019. Novartis aims to offset the dilutive impact from equity based participation plans of associates over the remainder of the year. These treasury share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 0.1 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 0.2 billion including the benefit from option proceeds.In the third quarter of 2020, Novartis issued the first healthcare industry sustainability-linked bond with a notional amount of EUR 1.85 billion (USD 2.2 billion) and a coupon of 0.00%, reinforcing its commitment to patient access.As of September 30, 2020, the net debt increased to USD 25.4 billion compared to USD 15.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly driven by the acquisition of The Medicines Company for USD 9.6 billion and the USD 7.0 billion annual dividend payment, partly offset by USD 8.3 billion free cash flow during the first nine months of 2020.As of Q3 2020, the long-term credit rating for the company is A1 with Moody’s Investors Service and AA- with S&P Global Ratings.The Group has not experienced liquidity or cash flow disruptions during the nine months of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that Novartis is well positioned to meet its ongoing financial obligations and has sufficient liquidity to support our normal business activities.2020 Outlook Barring unforeseen events Continuing operations (Excluding Alcon from both 2019 and 2020)Net Sales Expected to grow mid single digit (cc)    From a divisional perspective, we expect net sales performance (cc) in 2020 to be as follows:   * Innovative Medicines: expected to grow mid single digit  * Sandoz: expected to grow broadly in line with prior year, decreased from low single digit  Core operating income Expected to grow low double digit to mid teens (cc), upgraded from low double digit     Our guidance assumes that we see a continuation of the return to normal global healthcare systems including prescription dynamics, particularly ophthalmology, in Q4 2020. In addition, we assume that no Gilenya and no Sandostatin LAR generics enter in 2020 in the US.Foreign exchange impact  If late-October exchange rates prevail for the remainder of 2020, the foreign exchange impact for the year would be negative 1 percentage points on net sales and negative 4 percentage points on core operating income. The estimated impact of exchange rates on our results is provided monthly on our website.Key FiguresContinuing operations1,2 Q3 2020 Q3 2019  % change  9M 2020 9M 2019  % change     USD m  USD m  USD  cc  USD m  USD m  USD  cc   Net sales 12 259 12 172 1 0 35 889 35 042 2 4  Operating income 2 412 2 358 2 9 7 508 7 263 3 11  As a % of sales 19.7 19.4     20.9 20.7      Core operating income 4 069 3 748 9 11 11 915 10 650 12 16  As a % of sales 33.2 30.8     33.2 30.4      Net income 1 932 2 041 -5 0 5 972 6 018 -1 6  EPS (USD) 0.85 0.90 -6 0 2.62 2.62 0 7  Core net income 3 467 3 212 8 10 10 124 9 119 11 15  Core EPS (USD) 1.52 1.41 8 9 4.44 3.97 12 16  Cash flows from   operating activities 3 156 4 562 -31   9 645 10 007 -4    Free cash flow  2 697 3 968 -32   8 349 9 449 -12                                Innovative Medicines Q3 2020 Q3 2019  % change  9M 2020 9M 2019  % change     USD m  USD m  USD  cc  USD m  USD m  USD  cc   Net sales 9 837 9 688 2 1 28 780 27 794 4 5  Operating income 1 998 2 404 -17 -11 6 786 7 077 -4 2  As a % of sales 20.3 24.8     23.6 25.5      Core operating income 3 525 3 300 7 9 10 433 9 528 9 13  As a % of sales 35.8 34.1     36.3 34.3                                  Sandoz Q3 2020 Q3 2019  % change  9M 2020 9M 2019  % change     USD m  USD m  USD  cc  USD m  USD m  USD  cc   Net sales 2 422 2 484 -2 -3 7 109 7 248 -2 0  Operating income 395 191 107 113 671 746 -10 -1  As a % of sales 16.3 7.7     9.4 10.3      Core operating income 658 615 7 8 1 806 1 577 15 19  As a % of sales 27.2 24.8     25.4 21.8                                  Corporate Q3 2020 Q3 2019  % change  9M 2020 9M 2019  % change     USD m  USD m  USD  cc  USD m  USD m  USD  cc   Operating income/(loss) 19 -237 nm nm 51 -560 nm nm  Core operating loss -114 -167 32 36 -324 -455 29 31                              Discontinued operations Q3 2020 Q3 2019  % change  9M 2020 9M 2019  % change     USD m  USD m  USD  cc  USD m  USD m  USD  cc   Net sales               1 777        Operating income               71        As a % of sales           4.0      Core operating income               350        As a % of sales           19.7      Net income               4 590                                    Total Group Q3 2020 Q3 2019  % change  9M 2020 9M 2019  % change     USD m  USD m  USD  cc  USD m  USD m  USD  cc   Net income 1 932 2 041 -5 0 5 972 10 608 -44 -40  EPS (USD) 0.85 0.90 -6 0 2.62 4.62 -43 -39  Core net income 3 467 3 212 8 10 10 124 9 397 8 11  Core EPS (USD) 1.52 1.41 8 9 4.44 4.09 9 12  Cash flows   from operating activities 3 156 4 562 -31   9 645 10 085 -4    Free cash flow 2 697 3 968 -32   8 349 9 387 -11                                nm = not meaningful                             1 Continuing operations include the businesses of Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Division including the US generic oral solids and dermatology portfolio as well as the continuing corporate functions and discontinued operations include the business of Alcon.

2020-10-28,"* Novartis has been granted an option to in-license global rights of MP0420 and MP0423 - multi-targeted direct acting antiviral therapeutic candidates demonstrating potential efficacy against COVID-19      * MP0420 and MP0423 are potential medicines with a unique approach for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, with the possibility to manufacture at scale, easy administration and with the potential to bypass cold storage       * Switzerland based Molecular Partners, a global leader in the development of DARPin® therapeutics, will be responsible for the conduct of phase 1 & 2 trials that may lead to emergency use approval; Novartis will be responsible for further development, manufacturing, distribution and commercialization      * This collaboration strengthens Novartis ongoing commitment to research and partner with other companies to find and develop treatment options for COVID-19 and make them available around the world as fast as possible     Basel, October 28, 2020 — Novartis and Molecular Partners AG today announced a collaboration in the form of an option and license agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize Molecular Partners’ anti-COVID-19 DARPin® program, consisting of two therapeutic candidates, MP0420 and MP0423. The collaboration aims to leverage Molecular Partners’ proprietary DARPin® technologies and Novartis broad expertise in global drug development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and commercialization to rapidly advance the program in keeping with the unprecedented global urgency created by the pandemic. Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of those efforts, it has become increasingly clear that to tackle the pandemic at a global level the development of medicines that can prevent and treat the virus, in addition to the development of vaccines, will be crucial. Multiple treatment options increases the likelihood of reaching and treating patients around the world and, in addition, may be especially important for certain populations at greater risk who may benefit from a prophylactic treatment. MP0420 and MP0423 are potential medicines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, with the possibility of being manufactured at scale and the potential to bypass cold storage.“Novartis remains unwavering in its support for tackling COVID-19 and it is clear that this pandemic calls for not just scientific solutions, but also for collaboration between companies to provide treatments in an area of high unmet need. This Swiss led partnership, which could deliver both prophylactic and treatment options at scale for COVID-19 patients across the globe, is another demonstration of our sustained commitment to addressing one of the greatest health challenges of our time,” said Vas Narasimhan, Chief Executive Officer of Novartis. Molecular Partners are a Swiss based clinical-stage biotech company that are developing a new class of custom-built protein therapeutics known as DARPin® therapeutics. Under the agreement, during the option period, Molecular Partners will conduct Phase 1 clinical trials for MP0420, expected to begin in November 2020, and perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423 and Novartis will conduct Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of these trials. Upon option exercise, Novartis would be responsible for all further development and commercialization activities. During the clinical development stage, Molecular Partners will provide clinical supply. The companies will work together to scale-up manufacturing capacity, in collaboration with Sandoz, the generics and biosimilar Novartis division, to provide worldwide supply. Several characteristics of DARPin® therapeutics make them ideally suited for antiviral therapy including multi-specific target binding with the potential to prevent viral escape via mutations, the possibility for subcutaneous administration, long half-life for sustained activity, the potential to bypass cold storage and typically high-yield, highly scalable production in bacterial fermenters. These factors provide the possibility of developing and manufacturing this innovation at scale. This supports the commitment of both companies to leverage their respective strengths and expertise to urgently develop these two potential treatments and if the data are positive, facilitate access to these medicines for patients around the world as quickly as possible. “Our team rapidly mobilized to deliver a unique DARPin®-based approach to address the overwhelming need for effective therapeutics against COVID-19. As a class, DARPins have demonstrated over years of clinical research a number of characteristics that enhance their profile as antiviral therapeutics for a global pandemic. We have built on this long-term research with these two candidates, which have demonstrated extremely potent neutralization of the virus through inhibiting multiple viral mechanisms,” said Patrick Amstutz, Chief Executive Officer of Molecular Partners. “We are thrilled to partner with Novartis, who has shown great commitment to combatting this pandemic and bringing innovative solutions to people around the world.” Under the terms of the agreement, Molecular Partners will receive an upfront payment of CHF 60 million, including equity.Molecular Partners will receive a further payment of CHF 150 million, upon Novartis electing to take up the option to both therapeutic candidates, and significant royalty on sales. Molecular Partners has agreed to forgo royalties in lower income countries, and is aligned with Novartis’ plans to ensure affordability based on countries’ needs and capabilities. Novartis response to COVID-19 Pandemic  Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis has been active in two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). The company is also separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low- and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia patients. Novartis also announced a collaboration with the African Union (AU) through the Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP) to facilitate the supply of medicines from the Novartis Pandemic Response Portfolio to the AU member states and Caricom countries. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID.

2020-10-28,"Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) announced Wednesday it has received the license for global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize two antiviral therapies of Molecular Partners AG (OTC: MLLCF), which may be efficacious against COVID-19.What Happened: Molecular Partners will be paid approximately $66 million upfront, $165 million upon Novartis agreeing to take options on both the therapeutic candidates, and significant royalties on sales, Novartis said in a statement.The two candidates  -- MP0420 and MP0423 -- are ""potential medicines with a unique approach for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19,"" according to Novartis. Both the candidates reportedly have the potential for mass manufacturing, easy administration, and both potentially do not require cold storage.The Swiss drugmaker said it is becoming ""increasingly clear"" that, to tackle the pandemic globally, ""the development of medicines that can prevent and treat the virus, in addition to the development of vaccines, will be crucial.""""This Swiss led partnership, which could deliver both prophylactic and treatment options at scale for COVID-19 patients across the globe,"" said Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan.Why It Matters: The Phase 1 clinical trials for MP0420, conducted by Molecular Partners, are expected to begin in November 2020. Molecular Partners will also perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423, according to Novartis.Novartis said it will conduct the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, with Molecular Partners as a sponsor. Development and commercialization would be shouldered by Novartis, post the trials. Both Swiss Drugmakers will work with Sandoz, the generics and biosimilar division of Novartis, to scale-up manufacturing capacity and ensure global supply. Other than vaccines, antibody cocktails have emerged as a potential treatment option for COVID-19.This month, President Donald Trump was administered Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's (NASDAQ: REGN) antibody treatment, which he later touted as a ""cure."" Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) founder Bill Gates has said that regulatory approval for antibody treatments could sharply reduce COVID-19 mortality.Price Action: Novartis shares traded 1.17% at $80 lower in the pre-market session on Wednesday. Molecular Partners OTC shares closed almost 2.9% higher at $17 on Tuesday.

This approval makes FBRI the first and only approved commercial manufacturing site for CAR-T cell therapy in Asia.“Behind our efforts to reimagine medicine with CAR-T cell therapy lies a commitment to build a manufacturing network that brings treatment closer to patients,” commented Steffen Lang, Global Head of Novartis Technical Operations. “The expertise and infrastructure of FBRI, a world-leading manufacturing organization, allows us to bring CAR-T manufacturing to Asia. With the Japan MHLW commercial manufacturing approval, the recent capacity expansion in the US and our ongoing efforts to optimize and evolve our processes, we are well-positioned to deliver this potentially curative treatment option to more patients around the world.” Novartis has the largest geographical CAR-T cell therapy manufacturing network in the world, including seven CAR-T manufacturing facilities, across four continents. Commercial manufacturing for Kymriah now takes place at five sites globally including at the Morris Plains, New Jersey facility, where the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved a further increase in manufacturing capacity.Kymriah is the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, and the first-ever CAR-T to be approved in two distinct indications. It is a one-time treatment designed to empower patients’ immune systems to fight their cancer. Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of r/r pediatric and young adult (up to 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)1. Kymriah, approved in both indications by the Japan MHLW in 2019, is currently the only CAR-T cell therapy approved in Asia. Clinical manufacturing began at FBRI in 2019 and will continue alongside commercial manufacturing.Kymriah was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a strategic alliance between industry and academia, which was first-of-its-kind in CAR-T research and development.About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell & Gene   Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell & gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis has a deep CAR-T pipeline and ongoing investment in manufacturing and supply chain process improvements. With active research underway to broaden the impact of cell and gene therapy in oncology, Novartis is going deeper in hematological malignancies, reaching patients with other cancer types and evaluating next-generation CAR-T cell therapies that focus on new targets and utilize new technologies.Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to significantly invest in pioneering CAR-T research and initiate global CAR-T trials. Kymriah, the first approved CAR-T cell therapy, developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the foundation of Novartis’ commitment to CAR-T cell therapy. Kymriah is currently approved for use in at least one indication in 26 countries and at more than 260 certified treatment centers, with the ambition for further expansion to help fulfill the ultimate goal of bringing CAR-T cell therapy to every patient in need.The Novartis global CAR-T manufacturing footprint spans seven facilities, across four continents. This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the Novartis manufacturing and supply chain. Commercial and clinical trial manufacturing is now ongoing at Novartis-owned facilities in Stein, Switzerland, Les Ulis, France and Morris Plains, New Jersey, USA, as well as at the contract manufacturing sites at Fraunhofer-Institut for cell therapy and immunology (Fraunhofer-Institut für Zelltherapie und Immunologie) facility in Leipzig, Germany, and now FBRI in Kobe, Japan. Manufacturing production at Cell Therapies in Australia and Cellular Biomedicine Group in China is forthcoming.Important Safety information from the Kymriah SmPCEU Name of the medicinal product:Kymriah 1.2 x 106 – 6 x 108 cells dispersion for infusionImportant note: Before prescribing, consult full prescribing information.Presentation: Cell dispersion for infusion in 1 or more bags for intravenous use (tisagenlecleucel).Indications: Treatment of pediatric and young adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post‑transplant or in second or later relapse. Treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Dosage and administration: B-cell patients: For patients 50 kg and below: 0.2 to 5.0 x 106 CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg body weight. For patients above 50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 CAR-positive viable T-cells (non-weight based).DLBCL Patients: 0.6 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells (non-weight based).Pre‑treatment conditioning (lymphodepleting chemotherapy): Lymphodepleting chemotherapy is recommended to be administered before Kymriah infusion unless the white blood cell (WBC) count within one week prior to infusion is ≤1,000 cells/μL. The availability of Kymriah must be confirmed prior to starting the lymphodepleting regimen.Precautions before handling or administering Kymriah®: Kymriah contains genetically modified human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Kymriah should therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases.Preparation for infusion  The timing of thaw of Kymriah and infusion should be coordinated. Once Kymriah has been thawed and is at room temperature (20°C ‑25°C), it should be infused within 30 minutes to maintain maximum product viability, including any interruption during the infusion.Administration   Kymriah should be administered as an intravenous infusion through latex‑free intravenous tubing without a leukocyte depleting filter, at approximately 10 to 20 mL per minute by gravity flow. If the volume of Kymriah to be administered is ≤20 mL, intravenous push may be used as an alternative method of administration.All contents of the infusion bag(s) should be infused.Clinical assessment prior to infusion: Kymriah treatment should be delayed in some patient groups at risk (see Special warnings and precautions for use).Monitoring after infusion: Patients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of potential cytokine release syndrome, neurological events and other toxicities. Physicians should consider hospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of CRS and/or neurological events. After the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s discretion. Patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion.Elderly (above 65 years of age): Safety and efficacy have not been established in B-cell patients. No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age in DLBCL patients.Paediatric patients: No formal studies have been performed in paediatric patients with B-cell ALL below 3 years of age. The safety and efficacy of Kymriah in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet been established in DLBCL. No data are available.Patients seropositive for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): There is no experience with manufacturing Kymriah for patients with a positive test for HIV, active HBV, or active HCV infection. Leukapheresis material from these patients will not be accepted for Kymriah manufacturing. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Kymriah. Contraindications of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered.Warnings and precautions: Reasons to delay treatment: Due to the risks associated with Kymriah treatment, infusion should be delayed if a patient has any of the following conditions: Unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions or hypotension) from preceding chemotherapies, active uncontrolled infection, active graft versus host disease (GVHD), significant clinical worsening of leukaemia burden or rapid progression of lymphoma following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation: Patients treated with Kymriah should not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells.Active central nervous system (CNS) leukaemia or lymphoma: There is limited experience of use of Kymriah in patients with active CNS leukaemia and active CNS lymphoma. Therefore the risk/benefit of Kymriah has not been established in these populations. Risk of CRS: Occurred in almost all cases within 1 to 10 days post infusion with a median time to onset of 3 days and a median time to resolution of8 days. See full prescribing information for management algorithm of CRS. Risk of neurological events: Majority of events, in particular encephalopathy, confusional state or delirium, occurred within 8 weeks post infusion and were transient. The median time to onset of neurological events was 8 days in B-cell ALL and 6 days in DLBCL; the median time to resolution was 7 days for B-cell ALL and 13 days for DLBCL. Patients should be monitored for neurological events. Risk of infections: Delay start of therapy with Kymriah until active uncontrolled infections have resolved. As appropriate, administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing prior to and during treatment with Kymriah. Serious infections were observed in patients, some of which were life threatening or fatal. After Kymriah administration observe patient and ensure prompt management in case of signs of infection Risk of febrile neutropenia: Frequently observed after Kymriah infusion, may be concurrent with CRS. Appropriate management necessary. Risk of prolonged cytopenias: Appropriate management necessary. Prolonged cytopenia has been associated with increased risk of infections. Myeloid growth factors, particularly granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM CSF), not recommended during the first 3 weeks after Kymriah infusion or until CRS has been resolved. Risk of secondary malignancies: Patients treated with Kymriah may develop secondary malignancies or recurrence of their cancer and should be monitored life‑long for secondary malignancies. Risk of hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia: Infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement should be managed per age and standard guidelines. In patients with low immunoglobulin levels preemptive measures such as immunoglobulin replacement and rapid attention to signs and symptoms of infection should be implemented. Live vaccines: The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Kymriah treatment was not studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Kymriah treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with Kymriah. Risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Patients with elevated uric acid or high tumor burden should receive allopurinol or alternative prophylaxis prior to Kymriah infusion. Continued monitoring for TLS following Kymriah administration should also be performed.  Concomitant disease: Patients with a history of active CNS disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary or cardiac function are likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions of Kymriah and require special attention.  Prior stem cell transplantation: Kymriah infusion is not recommended within 4 months of undergoing an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) because of potential risk of worsening GVHD. Leukapheresis for Kymriah manufacturing should be performed at least 12 weeks after allogeneic SCT.  Serological testing: There is currently no experience with manufacturing Kymriah for patients testing positive for HBV, HCV and HIV. Screening for HBV, HCV and HIV, must be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, can occur in patients treated with medicinal products directed against B cells and could result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death. Prior treatment with anti CD19 therapy: There is limited experience with Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19 directed therapy. Kymriah is not recommended if the patient has relapsed with CD19 negative leukaemia after prior anti-CD19 therapy.  Interference with serological testing: Due to limited and short spans of identical genetic information between the lentiviral vector used to create Kymriah and HIV, some commercial HIV nucleic acid tests (NAT) may give a false positive result.  Sodium and potassium content: This medicinal product contains 24.3 to 121.5 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 1 to 6% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “potassium free”.  Content of dextran 40 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): Contains 11 mg dextran 40 and 82.5 mg dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) per mL. Each of these excipients are known to possibly cause anaphylactic reaction following parenteral administration. Patients not previously exposed to dextran and DMSO should be observed closely during the first minutes of the infusion period.Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interactionLive vaccines: The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Kymriah treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Kymriah treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with Kymriah.Fertility, pregnancy and lactationWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females: Pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential should be verified prior to starting treatment with Kymriah. Consider the need for effective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. There are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of contraception following treatment with Kymriah.Pregnancy: There are no data from the use of Kymriah in pregnant women. It is not known whether Kymriah has the potential to be transferred to the foetus via the placenta and could cause foetal toxicity, including B cell lymphocytopenia. Kymriah is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant women should be advised on the potential risks to the foetus. Pregnancy after Kymriah therapy should be discussed with the treating physician. Pregnant women who have received Kymriah may have hypogammaglobulinaemia. Assessment of immunoglobulin levels is indicated in newborns of mothers treated with Kymriah.Breast feeding: It is unknown whether Kymriah cells are excreted in human milk, a risk to the breast fed infant cannot be excluded. Women who are breast feeding should be advised of the potential risk to the breast fed infant. Breast-feeding should be discussed with the treating physician.Fertility: There are no data on the effect of Kymriah on fertility.Effects on ability to drive and use machines  Driving and engaging in hazardous activities in the 8 weeks following infusion should be refrained due to risks for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination.Adverse drug reactions:B-Cell ALL patients and DLBCL patients:Very common (≥10%): Infections - pathogen unspecified, viral infections, bacterial infections, fungal infections, anaemia, haemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinaemia, decreased appetite, hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, anxiety, delirium, sleep disorder, headache, encephalopathy, arrhythmia, hypotension, hypertension, cough, dyspnoea, hypoxia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia, acute kidney injury, pyrexia, fatigue, oedema, pain, chills, lymphocyte count decreased, white blood cell count decreased, haemoglobin decreased, neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased.

2020-11-02,"* The first randomized, double blind, head-to-head study of Aimovig® (erenumab) against topiramate in patients with episodic and chronic migraine (HER-MES) achieved superiority in its primary and secondary endpoints  * Aimovig showed superior tolerability and efficacy against topiramate and provided a significant reduction in monthly migraine days (MMDs)  * Aimovig is the most prescribed anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway (anti-CGRP) therapy worldwide, with more than 480,000 patients prescribed across 44 countries since launch1The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here:  Basel, November 2, 2020 — Novartis announced today that HER-MES, the first Phase IV, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, head-to-head study of Aimovig® (erenumab) against topiramate, an anticonvulsant, in patients with episodic and chronic migraine met its primary and secondary endpoints. The results of HER-MES showed that Aimovig had a superior tolerability and efficacy profile than topiramate, with less discontinuation over the course of the 24-week treatment phase. Aimovig also showed superior efficacy, with a greater proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days (MMDs).“The data generated by this first of a kind head-to-head study reinforces the value of erenumab as a safe and effective migraine prevention treatment. The findings also provide novel insights into migraine therapy for physicians and patients,” said Prof. Uwe Reuter, Managing Medical Director at Charité Universitätsmedizin.“With Aimovig continuing to be the anti-CGRP treatment with the longest safety and efficacy experience, these results further emphasize its potential to provide significant relief from migraine with an infrequent dosing compared with the oral treatment,” said Estelle Vester-Blokland, Global Head Neuroscience Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Novartis remains fiercely committed to reimagining migraine care worldwide, contributing to the improvement of life for people living with this highly debilitating neurological disease.”HER-MES aimed to determine the tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig 70 mg and 140 mg compared with topiramate, an anticonvulsant commonly used as standard of care in migraine prevention, in the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg daily). The study enrolled 777 adult patients suffering from ≥ 4 MMDs and who were naïve to, not suitable for or had previously failed up to three prophylactic migraine treatments.The primary outcome of HER-MES explored the Aimovig treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events compared with topiramate during the double-blind treatment phase of the study. Overall, Aimovig showed superior tolerability against topiramate, with a higher proportion of patients remaining on Aimovig than on topiramate.The secondary endpoint looked into the superiority of Aimovig compared with topiramate in terms of at least 50% reduction in MMDs to baseline in the last three months of the 24-week, double-blind treatment phase. A higher number of patients in the Aimovig treatment arm experienced a significant (≥50%) reduction in MMDs compared with those on topiramate treatment arm. The safety profile in the HER-MES study was generally consistent with those seen in previous Aimovig clinical trials.Additional findings and detailed results of primary and secondary endpoints from this trial will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.Migraine is a highly debilitating disease that has a significant impact on people’s lives, including time spent with family and friends, or at work2,3. Aimovig is the first European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved migraine preventive treatment that targets the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R). It is self-administered once monthly via the SureClick® autoinjector, does not require a loading dose and is easy to use4.Aimovig is the only CGRP-R inhibitor with up to 5-year clinical trial data in episodic and chronic migraine, adding to the breadth of data showcasing the expanded long-term safety and efficacy of the treatment for migraine patients.About HER-MES  HER-MES (NCT03828539) is a two-armed, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, Phase IV study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig® (erenumab) versus topiramate in a patient-centered setting5. The primary endpoint was treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events compared with topiramate during the double-blind treatment phase of the study5. The secondary endpoint was efficacy of 70 mg and 140 mg erenumab versus topiramate in terms of at least 50% reduction in monthly migraine days to baseline in the last three months (months 4, 5 and 6) of the double-blind, 24-week treatment phase5 in the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg daily). The HER-MES study enrolled 777 adult patients with episodic or chronic migraine (≥4 migraine days per month) who had not previously received migraine prevention treatment or had unsuccessfully discontinued up to three previous therapies with propranolol/metoprolol, amitriptyline and flunarizine5. After a 2-week screening and 4-week baseline phase, patients were randomized 1:1 to erenumab or topiramate. In the double-blind, 24-week treatment phase, patients in the erenumab arm received either 70 mg or 140 mg directly after the baseline phase according to the current expert information, as estimated by the investigator5. An increase in dose from 70 mg to 140 mg was possible at any time during the study. Patients in the topiramate arm were given topiramate at the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg), starting with a 6-week titration phase, according to the latest expert information5. The HER-MES study has been fully developed in Germany. The study was conducted in 82 centers from the end of February 2019 to the end of July 2020.About Aimovig® (erenumab)  Aimovig is the first European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved migraine prevention treatment designed specifically to block the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R), which plays a critical role in migraine. Aimovig has been studied in several large, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess its safety and efficacy in migraine prevention. More than 3,000 patients have participated in our overall clinical trial program. This includes 2,600 participants across the four placebo-controlled pivotal Phase II and Phase III clinical studies as well as participants in further studies such as LIBERTY, a dedicated study in a difficult-to-treat treatment failure population. The most common side effects in the clinical program to date have been viral upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, and back pain. Aimovig is the most prescribed anti-CGRP worldwide, with more than 480,000 patients prescribed in the post-trial setting.Novartis and Amgen are co-commercializing Aimovig in the US. Amgen has exclusive commercialization rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has exclusive rights to commercialize in the rest of the world.About Migraine  Migraine is a distinct neurological disease6. It involves recurrent attacks of moderate-to-severe head pain that is typically pulsating, often unilateral and associated with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light, sound and odors7. Migraine is associated with personal pain, disability, reduced quality of life and financial cost to society8. It has a profound and limiting impact on an individual’s abilities to carry out everyday tasks; the World Health Organization reported migraine to be one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability for men and women8,9. It remains under-recognized and under-treated8,10.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-11-05,"* Significant reduction of synovitis (joint lining inflammation) was demonstrated with Cosentyx®  at Week 12  vs. placebo, with improvements as early as Week 11      * ULTIMATE is the first ever Phase IIIb imaging study primarily looking at the time course of response to Cosentyx in biologic-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) using Power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS)1     * PDUS is a sensitive technology, allowing detection and monitoring of early changes in synovitis and enthesitis1 with earlier insights into treatment efficacy     * More than 400,000 patients have been treated with Cosentyx across moderate-to-severe psoriasis, PsA, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) worldwide since launch2Basel, November 5, 2020 — Novartis, a leader in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, today announced 12-week results from the first-of-its-kind Phase IIIb ULTIMATE randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated the significant treatment response of Cosentyx® (secukinumab) on synovitis (joint lining inflammation) in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) versus placebo. Synovitis was assessed using an advanced and sensitive imaging technique called Power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS). These data are being presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) All-Virtual Annual Meeting, November 5-9, 2020.“Psoriatic arthritis can have a significant impact on a patient’s joints. Joint lining inflammation, also known as synovitis, if left untreated, can cause pain to worsen, joint damage and may decrease physical function,” said Dr. Maria A. D’Agostino, Professor of Rheumatology at the Catholic University of Rome. “These data are highly encouraging, showing Cosentyx can significantly reduce synovitis at Week 12 versus placebo with results seen as early as Week 1, and that ultrasound is a sensitive and objective tool to monitor joint inflammation in PsA patients.”The use of a standardized ultrasound synovitis score (GLOESS) as the primary endpoint showed objectively the significant benefit of Cosentyx versus placebo on synovitis at Week 12 with an early improvement observed from Week one. Treatment with Cosentyx also significantly improved key secondary endpoints versus placebo, including ACR20 (68% vs 34%, respectively), ACR50 (46% vs 9%, respectively) and enthesitis (mean change from baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada enthesitis index score [SPARCC] of -2.4 vs -1.7 respectively)1. The safety profile of Cosentyx through 12 weeks was consistent with previous studies1.Novartis anticipates disclosing full 24-week data from the ongoing ULTIMATE trial at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual meeting in 2021 and final analysis at ACR 2021.""As a strong believer in the diagnostic and treatment monitoring benefits of ultrasound, this first large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in PsA with an ultrasonographic primary endpoint is incredibly exciting. The ability to use a sensitive imaging technique to assess synovitis and enthesitis in PsA represents a breakthrough in how we conceptualize treatment goals,” said Dr. Catherine Bakewell of Intermountain Medical Group in Salt Lake City, UT and an investigator in the ULTIMATE study. “In addition to other measures, PDUS helps to provide earlier insight into treatment response, and that patients are more effectively treated across multiple domains of this heterogeneous psoriatic disease spectrum.” PsA is a complex disease with multiple manifestations driving patient symptoms3,4. In PsA, synovitis may lead to joint damage and if left untreated, the joint damage can be irreversible5,6. In addition to reducing synovitis, Cosentyx has been proven to provide long-lasting inhibition of radiographic progression in PsA, limiting joint damage and helping to improve outcomes for patients with this debilitating condition7,8.Plain Language Media Summaries for ULTIMATE and other key abstracts presented at ACR 2020 are available from the Novartis website: https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/immunology-dermatology/abstract-summaries-acr About Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)  PsA is estimated to affect up to 50 million people worldwide9,10. It is part of a family of life-long inflammatory diseases (spondyloarthritis) that target the joints and is closely associated with psoriasis10. Up to 40% of patients with psoriasis may develop PsA10. Symptoms of PsA include joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful swelling of the tendons and irreversible joint damage10.About ULTIMATE   ULTIMATE is the first ongoing 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIIb study using ultrasound to assess time-course of response of Cosentyx on synovitis in psoriatic arthritis. The study enrolled 166 adult biologic-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either secukinumab (300-mg or 150-mg according to severity of skin disease) or placebo weekly for a month with treatment starting at Week 4, followed by a once-a-month dose for the next 11 months.The primary endpoint is the difference in mean change from baseline to Week 12 between secukinumab and placebo in Global Omeract-European League Against Rheumatism Ultrasound Synovitis Score (GLOESS). GLOESS is a standardized composite score that has shown to be sensitive to change and is able to detect and score synovitis11. Secondary endpoints include ACR20, ACR50 and change in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis index from baseline to Week 12 compared with placebo. ACR20 and ACR50 are composite measures defined as both improvement of 20% or 50% in the number of tender and number of swollen joints, and a 20% or 50% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire, visual analog pain scale and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein12. The SPARCC enthesitis index is a validated clinical tool for evaluation of enthesitis13,14.About Cosentyx® (secukinumab)  Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)15-17. Cosentyx is the only biologic with proven efficacy in all key manifestations of PsA18.Cosentyx is backed by more than 12 years of clinical experience and long-term five-year data across three indications of psoriasis, PsA and AS, as well as data from real-world evidence19-24. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting comprehensive treatment across axial spondyloarthritis, PsA and psoriatic disease, with more than 400,000 patients treated worldwide with Cosentyx since launch2 and plans to expand to 10 indications over the next 10 years. Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In addition, a Phase III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by year end5Basel, November 6, 2020 — Novartis today announced new data from an interim analysis for the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CAN-COVID trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)6. The ongoing trial failed to meet its primary endpoint showing that treatment with canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) did not demonstrate a significantly greater chance of survival for patients without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, compared with placebo plus SoC up to Day 291. The trial did not meet its key secondary endpoint of reducing the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after treatment1. The safety profiles of canakinumab plus SoC and placebo plus SoC were comparable1.“Though the CAN-COVID trial did not show the patient benefit we were hoping for, it helps improve the scientific understanding of COVID-19 and the role of interleukin-1β inhibition,” said John Tsai, M.D., Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “There’s still an urgent need for effective ways to combat COVID-19 and we will continue to apply our best scientific minds in support of the global pandemic response, including a Phase III trial of ruxolitinib. We’re deeply grateful to the patients who participated and their caregivers, as well as the healthcare professionals and hospital staff who made this research possible while fighting the pandemic on the front line.”In the trial, the primary endpoint of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation was 88.8% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 85.7% for placebo plus SoC (P=0.29)1. The key secondary endpoint of COVID-19-related mortality up to 4 weeks was 4.9% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 7.2% for placebo plus SoC (P=0.33)1. Both the primary and key secondary endpoints trended in favor of canakinumab but did not reach statistical significance1. No new safety signals for canakinumab were identified1.This interim analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks. The CAN-COVID results do not affect any other ongoing trials for canakinumab, including investigations for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)7-9.As part of its continued efforts to support the global pandemic response, Novartis in October announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-194. In addition, a Phase III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by year end5.About CAN-COVID  CAN-COVID is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)6. Patients were hypoxic but not requiring intubation or invasive mechanical ventilation6. The primary endpoint was to demonstrate the benefit of canakinumab plus SoC vs placebo plus SoC in increasing the chance of survival without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation up to Day 296. The key secondary endpoint was to reduce the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after trial treatment6. The trial enrolled 454 patients at multiple centers across the US, Russia and Europe1. Both endpoints were analyzed at Day 296. The average age of trial participants was 58 years old, ranging from 18 to 98 years old1. Approximately 30% were Hispanic or Latino, 16% were Black or African American and 4% were Asian1. Interim analysis of Day 29 results is available. The trial is ongoing (to Day 127) with full results expected in early 20216.About canakinumab  Canakinumab is biologic medicine used in the treatment of a number of rare, debilitating auto-inflammatory diseases, for which there are limited options available. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), blocking its action2,3,10. Excessive production of IL-1β plays a prominent role in certain inflammatory diseases and immune responses11,12. Canakinumab is an established medicine approved under the trade name Ilaris® in approximately 60 countries including the US, Europe and others. It is indicated for rare conditions including periodic fever syndromes, adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA)2,3. First approved in 2009, canakinumab has been proven to be highly effective and well tolerated as a treatment option for its approved indications based on previously reported clinical trials2,3. As well as being studied in severe COVID-19, canakinumab is also being investigated for the treatment of a number of other diseases involving inflammation, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)7-9.Novartis response to COVID-19 pandemic  Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)13. Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19, and the company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines4. We continue with the Phase III trial for ruxolitinib, another Novartis medicine, in collaboration with Incyte5. Preliminary results from this trial are expected by year end. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-1914, 15. In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop an antiviral molecule to potentially treat all coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low- and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone, which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia13. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID16.

2020-11-13,"*  Pooled data analyses from Phase III ORION-9, -10 and -11 showed that inclisiran consistently reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 51% in both male and female adult patients and in three age categories1,2      * Sustained LDL-C reduction with inclisiran was observed regardless of age or gender differences1,2 with two doses a year, after an initial dose and then again at three months; the overall trial dosing schedule was at months 1, 3 and then every 6 months up to month 17       * LDL-C is the most readily modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), yet despite widespread statin use 80% of high-risk patients do not reach guideline-recommended LDL-C targets3,4       * Inclisiran recently received a positive CHMP opinion and recommendation for marketing authorization in Europe and is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here: Basel, November 13, 2020 — Novartis today announced results from two pooled post-hoc analyses of Phase III ORION-9, -10 and -11 trials, evaluating the impact of age and gender on the efficacy and safety of inclisiran, an investigational and potential first-in-class small interfering RNA (siRNA) for hyperlipidemia in adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The data showed that at month 17, inclisiran was well-tolerated and provided effective and sustained reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) when used in addition to other lipid lowering therapies regardless of patients’ age and gender1,2. During the trials, inclisiran was administered at months 1, 3 and then every 6 months up to month 17. Results were presented at the virtual American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2020.“High LDL-C and other risk factors for ASCVD, as well as the potential for treatment side effects, may increase with age and differ by gender,” said Kausik Ray, MD, ORION-11 trial principal investigator, Professor of Public Health at Imperial College London and Honorary Consultant Cardiologist at the Imperial College NHS Trust. “These data are important as they show that inclisiran, as a siRNA, has the potential to provide consistent efficacy and tolerability despite the cholesterol-lowering treatment challenges posed by age and gender with two doses a year after the initial dosing regimen on day 1 and month 3.”In post-hoc analyses of the pooled results from the ORION Phase III trials in more than 3,600 patients, treatment with inclisiran delivered similar LDL-C reductions of approximately 51% from baseline for both women and men (50.6% vs 50.6% respectively) compared to placebo1. Results from a second pooled analysis showed that inclisiran-treated patients in three age categories all achieved similar LDL-C reductions of approximately 51% (−51.3% <65 years; −49.9% ≥65 years to <75 years; −51.0% ≥75 years)2. In both analyses, inclisiran was well-tolerated1,2.“Whether you look at it from an age or a gender perspective, inclisiran analyses continue to show consistency with effective and sustained LDL-C reduction lasting over the dosing interval,” said David Soergel, MD, Global Head of Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Drug Development, Novartis. “As we move forward in our journey to reimagine treatment for ASCVD, these data analyses reinforce the potential of inclisiran as a first-in-class siRNA treatment to transform LDL-C management with two doses a year, following the initial dose and another dose at three months, and a positive tolerability profile.” On Friday, October 16, 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion and recommended granting marketing authorization for inclisiran. Novartis is anticipating a final regulatory decision in Europe in December 2020 and is under review by the US Food and Drug Administration.About the Pooled Post-Hoc Analyses from Phase III ORION-9, -10 and -11 trials: Age and Gender   The pooled analyses include data from inclisiran’s ORION-9, -10 and -11 trials, which were multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,18-month studies evaluating inclisiran in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (ORION-9), ASCVD (ORION-10) and ASCVD or ASCVD risk equivalents (ORION-11) on statin therapy who required additional LDL-C lowering. The primary endpoints for these studies were percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to 17 months and time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline between 3 months and up to 18 months. The primary endpoints were achieved in all three studies5-7. The pooled analyses assessed inclisiran’s efficacy for lowering LDL-C, as well as safety and tolerability, across age ranges and by gender1,2.Impact of age on the efficacy of inclisiran versus placebo (<65 years; ≥65 years to <75 years; ≥75 years)2:  * Percentage change between inclisiran and placebo in LDL-C at month 17 was similar across all ages: −51.3% (<65 years), −49.9% (≥65 years to <75 years), −51.0% (≥75 years)  * Time-adjusted percentage LDL-C change between inclisiran and placebo at month 18 was similar across all ages: −49.6% (<65 years), −51.5% (≥65 years to <75 years), −50.8% (≥75 years)Impact of gender on the efficacy of inclisiran versus placebo1:  * Percentage change between inclisiran and placebo in LDL-C at month 17 was consistent across women and men at -50.6% and -50.6% respectively  * Time-adjusted LDL-C change between inclisiran and placebo at month 18 was consistent across women and men at -50.5% and -50.6%Across both analyses, inclisiran was reported to be well-tolerated irrespective of age or gender. Injection site reactions (ISR) were more frequent in female versus male patients and in the <65 population versus elder patients, all ISRs were transient and mild or moderate in terms of severity.About the ORION Phase III Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering Studies  ORION-9 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium salt 300 mg, equivalent to 284 mg of inclisiran, administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose5. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 482 participants with clinical or genetic evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and elevated LDL-C, despite a maximally tolerated dose of LDL-C-lowering therapies (e.g. a statin or ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered mean placebo-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 48% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 44% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The international study was conducted at 46 sites in eight countries5.ORION-10 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium salt 300 mg, equivalent to 284 mg of inclisiran, administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose6. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,561 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and elevated LDL-C, despite a maximally tolerated dose of LDL-C-lowering therapies (e.g. a statin and/or ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-10, inclisiran delivered mean placebo-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 52% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 54% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The study was conducted at 145 sites in the United States6,7.ORION-11 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium salt 300 mg, equivalent to 284 mg of inclisiran, administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose6. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,617 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents and elevated LDL-C despite a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-11, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted change in LDL-C reductions of 50% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 49% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The international study was conducted at 70 sites in seven countries6,7.About Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)  Atherosclerosis corresponds to the accumulation of lipids over time mainly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the inner lining of the arteries. Unexpected rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque can cause an atherosclerotic cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke8,9. ASCVD accounts for over 85% of all cardiovascular disease deaths10. ASCVD is the primary cause of death in the European Union and its burden in the United States is greater than that from any other chronic diseases11,12. ASCVD risk equivalent corresponds to conditions that confer a similar risk for a ASCVD event (e.g. diabetes, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia)6,13.About Inclisiran  If approved, inclisiran (KJX839) would be the first and only therapy to use the small interfering RNA (siRNA mechanism) of action to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which could help improve outcomes for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a deadly form of cardiovascular disease5,6,14. With two doses a year and effective and sustained LDL-C reduction, inclisiran works as a complement to statins. Inclisiran works differently from other therapies by preventing the production of the target protein in the liver, increasing hepatic uptake of LDL-C and clearing it from the bloodstream14. Inclisiran is dosed initially, again at 3 months, and then once every 6 months. In three clinical trials, patients taking inclisiran maintained LDL-C reduction throughout each 6-month dosing interval5,6. Administered in-office as a subcutaneous injection, inclisiran integrates seamlessly into a patient’s healthcare routine5,6.No significant safety or tolerability concerns have been identified with the long-term administration of inclisiran. In the Phase III trials, inclisiran was well-tolerated with a safety profile shown to be comparable to placebo5,6. The most common adverse reactions reported (≥3% of patients treated with inclisiran and occurring more frequently than placebo) were injection site reaction, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, bronchitis, pain in extremity and dyspnea. Adverse events at the injection site were generally mild and none were severe or persistent5,6.Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a leader in RNAi therapeutics.About Novartis in Cardiovascular-Renal-Metabolism  Bending the curve of life requires addressing some of society’s biggest public health concerns.

2020-11-19,"* Five virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) with three developers expected to add more than 275 megawatts of clean power to the electrical grid      * Projects expected to address Novartis greenhouse gas emissions across its European operations, equivalent to removing approximately 113 000 passenger vehicles from the road annually1      * Agreements mark a major milestone on the Novartis environmental sustainability journey to be carbon neutral across its operations by 2025 and across its supply chain by 2030Basel, November 19, 2020 — Novartis today announced the signature of five virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), which are expected to collectively add more than 275 megawatts of clean power to the electrical grid. This move makes Novartis the first pharmaceutical company set to achieve 100% renewable electricity in its European operations through VPPAs. “At Novartis, environmental sustainability is aligned with our purpose to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people’s lives,” said Montse Montaner, Chief Sustainability Officer at Novartis. “Energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions are the cornerstones of our strategy for reducing emissions. These agreements mark a major milestone on the Novartis environmental sustainability journey to be carbon neutral across its operations by 2025 and across its value chain by 2030.""Under the agreements, wind and solar electricity will be generated from six renewable energy projects being developed by three different providers – Acciona, EDP Renewables and Enel Green Power. All projects will be located in Spain. The projects are expected to be online by 2023 and aim to address the company’s carbon footprint across its European operations over a period of 10 years from the start of operations. This is equivalent to removing approximately 113 000 passenger vehicles from the road each year1. These European agreements follow the VPPA recently implemented with the Santa Rita East windfarm in Texas, US, which currently addresses 100% of the electricity used in our operations in the US and Canada. ""Novartis has demonstrated tremendous and ongoing sustainability leadership in the pharmaceutical industry,"" said John Powers, Vice President of Global Renewables and Cleantech at Schneider Electric. ""Executing five deals allows Novartis to diversify risk across technology, location, counterparty and deal structure making for a balanced portfolio of Spanish renewable energy. We want to congratulate Novartis on this sustainability milestone and shaping a clean energy future."" Schneider Electric, a global specialist in energy management, acted as advisor in the project. Global law firm Baker McKenzie advised Novartis on all legal aspects relating to the VPPAs.Environmental sustainability at Novartis  At Novartis, we aim to drive sustainability through our own operations, as well as those of our suppliers, and we have set ambitious targets to minimize our impacts on climate, waste and water. We are committed to using resources efficiently and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which affect the climate. Our ambition is to make the company both energy and climate resilient. We aim to become carbon neutral in our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2025, and to achieve carbon neutrality across our supply chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2030. As a stepping stone to achieve our ambition, we have an approved Science Based Target which commits us to a 35% reduction in absolute emissions across our value chain without using carbon offsets.For more information: https://www.novartis.com/our-company/corporate-responsibility/environmental-sustainabilityDisclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-11-19,"Looking into the current session, Novartis Inc. (NYSE: NVS) shares are trading at $86.24, after a 0.51% gain. Moreover, over the past month, the stock increased by 2.16%, but in the past year, fell by 4.70%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 24.66%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Pharmaceuticals stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.  The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

2020-11-19,"* Novartis enters into exclusive worldwide license with Mesoblast to develop, commercialize and manufacture remestemcel-L for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other indications      * Addition of remestemcel-L could expand Novartis respiratory portfolio by adding potential first-in-class ARDS therapy using innovative cell-based technology with platform potential       * Deal includes $50 million upfront cash payment and equity/share  subscription, plus performance-based milestones and royalties for access to a cell-therapy based platform with worldwide rights to a range of potential indications   Basel, November 19, 2020 — Novartis announced today that it entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Mesoblast to develop, commercialize and manufacture remestemcel-L for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including that associated with COVID-19. ARDS is an area of significant unmet need, with an approximate 40% mortality rate with current standard of care, which includes prolonged ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation.1,2 As the potential first ARDS therapy, remestemcel-L will use mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a cell-based platform technology, to treat this deadly condition and improve outcomes. Remestemcel-L is currently being studied in COVID-19-related ARDS in an ongoing 300-patient Phase III study.3 Novartis intends to initiate a Phase III study in non-COVID-19-related ARDS after the anticipated closing of the license agreement and successful completion and outcome of the current study. “We believe that Novartis is uniquely placed to advance this important potential new therapy,” said John Tsai, M.D., Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “Novartis is committed to, and has demonstrated success with, cell-based therapies and transforming care for a spectrum of respiratory diseases. This makes remestemcel-L an important addition to our pipeline. It has the potential to be the first treatment for the most critically ill ARDS patients, and it provides us with an opportunity to apply years of specialized experience directly to the work of saving lives.”The demonstrated ability of Novartis to rapidly move from clinical to commercial scale with cell-based therapies will play a role in the successful development and potential commercialization of remestemcel-L, as will the nearly two decades of experience Novartis has in delivering first-in-class products that address areas of unmet respiratory need. In March, an open label compassionate use program was conducted, which included 12 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, who were being supported with mechanical ventilation. Remestemcel-L treatment was associated with an 83% survival rate.4 Based on those results, remestemcel-L is being studied in this population in an ongoing 300-patient Phase III study, conducted in collaboration with the Cardiothoracic Surgical Network, which is anticipated to be completed in early 2021.3 After the anticipated closing of the license agreement and successful completion and outcome of this ongoing study, Novartis and Mesoblast will work together to develop appropriate critical quality attributes that meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for remestemcel-L in advance of initiation of the Phase III study in non-COVID-19-related ARDS.  Under the license agreement, Novartis will acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, commercialize and manufacture remestemcel-L for ARDS, and will obtain access to an innovative cell-therapy platform with a range of potential applications in severe respiratory conditions and beyond. Novartis will make a $25 million upfront payment and invest $25 million in Mesoblast equity with additional payments and royalties due on achievement of agreed development, regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, Novartis will provide certain support to enable commercial manufacturing scale-up. Novartis has the option, if exercised, to distribute remestemcel-L for graft versus host disease (GVHD) (outside Japan). Both parties have rights to co-fund development and commercialization for other non-respiratory indications. The closing of the license agreement is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and certain other conditions.About remestemcel-L   Remestemcel-L, is an investigational therapy comprising of culture-expanded mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the bone marrow of an unrelated donor.5 Remestemcel-L is thought to have immunomodulatory properties to counteract the cytokine storms that are implicated in various inflammatory conditions by down-regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increasing production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and enabling recruitment of naturally occurring anti-inflammatory cells to involved tissues.5 In the Phase III study in COVID-19-related ARDS, remestemcel-L is administered as two infusions of 2x106 MSC/kg given three to four days apart.3 The administration of remestemcel-L for the treatment of all-cause ARDS could be the subject of further exploration.About mesenchymal stromal cells     Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue and other sources that can be expanded in culture to larger quantities.6 In preclinical studies MSCs have been suggested to transiently accumulate in the pulmonary circulation and have potent immunomodulatory functions.7 They express receptors for multiple chemokine, cytokine and growth factor receptors and in inflammatory conditions secrete immunomodulatory mediators that have broad-acting effects to promote resolution of inflammation and tissue repair.8 MSCs have been infused into well over 1,000 patients, including young children, without serious adverse events to date, testifying to the general safety of this therapeutic approach.9About acute respiratory distress syndrome   Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome that represents a final common pathway for lung injury caused by a variety of factors including bacterial and viral infection (including COVID-19).2  It is characterized by life threatening hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without evidence of cardiac failure.10 Mortality often exceeds 40%.2 Aside from appropriate ventilator and fluid management, no therapies have been shown to consistently improve survival in randomized clinical trials.8,11Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The virtual meeting provides a deeper view into the company's progress on its ongoing transformation and growth strategy focused on becoming the leading medicines company powered by data science and advanced therapy platforms. ""Novartis offers a unique profile as a fully focused medicines company with diversification across therapeutic areas and geographies, while providing exposure to cutting-edge platforms. We have delivered strong operational performance, growing the top- and bottom- line and delivering on our commitment to margin expansion. Our rich pipeline continues to advance, and we highlight many assets that show significant promise. Reflecting our confidence in future growth and success of our pipeline, we are initiating a share buyback of up to USD 2.5 billion,” said Novartis CEO, Vas Narasimhan.Novartis has a leading pipeline based on scale, innovation and future value, including 116 assets in phase I or II, 49 in Phase III or undergoing registration and more than 65 new molecular entities. The pipeline is expected to fuel growth in the mid-to long-term, with around 90 percent potential first-in-class/first-in-indication medicines and about 80 percent of targets in areas of high unmet patient need. The company is strengthening its advanced therapy platforms along the value chain with 20 advanced platform therapies in clinical development alongside a large number of pre-clinical projects. Novartis is also making significant progress on the manufacturing and commercialization of these advanced therapy platforms. The total value of estimated sales of products launched from 2020 to 2026 puts Novartis as number two for pipeline replacement power in the global pharmaceutical industry.The company is advancing sustained lifecycle management for many assets with five key programs highlighted at the meeting:  * Entresto® (sacubitril/valsartan) is under review for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with a US regulatory decision expected in the first quarter of 2021. Phase III results are expected in the first half of next year from the PARADISE MI trial studying Entresto in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  * Cosentyx® (secukinumab) continues to show strength in dermatology and findings from a Phase III trial in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are expected in the second half of 2021.  * Kisqali® (ribociclib) continues to grow in-market with overall survival (OS) data in aBC from the MONALEESA-2 trial anticipated in the second half of 2021.   * Alpelisib (BYL719) is on track for a US submission in PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) in 2021.   * Beovu® (brolucizumab) is progressing in Phase III development for diabetic macular edema (DME) with a potential submission planned in 2021.From the many assets in the Pharmaceuticals business unit, Novartis is also highlighting multiple mid- to late-stage assets with key milestones expected in 2021 and 2022:  * Iptacopan (LNP023), a potential first-in-class oral factor B inhibitor in development for several rare renal diseases and a hematological disorder, is expected to begin Phase III development for IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) in the first half of 2021. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted orphan drug designation to iptacopan for the treatment of IgAN and PRIME designation in C3G.  * Iscalimab (CFZ533) is an anti-CD40 antibody in development across multiple indications including Sjögren’s syndrome, kidney and liver transplantation; with first results expected in 2022.  * The Phase III clinical trials for the next-generation anti-IgE/FcεRI antibody ligelizumab (QGE031) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) are fully enrolled, with results expected in the second half of 2021 and regulatory submission in 2022.   * In December 2019, Novartis initiated a Phase III outcomes study for pelacarsen (TQJ230), a potential first-in-class antisense oligonucleotide for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with elevated levels of lipoprotein (a). Results are expected in 2024.   * Inclisiran (Leqvio®) has received positive CHMP opinion for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, marking an important milestone towards it becoming potentially available in the EU. Currently under regulatory review with the FDA with an action date of December 2020.    * The FDA granted orphan drug designation for the company’s orally administered, small molecule RNA splicing modulator branaplam (LMI070) for the treatment of Huntington’s disease (HD). A Phase IIb study in HD patients is planned to begin in the first half of 2021.From its broad portfolio in the Oncology business unit, Novartis is also highlighting five mid- to late-stage assets with key milestones expected in 2021:  * The Phase III program for canakinumab (ACZ885) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is progressing with final results expected from the CANOPY-1 and CANOPY-2 trials in the second and first half of 2021 respectively.  * Results from the Phase III VISION trial for 177Lu-PSMA-617 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC 3L) are expected in the first half of 2021.  * Sabatolimab (MBG453), an anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibody, makes progress in a Phase III trial in high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS), and a potential first submission is anticipated in the second half of 2021.   * TNO155, a SHP2 inhibitor, is advancing in early clinical trials with a broad combination strategy for KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC and other solid tumors.  * LXH254, a selective B/C RAF inhibitor, is making progress in multiple combination studies in NRAS and BRAF mutant melanomas and in certain forms of lung cancers.  For Sandoz, management provides an update on progress against its strategy. Recent successes include increasing biosimilar market share in Europe, expansion of gross margin, joint investment to drive sustainable production of antibiotics and strategic deals in the US and Japan. Sandoz is now the only generics company with a top three position in all major regions (US, Europe, ROW). The division continues to target sustained industry leadership, with growth driven primarily by biosimilars, based on a strong pipeline of more than 15 molecules, and a goal to achieve margins in the mid to high 20s range. Sandoz also continues to drive value for society, reaching well over 500 million patients annually, playing a leading role in generating generic savings for healthcare systems worldwide.  The announced share buyback of up to USD 2.5 billion will be executed under the existing annual general meeting authority, starts immediately and will last into the first half of 2021. The program is supported by Novartis’ liquidity and strong balance sheet, in line with our capital structure reflecting AA- (S&P) / A1 (Moody’s) credit rating, and existing capital allocation priorities.Novartis is committed to driving constant margin expansion and is on track to deliver USD 2 billion cost savings by year-end across Novartis Technical Operations and Novartis Business Services. Novartis Technical Operations also has productivity programs in place that are set to further generate around USD 2 billion in cost reduction in the mid-term.In the Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) space, Novartis has taken significant steps to achieve its objective of becoming one of the leaders in the sector. Key developments in the last 12 months include the resolution of material legacy compliance issues and the launch of the Code of Ethics, expanded Diversity and Inclusions efforts across all operations, as well as the issuance of the first-of-its–kind sustainability bond in the pharmaceutical industry.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The management also exhibited a heightened confidence level in its sales projections based on the current pipeline of products under development.What Happened: The buyback decision was spurred by a strong liquidity position along with the top ratings for its capital structure from companies like S&P (AA-) and Moody's (A1).CEO Vas Narasimhan said that management has ""confidence in future growth and success of our pipeline."" The share repurchase program will kick-off immediately and could continue till the first half of the next year.Novartis expects margins to widen due to cost reduction measures across the Technical Operations and Business Services units. These efforts could save close to $2 billion by the end of 2020. The management anticipates an additional cost savings of $2 billion from productivity programs in the Technical Operations unit.Why Does It Matter: Novartis management has high hopes from five of its assets in experimental medicines for cancer treatment, which could progress to the mid and late stages of trials next year. Six assets from the Pharmaceuticals unit are expected to reach key milestones between 2021 and 2022.Based on products under development, Novartis holds the second spot in the biopharma sector.

2020-12-04,"* Results of REACH3 trial also demonstrate significant improvements in failure-free survival (FFS) and patient-reported symptoms1  * Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a life-threatening complication of stem cell transplants and half of patients become steroid refractory/dependent2,3  * Findings from the study were presented at ASH 2020, and complement previously reported positive results for Jakavi in acute GvHD; data to be submitted to ex-U.S. health authorities4Basel, December 4, 2020 — Detailed results from the pivotal Phase III REACH3 study demonstrate Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) significantly improved outcomes across a range of efficacy measures in patients with steroid-refractory/dependent chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) compared to best available therapy (BAT)1. The results of REACH3, the first successful, randomized Phase III trial in chronic GvHD, were presented today during the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition (ASH). REACH3 is jointly sponsored by Novartis and Incyte.“The damaging and sometimes deadly effects of chronic GvHD following stem cell transplant present significant treatment challenges, particularly for the nearly half of patients who do not adequately respond to steroid treatment,” said Dr. Robert Zeiser, University Hospital Freiburg, Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg, Germany. “Based on the compelling REACH3 results, we now have a potential new standard of care for these patients.”In REACH3, patients treated with Jakavi achieved significantly greater overall response rate (ORR) compared to BAT (49.7% vs. 25.6%; p<0.0001i) at Week 24, the primary endpoint of the study1. Jakavi also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key secondary endpoints:  * Patients receiving Jakavi had a significant improvement of failure-free survival (FFS; defined as time to the earliest recurrence of the underlying disease, the start of new systemic treatment for chronic GvHD, or death) than patients receiving BAT (median FFS not yet reached vs. 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.370, 95% CI, 0.268 to 0.510; p<0.0001)1.  * Patients treated with Jakavi also had greater improvements in patient-reported symptoms than those treated with BAT (24.2% vs. 11.0%; p=0.0011), as measured by the rate of responders who achieved a reduction of ≥ 7 points of total symptom score (TSS) from baseline of the modified Lee Symptom Score (mLSS)1.  * Additionally, best overall response (BOR) rate was achieved in 76.4% of patients in the Jakavi arm compared to 60.4% in the BAT arm (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.34-3.52). The median duration of response was 6.24 months in the BAT arm, but was not reached in the Jakavi arm1.“These impressive results in chronic GvHD, which complement previous positive findings in the acute form of the disease, clearly define the role Jakavi can play in improving outcomes for patients facing this difficult-to-treat condition,” said David Feltquate, Head Hematology Development Unit, Novartis. “Jakavi is the first treatment to demonstrate efficacy in a large-scale randomized clinical trial in steroid-refractory/dependent chronic GvHD, and with these meaningful data we look forward to advancing discussions with regulatory authorities.”No new safety signals were observed in REACH3, and adverse events (AEs) attributable to treatment were consistent with the known safety profile of Jakavi. The most common AEs in the Jakavi vs. BAT arms were anemia (29.1% vs. 12.7%), thrombocytopenia (21.2% vs. 14.6%), hypertension (15.8% vs. 12.7%) and pyrexia (15.8% vs. 9.5%). While 37.6% and 16.5% of patients required Jakavi and BAT dose modifications, respectively, the number of patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs was low (16.4% and 7%, respectively). Mortality rates were similar across treatment arms (19% vs. 16% BAT)1. Deaths reported as primarily due to chronic GvHD were slightly higher for Jakavi.GvHD, a common and potentially life-threatening complication that can arise after allogeneic stem cell transplants, is a reaction where the donor’s cells attack the recipient’s normal cells because it sees them as foreign2. The two main types of GvHD are acute GvHD, which occurs within 100 days of transplant, and chronic GvHD, which occurs after 100 days of transplant2. Around 50 percent of people experience either acute or chronic GvHD, or both, following allogeneic stem cell transplant3. Symptoms of chronic GvHD can affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, mouth, lungs and joints5. There is a need for additional treatment options for people who do not respond to initial steroid therapy for GvHD or are considered steroid-refractory3.In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration approved ruxolitinib (marketed by Incyte Corporation in the U.S. as Jakafi®) for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older based on results of the single-arm Phase II REACH1 trial6. REACH3 (NCT03112603) is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, global multicenter study to evaluate Jakavi compared to BAT in patients with steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent chronic GvHD following allogeneic stem cell transplant7. Regulatory filings for steroid-refractory/dependent GvHD in Europe and other ex-US countries based on these data are planned for the first half of 2021.

Jakavi is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea and for the treatment of disease- related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF) (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Jakavi is approved in over 100 countries for patients with MF, including EU countries, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and in more than 85 countries for patients with PV, including EU countries, Switzerland, Japan and Canada. The exact indication for Jakavi varies by country. Additional worldwide regulatory filings are underway in MF and PV.Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation for development and commercialization outside the United States. Ruxolitinib is marketed in the United States by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi® for patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, for patients with intermediate or high-risk MF, and steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older6.The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in PV is 10 mg given orally twice daily. The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in MF is 15 mg given orally twice daily for patients with a platelet count between 100,000 cubic millimeters (mm) and 200,000 mm, and 20 mg twice daily for patients with a platelet count of >200,000 mm. Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy. There is limited information to recommend a starting dose for MF and PV patients with platelet counts between 50,000/mm and <100,000/mm. The maximum recommended starting dose in these patients is 5 mg twice daily, and patients should be titrated cautiously6.Jakavi is a registered trademark of Novartis AG in countries outside the United States. Jakafi is a registered trademark of Incyte Corporation. The safety and efficacy profile of Jakavi has not yet been established outside of its approved indications.Important Safety Information  Jakavi can cause serious side effects, including a decrease in blood cell count and infections. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended. Dose reduction or interruption may be required in patients with any hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment or in patients developing hematologic adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia. Dose reductions are also recommended when Jakavi is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole. Use of Jakavi during pregnancy is not recommended, and women should avoid becoming pregnant during Jakavi therapy. Women taking Jakavi should not breast feed. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported. Physicians should be alert for neuropsychiatric symptoms suggestive of PML.Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infections. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated and monitored according to clinical guidelines. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has been reported in Jakavi treated patients. Periodic skin examination is recommended. Very common adverse reactions in MF (>10%) include urinary tract infections, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hypercholesterolemia, dizziness, headache, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bruising and weight gain. Common adverse reactions in MF (1 to 10%) include herpes zoster and flatulence. Uncommon adverse reactions in MF include tuberculosis. Very common adverse reactions in PV (>10%) include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased. Common adverse reactions in PV (1 to 10%) include urinary tract infections, herpes zoster, weight gain, constipation and hypertension.Please see full Prescribing Information available at www.jakavi.com.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-12-05,"* Interim analysis from the investigational ELARA study shows, 65% of patients with r/r follicular lymphoma evaluated for efficacy achieved a complete response and the overall response rate was 83%1  * Longer-term median follow-up of 40 months from the JULIET study showed a 33% two-year progression-free survival rate in patients with r/r DLBCL2  * Both ELARA and JULIET trials reaffirm safety profile of Kymriah with no new short- or long-term safety signals identifiedBasel, December 5, 2020 — Novartis announced analyses from two separate trials with Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) in patients with certain advanced lymphomas. In the interim analysis of the investigational Phase II ELARA study, Kymriah led to a complete response (CR) in 65% of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) and an overall response rate (ORR) of 83% after at least three months of follow-up. These patients continued to relapse or have refractory disease despite exposure to numerous lines of therapy (median four prior lines of therapy [range 2-13]) prior to Kymriah infusion1. The second analysis – a 40-month median follow-up from the Phase II JULIET trial – reported that the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 33% in patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an important finding given these patients have limited treatment options that provide durable responses2. The JULIET study continued to show the effectiveness and well-characterized safety profile of Kymriah for these patients. These results were presented today during the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition (ASH).“For people who have follicular lymphoma that continues to relapse or does not respond after treatment with many lines of therapy, response to therapy becomes less likely with each additional treatment,” said Nathan H. Fowler, MD, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, Division of Cancer Medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center. “We are encouraged by these interim results from the ELARA trial, as there is a great need for potentially definitive options and an alternative to stem cell transplant. We look forward to continuing to learn more about how Kymriah may provide benefit for these patients.”In the interim analysis of the investigational ELARA clinical trial, in which 52 patients were evaluable for efficacy with a median follow-up of 9.9 months, Kymriah led to responses for the majority of patients treated. Specifically, after at least three months of follow-up, 65% (99.5% CI, 45.1-82.4) of patients achieved a complete response, meeting the primary endpoint. The overall response rate was 83% (95% CI, 69.7-91.8). For those who had a complete response, the vast majority (90%) sustained responses for six months or more.Safety results from this analysis of the ELARA trial suggest there was no emergence of new safety signals for Kymriah in the 97 patients evaluable for safety. No patients experienced grade 3/4 CRS, as defined by the Lee Scale, and any grade CRS occurred in 49% of patients (29% grade 1; 20% grade 2). To treat CRS, 15% of patients required tocilizumab and 3% required steroids. One percent of patients experienced grade 3/4 NEs and any grade NEs occurred in 9% of patients. Median time to CRS and severe NE onset was four and 8.5 days respectively, with respective median time to resolution of four and two days. All neurological and CRS events resolved with appropriate management. Three patients died from progressive disease and no deaths were treatment-related. Kymriah was administered in the outpatient setting for 18% of patients in the ELARA trial1.Results from the primary analysis of the ELARA study, with data from 90 patients followed up for at least 6 months, will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.“Novartis is dedicated to continuing to explore the safety and efficacy of Kymriah for patients with advanced blood cancers who do not achieve long-term remissions despite multiple prior lines of therapy,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “As we go deeper with our research in CAR-T cell therapies, these new analyses showcase the potential to rewrite cancer survival in patients with certain advanced lymphomas.”               New updated efficacy results from pivotal JULIET clinical trialNew updated efficacy results from a 40-month median follow-up analysis demonstrated continued durable responses for patients with r/r DLBCL treated with Kymriah in the JULIET trial (n=115). Among the 61 patients who responded to treatment, the relapse-free probability was 60% at 24 and 36 months; median DOR was not reached (95% CI, 10-not estimable [NE])3. Two-year progression-free survival rate was 33% 2. Survival probability at 24 and 36 months was 40% and 36%, respectively. Importantly, no new safety signals were observed after more than three years of long-term follow-up observation3.“Before the availability of Kymriah, long-term responses to treatment for those living with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were rare,” said Ulrich Jaeger, MD, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. “With these results from the JULIET trial, including biomarker analysis to better define patient subgroups who may benefit the most from CAR-T cell therapy, we are providing further evidence that Kymriah may be a definitive option for some patients. Additionally, with no new safety signals observed, physicians can continue to confidently refer their patients to certified centers to be treated with Kymriah.”The relationship between biomarkers, such as baseline Myc overexpression in tumors and tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics, and response to Kymriah was also assessed in this analysis. Outcomes were better for those with negative Myc expression compared to those who had Myc overexpression, which leads to an unfavorable immunosuppressive TME with a restricted T-cell response. These results are consistent with historical outcomes for patients with Myc- and Myc+ expression4. Analyses to further identify biomarkers for response to CAR-T cell therapy are ongoing.More information about Novartis activities at ASH can be found on the Novartis 2020 ASH Annual Meeting virtual portal.About Follicular Lymphoma  Follicular lymphoma, the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is an indolent lymphoma, and represents approximately 22% of NHL cases5,6. Despite new treatments that improve overall survival, FL is regarded as an incurable malignancy with a relapsing and remitting pattern7,8. Throughout the lifetime of a patient with relapsing FL, they may be exposed to a median of five lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines9,10. Although patients in third or later line treatment for FL have multiple systemic therapies available, the efficacy of these regimens drops off rapidly in later lines5. Additionally, because of this relapsing and remitting pattern, patients who are refractory to treatment or quickly relapse may exhaust available treatment options8.About the ELARA trial  ELARA is a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r FL. This international trial has enrolled patients from over 30 sites in 12 countries worldwide. The primary endpoint is CRR based on best response by central review (Lugano 2014 criteria). Patients evaluable for efficacy had measurable disease at infusion and more than six months of follow-up from infusion or discontinued early. After infusion, disease assessments were performed every three months. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.In Q2 2020, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Kymriah in r/r FL, based on preliminary results from the ELARA trial. RMAT designation is intended to expedite the development and review of Kymriah as a regenerative therapy for this underserved patient population. Kymriah also has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for this indication. About the JULIET Trial  JULIET was the first multi-center global registration study for Kymriah in adult patients with r/r DLBCL. JULIET, led by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, enrolled patients from 27 sites in 10 countries across the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the Netherlands.About Kymriah   Kymriah is the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, and the first-ever CAR-T to be approved in two distinct indications. It is a one-time treatment designed to empower patients’ immune systems to fight their cancer. Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of r/r pediatric and young adult (up to 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult DLBCL11.About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell & Gene  Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell & gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis has a deep CAR-T pipeline and ongoing investment in manufacturing and supply chain process improvements. With active research underway to broaden the impact of cell and gene therapy in oncology, Novartis is going deeper in hematological malignancies, reaching patients with other cancer types and evaluating next-generation CAR-T cell therapies that focus on new targets and utilize new technologies.Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to significantly invest in pioneering CAR-T research and initiate global CAR-T trials. Kymriah, the first approved CAR-T cell therapy, developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the foundation of Novartis’ commitment to CAR-T cell therapy. Kymriah is currently approved for use in at least one indication in 27 countries and at more than 270 certified treatment centers, with the ambition for further expansion to help fulfill the ultimate goal of bringing CAR-T cell therapy to every patient in need.The Novartis global CAR-T manufacturing footprint spans seven facilities, across four continents. This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the Novartis manufacturing and supply chain. Commercial and clinical trial manufacturing is now ongoing at Novartis-owned facilities in Stein, Switzerland, Les Ulis, France and Morris Plains, New Jersey, USA, as well as at the contract manufacturing sites at Fraunhofer-Institut for cell therapy and immunology (Fraunhofer-Institut für Zelltherapie und Immunologie) facility in Leipzig, Germany, and now FBRI in Kobe, Japan. Manufacturing production at Cell Therapies in Australia and Cellular Biomedicine Group in China is forthcoming.Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information  Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient's healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah, and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.  Please see the full Prescribing Information for Kymriah, including Boxed WARNING, and Medication Guide at www.Kymriah.comDisclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-12-08,"* At 24 weeks, asciminib nearly doubled the major molecular response (MMR) rate compared to Bosulif® (bosutinib)*, in patients resistant to, or intolerant of, at least two prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies1      * Despite advances in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) care, many patients are at risk of disease progression, and sequential TKI therapy may be associated with increased resistance and intolerance2-7  * Data further reinforce the potential of asciminib to help patients with CML who suffer from intolerable side effects in later lines of therapy1  * Data presented at ASH; submission to health authorities planned for first half of 2021Basel, December 8, 2020 — Detailed results from the Phase III ASCEMBL study demonstrate that, at 24 weeks, asciminib (ABL001) – a novel investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP) – nearly doubled the major molecular response (MMR) rate compared to Bosulif® (bosutinib)* (25.5% vs. 13.2%, respectively ([95% CI, 2.19-22.3]; 2-sided P=0.029) in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)1. These data were presented today at a late-breaking abstracts session during the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition (ASH).“These important comparative data are impressive, and they reinforce the critical role asciminib may play, if approved, in overcoming the treatment challenges we face in later treatment lines of chronic-phase CML,” said Dr. Michael J. Mauro**, Member and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Program Leader at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine. “While the advent and expansion of TKI therapies has resulted in tremendous progress for patients living with CML over the last decades, many of our patients in later treatment lines still face inadequate response, disease progression and intolerable side effects.”Despite the significant advances in the CML treatment landscape, many patients treated with two or more TKIs experience intolerance; for example, in an analysis of studies in patients who had previously failed two TKIs, up to 55% reported intolerance to treatment8-13. In addition, resistance rates for patients in later treatment lines remain high; and in the second-line setting, at least three out of five patients are unable to achieve MMR and up to 56% of patients do not achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within two years of follow-up5,13-18. With few remaining treatment options, and no currently established standard-of-care in the third-line setting per treatment guidelines, patients who are resistant or intolerant to two or more TKIs are at a high risk of progression2-5,19-21. In the ASCEMBL trial, 233 patients were randomized to receive asciminib 40 mg twice daily (n=157) or Bosulif 500 mg once a day (n=76)1. Data showed that, at 24 weeks, more patients achieved a CCyR in the asciminib arm (40.8%) than in the Bosulif arm (24.2%); and deep molecular response (DMR) rates were higher for patients in the asciminib arm than in the Bosulif arm – with 10.8% and 8.9% patients achieving MR4 and MR4.5 on asciminib, respectively, vs. 5.3% and 1.3% on Bosulif1.Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 50.6% and 60.5% of patients treated with asciminib and Bosulif, respectively1. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs in the asciminib arm was 5.8% compared to 21.1% for patients taking Bosulif 1. Similarly, AEs requiring dose interruption and/or dose adjustments were reported less frequently with asciminib than with Bosulif (37.8% vs. 60.5%, respectively)1. At data cutoff, more patients were still on treatment in the asciminib arm vs. the Bosulif arm (61.8% vs. 30.3%, respectively)1.The most common grade ≥3 AEs (occurring in >10%) of patients treated with asciminib were thrombocytopenia (17.3%) and neutropenia (14.7%), while for Bosulif they were increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (14.5%), neutropenia (11.8%) and diarrhea (10.5%)1. On-treatment deaths on the asciminib arm occurred in two (1.3%) patients (ischemic stroke and arterial embolism); there was one (1.3%) death on Bosulif (septic shock)1. The most frequent AEs (all grades; ≥20%) were thrombocytopenia (28.8%) and neutropenia (21.8%) in the asciminib arm, compared to diarrhea (71.1%), nausea (46.1%), increased ALT (27.6%), vomiting (26.3%), rash (23.7%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (21.1%), neutropenia (21.1%) and thrombocytopenia (18.4%) in the Bosulif arm1. “Though some patients with CML may be told they have a ‘good cancer’ because of the wonderful advances in care that have been made over the years, this doesn’t capture the full picture for everyone with the disease,” said Greg Stephens, Executive Director and Founder of the US National CML Society. “The results of the ASCEMBL study are very encouraging to the CML community, and help underscore the crucial need for additional treatment options to address real challenges that patients face.”Pre-clinical data suggests that asciminib has specificity for BCR-ABL22. Additional data accepted for online publication highlight that, as an investigational STAMP inhibitor, asciminib is designed to help overcome mutations on the ATP-binding site of BCR-ABL1, which may help address resistance in later treatment lines of CML and may potentially address off-target activity22.“Novartis has been at the forefront of CML research for years – significantly changing the prognosis for patients. We are very proud to once again advance a potentially transformative medicine, a novel STAMP inhibitor, for those who do not adequately respond or are intolerant to currently available TKIs,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “There is a clear need in later lines of therapy, and based on these results, we believe asciminib may become an important new development for patients. We look forward to sharing the data with regulatory authorities and moving forward with submissions worldwide.”The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for asciminib. Submission to the US and EU health authorities is planned for the first half of 2021.Visit https://www.virtualcongress.novartis.com/ash20 for the latest information from Novartis including our bold approach to reimagining care in hematology, and access to our ASH Virtual Congress 2020 symposia and data presentations (for registered participants).About asciminib (ABL001)  Asciminib (ABL001) is an investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP). As a STAMP inhibitor, asciminib may help address tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistance and intolerance in later treatment lines of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and it is being studied in several clinical trials in hopes of helping patients across multiple treatment lines of CML23-30.About ASCEMBL  ASCEMBL is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the oral investigational treatment asciminib (ABL001) versus bosutinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)1. Patients with failure or intolerance to the most recently administered TKI therapy were included in the trial1.About Novartis Commitment to CML  Our ongoing research in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) has helped transform the disease from a fatal leukemia to a chronic condition in most patients. Novartis maintains an unwavering commitment to scientific innovation and access to care for patients worldwide. As an organization committed to patients, Novartis continues to reimagine CML care by pursuing ambitious goals with courage, passion and commitment for the global CML community.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-12-09,"*  MONALEESA-7 median overall survival (OS) results reinforce Kisqali as the CDK4/6 inhibitor with unrivaled OS evidence1      * Kisqali plus endocrine therapy had a median OS of nearly five years (58.7 months), the longest ever reported for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC), after a median of 53.5 months follow-up1      * Kisqali offers the chance for more life for younger women with HR+/HER2- MBC, which remains the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old2,3The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here:Basel, December 9, 2020 — Novartis today announced updated median overall survival (OS) results for Kisqali® (ribociclib) in combination with endocrine therapy, marking the longest survival data ever reported in premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial evaluated Kisqali plus endocrine therapy (goserelin plus either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen) as initial treatment compared to endocrine therapy alone in pre- and perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. These updated median OS data will be presented today at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Virtual Symposium.After a median of 53.5 months follow-up, median OS for patients taking Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy was 58.7 months vs. 48.0 months for endocrine therapy alone (HR=0.76 [95% CI: 0.61-0.96])1. Additionally, a similar median OS benefit of 58.7 months was observed with Kisqali plus an aromatase inhibitor subgroup vs. 47.7 months in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor subgroup (HR=0.80 [95% CI, 0.62-1.04]), and the survival benefit shown in subgroup analyses was consistent with the intent-to-treat (ITT) population1. This exploratory ad hoc analysis follows the previously reported MONALEESA-7 OS analysis presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which demonstrated statistically significant OS results for Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy. After a median of 42 months follow-up, the estimated survival rate was 70.2% [95% CI: 63.5 to 76.0] for women who received Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy compared to 46.0% [95% CI, 32.0 to 58.9] for women who received endocrine therapy alone (HR=0.71 [95% CI: 0.54 to 0.95]) p=0.00973)4.“These longer-term data showing ribociclib can help women with metastatic breast cancer live longer are remarkable and emphasize the progress we’ve made in treating this disease, which until now, had an estimated median survival of just three years,” said Debu Tripathy, M.D., chair of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center. “I’m hopeful the proven overall survival benefit with ribociclib will shift the standard for those with metastatic breast cancer, and that patients are empowered to ask their doctors about which treatments give them the best chance of living longer with the best quality of life.”The need for chemotherapy was delayed by more than four years (50.9 months) in patients taking Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.56-0.87)1. No new adverse events were observed. Kisqali is not indicated for use with tamoxifen.“We’re proud to be able to provide the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the longest ever reported median overall survival benefit of nearly five years in younger women,” said Susanne Schaffert, Ph.D., President, Novartis Oncology. “It is our vision to develop therapies that give patients the longest life possible, and these best-in-class data help us realize that vision by proving Kisqali extends the lives of younger premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, who typically have more aggressive disease and unique needs.”Metastatic breast cancer in premenopausal women is biologically distinct, more aggressive and the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old2,3.About Kisqali® (ribociclib)  Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in July 2018 and by the EC in December 2018. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide.Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.Important Safety Information from the Kisqali EU SmPC   Kisqali® (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine - based therapy in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer or fulvestrant as initial endocrine - based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It is not known if Kisqali is safe and effective in children or adolescents. Kisqali can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. Kisqali is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen due to an increased risk of QT prolongation. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. Kisqali can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking Kisqali and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking Kisqali, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as Kisqali can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take Kisqali should use highly effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Do not breastfeed during treatment with Kisqali and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with Kisqali. Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Kisqali. The most common side effects (incidence >=20%) include infections, white blood cell count decreases, headache, cough, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, hair loss and rash. The most common Grade 3/4 side effects (incidence >5%) were infections, low neutrophils, low leukocytes, low red blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, low phosphate levels and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.Please see full Prescribing Information for Kisqali, available at www.Kisqali.com.About Novartis in Advanced Breast Cancer  Novartis tackles breast cancer with superior science, collaboration and a passion for transforming patient care.

2020-12-09,"* Findings presented at SABCS from largest intrinsic subtype analysis show Kisqali is unique among CDK4/6 inhibitors, delivers consistent efficacy across main HR+/HER2- intrinsic subtypes1      * Benefit seen even in patients with the endocrine-resistant HER2-enriched subtype, who face poor prognosis with endocrine therapy alone, reinforces Kisqali as first line treatment choice for all patients2       * Data presented at SABCS also show Kisqali more selectively inhibits CDK4, the active target in breast cancer and a pivotal driver of disease progression, compared to palbociclib3      * Kisqali remains the CDK4/6 inhibitor with longest reported overall survival, proven in two Phase III trials to help people with metastatic breast cancer live longer regardless of menopausal status, endocrine sensitivity or endocrine partner4-6    Basel, December 9, 2020 — Novartis today announced new Kisqali® (ribociclib) data demonstrating consistent efficacy benefit with Kisqali plus endocrine therapy across the main intrinsic subtypes of hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The largest biomarker analysis of efficacy in intrinsic subtypes evaluated whether there was a correlation between these subtypes and efficacy outcomes in patients treated with Kisqali across the three Phase III MONALEESA trials1. The findings will be presented in an oral presentation at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Virtual Symposium. This broad ad hoc exploratory analysis showed that Kisqali plus endocrine therapy consistently provided significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit across three of four subtypes of HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (LumA HR=0.63; p<.001, LumB HR=0.52; p<.001, HER2-enriched HR=0.39; p<.001, Basal-like HR=1.15; p=.7672)1. The largest PFS benefit was seen in patients with the HER2-enriched subtype – a non-luminal subtype associated with endocrine resistance and poor prognosis1. In contrast, benefit was not observed with palbociclib in the HER2-enriched subtype in a retrospective analysis of the PALOMA-2 trial presented at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium 7.“The significant benefit seen with ribociclib in the endocrine-resistant HER2-enriched subtype is a unique and important finding, differentiating it from the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. The underlying hypothesis is that ribociclib induces hormone-sensitivity in this group of tumors beyond inhibition of the cell-cycle,” said Aleix Prat, Head, Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain. “The body of preclinical data showing that ribociclib has the ability to more selectively target and inhibit CDK4, which is a key driver of disease progression in breast cancer, may help us understand why ribociclib provides consistent benefit, especially in patients with more aggressive disease.” The four intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like) have revealed critical differences in terms of incidence, survival and response to treatment8-12. Additionally, the insights provided by intrinsic subtypes complement and expand upon the information provided by standard clinical parameters and pathological markers. The observed benefit with Kisqali provides reassurance about it as a treatment choice for the majority of people with metastatic breast cancer without the need for additional testing.Preclinical CDK4/6 Study  Additional data to be presented at SABCS include a poster presentation of a preclinical analysis in which cellular models were used to examine the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors on either CDK4 or CDK6. The preclinical in vivo study confirmed previously published biochemical in vitro and proliferation data, demonstrating that Kisqali selectively inhibits CDK4, whereas palbociclib has similar activity against both CDK4 and CDK6 in cells3. Kisqali inhibited CDK4 at 11-fold and 9-fold lower drug concentrations than CDK6, whereas palbociclib inhibited CDK4 at 2-fold lower drug concentrations than CDK6 in both cell lines3.“The data presented at SABCS show that Kisqali offers a superior benefit for metastatic breast cancer patients, even in those with the HER2-enriched subtype, who face a very poor prognosis. These data build on previous findings showing Kisqali provides a benefit regardless of type of metastases, endocrine partner or menopausal status. The totality of evidence to date gives us incredible confidence that Kisqali is unique among CDK4/6 inhibitors, and we believe doctors should consider Kisqali for their patients,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President of Novartis Oncology. About Kisqali® (ribociclib)  Kisqali is the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the largest body of first-line clinical trial evidence demonstrating consistent and sustained efficacy compared to endocrine therapy alone. Kisqali is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to achieve statistically significant OS in two Phase III trials with two distinct patient populations4-6. The substantial OS benefit and improved quality of life observed in MONALEESA-7 support the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (MCBS) perfect five out of five rating for Kisqali plus endocrine therapy in premenopausal HR+/HER2- MBC13. Kisqali also received an ESMO-MCBS score of four out of five, the highest score achieved by any CDK 4/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant, for first-line postmenopausal patients based on the statistically significant OS benefit observed in MONALEESA-3 and maintained quality of life13. Overall survival follow-up is ongoing for the Phase III MONALEESA-2 trial.Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in July 2018 and by the EC in December 2018. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide.Novartis is continuing to reimagine cancer by investigating Kisqali in early breast cancer. The NATALEE study is a Phase III clinical trial of Kisqali with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- early breast cancer being conducted in collaboration with Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO).Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.Important Safety Information from the Kisqali EU SmPC   Kisqali® (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine - based therapy in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer or fulvestrant as initial endocrine - based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

2020-12-14,"* Phase III study did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications (death, mechanical ventilation or ICU care)1  * Detailed results will be submitted for publication to support scientific understanding of JAK inhibition in COVID-19 and inform ongoing research  * Novartis commitment to address COVID-19 pandemic remains strong with multiple research collaboration initiatives ongoingBasel, December 14, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the Phase III RUXCOVID study evaluating ruxolitinib on top of standard of care (SoC) therapy compared to SoC treatment alone in patients with COVID-19 did not meet its primary endpoint1. Initial data show there was no statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients on ruxolitinib plus SoC therapy who experienced severe complications, including death, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) by Day 29, compared to SoC alone1. The trial also did not show clinically relevant benefit among secondary and exploratory endpoints including mortality rate by Day 29, and time to recovery (no longer infected, or ambulatory with no or minimal limitations)1.“While the RUXCOVID trial did not give us the results we hoped for, we will continue working with the medical community to analyze its findings to better understand COVID-19 and the role of JAK inhibition,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We would like to thank the front-line clinical teams and staff at each of the trial sites and the hundreds of patients who volunteered to participate and their loved ones. We are deeply grateful to them and will continue our dedicated scientific research into the ongoing global pandemic.”In the trial, the proportion of patients who died, or required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure or ICU care by Day 29, the primary endpoint, was 12.0% for ruxolitinib plus SoC vs. 11.8% for placebo plus SoC (OR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.48-1.73]; p=0.769)1. Ruxolitinib was generally well-tolerated, and a comprehensive analysis including safety data is ongoing1. The results of RUXCOVID do not affect any ongoing trials for ruxolitinib in non-COVID-19 diseases.About RUXCOVID  RUXCOVID (NCT04362137) is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 29-day study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib plus standard of care (SoC) therapy compared to placebo plus SoC therapy in patients aged ≥12 years hospitalized for COVID-19 and not intubated or receiving ICU care prior to randomization. The study has enrolled 432 patients globally2.The composite primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation), or require admission to ICU by Day 29. Secondary endpoints include various efficacy assessments including evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale; in-hospital outcomes (mortality rate; proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation); change in the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2); change in SpO2/FiO2 ratio; proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation of ≥94% on room air); and safety. The exploratory endpoint of time to recovery (no longer infected, or ambulatory with no or minimal limitations) was also evaluated2.Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral ruxolitinib 5mg twice daily (BID) or oral-matching placebo for a total of 14 days. Study treatment is given in combination with SoC therapy according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. After 14 days of therapy, should clinical signs or symptoms not improve or worsen, and the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks, patients may receive an additional 14 days of study therapy. In total, patients are followed on study for 29 days post-randomization2.RUXCOVID is sponsored by Novartis outside of the US and by Incyte in the US.About ruxolitinib  Ruxolitinib is an oral inhibitor of the JAK 1 and JAK 2 tyrosine kinases. It is approved under the trade name Jakavi® in Europe and other regions and countries for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea and for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF), also known as chronic idiopathic MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Approved indications vary by country3. The safety and efficacy profile of Jakavi has not yet been established outside of its approved indications.Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation for development and commercialization outside the US. Ruxolitinib is marketed outside the US by Novartis as Jakavi®, and in the US by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi® for patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, for patients with intermediate or high-risk MF, and steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older3. Jakavi is a registered trademark of Novartis AG in countries outside the US. Jakafi is a registered trademark of Incyte Corporation.Novartis response to COVID-19 pandemic  Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)4. Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-195, and the company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-196,7. In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop an antiviral molecule to potentially treat all coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low-and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone, which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia4. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID8.

2020-12-15,"* In Phase III KESTREL study, Beovu (brolucizumab 6 mg) achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to aflibercept 2 mg in change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at year one (week 52)1      * In a secondary endpoint, more than half of Beovu patients in the 6 mg arm were maintained on a three-month dosing interval through year one, following the loading phase1      * Significant improvement with Beovu 6 mg in change of central subfield thickness (CST) from baseline over the period of week 40 through week 52 was observed1      * Beovu demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile1      * Novartis intends to submit the data from KESTREL, together with the data from the pivotal Phase III KITE2 study in DME, to health authorities in H1 2021     Basel, December 15, 2020 — Novartis today announced positive findings from the first interpretable results of the Phase III KESTREL study, assessing the efficacy and safety of Beovu® (brolucizumab) 3 mg and 6 mg in diabetic macular edema (DME). Following KITE*, KESTREL is the second pivotal Phase III study of Beovu in DME. The trial met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline of Beovu 6 mg to aflibercept 2 mg at year one. The trial also met its key secondary endpoint of non-inferiority in average change in BCVA of Beovu 6 mg to aflibercept 2 mg over week 40 through week 521. (Beovu 6 mg is the marketed dose for wet AMD.)More than half of patients in the Beovu 6 mg arm were maintained on a three-month dosing interval through year one, following the loading phase1. Patients treated with Beovu 6 mg experienced significant improvement in change of central subfield thickness (CST) from baseline over the period of week 40 through week 521. As non-inferiority in change in BCVA of brolucizumab 3 mg was not demonstrated in KESTREL, no confirmatory testing of superiority on anatomical outcomes was performed. Further analyses on anatomical outcomes from KESTREL are ongoing. “These results demonstrate that Beovu has the potential, if approved, to offer DME patients better disease management,” said Dirk Sauer, Global Head Development, Novartis Pharma Ophthalmology. “Based on these data and the strong results we saw earlier this year from the KITE clinical study, we look forward to working with regulatory authorities to bring Beovu to DME patients.”In KESTREL, Beovu demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile1.Novartis announced positive topline results from another pivotal phase III study, KITE, in September 2020. The results from KESTREL support the positive results seen in KITE, reinforcing Beovu as a potential new treatment option for DME patients. The data from KITE and KESTREL will be submitted to upcoming medical meetings and for peer-review publication. Novartis intends to submit the data from both KITE and KESTREL to health authorities in H1 2021 and looks forward to working with regulators worldwide to make Beovu available to DME patients in need. About Diabetic Macular Edema  Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of blindness in young adults in developed countries, including 12% of people with type 1 diabetes and 28% of those with type 2 diabetes3.Consistently high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage small blood vessels in the eye, causing them to leak fluid4. The resulting accumulation of fluid (known as edema) in the macula can lead to vision loss5. The macula is the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision5.Early symptoms of DME include blurry or wavy central vision and distorted color perception, although the disease can also progress without symptoms at early stages4,5.    About Beovu (brolucizumab)  Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is approved in more than 50 countries, including in the US6, EU7, UK7, Japan8, Canada9 and Australia10, for the treatment of wet AMD. Additional trials are currently ongoing which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with AMD, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Brolucizumab is the most clinically advanced humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv)11-13. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation and drug delivery characteristics13-15.The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms14. Beovu is engineered to deliver the highest concentration of drug, providing more active binding agents11-13. In preclinical studies, Beovu inhibited activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction14-16. Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular angiogenesis and retinal edema17. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and suppress endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability17.*Kite Pharma, Inc. is neither a sponsor nor associated with Novartis’ KITE trial.Disclaimer  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-12-16,Novartis (NVS) gets positive review from the FDA Advisory Committee to support the use of Entresto in the treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.,Novartis' (NVS) Entresto Gets FDA Panel Nod for Expanded Use
2020-12-16,"* The Committee voted 12 to 1 that the data presented support the use of Entresto in treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)      * Potential Q1 2021 sNDA approval could make Entresto the first therapy indicated for use in treatment of patients with both major types of chronic heart failure: HFpEF and HFrEF; and the only chronic heart failure treatment studied in both conditions against active comparators1,2       * HFpEF patients currently have no approved treatment options and face worsening symptoms that result in frequent HF hospitalizations, emergency room and urgent office visits1,3,4    Basel, December 16, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) voted 12 to 1 that the data presented support the use of Entresto® (sacubitril/valsartan) in treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This was based on data supporting the benefit of Entresto in reducing worsening heart failure (total heart failure [HF] hospitalizations and urgent HF visits) in patients studied in PARAGON-HF. If approved by the FDA, Entresto could become the first therapy indicated for use in treatment of patients with HFpEF, as well as the first medication approved for both major types of chronic heart failure, HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), both based on trials that included active comparators (valsartan and enalapril, respectively)1,2. With no approved therapies for HFpEF to address the prevention of HF hospitalizations and urgent visits, a significant unmet medical need exists for a treatment to reduce the burden associated with this debilitating condition. The FDA is expected to make a decision on the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) in the first quarter of 2021.“Managing HFpEF has historically been a clinical and scientific challenge due to the heterogeneity of the condition,” said Scott Solomon, MD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and PARAGON-HF Executive Committee Co-Chair. “Today’s vote represents much needed progress in this area of unmet need and is a positive step toward bringing a potential therapy to millions of patients suffering from this type of heart failure.”The Committee’s positive decision is based on the totality of evidence from efficacy and safety analyses, including findings presented from a pre-specified subgroup analysis of PARAGON-HF, the largest and only Phase III active-controlled study to date in patients with HFpEF and additional evidence from PARAMOUNT (a Phase II trial in HFpEF), as well as PARADIGM-HF (a Phase III trial in HFrEF)5-7. Data from PARAGON-HF demonstrated a favorable safety profile for Entresto in patients with HFpEF, which is in line with the vast clinical and post-marketing experience in HFrEF, and showed clinical benefit of Entresto in HFpEF patients2.“Our commitment to reimagine medicine through our extensive clinical trials program on heart failure has been unwavering, and we are encouraged by the Committee’s response today,” said David Soergel, MD, Global Head of Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Drug Development, Novartis. “We appreciate the valuable insights shared by the patient and advocacy community about this devastating disease, and we look forward to FDA’s decision on the potential approval of this new indication.”HFpEF affects more than 3 million Americans, and is increasing in prevalence as the population ages3,8. It is a complex disease for which it is difficult to develop treatments due to its heterogeneous pathophysiology and the varied impact of symptoms among patients, despite decades of research9. HFpEF can change the structure of the heart and occurs when the muscle tissue of the heart thickens and stiffens so that it cannot expand to fill with enough blood to meet the body’s needs10. HFpEF is associated with high rates of recurring heart failure hospitalizations, emergency room visits and urgent doctor’s office appointments3,4. Each hospitalization event is associated with worsening long-term prognosis, and approximately one in four patients are re-admitted for heart failure within one year of discharge11,12.Entresto is approved in 115 countries worldwide for the treatment of HFrEF, with more than 2.6 million patient-years of exposure to date13.About our longstanding commitment to heart failure  To reimagine medicine for heart failure patients, Novartis established the largest global clinical program in the HF disease area across the pharma industry to date. Known as FortiHFy, it is comprised of more than 40 clinical studies designed to generate an array of additional data on efficacy, quality of life, patient-reported outcomes and real-world evidence with Entresto, as well as to extend understanding of heart failure. FortiHFy includes trials across HFpEF, including PARAGON-HF, PARAMOUNT and PARAGLIDE-HF, as well as Entresto’s current indication in HFrEF, such as PARADIGM-HF, PIONEER-HF, TRANSITION and PROVE-HF.About Entresto for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  In Europe, Entresto is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of symptomatic chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction14. In the United States, Entresto is indicated for the treatment of HF (New York Heart Association class II-IV) in patients with systolic dysfunction15. It has been shown to reduce the rate of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization, to reduce the rate of all-cause mortality and to improve aspects of health-related quality of life (including physical and social activities), compared to enalapril7,16,17. Entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other HF therapies, in place of an ACE inhibitor or other angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)14. Approved indications may vary depending upon the individual country.    Entresto is a twice-a-day medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart14. It does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems (natriuretic peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)14,18. Other common HF medicines, called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS. Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan14,15.

2020-12-18,"* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not raised any concerns related to the efficacy or safety of inclisiran. The complete response letter is due to unresolved facility inspection-related conditions  * No onsite inspection was conducted of the single third-party facility in question. If a facility inspection is needed, FDA will define an approach once safe travel may resume based on public health need and other factors  * Novartis will work with FDA and the third-party manufacturing facility in Europe to complete the inclisiran review, to bring this potential first-in-class siRNA to patients in the U.S. as quickly as possibleBasel, December 18, 2020 — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a complete response letter (CRL) regarding the new drug application (NDA) for inclisiran, a potential treatment for hyperlipidemia in adults who have elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) while being on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin therapy. The FDA stated that the agency cannot approve the NDA by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of December 23, 2020, due to unresolved facility inspection-related conditions. The conditions will be conveyed to the European manufacturing facility within 10 business days. The third-party facility is responsible for drug product manufacturing. Satisfactory resolution of the unresolved facility inspection-related conditions is required before the Novartis NDA may be approved. No onsite inspection was conducted. If it is determined that a facility inspection is needed to approve the application, the FDA will define an approach for scheduling once safe travel may resume based on public health need and other factors.“Novartis is confident in the quality of the regulatory submission for inclisiran, which includes a robust body of evidence related to efficacy and safety. We look forward to meeting with the FDA and our third-party manufacturing partner to discuss the feedback received and next steps,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We are committed to bringing this potential first-in-class small interfering RNA cholesterol-lowering treatment to patients as soon as possible.” The European Commission (EC) recently granted Novartis marketing authorization for Leqvio® (inclisiran) in Europe on December 11, 2020. About inclisiran  Inclisiran (KJX839) is the first and only small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels via an RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism of action and could help improve outcomes for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a deadly form of cardiovascular disease1-3. With two doses a year and effective and sustained LDL-C reduction, inclisiran works as a complement to statins. Inclisiran works differently from other therapies by preventing the production of the target protein in the liver, increasing hepatic uptake of LDL-C and clearing it from the bloodstream3. Inclisiran is dosed initially, again at 3 months, and then once every 6 months. In three clinical trials, patients taking inclisiran maintained LDL-C reduction throughout each 6-month dosing interval1,2. Administered in-office as a subcutaneous injection, inclisiran is expected to integrate seamlessly into a patient’s healthcare routine1,2.In the Phase III trials, inclisiran was well-tolerated1,2. The most common adverse events reported (≥3% of patients treated with inclisiran and occurring more frequently than placebo) were injection site reaction, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, bronchitis, pain in extremity and dyspnea1,2. Among those, injection site reactions were the most frequent ones. Those were generally mild and none were severe or persistent1,2. Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a leader in RNAi therapeutics.About Novartis in Cardiovascular-Renal-Metabolism  Bending the curve of life requires addressing some of society’s biggest public health concerns. Novartis has an established and expanding presence in diseases covering the heart, kidney and metabolic system. In addition to essential treatment Entresto® (sacubitril/valsartan), Novartis has a growing pipeline of potentially first-in-class molecules addressing cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases.Disclaimer   This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Tislelizumab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to FcγR on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis will obtain the development and commercialization rights to tislelizumab in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Russia, and Japan in exchange for an upfront payment of USD 650 million plus royalties and milestone payments. BeiGene will retain the rights to tislelizumab in China and other countries. The transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.More than 7,700 patients have been enrolled in 15 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials with tislelizumab in a dozen indications, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The first ex-China regulatory filing is expected in 2021. In addition, Novartis and BeiGene have identified multiple tislelizumab plus Novartis therapy combination clinical trial opportunities in solid tumors. “Novartis has a bold ambition to reimagine medicine and find new cures for cancer and blood disorders. This agreement expands on our strategy as the only company pursuing four different approaches to treating cancer: targeted therapy, radioligand therapy, cell and gene therapy, and immunotherapy. No other company has this range of therapeutic approaches, and the opportunity to combine them to offer the best outcomes for each patient,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “We are excited about collaborating with BeiGene, a leading global biotechnology company with roots in China, to bring tislelizumab to patients around the world, and pair it with our extensive portfolio and pipeline to develop transformative combination therapies for patients.”Tislelizumab is approved by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) as a treatment for certain patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic urothelial carcinoma. In addition, BeiGene has filed three supplemental new drug applications for tislelizumab in China for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, and previously treated unresectable HCC.

2021-01-25,"Novartis (NYSE:NVS) announces its next round of earnings this Tuesday, January 26. Here is Benzinga's look at Novartis's Q4 earnings report.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Analysts expect Novartis earnings of $1.36 per share. Revenue will likely be around $12.87 billion, according to the consensus estimate. In the same quarter last year, Novartis reported earnings per share of $1.32 on revenue of $12.40 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on NVSThe analyst consensus estimate would represent a 3.03% increase in the company's EPS figure. Revenue would be up 3.77% from the same quarter last year. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020  EPS Estimate 1.45 1.35 1.36 1.25  EPS Actual 1.52 1.36 1.56 1.32  Revenue Estimate 12.53 B 12.00 B 12.03 B 12.12 B  Revenue Actual 12.26 B 11.35 B 12.28 B 12.40 B  Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 1.76%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders can relax going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

An explanation of non-IFRS measures can be found on page 55 of the Condensed Financial Report. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates in this Release refer to same period in prior year. 3 Please see detailed guidance assumptions on page 8 including the forecast assumption that we see a continuation of the return to normal global healthcare systems including prescription dynamics by mid 2021. In addition, we assume that no Gilenya and no Sandostatin LAR generics enter in 2021 in the US. Strategy update During 2020, we continued focusing Novartis as a leading medicines company powered by advanced therapy platforms and data science. We are now uniquely positioned with scale and diversification across therapeutic areas and we continue to execute on our five strategic priorities: embrace operational excellence, deliver transformative innovation, go big on data and digital, build trust with society, and build a new culture by unleashing the power of our people. Operationally, solid sales growth, improved gross margins, productivity including lower spend drove double-digit growth in core operating income. Innovative Medicines core margin increased by 2.2 percentage points (cc) to 35% of sales, and we expect this margin to improve to high 30’s in the mid-term. Sales in China grew double-digit and we expect to double our China business by 2024 compared to 2019 sales. In 2020, we continued to advance transformative innovation for patients, including treatments for hyperlipidemia and multiple sclerosis. We received 26 approvals for new treatments as well as new indications for existing treatments in the US, the EU, Japan and China. Additionally we submitted regulatory filings for several major drugs, including Leqvio, Kesimpta and Entresto (HFpEF). Novartis has an industry-leading pipeline that includes more than 40 assets in full development, including molecules that are being tested in more than one disease. As such, our pipeline remains rich including many near to mid-term catalysts and we expect to maintain innovation momentum. We made significant progress to solidify our culture journey towards an inspired, curious and unbossed organization. More than three years ago, Novartis started a digital transformation, from R&D efforts to next generation customer engagement. The Novartis digital strategy and its execution are well on track with a strong focus on scaling our efforts. As a result we are bringing our Digital Function and Novartis Business Services together to build a new organization called Customer & Technology Solutions (CTS), effective February 1, 2021. CTS aims to further improve internal and external customer experience. Novartis made significant strides in building trust with society and issued the healthcare industry’s first sustainability bond linked to access to medicines and committed to carbon neutral emissions by 2030. Significant improvements recognized by third party ESG rating agencies. COVID-19 update The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve and is taking differing courses across the multitude of geographies in which Novartis operates. We continue to take strong actions to help address the pandemic. Our primary concerns remain the health and safety of our associates and patients. During the year, there have been COVID-19 related lockdowns in several geographies negatively impacting certain therapeutic areas, most notably in: ophthalmology, dermatology and the Sandoz retail business. However, our operations remain stable and cash collections continue to be according to our normal trade terms, with days sales outstanding at normal levels. Novartis remains well positioned to meet its ongoing financial obligations and has sufficient liquidity to support our normal business activities. At present, drug development operations are continuing with manageable disruptions (please see Innovation Review Section of the Condensed Financial Report for further information), with our range of digital technologies allowing us to proactively manage our clinical trials portfolio and rapidly mitigate any disruptions. Novartis launched a first-of-its-kind not-for-profit portfolio of 15 medicines from the Sandoz Division for symptomatic treatment of COVID-19. The portfolio addresses urgent unmet needs and is sold at no profit to governments in up to 79 eligible low and lower middle income countries. We continue to work closely with third parties to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Novartis is also undertaking drug discovery efforts to develop the first oral medicines for COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. We are investigating two potential medicines, DFV890 and MAS825, in early stage development focused on the immune response. In October, we announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop, manufacture and commercialize Molecular Partners’ anti-COVID-19 DARPin® program, potential medicines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Financials In order to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), Novartis has separated the Group’s reported financial data into “continuing” and “discontinued” operations. The results of the Alcon business in 2019 are reported as discontinued operations. See page 43 and Notes 2, 3 and 10 in the Condensed Financial Report for a full explanation. The commentary below focuses on continuing operations including the businesses of Innovative Medicines and Sandoz, as well as the continuing Corporate functions. We also provide information on discontinued operations. Continuing operations fourth quarter Net sales were USD 12.8 billion (+3%, +1% cc) in the fourth quarter driven by volume growth of 6 percentage points, offset by price erosion of 2 percentage points and the negative impact from generic competition of 3 percentage points. Operating income was USD 2.6 billion (+45%, +51% cc) mainly due to lower impairments, lower legal charges and income from contingent receivables. Net income was USD 2.1 billion (+86%, +93% cc) driven by higher operating income and benefiting from lower taxes. EPS was USD 0.92 (+84%, +93% cc), growing in line with net income. Core operating income was USD 3.5 billion (+1%, +2% cc) mainly driven by higher sales. Core operating income margin was 27.4% of net sales, decreasing by 0.5 percentage points (+0.4 percentage points cc). Core net income was USD 3.0 billion (+2%, +3% cc) mainly driven by growth in core operating income. Core EPS was USD 1.34 (+2%, +3% cc), growing in line with core net income. Free cash flow from continuing operations amounted to USD 3.3 billion (-4%) compared to USD 3.5 billion in the prior year quarter, as higher cash flows from operating activities were more than offset by increased net investment for intangible assets. Innovative Medicines net sales were USD 10.2 billion (+3%, +1% cc) with volume contributing 6 percentage points to growth, pricing had a negative impact of 1 percentage point and generic competition had a negative impact of 4 percentage points mainly due to Afinitor and Exjade. Pharmaceuticals BU sales grew 2% (cc) driven by strong growth from Entresto, Cosentyx and Zolgensma. Growth was partly offset by declines in Established Medicines and mature Ophthalmology brands. Oncology BU sales were broadly in line with prior year (+1% cc). Strong performance of Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist, Kymriah, Adakveo and Kisqali was offset by generic competition, mainly for Exjade and Afinitor. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively impact dermatology and ophthalmology. Sandoz net sales were USD 2.5 billion (+2%, 0% cc) with a volume increase of 3 percentage points. There was a negative price effect of 3 percentage points, despite the benefit from off-contract sales in the US. Global sales of Biopharmaceuticals grew 16% (cc), driven by continued strong growth in Europe. Continuing operations full year Net sales were USD 48.7 billion (+3%, +3% cc) in the full year mainly driven by Entresto, Zolgensma and Cosentyx. Volume contributed 9 percentage points to sales growth, partly offset by price erosion of 3 percentage points and the negative impact from generic competition of 3 percentage points. Operating income was USD 10.2 billion (+12%, +19% cc) mainly driven by higher sales and productivity including lower spend. Net income was USD 8.1 billion (+13%, +20% cc) mainly driven by higher operating income. EPS was USD 3.55 (+14%, +21% cc), growing faster than net income and benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. Core operating income was USD 15.4 billion (+9%, +13% cc) mainly driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and productivity including lower spend. Core operating income margin was 31.7% of net sales, increasing by 2.0 percentage points (+2.8 percentage points cc). Core net income was USD 13.2 billion (+9%, +12% cc) mainly driven by growth in core operating income. Core EPS was USD 5.78 (+9%, +13% cc), growing faster than core net income and benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. Free cash flow from continuing operations amounted to USD 11.7 billion (-10%) compared to USD 12.9 billion in 2019, as higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items was more than offset by payments related to legal matters and lower divestment proceeds. Innovative Medicines net sales were USD 39.0 billion (+3%, +4% cc) with volume contributing 10 percentage points to growth, pricing a negative 3 percentage points and generic competition had a negative impact of 3 percentage points. Pharmaceuticals BU grew 5% (cc) driven by Entresto (+44% cc), Zolgensma (reaching USD 0.9 billion), Cosentyx (+13% cc) and Ilaris (+31% cc). Growth was partly offset by declines in Gilenya, and lower demand for Lucentis due to COVID-19. Other Ophthalmology products were also impacted by both COVID-19 and generic competition. Oncology BU grew 3% (cc) driven by Promacta/Revolade (+23% cc), Jakavi (+20% cc), Kisqali (+45% cc), Tafinlar + Mekinist (+16% cc) and Piqray (reaching USD 0.3 billion), partly offset by generic competition mainly on Afinitor and Exjade. Sandoz net sales were USD 9.6 billion (-1%, 0% cc) with volume growth of 2 percentage points despite the negative impact of COVID-19 mainly on the retail business. There was a negative price effect of 2 percentage points, despite the benefit from off-contract sales and favorable revenue deduction adjustments. Sales in Europe grew 2% (cc), while sales in the US declined 14%, due to the continued volume decline in oral solids including partnership terminations. Global sales of Biopharmaceuticals grew 19% (cc) to USD 1.9 billion, driven by continued double-digit growth across all regions. Discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the business of Alcon and certain corporate costs directly attributable to Alcon up to the spin-off date. As the Alcon spin-off was completed on April 9, 2019, the prior year included three months of operating results of the divested business.

In the full year of 2019, discontinued operations net sales were USD 1.8 billion, operating income amounted to USD 71 million and net income from discontinued operations was USD 4.6 billion, including the non-taxable non-cash net gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders which amounted to USD 4.7 billion.

Q4 key growth drivers Underpinning our financial results in the quarter is a continued focus on key growth drivers including: Entresto (USD 716 million, +35% cc) sustained strong growth with increased patient share across markets, driven by demand as the essential first choice therapy for rEF heart failure.

Promacta/Revolade (USD 471 million, +23% cc) grew across all regions, driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia in the US. Jakavi (USD 376 million, +24% cc) growth was driven by strong demand in the myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera indications. Zolgensma (USD 254 million, +33% cc) growth was driven by expansion outside the US, including reimbursement in the EU and Japan, despite COVID-19 impacts. Tafinlar + Mekinist (USD 408 million, +13% cc) continued to show solid growth driven by demand in adjuvant melanoma as well as NSCLC. Kymriah (USD 141 million, +42% cc) grew strongly in Europe, US and Japan.

Entresto FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) voted 12 to 1 to support the use of Entresto in treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). PDUFA date is in Q1 2021. Iptacopan(LNP023) EMA granted orphan drug designation for iptacopan (LNP023) in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), an inflammatory kidney disease leading to deteriorating kidney function in mainly young adults. FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation1 in C3G, a rare renal disease affecting young patients with a poor prognosis and significant unmet need. Additionally, Breakthrough Therapy Designation was granted in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a life-threatening blood disorder. Ligelizumab(QGE031) FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for chronic spontaneous urticaria, an unpredictable and severe disease of the skin with limited approved therapies. 1 FDA grants the rare pediatric designation for serious or life-threatening diseases primarily affecting individuals aged 18 years or younger and impacting fewer than 200,000 people Results from ongoing trials and other highlights Beovu Phase III KESTREL study in diabetic macular edema (DME) met its primary endpoint, with Beovu 6mg demonstrating non-inferiority to aflibercept 2mg in change in best-corrected visual acuity at year one. Beovu demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile. Novartis announced positive topline results from another pivotal phase III study in DME, KITE, in September 2020. Submission planned for H1 2021. Asciminib(ABL001) Phase III ASCEMBL data in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase, presented at the American Society of Hematology, showed that at 24 week the investigational STAMP inhibitor asciminib nearly doubled the major molecular response rate compared to bosutinib (25.5% versus 13.2%), in patients resistant to, or intolerant of, at least two prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. Kisqali Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial demonstrated nearly five years of median overall survival in in pre- and perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. After a median of 53.5 months follow-up, median OS for patients taking Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy was 58.7 months versus 48.0 months for endocrine therapy alone. Data presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium demonstrated that Kisqali delivers consistent efficacy across the main HR+/HER2- intrinsic subtypes. Ad hoc exploratory analysis showed that Kisqali plus endocrine therapy consistently provided significant progression-free survival benefit across three of four subtypes of HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Kymriah Phase II investigational ELARA study interim analysis, presented at the American Society of Hematology, demonstrated that Kymriah led to a complete response in 65% of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and an overall response rate of 83% after at least three months. Phase II JULIET trial 40 months follow-up analysis demonstrated that the two-year progression-free survival rate was 33% in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Jakavi Phase III REACH3 study, presented at the American Society of Hematology, met its primary endpoint with Jakavi significantly improving outcomes in patients with steroid-refractory/dependent chronic graft-versus-host disease compared to best available therapy (BAT). Patients treated with Jakavi achieved significantly greater overall response rate compared to BAT (49.7% versus 25.6%) at week 24. Cosentyx Phase IIIb ULTIMATE trial demonstrated significant treatment response of Cosentyx on synovitis in psoriatic arthritis versus placebo at week 12, with improvements seen as early as week 1. Safety profile was consistent with previous studies. Data was presented at the American College of Rheumatology. Cosentyx received EC approval for a new 300mg autoinjector and pre-filled syringe, which enable the 300mg dose to be administered in a single injection. Leqvio Pooled post-hoc analyses from Phase III ORION-9, -10 and -11 trials, showed that Leqvio consistently reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by approximately 51% in both male and female adult patients and in three age categories (−51.3% <65 years; −49.9% ≥65 years to <75 years; −51.0% ≥75 years). Aimovig Phase IV HER-MES trial met its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority against topiramate in treating patients with episodic and chronic migraine. Aimovig had less discontinuation over the course of the 24-week treatment phase and a greater proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days. Tislelizumab In January, announced expansion of Oncology portfolio, by in-licensing a late-stage anti-PD1 antibody, tislelizumab, from BeiGene for monotherapy and potential proprietary combinations. Novartis secured development and commercialization rights in North America, Europe and Japan. Tislelizumab is already approved for patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic urothelial carcinoma in China and has 15 registration-enabling clinical trials underway in non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. (Subject to closing conditions; closing expected H1 2021). Capital structure and net debt Retaining a good balance between investment in the business, a strong capital structure and attractive shareholder returns remains a priority. In 2020, Novartis repurchased a total of 32.6 million shares for USD 2.9 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line, including 8.0 million shares (USD 0.7 billion) bought back under the up to USD 2.5 billion share buyback announced in November 2020 and 24.6 million shares (USD 2.2 billion) to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of associates. In addition, 1.7 million shares (USD 0.2 billion) were repurchased from associates. In the same period, 26.1 million shares (for an equity value of USD 1.5 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of associates. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 8.2 million versus December 31, 2019. These treasury share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 1.6 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 2.1 billion including the benefit from net option proceeds. As of December 31, 2020, the net debt increased to USD 24.5 billion compared to USD 15.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly driven by the acquisition of The Medicines Company for USD 9.6 billion, the USD 7.0 billion annual dividend payment and net cash outflow for treasury share transactions of USD 2.1 billion, partly offset by USD 11.7 billion free cash flow during 2020. As of Q4 2020, the long-term credit rating for the company is A1 with Moody’s Investors Service and AA- with S&P Global Ratings. The Group has not experienced liquidity or cash flow disruptions during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are confident that Novartis is well positioned to meet its ongoing financial obligations and has sufficient liquidity to support our normal business activities. 2021 outlook Barring unforeseen events Continuing operations (Excluding Alcon from both 2019 and 2020) Net Sales Expected to grow low to mid single digit (cc) From a divisional perspective, we expect net sales performance (cc) in 2021 to be as follows: Innovative Medicines: expected to grow mid single digitSandoz: expected to be broadly in line with prior year Core operating income Expected to grow mid single digit, ahead of sales (cc) Our guidance assumes that we see a return to normal global healthcare systems including prescription dynamics by mid 2021. In addition, we assume that no Gilenya and no Sandostatin LAR generics enter in 2021 in the US. Foreign exchange impactIf late-January exchange rates prevail for the remainder of 2021, the foreign exchange impact for the year would be positive 3 to 4 percentage points on net sales and positive 3 percentage points on core operating income. The estimated impact of exchange rates on our results is provided monthly on our website. Annual General Meeting Dividend proposalThe Novartis Board of Directors proposes a dividend payment of CHF 3.00 per share for 2020, up 1.7% from CHF 2.95 per share in the prior year, representing the 24th consecutive dividend increase since the creation of Novartis in December 1996.

2021-01-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Novartis AG is in talks to help produce other companies’ coronavirus vaccines or treatments as the industry mobilizes to boost supply amid fights over access.The company is “in conversations with a range of different players,” Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan said on Bloomberg TV, with an agreement possible in the coming days or weeks. “We have production capacity across our network that we’re willing to make available,” he said, for everything from monoclonal antibodies to vaccine production.The talks come amid a global scramble for vaccines that’s raised tensions as countries seek to nab supplies in the hope of securing a way out of the one-year-old pandemic. Sanofi threw its manufacturing weight behind Pfizer Inc.’s and BioNTech SE’s vaccine on Wednesday, saying it would give access to a production facility in Frankfurt after its own research stumbled.Merck KGaA is also considering several ways to help BioNTech increase capacity, including in the so-called “fill and finish” stage of vaccine production, a spokesman said. The company already supplies raw materials and research products to more than 50 coronavirus vaccine developers, including BioNTech.Germany’s Health Ministry has been talking with companies about increasing production, a spokesman said in an e-mail earlier this month. A spokeswoman for BioNTech declined to comment on potential partnerships.Tension Over SuppliesPfizer and BioNTech cut shipments of their vaccine, which was the first to market at the end of last year, to some governments this month due to renovations at a factory in Belgium. Then AstraZeneca Plc -- which may get EU approval for its shot on Friday -- announced delays to previously scheduled deliveries to the continent.The supply crunch has raised political tension between the European Union and Astra, which rejected demands that it take supplies from its U.K. factories to increase doses going to the bloc.Novartis’s Narasimhan, a physician who once led the company’s vaccines unit, has some personal experience being in the hot seat over pandemic shots. He oversaw the Novartis response to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 and was called to testify before the House Oversight Committee about why vaccines weren’t ready on time.Road Bumps“The early stages of scaling up from a few tens of thousands of doses to hundreds of millions of doses in general is a challenging scale-up,” he said in a separate interview. “It’s not surprising that we have some bumps in the road. What’s important right now is that we manage public expectations appropriately, and then I think the supplies will start to come through.”The fact that there are several shots available so soon into the pandemic is already a feat, he said.Unlike Sanofi, Novartis isn’t working on developing its own pandemic vaccine. The company sold its vaccines unit to GlaxoSmithKline Plc -- Sanofi’s partner for the shot that’s suffered delays -- several years ago.But Novartis makes more than 70 billion doses of medicines each year across 50 facilities, and the Swiss drugmaker is investigating how best to deploy that capacity, according to Narasimhan.“We have the capabilities to make many of these different technologies available,” he said.Novartis shares traded about 1% lower in Zurich amid a general stock market retreat.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Novartis in Talks to Join Pharma Industry’s Covid Vaccine Push

2021-01-29,"Kesimpta is a targeted B-cell therapy that delivers superior efficacy with a similar safety and tolerability profile compared with teriflunomide, a first-line treatment in MS1CHMP opinion is based on two Phase III ASCLEPIOS studies that met the primary endpoints where Kesimpta showed a reduction of the annual relapses by over 50% versus teriflunomide and achieved more than 30% relative risk reduction of 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) 1In a post hoc analysis, nearly nine out of 10 patients treated with Kesimpta achieved no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) in their second year of treatment2If approved, Kesimpta will be the first and only self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis in Europe The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here: Basel, January 29, 2021 — Novartis announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion and recommended granting marketing authorization of Kesimpta® (ofatumumab) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that has shown superior efficacy with a similar safety profile compared with teriflunomide, a first-line treatment in MS1. Kesimpta has the potential to become a first-choice treatment option for patients with RMS that can be self-administered once-monthly at home via the Sensoready® autoinjector pen3. “In MS, one of the main goals of treatment is to achieve no evidence of disease activity as early on and for as long as possible4,” said Dr. Xavier Montalban, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Vall d'Hebron University Hospital. “Knowing that early initiation of high-efficacy treatments can improve long-term outcomes5, it’s exciting to see that Kesimpta has the potential to halt new disease activity and help people to preserve neurological function and slow down the worsening of disability2.” “The positive CHMP opinion for Kesimpta underscores its potential to provide people living with RMS in Europe with a new treatment that combines powerful efficacy with a favorable safety profile and can be taken at home1,3,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “By removing the need to go to an infusion center, Kesimpta has the capability to reduce the burden not only for patients, but also for physicians and the healthcare system6,7. Kesimpta is a testament to our commitment to reimagine medicine for the MS community and we will work closely with the regulatory authorities to ensure it is available for people living with MS as soon as possible.”The CHMP opinion is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority versus teriflunomide in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR, primary endpoint), 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions1. Results from these two studies were published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated that Kesimpta may halt new disease activity in RMS patients, with nearly nine out of 10 patients treated with Kesimpta achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) in their second year of treatment2. The CHMP recommended approval for Kesimpta with an indication for the treatment of adult patients with RMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. The European Commission will review the CHMP recommendation and deliver its final decision in approximately two months.In August 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Kesimpta as an injection for subcutaneous use for the treatment of RMS, to include clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. On January 25, 2021, Kesimpta was approved in Canada for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). *Brand name Kesimpta provisionally approved by EMA.About Kesimpta® (ofatumumab)Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that provides the flexibility of self-administration for adults with RMS. It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. Initial doses of Kesimpta are given at Weeks 0, 1 and 2, with the first injection performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As shown in preclinical studies, Kesimpta is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion8. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen9. Once-monthly dosing of Kesimpta differs from other anti-CD20 therapies as it allows faster repletion of B-cells, offering more flexibility in MS management10. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 201511.About ASCLEPIOS I and II studiesThe ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Kesimpta 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1,882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries12. Kesimpta demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 59% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P<.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Kesimpta also showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (P=.002) in 3-month CDP compared with teriflunomide, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1. Kesimpta showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (98% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) vs teriflunomide1. Kesimpta had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and malignancies also being similar across both treatment groups. Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions and local injection site reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions with Kesimpta (incidence greater than 10%)1. A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated that Kesimpta may halt new disease activity in RMS patients. It showed the odds of achieving NEDA-3 (no relapses, no MRI lesions, and no disability worsening combined) with ofatumumab versus teriflunomide were >3-fold higher at Months 0–12 (47.0% vs 24.5% of patients; P<.001) and >8-fold higher at Months 12–24 (87.8% vs 48.2% of patients; P<.001)2. Overall Kesimpta, an antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1. About APLIOS studyThe APLIOS study is a 12-week, open-label, Phase II bioequivalence study to determine the onset of B-cell depletion with Kesimpta subcutaneous monthly injections and the bioequivalence of subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe—as used in ASCLEPIOS I and II—and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS. Patients were randomized according to injection device and site including the abdomen and thigh. B-cell depletion was measured nine times over 12 weeks and Gd+ lesion counts were assessed at baseline and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. Regardless of injection device or site, Kesimpta 20 mg subcutaneous monthly injections resulted in rapid, close to complete and sustained B-cell depletion; the proportion of patients with B-cell concentrations of <10 cells/μL was >65% after the first injection by Day 7, 94% by Week 4 and sustained >95% at all following injections. Kesimpta treatment reduced the mean number of Gd+ lesions from baseline (1.5) to 0.8, 0.3 and 0.1 by Weeks 4, 8 and 12, respectively. The proportion of patients free from Gd+ lesions at the corresponding time points were 66.5%, 86.7% and 94.1%, respectively3.The ASCLEPIOS and APLIOS studies form part of the AXIOS Program, the overarching ofatumumab clinical development program, which will expand the evidence of ofatumumab in MS.About Multiple SclerosisMultiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord13. MS, which affects approximately 2.8 million people worldwide14, can be characterized into four main types of MS: CIS, relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)15. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease13.Novartis in NeuroscienceNovartis has a long heritage and strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions where there is a high unmet need.

2021-02-11,"Sandoz to acquire three established brands sold in more than 100 marketsAcquisition, including leading global brand Zinnat®, confirms Sandoz commitment to antibiotics, following plans to expand its integrated manufacturing site in KundlTransaction complements Sandoz leadership in generic penicillins with a leading position in cephalosporins – largest antibiotic segment by global sales Basel, February 11, 2021 – Sandoz, a Novartis division, has signed an agreement to acquire GSK’s cephalosporin antibiotics business, reinforcing its leading global position in antibiotics. The agreement includes the global rights to three established brands (Zinnat®, Zinacef® and Fortum®)) in more than 100 markets. It excludes the rights in the US, Australia and Germany to certain of those brands, which were previously divested by GSK, and in India, Pakistan, Egypt, Japan (to certain of the brands) and China, which will be retained by GSK. Sandoz will pay GSK USD 350 million at closing, plus additional milestone payments of up to USD 150 million, subject to the terms of the transaction. Closing of the transaction is expected in the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. In 2020, the three brands had combined sales of approximately USD 140 million in the relevant markets. In line with its integrated manufacturing strategy, Sandoz intends in the longer term to manufacture Zinnat® at sites in its own network, which has global antibiotics production centered on its lead production site in Kundl, Austria. Once the transaction is completed, GSK will supply Zinnat® to Sandoz under a manufacturing and supply agreement (MSA), while supporting a transfer of the related manufacturing operations to Sandoz. We expect this process to last for approximately four years from the close of the transaction onwards. “This important transaction will further position Sandoz as a global leader in antibiotics – truly essential medicines that are the backbone of modern healthcare systems,” said Sandoz CEO Richard Saynor. “Cephalosporins are the largest antibiotic segment by global sales and acquiring this leading business, including the established global Zinnat® brand, will complement our #1 position in generic penicillins, the other key segment. It will also set us up for additional synergies driven by an increased promotional footprint that will support growth of both the acquired brands and the current existing Sandoz portfolio.” The agreement confirms the Sandoz commitment to further grow its antibiotics business, following the announcement last year of a joint investment with the Austrian government of more than EUR 150 million to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of its Kundl antibiotic manufacturing site and help to ensure long-term supply resilience. Kundl is the hub and center of the last major integrated production chain for antibiotics in the western world. Its focus is on generic penicillin products, but the plant also produces finished dosage forms of several generic cephalosporin products.

2021-02-16,"Entresto is the first and only therapy approved in the US to treat patients diagnosed with guideline-defined heart failure to include both those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and many with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)1-3 Expanded indication enables potential treatment of more adults with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal, the group where benefits are most clearly evident1 Of the more than 6 million Americans suffering from chronic heart failure (CHF), approximately 5 million may be appropriate for treatment with Entresto3,4 Basel, February 16, 2021 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following expanded indication for Entresto® (sacubitril/valsartan): to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure1. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal1. The label also states LVEF is a variable measure and clinical judgment should be used in deciding whom to treat1. For the first time, there is a treatment with benefit for patients diagnosed with guideline-defined heart failure that includes both those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and many with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)1-3. “This approval is a significant advancement, providing a treatment to many patients who were not eligible for treatment before because their ejection fraction was above the region we normally considered reduced. Until now, treatment for these patients was largely empiric,” said Scott Solomon, MD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and PARAGON-HF Executive Committee Co-Chair. “We can now offer a treatment to a wider range of patients who have an LVEF below normal.” This label expansion is based on efficacy and safety evidence observed in PARAGON-HF, the largest and only Phase III active-controlled study to date in patients with guideline-defined HFpEF2,5,6. The greatest benefit was shown in patients with LVEF below normal6. Approximately 6 million Americans are living with chronic heart failure (CHF)4. Approximately 3 million have HFrEF, and of the remaining 3 million, about 2 million have HFpEF with LVEF below normal2-4. The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is increasing as the population ages4. Patients often face worsening symptoms that result in frequent HF hospitalizations7. Each hospitalization event is associated with worsening long-term prognosis7. Approximately one in four patients are re-admitted for HF and 10 percent may die within 30 days of discharge8,9. Overall CHF death rates remain significantly high, with up to half of patients dying within five years of a HF diagnosis4. “We are proud of our goal to reimagine medicine. This commitment has enabled us to bring Entresto to millions more heart failure patients in the US, many of whom did not have an approved treatment option until now,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “This achievement would not have been possible without tremendous dedication from investigators, patients in our clinical trials and the advocacy community, to whom we are extremely grateful.” About our longstanding commitment to heart failureOur goal is to reimagine medicine for heart failure patients. Novartis established the largest global clinical program in the HF disease area across the pharma industry to date. Known as FortiHFy, it is comprised of more than 40 clinical studies designed to generate an array of additional data on efficacy, quality of life, patient-reported outcomes and real-world evidence with Entresto, as well as to extend understanding of heart failure. FortiHFy includes trials across the spectrum of heart failure, such as PARADIGM-HF, PIONEER-HF, TRANSITION, PROVE-HF, PARAGON-HF and PARAMOUNT. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 30,000 patients have participated in the Entresto clinical trials program, and it is estimated that more than 2.8 million patients are on treatment with Entresto today. About EntrestoIn Europe, Entresto is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of symptomatic chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction10. In the United States, Entresto is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure1. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal1. LVEF is a variable measure, so use clinical judgment in deciding whom to treat1. Approved indications may vary depending upon the individual country. Entresto is a twice-a-day medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart10. It does this by enhancing protective neurohormonal systems (i.e., natriuretic peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)10,11. Other common HF medicines, called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS. Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan1,10.

2021-02-17,"Project brings together Novartis drug discovery and gene therapy expertise and funding support from the Gates Foundation Agreement aims to address disparity in access to treatments and to prioritize populations and regions that bear the greatest burden of sickle cell disease in the search for curative therapies Effort expands on Novartis commitment to sickle cell disease, which includes a therapeutic pipeline and a holistic approach to diagnosis, treatment, and management of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa Basel, February 17, 2021 — Novartis today announced that it has entered into a grant agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. As part of the agreement, the foundation will provide funding support for the discovery and development of a single-administration, in vivo gene therapy to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). The project brings together Novartis drug discovery and gene therapy expertise with the Gates Foundation’s charitable objectives to expand access to healthcare in low-resource settings in an effort to address this potentially life-threatening genetic disease. “Existing gene therapy approaches to sickle cell disease are difficult to deliver at scale and there are obstacles to reaching the vast majority of those affected by this debilitating disease,” said Jay Bradner, a hematologist and President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR). “This is a challenge that calls for collective action, and we are thrilled to have the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in addressing this global unmet medical need.” SCD is a hereditary blood disease—one of the oldest known and most common genetic disorders. The disease affects millions around the world, with over 300,000 born with the condition annually1,2. It disproportionately affects those of African descent, and sub-Saharan Africa bears roughly 80 percent of the disease burden3. It also is common among people with ancestry from South America, Central America, and India, as well as several Mediterranean countries, such as Italy and Turkey. SCD is a complex genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of hemoglobin, reduces the ability of red blood cells to transport oxygen efficiently and, early on, progresses to a chronic vascular disease1,4,5,6. The disease can lead to acute episodes of pain known as sickle cell pain crises, or vaso-occlusive crises, as well as life-threatening complications7,8,9. The resulting, frequent hospitalizations associated with sickle cell disease combined with an overall lack of specialized care places a significant burden on patients and their families, healthcare systems, and the overall economy. Even with today’s best available care, SCD continues to drive premature deaths and disability. While the genetic cause of SCD has been known for decades, it’s only recently that the medical world has gained the tools to potentially fix the errant gene that causes the disease. Current clinical-stage gene-based therapies require extracting cells from a patient, altering those cells in a laboratory, and then reintroducing them to the patient through a complex procedure akin to a bone marrow transplant. The lab and manufacturing facilities and hospital infrastructure for such procedures often do not exist in the areas where SCD is most prevalent, excluding the vast majority of those with the disease from these life-changing gene therapies. “Gene therapies might help end the threat of diseases like sickle cell, but only if we can make them far more affordable and practical for low-resource settings,” said Trevor Mundel, President of Global Health at the Gates Foundation. “What’s exciting about this project is that it brings ambitious science to bear on that challenge. It’s about treating the needs of people in lower-income countries as a driver of scientific and medical progress, not an afterthought. It also holds the promise of applying lessons learned to help develop potentially curative options for other debilitating diseases affecting low-income populations, such as HIV.” Novartis envisions developing an accessible in vivo gene therapy for SCD that could potentially be administered once, directly to the patient, without the need to modify the cells in a lab. This would have the advantage of mitigating the need for long or repeated hospital stays or specialized lab infrastructure. To facilitate the research, the Gates Foundation has agreed to provide funding support for a research team within NIBR wholly dedicated to developing an approach to delivering this potential treatment. Novartis will provide in-kind support and access to its suite of technologies and resources. In addition to research funding, the Gates Foundation lends its long history and experience in global health to this collaboration. As part of the early drug design strategy, Novartis will prioritize addressing access and distribution hurdles posed by limited healthcare infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries and the funding agreement includes specific provisions to support global access to any resulting innovations. “Novartis is proud to lead this effort to find an accessible genetic therapy for sickle cell disease, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,” said Lutz Hegemann, Group Head of Corporate Affairs & Global Health for Novartis. “In keeping with our purpose, we firmly believe we can use science and innovation to reimagine the way SCD is treated for patients around the world.” The agreement builds on the Novartis commitment to improve the lives of patients with sickle cell disease through the development of new treatments, including crizanlizumab, strategic partnerships with government and non-government organizations, and support for such interventions as newborn screenings and the distribution of existing drugs.

2021-03-09,"Molecular Partners AG (OTCMKTS: MLLCF) and its collaborator Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) have announced initial results from the ongoing Phase 1 study of its COVID-19 antiviral treatment, ensovibep (MP0420), in healthy volunteers. In two cohorts of a single infusion of either 3mg or 9mg per kilogram body weight dosing, ensovibep was seen to be safe and well-tolerated. No significant adverse events were reported. Preliminary results showed extended exposure of MP0420 in serum, with a half-life of 2-3 weeks. The company plans to initiate Phase 2/3 global registration study in the second quarter of this year. The third cohort in this Phase 1 study, at a 20mg per kilogram dose level, has been planned. The cohort has not been enrolled due to the pandemic-related restrictions, with possible enrollment to start in the coming weeks. The companies have already identified the therapeutic dose levels, which will be investigated in the upcoming clinical studies below the 20mg per kilogram level. Price Action: NVS shares are down 0.4% at $83.37, while MLLCF is up 1.4% at $21.54 in premarket trading on the last check Tuesday.

2021-03-09,"Phase III CANOPY-2 trial did not meet primary endpoint of overall survival in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose cancer progressed while on or after previous treatments1Canakinumab development program continues; two Phase III non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials are ongoing in first-line and adjuvant settings2,3 The CANOPY clinical trial program is designed to help answer critical questions about the role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in pro-tumor inflammation in lung cancer, with multiple clinical trials investigating canakinumab in different stages of disease using distinct treatment combinations2-5 Basel, March 9, 2021 — Novartis announced today the Phase III CANOPY-2 study evaluating canakinumab (ACZ885), an inhibitor of interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel, did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS)1. The trial was conducted among 237 adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed while on or after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitor immunotherapy4. Two Phase III CANOPY trials continue, evaluating canakinumab in first-line and adjuvant settings2,3. Novartis and CANOPY-2 investigators will analyze the study data and are expected to submit its findings for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.“While results from the CANOPY-2 trial are not what we hoped for in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have been treated with other lines of therapy, these data give us valuable insights into IL-1β inhibition,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “Ongoing Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer continue, evaluating canakinumab in earlier treatment settings. We sincerely thank the patients and clinical investigators involved in the CANOPY-2 study for their partnership.”CANOPY-1, a Phase III study evaluating canakinumab in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, is expected to report final results before the end of the year2. CANOPY-A, another Phase III study, is investigating canakinumab as an adjuvant therapy and has enrolled more than 950 patients to date and is expected to enroll a total of 1,500 patients3.About canakinumab (ACZ885) Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and selectivity to human interleukin-1beta (IL-1β)6,7 and neutralizes IL-1β activity by blocking its interaction with its receptors8. By neutralizing IL-1β, preliminary evidence suggests that canakinumab inhibits pro-tumor inflammation (PTI) to 1) enhance anti-tumor immune response; 2) reduce tumor cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness; and 3) impair angiogenesis8. Pro-tumor inflammation enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses9,10. Canakinumab is a first-in-class interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) inhibitor of PTI in non-small cell lung cancer10. About the CANOPY program Novartis launched the CANOPY study program after observing significantly lower than expected rates of lung cancer mortality among patients in the Phase III cardiovascular CANTOS trial. The CANTOS trial evaluated canakinumab as a secondary prevention measure for cardiovascular events in patients following a heart attack (CRP≥2 mg/L)8,9. Patients in the CANTOS trial were also at high risk for inflammatory cancers, like lung cancer, due to advanced age, smoking history and other clinical risk factors8,9. Based on these findings, Novartis launched three, large-scale, randomized, Phase III clinical trials and a Phase II clinical trial to investigate canakinumab as a potential treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CANOPY-1 (NCT03631199) is a Phase III trial evaluating canakinumab as a first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy2 CANOPY-2 (NCT03626545) is a Phase III trial investigating the role of canakinumab in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel in second- or third-line therapy versus docetaxel alone in NSCLC. Part 1 of the CANOPY-2 trial – a safety run-in study to determine the appropriate dosage, was previously presented at ASCO 2019. Part 2 of the trial, reported today, evaluated overall survival (OS)4 CANOPY-A (NCT03447769) is a Phase III trial studying canakinumab in the adjuvant setting, following surgical resection and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The adjuvant study is designed to determine if treatment with canakinumab can prevent cancer relapse3 CANOPY-N (NCT03968419) is a non-registrational Phase II neoadjuvant trial evaluating canakinumab in combination with pembrolizumab among patients with resectable NSCLC prior to their planned surgery5 Novartis and Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for more than 2 million new cases diagnosed each year11. There are two main types of lung cancer – small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)12. NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses, resulting in nearly 1.7 million new cases each year11,13. Currently, the five-year survival rate for lung cancer is less than 20%14, decreasing further when the disease is diagnosed at later stages15. The majority of people with NSCLC are diagnosed with advanced or Stage III or IV disease16, and treatment options are limited for people with lung cancer who experience cancer growth or progression while on standard of care treatments17-19. More people die of lung cancer every year than any other cancer type11. Novartis is committed to developing best-in-class treatments for lung cancer patients around the world. With a focus on both targeted, personalized medicine and the role of newer, immuno-oncology therapies, the lung cancer drug development program at Novartis is among the most robust in the industry. With research activities informed by long-term relationships with leading lung cancer thought leaders and patient advocates, Novartis is focused on reimagining the treatment of lung cancer.

2021-03-12,"Pharmaceutical stocks often need just a single blockbuster drug to make their fortunes. Though the definition varies, blockbuster drugs are those that generate annual sales of $1 billion or more. The biggest blockbuster drugs can even exceed $100 billion in lifetime sales. All of the companies on this list have drugs in their pipelines which could eclipse the billion dollar revenue milestone. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A blockbuster drug may be enough to send a smaller company’s stock price skyrocketing. Yet, in a larger pharmaceutical firm, a succession of blockbuster drugs is necessary simply to keep prices stable. Investors should keep that in mind before buying into any of the equities on this list. 7 OTC Stocks That Could Still Run with the Big Boys Nevertheless, these pharmaceutical stocks are on track to produce blockbusters: Mirati Therapeutics (NASDAQ:MRTX) Novartis (NYSE:NVS) Biohaven Pharmaceutical (NYSE:BHVN) BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:BMRN) Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) Daiichi Sankyo (OTCMKTS:DSNKY) arGENX (NASDAQ:ARGX) Pharmaceutical Stocks: Mirati Therapeutics (MRTX) Source: luchschenF / Shutterstock.com Mirati Therapeutics is a pharmaceutical company that focuses on oncology. Cancer costs the U.S. and the world untold sums. According to the CDC, in 2019 cancer was the second leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer comprises many different forms, and attacks multiple sites within the body. Therefore, there can be no single cure for cancer. Mirati Therapeutics is currently in the running to commercialize a therapy against a cancer that is particularly difficult to treat. Adagrasib is a drug the company has developed, which may have particular efficacy in treating non-small cell lung cancer that exhibits a specific mutation. KRAS G12C mutation positive cancers were once thought to be untreatable. However, there are several companies with promising therapies with the potential to soon hit the market. Drugs which treat once intractable diseases often become blockbusters, and there’s great potential for these types of pharmaceutical stocks. However, Mirati Pharmaceuticals is not alone in the race to treat KRAS G12C mutation positive cancers. According to FiercePharma, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) looks likely to commercialize its drug, Sotorasib first. That might not be as bad as it appears. That’s because there are clear indications that Mirati Therapeutics’ Adagrasib will prove more effective in the long run. It produced a higher response than Amgen’s drug and exhibits greater tumor reduction potential. MRTX stock is down 12.5% in 2021, but analysts have it overweight with an average target price of $244.77 Novartis (NVS) Source: Shutterstock Novartis, like a few other pharmaceutical stocks, is off by roughly 12% since beginning 2021. Even so, the company has two potential blockbuster drugs in development: Kesimpta and Inclisiran. Kesimpta is an injectable drug used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drug has recently received approval. Inclisiran is used to battle high cholesterol. Inclisiran is known commercially as Leqvio. Novartis is currently launching Leqvio in Germany for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The U.K. launch is set to occur in the third quarter of this year, while the U.S. launch is facing setbacks. The setbacks look to be related to production issues rather than efficacy. Inclirisan/Leqvio is manufactured at an Italian facility controlled by Corden Pharma. Process control related issues caused the FDA to delay the drug’s approval in December. 7 Stocks to Buy That Are Cheering for March Madness Novartis assumes that Kesimpta will be a growth driver during 2021. At the same time, the company recognizes that launches of both Kesimpta and Leqvio will require significant investments. Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) Source: Bukhta Yurii / Shutterstock.com Biohaven Pharmaceutical has a potential blockbuster on the market in its migraine drug called Nurtec. Nurtec helps migraine sufferers return to normal functioning for up to 48 hours with a single dose. The drug was launched commercially in the U.S. in March of 2020. Furthermore, Nurtec accounted for $63.6 million in revenues during calendar year 2020. And the drug’s sales really took off in the fourth quarter. Nurtec pulled in $35.1 million in sales, which was a 98% increase over the third quarter. Biohaven Pharmaceutical recorded no revenue in 2019. All of its 2020 revenues were attributable to Nurtec which was prescribed to 337,000 times during the period. Biohaven Pharmaceutical CEO Vlad Coric believes that Nurtec competes in an addressable market that could grow to $4 billion-$5 billion annually in the U.S. alone, which makes this one of the most compelling pharmaceutical stocks. BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) Source: Shutterstock BioMarin Pharmaceutical has an opportunity to occupy a significant corner of its market. That’s because BioMarin recently increased its production estimates in its gene therapy facility. BioMarin Pharmaceutical previously stated that it could treat up to 4,000 hemophilia A patients with its single dose drug. However, the company later upped that number to 10,000. That’s an important number because it may mean that BioMarin can treat the entire U.S. population suffering from severe hemophilia A in two years. Existing hemophilia A therapies require repeated injections. BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec therapy is a single dose gene therapy. If it receives FDA approval, it will provide long-lasting effects with a single dosage. The therapy costs between $2 million and $3 million. The current standard in the highly competitive hemophilia. Gene therapy costs about $700,000 annually but must be continued indefinitely. 7 of the Top Transportation Stocks to Buy Right Now Phase 3 study results for the gene therapy are expected in early 2021. Company CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime expects 2020 revenues of around $2 billion to increase to as much as $10 billion within a decade. Novo Nordisk (NVO) Source: Shutterstock Novo Nordisk launched type-2 diabetes drug Rybelsus in 2019. Full-year 2020 sales reached $305 million, which exceeded the expectations of many analysts. Rybelsus is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy and is the second from Novo Nordisk. The first such therapy was Ozempic which was launched in 2018. Novo Nordisk will have a strong opportunity to dominate the market over the coming decade with both drugs. Researchers studying both semaglutide drugs have noted other interesting side effects: “Our trial showed that among adults with overweight or obesity (without diabetes), once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide plus lifestyle intervention was associated with substantial, sustained, clinically relevant mean weight loss of 14.9%, with 86% of participants attaining at least 5% weight loss.” I cannot say if this opens up an additional sales channel in non-diabetic patients. Whether it does or does not remains irrelevant. Novo Nordisk looks to have struck gold with its newest diabetes therapies. Daiichi Sankyo (DSNKY) Source: Shutterstock Enhertu is a drug that received FDA approval in December against interstitial lung disease. Additionally, the drug is indicated against HER2- positive breast cancer. The drug is approved for use in both Japan and the United States. It is indicated for use in patients who have received two or more anti HER2 based regimens previously. As mentioned previously, a blockbuster drug is one that exceeds $1 billion in annual sales. Enhertu could eclipse that based on a prediction which pegs its 2024 sales at $2.4 billion. A monthly regimen of the drug cost $13,300 at launch. 7 Hot Stocks Ready to Ride Retail Growth SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens, M.D., predicted that the drug could reach peak sales of $2.5 billion annually. In one study, Enhertu reduced tumor size in 61% of cases and completely eliminated them in 6% of cases. The drug is also being evaluated for efficacy against non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. The obvious upshot here is that other potential large revenue streams may exist for Enhertu moving forward. arGEN-X (ARGX) Source: Shutterstock arGEN-X is a company and stock that had a great 2020. In early March of 2020 ARGX stock sat at $150. As of March 12, it sits above $309 per share. The company’s potential blockbuster drug is a severe autoimmune disease therapy called Efgartigimod. The drug is closest to approval for use in treating myasthenia gravis. Efartigimod is also being reviewed for two other diseases and is in Phase 3 trials. It also is being studied in a Phase 2 trial. This means the drug could receive approval for four separate diseases. Investors are keenly following, as the revenue implications are intriguing. Stifel analysts predict that peak sales of Efgartigimod for use in treating myasthenia gravis could reach $1.7 billion annually. Efgartigimod is nearest FDA approval as a therapy for that specified condition. That application alone would vault it into blockbuster territory. However, investors must remember that the drug is in two Phase 3 trials and another Phase 2 trial. That means revenue streams could peak much higher.

2021-03-15,"Children with SMA treated presymptomatically achieved age-appropriate motor milestones including sitting, standing and walking; required no ventilatory or feeding tube support; and had no serious, treatment-related adverse events Real-world data indicate older children (aged ≥6 months) achieved clinically meaningful benefit with Zolgensma alone, after or in combination with another SMA therapy, with events consistent with the previously described safety profileZolgensma led to achievement of new milestones years after treatment in two long-term follow-up studies and resulted in sustained durability in children with SMA now up to six years old and more than five years post-treatment To date, more than 1,000 children with SMA have been treated with Zolgensma across clinical trials, managed access programs, and in the commercial setting Basel, March 15, 2021 – Novartis today announced new data that reinforce the transformational benefit of Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec), an essential one-time treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The overall safety profile remains favorable following presymptomatic treatment, in the long-term follow-up period from clinical studies and in the real-world setting. These data were presented during the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Virtual Clinical and Scientific Conference. New data underscore the critical importance of identifying and treating SMA as early as possible. In contrast to the natural history1 of this devastating disease, which leads to progressive and irreversible loss of motor function, children treated with Zolgensma presymptomatically in the Phase 3 SPR1NT trial achieved age-appropriate motor milestones within the World Health Organization (WHO) window of normal development – including sitting, standing and walking – were able to eat exclusively by mouth and did not require ventilatory support of any kind. There were no serious, treatment-related adverse events reported in SPR1NT. In addition, children identified via newborn screening enrolled in the RESTORE real-world registry were significantly less likely to receive more than one SMA therapy compared with those who were diagnosed clinically. “Without the benefit of disease-modifying therapy, newborns with biallelic SMN1 deletions and two or three copies of SMN2 would normally develop SMA Type 1 and SMA Type 2, respectively. When treated with Zolgensma prior to the onset of symptoms, children in the SPR1NT trial achieved milestones like sitting, standing and walking at an appropriate age, grew as expected without nutritional assistance, and remained free of all forms of mechanical ventilatory support,” said Kevin Strauss, M.D., Medical Director, Clinic for Special Children in Pennsylvania. “This stands in sharp contrast to the natural progression of SMA Type 1, which would otherwise render them helpless within the first year of life and unable to swallow, breathe, or survive without mechanical support. The transformative benefit of early intervention, as seen in SPR1NT, further underscores the urgent need for newborn screening.” Long-term follow-up data from two studies continued to demonstrate that children treated with Zolgensma experienced a sustained benefit from gene therapy in the years following dosing, with no evidence of new or delayed safety signals. Zolgensma led to achievement of new milestones years after treatment – including sitting – with sustained durability in children now up to six years old and more than five years post-treatment. Emerging findings from the RESTORE registry – designed to provide real-world data for enhancing our understanding of patients cared for in routine practice – indicate older children (≥6 months) achieved a clinically meaningful benefit when treated with Zolgensma alone, after switching to gene therapy or in combination with another SMA therapy, with safety events consistent with the previously described safety profile. Nearly all children with two or more CHOP INTEND assessments available improved or maintained their scores, and most had a clinically meaningful ≥4-point increase. According to Shephard Mpofu, M.D., SVP, Chief Medical Officer, Novartis Gene Therapies, “With more than 1,000 patients now treated, these data presented at MDA further reinforce what we’ve come to expect from Zolgensma – consistent, significant and clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit in SMA, including prolonged event-free survival, achievement of motor milestones unseen in natural history of the disease, and durability now more than five years post-dosing.” SPR1NT Data as of June 11, 2020 SPR1NT is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in presymptomatic patients with a genetic diagnosis of SMA and two or three copies of SMN2 who are ≤6 weeks of age. The majority of patients with two copies of SMN2 develop SMA Type 1, the most common form accounting for 60 percent of cases. Patients with SMA Type 1 will never sit unassisted and, when left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or permanent ventilation by the age of two in the majority of cases. Most patients (>80 percent) with three copies of SMN2 develop SMA Type 2. According to natural history, patients with SMA Type 2 never walk. Across the two-copy and three-copy cohorts, all patients (100 percent) were alive and free of ventilatory support of any kind. All patients (100 percent) fed orally and did not require feeding tube support of any kind. According to natural history, 60 percent of two-copy patients would require feeding support by 15 months. Two-copy cohort (n=14) findings as of June 11, 2020 data cut The median age of patients was 15.6 months (range 8.8–18.8 months of age).Eleven of 14 patients (79 percent) achieved the study’s primary endpoint of sitting without support for at least 30 seconds. Ten of these patients achieved this within the WHO window of normal development. The remaining three patients were still being evaluated in the study at the time of the data cutoff. Five patients (36 percent) could stand independently, three of whom achieved this milestone within the WHO window of normal development. Four patients (29 percent) could walk independently, three of whom achieved this milestone within the WHO window of normal development. Of those patients who had not yet achieved these milestones, the majority (seven of 9 and seven of 10, respectively) had not yet passed the normal developmental window. All patients (100 percent) achieved CHOP INTEND scores of ≥50, and 13 (93 percent) achieved a CHOP INTEND score ≥58. All patients (100 percent) had steady gains in mean raw score of Bayley-III fine and gross motor scales. Three-copy cohort (n=15) findings as of June 11, 2020 data cut The median age was 15.2 months (range 3.3–21.1 months of age).Eight patients (53 percent) achieved the study’s primary endpoint of standing alone for at least three seconds, and six patients (40 percent) walked independently. These motor milestones were all achieved within the WHO window of normal development. Of those patients who had not yet achieved these milestones, all were still within the WHO window of normal development. All patients (100 percent) had steady gains in mean raw score of Bayley-III fine and gross motor scales. While all patients experienced at least one AE after dosing, there were no serious, treatment-related adverse events. Seven patients were reported to have had serious adverse events (SAEs), all of which resolved and were not related to treatment. Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) StudiesAfter the conclusion of the Phase 1 START study, 10 of 12 patients from cohort 2 (therapeutic dose) voluntarily enrolled in an ongoing observational long-term follow-up study (LT-001). As of June 11, 2020 data cut, all patients (100 percent) were alive and free of permanent ventilation. The mean age of patients was 5.2 years (range 4.76.1 years) and the mean time since gene therapy treatment was 5.0 years (range 4.65.6 years). No visits were conducted in LT-001 from December 31, 2019 through June 11, 2020. As of the December 2019 data cut, no previously achieved motor milestones were lost, and two patients (20 percent) had gained the milestone of standing with assistance (neither of whom had received treatment with nusinersen) during the follow-up period. Six patients (60 percent) did not require regular, daily respiratory support. Patients from the completed and ongoing Phase 3 IV studies (STR1VE-US, STR1VE-EU, STR1VE-AP, SPR1NT) and the Phase 1 intrathecal study (STRONG – currently on partial clinical hold) are now enrolling in a long-term follow-up extension study (LT-002). IV cohort (n=23) findings as of the November 12, 2020 data cut The mean age was 2.3 years (range 1.63.2 years) and the mean time since gene therapy treatment was 2.0 years (range 1.52.7 years). Eleven new milestones were achieved by four patients (17 percent), including sitting without support by all four patients (three were not receiving concomitant disease-modifying SMA therapy). Twenty-one patients (91 percent) were not receiving concomitant disease-modifying SMA therapy. IT cohort (n=8) findings as of the November 12, 2020 data cut The mean age was 4.3 years (range 2.86.1 years) and the mean time since gene therapy treatment was 2.4 years (range 1.8–2.8 years).Four patients (50 percent) were not receiving concomitant disease-modifying SMA therapy. In both LT-001 and LT-002, long-term follow-up does not show evidence of new or delayed safety signals, supporting a favorable benefit-risk profile. RESTORE RegistryThe RESTORE registry is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter, multinational, observational study of patients with a diagnosis of SMA, including patients from the Zolgensma managed access programs and from partnering clinical sites with a planned follow up of 15 years. The RESTORE registry provides real-world data for enhancing our understanding of patients with SMA cared for in routine practice. As of December 7, 2020, 70 patients were enrolled who had received Zolgensma when they were 6 months of age or older. Of these, 45 (64 percent) had SMA Type 1. Real-world findings from older patients (≥6 months) Thirty-four patients (48.5 percent) were ≥6 to 12 months, 30 (43 percent) were ≥12 to 24 months, and six (8.5 percent) were ≥24 months of age at the time of dosing. 50 patients (71 percent) were on Zolgensma alone, or had switched from nusinersen and/or risdiplam.Of the 23 patients with two or more CHOP INTEND assessments available, 22 (nearly 96 percent) improved or maintained their score, including 15 patients with a clinically meaningful ≥4-point increase. Reported adverse reactions in patients receiving Zolgensma were consistent with the previously described safety profile.Hepatotoxicity events were reported, ranging from asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases to acute liver failure; all resolved with prednisolone treatment. In November 2020, “Hepatotoxicity following administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec (AVXS-101) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy,” was published in the Journal of Hepatology.Two cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) were reported as adverse events. These were both included in a series of patient case studies of TMA following treatment with Zolgensma that was published in the Journal of Pediatrics in November 2020.Two deaths have been reported: one was due to respiratory arrest assessed as unrelated to Zolgensma by both the investigator and Novartis, and one report could not be substantiated by the site investigator. Newborn screening findings Twenty-eight patients were identified via newborn/prenatal screening, and 56 patients were clinically diagnosed.For newborn screening/prenatally identified patients compared with clinically diagnosed patients: Mean age at diagnosis was 0.8 versus 3.5 months;Mean age at first treatment was 1.7 versus 4.4 months; and,Mean time from diagnosis to treatment was 0.9 in both groups. Forty (71 percent) clinically diagnosed patients received more than one SMA disease-modifying therapy compared with eight (29 percent) patients identified by newborn screening.Of those with two or more CHOP INTEND assessments available, 15 of 22 patients (68 percent) clinically diagnosed and eight of nine patients (89 percent) identified by newborn screening achieved clinically meaningful CHOP INTEND increases of ≥4 points between first and last assessments. About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is the only gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and the only SMA treatment designed to directly address the genetic root cause of the disease by replacing the function of the missing or non-working SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma represents the first approved therapeutic in Novartis Gene Therapies’ proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. Zolgensma was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 and subsequently has been approved in 38 countries. To date, more than 1,000 patients have been treated with Zolgensma across clinical trials, managed access programs, and in the commercial setting2. Novartis Gene Therapies has an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children's Hospital to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of AAV9 gene therapy for the treatment of all types of SMA; has an exclusive, worldwide license from REGENXBIO for any recombinant AAV vector in its intellectual property portfolio for the in vivo gene therapy treatment of SMA in humans; an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Généthon for in vivo delivery of AAV9 vector into the central nervous system for the treatment of SMA; and a non-exclusive, worldwide license agreement with AskBio for the use of its self-complementary DNA technology for the treatment of SMA. About Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death.4,5 If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.1 SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.4 It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.6 This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities.7 More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.8 About Novartis Gene Therapies Novartis Gene Therapies (formerly AveXis) is reimagining medicine to transform the lives of people living with rare genetic diseases. Utilizing cutting-edge technology, we are working to turn promising gene therapies into proven treatments, beginning with our transformative gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

2021-03-23,"Novartis' experimental Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy has improved the survival of prostate cancer patients with a hard-to-treat form of the disease, the Swiss drugmaker said on Tuesday.  The therapy, which Novartis bought with its $2.1 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker Endocyte in 2018, arms a molecule, or ligand, with a cancer-killing radioactive isotope.  Novartis said the therapy had significantly improved overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",UPDATE 1-Novartis says radioligand therapy improves prostate cancer survival
2021-03-23,"Phase III VISION study with 177Lu-PSMA-617 met both primary endpoints, significantly improving overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer1 VISION trial findings to be presented at upcoming medical meeting, with regulatory submissions in the US and EU anticipated in 2021 Novartis is committed to reimagining prostate cancer through targeted radioligand therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617 More than 15 dedicated early to late development and research programs underway to identify the next wave of radioligand therapies for cancer Basel, March, 23, 2021 — Novartis today reported the first interpretable results of the Phase III VISION study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617, a targeted radioligand therapy in patients with progressive PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) compared to best standard of care alone. The trial met both primary endpoints of overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival1, helping to move closer the ambition of becoming the targeted treatment for >80% of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The safety profile was consistent with data reported in previous clinical studies1. Results from the VISION trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and included in US and EU regulatory submissions. “Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have a less than 1 in 6 chance of surviving 5 years2 and need new treatment options. These groundbreaking data confirm our belief in the potential of 177Lu-PSMA-617 to reimagine outcomes for these patients through phenotypic precision medicine. We intend to submit these data to regulatory authorities as soon as possible,” said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “We would like to thank the patients who volunteered to participate in this study as well as the clinical teams at each of the trial sites. We would not be able to realize our commitment to reimagining medicine without the partnership of patients and their families.” Radioligand therapy combines a targeting compound that binds to markers expressed by tumors and a radioactive isotope, causing DNA damage that inhibits tumor growth and replication. This therapeutic approach enables targeted delivery of radiation to the tumor, while limiting damage to the surrounding normal tissue. Novartis has established global expertise and specialized supply chain and manufacturing capabilities across its network of four radioligand therapy production sites, and is further increasing capacity to ensure delivery of radioligand therapies like 177Lu-PSMA-617 to patients in need. Novartis is the only pharmaceutical company which is pursuing four different cancer treatment platforms. These include radioligand therapy, cell and gene therapy, and targeted therapy and immunotherapy, with an opportunity to combine these platforms for the best outcomes for each cancer patient. About Advanced Prostate CancerProstate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate gland, a small walnut shaped gland in the pelvis of men. In castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the tumor shows signs of growth, such as rising Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, despite the use of hormone treatments that lower testosterone3. In metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), the tumor spreads to other parts of the body, such as neighboring organs or bones and remains unresponsive to hormone treatment4. The five-year survival rate for patients with mCRPC is approximately 15%2. About Phenotypic Precision Medicine in Advanced Prostate CancerDespite advances in prostate cancer care, there is a high unmet need for new targeted treatment options to improve outcomes for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. More than 80% of prostate cancer tumors highly express a phenotypic biomarker5 called Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)4,6-9, making it a promising diagnostic (through positron emission tomography (PET) scan imaging) and therapeutic target for radioligand therapy6. About 177Lu-PSMA-617177Lu-PSMA-617 is an investigational PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It is a type of precision cancer treatment combining a targeting compound (ligand) with a therapeutic radioisotope (a radioactive particle)10-12. After administration into the bloodstream, 177Lu-PSMA-617 binds to prostate cancer cells that express PSMA13, a transmembrane protein, with high tumor-to-normal tissue uptake10,14,15. Once bound, emissions from the radioisotope damage tumor cells, disrupting their ability to replicate and/or triggering cell death. The radiation from the radioisotope works over very short distances to limit damage to surrounding cells14,16. About VISIONVISION is an international, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III study to assess the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq administered by i.v. infusion every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles) plus investigator-chosen best standard of care in the investigational arm, versus best standard of care in the control arm17. Patients with PSMA PET-scan positive mCRPC, and progression after prior taxane and androgen receptor-directed therapy (ARDT), were randomized in a 2:1 ratio in favor of the investigational arm. The alternate primary endpoints were rPFS and OS. The study enrolled 831 patients1.

2021-03-23,"Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) says that its Phase 3 VISION study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 hit both co-primary endpoints on overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival for prostate cancer patients. Details were not disclosed. Investigators tried to treat progressive PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, comparing it against the standard of care. The VISION trial results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and included in U.S. and E.U. regulatory submissions. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is an investigational PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy, a type of precision cancer treatment combining a targeting compound (ligand) with a therapeutic radioisotope. After administration into the bloodstream, 177Lu-PSMA-617 binds to prostate cancer cells that express PSMA, a transmembrane protein, with high tumor-to-normal tissue uptake. Once bound, emissions from the radioisotope damage tumor cells, disrupting their ability to replicate and triggering cell death.

2021-03-30,"Expands Novartis Oncology radioligand pipeline with exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize therapeutic applications for a library of FAP assets including FAPI-46 and FAPI-74Broad expression of FAP demonstrated in tumors or in tumor stroma across many solid tumors1,2,3Novartis Oncology continues to reimagine cancer care through development of robust radioligand therapy portfolio Basel, March 30, 2021 — Novartis has obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize therapeutic applications for a library of Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) targeting agents including FAPI-46 and FAPI-74, through an assignment agreement with iTheranostics, Inc., an affiliate of SOFIE Biosciences, Inc. The FAP assets were originally developed at the University of Heidelberg. The agreement also includes co-exclusive rights for Novartis to develop imaging applications for these assets. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell-surface protein expressed at low levels in most normal adult tissues, but over-expressed in common cancers, particularly on cancer-associated fibroblasts that form the tumor stroma, which is essential for growth1,2,3,4. High FAP expression on cancer-associated fibroblasts is generally associated with worse prognosis in solid tumors due to promotion of tumorigenesis and progression4,5,6,7. “We continue to invest in radioligand therapy as one of the four unique platforms of Novartis Oncology. We believe working across multiple approaches is the key to reimagining cancer care,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “FAP is an exciting target and these agents are a great fit with our radioligand therapy pipeline, which we are actively investigating across multiple tumor types. We believe this technology has the potential to transform many patients’ lives.” Targeted radioligand therapy is a type of precision medicine combining two key elements: a targeting compound, or ligand, and a radioactive isotope, causing DNA damage that inhibits tumor growth and replication. These targeted drugs bind to markers or proteins over-expressed by certain tumors, or tumor-associated tissue, such as stroma. Due to the high-affinity of these agents for specific tumor cells or associated tumor tissue, surrounding healthy tissue is less affected.

2021-04-07,"Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) has struck a deal with UK-based Artios Pharma to access DNA damage response (DDR) targets that can potentially enhance its radioligand therapies. Artios is set to get $20 million upfront and up to $1.3 billion in milestones in return for the targets. During the three-year collaboration, Artios and Novartis will discover and validate up to three targets for exclusive worldwide use by Novartis. The goal is to find targets that add to the potential of Novartis’ radioligand therapies. Last month, Novartis announced a Phase 3 win for its lead radioligand in prostate cancer study. Artios’ work targets synthetic lethality in DDR, effectively shutting down tumor cells’ ability to heal themselves after being damaged. The Novartis pact is the second major discovery deal for Artios after the company agreed in December to work with Merck KGaA (OTCMKTS: MKGAF) on small-molecule drugs targeting DNA repair enzymes — a deal that brought $30 million upfront and the potential for $860 million in milestone payments.

2021-04-27,"Tucked in its Q1 earnings release, Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) has scrapped its plans to seek approval for mirikizumab in psoriasis. The company decided not to enter the market despite the anti-IL-23p19 antibody outperforming Novartis AG’s (NYSE: NVS) Cosentyx in a Phase 3 trial last year. AbbVie Inc’s (NYSE: ABBV) anti-IL-23 antibody Skyrizi and Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE: JNJ) Tremfya and Stelara, which hits IL-12 and IL-23, are already approved in plaque psoriasis. Despite being behind the already approved anti-IL-23 drugs, Lilly moved mirikizumab into a Phase 3 program that included three psoriasis studies, including a long-term study. “We look forward to bringing mirikizumab to market to provide patients with an additional treatment option that has the potential to provide near-complete or complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 90 and PASI 100, with sustained results at 52 weeks,” Lilly USA president Patrik Jonsson noted when data were announced. The company said it would no longer submit mirikizumab for approval in psoriasis in any geography. The decision leaves mirikizumab development focused on ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Last month, Lilly showed mirikizumab improved clinical remission in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had been failed by conventional or biologic therapies. The company posted weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings and cut its forecast for full-year adjusted profit due to lower demand for its COVID-19 drugs. Price Action: LLY shares down 2.22% at $183.07 in the market trading session the last check Tuesday.

Vas Narasimhan, Novartis chief executive, said there was still a backlog of delayed diagnoses, particularly in breast cancer, even though demand in many other areas of healthcare was returning to normal levels.  Diagnoses have fallen as healthcare systems are stretched by Covid-19 and some patients are reluctant to visit doctors for screenings.",Novartis warns of pandemic delay in cancer diagnoses

We continue to take strong actions to help address the pandemic. Our primary concerns remain the health and safety of our associates and patients. There continues to be COVID-19 related lockdowns and disruptions in several geographies negatively impacting demand, particularly: dermatology, ophthalmology, the breast cancer portfolio, Sandoz Retail and Anti-Infectives. For Sandoz, COVID-19 resulted in a historically weak cough and cold season and softened retail demand. At present, drug development operations are continuing with manageable disruptions (see the Innovation Review Section of the Condensed Interim Financial Report for further information), with our range of digital technologies allowing us to proactively manage our clinical trials portfolio and rapidly mitigate any disruptions. Our operations remain stable and cash collections continue to be according to our normal trade terms, with days sales outstanding at normal levels. Novartis remains well positioned to meet its ongoing financial obligations and has sufficient liquidity to support normal business activities. Novartis is collaborating with Molecular Partners to develop, manufacture and commercialize two antiviral DARPin® candidates, ensovibep (MP0420) and MP0423. These are designed to target multiple different sites on the SARS-CoV-2 virus simultaneously for enhanced antiviral effects and potential use as both prophylactics and treatments. Furthermore, Novartis joined industry-wide efforts to meet global demand for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. An initial agreement was signed to leverage Novartis manufacturing capacity and capabilities to support the production of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Comirnaty™), with production planned to start in the second quarter of 2021. Novartis also signed an initial agreement to manufacture the mRNA and bulk drug product for the vaccine candidate CVnCoV from CureVac, with plans to produce up to 50 million doses in 2021 and up to a further 200 million doses in 2022. Financials First quarter Net sales were USD 12.4 billion (+1%, -2% cc) in the first quarter driven by volume growth of 3 percentage points, price erosion of 2 percentage points and negative impact from generic competition of 3 percentage points. Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, we estimate first quarter net sales grew +1% (cc, +4% USD). Operating income was USD 2.4 billion (-12%, -14% cc) mainly due to lower gross profit impacted by pricing erosion at Sandoz, manufacturing restructuring, higher impairments, partly offset by lower legal expenses. Net income was USD 2.1 billion (-5%, -7% cc) mainly due to lower operating income. EPS was USD 0.91 (-5%, -6% cc), declining less than net income, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. Core operating income was USD 4.0 billion (-5%, -8% cc) mainly due to Sandoz (-35% cc). Core operating income margin was 31.9% of net sales, decreasing by 2.1 percentage points (-1.8 percentage points cc). Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, we estimate core operating income declined -1% (cc, +2% USD). Core net income was USD 3.4 billion (-4%, -6% cc) mainly driven by the decline in core operating income. Core EPS was USD 1.52 (-3%, -5% cc), declining less than core net income, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. Cash flows from operating activities amounted to USD 2.1 billion. Free cash flow amounted to USD 1.6 billion (-21%) compared to USD 2.0 billion in the prior year quarter. This decline was mainly due to the USD 650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from BeiGene and lower operating income adjusted for non-cash items, partly offset by favorable changes in working capital. Innovative Medicines net sales were USD 10.1 billion (+4%, 0% cc) with volume contributing 4 percentage points. Generic competition had a negative impact of 4 percentage points. Net pricing had a negligible impact on sales growth. Pharmaceuticals BU sales were in line (0% cc) with continued strong growth from Entresto (+34% cc), Zolgensma (+81% cc) and Cosentyx (+11% cc). Growth was offset by declines in Established Medicines and mature Ophthalmology brands. Oncology BU sales grew 1% (cc) driven by Kymriah (+55% cc), Promacta/Revolade (+13% cc), Kisqali (+19% cc) and Jakavi (+8% cc), partly offset by generic competition, mainly for Glivec, Afinitor and Exjade. Innovative Medicines sales were affected by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (mainly in dermatology, ophthalmology and breast cancer portfolio) and prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing. Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, we estimate Innovative Medicines first quarter net sales grew +3% (cc, +7% USD). Sandoz net sales were USD 2.3 billion (-9%, -13% cc) with a negative price effect of 10 percentage points mainly due to increasing competition and prior year benefit from off-contract sales. Volume declined 3 percentage points from the impact of COVID-19 on prior year forward purchasing and softened retail demand, with a historically weak cough and cold season, partly offset by growth in Biopharmaceuticals. Excluding prior year COVID-19 related forward purchasing, we estimate first quarter net sales declined -9% (cc, -5% USD). First quarter key growth drivers Underpinning our financial results in the quarter is a continued focus on key growth drivers including: Entresto(USD 789 million, +34% cc) sustained strong growth with increased patient share across markets, driven by demand as the essential first choice therapy for heart failure patientsZolgensma (USD 319 million, +81% cc) had a strong quarter with growth driven by Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, as well as ongoing geographic expansionCosentyx(USD 1.1 billion, +11% cc) saw continued growth across indications despite access changes in the US and COVID-19 negatively impacting new patient startsKymriah (USD 151 million, +55% cc) grew strongly across all regions. Coverage continued to expand, with more than 300 qualified treatment centers in 28 countries Promacta/Revolade(USD 463 million, +13% cc) grew across all regions, driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line for severe aplastic anemia in the USKesimpta(USD 50 million) driven by launch uptake and faster than expected conversion from free to paid scripts, resulting in a USD 9 million revenue adjustment relating to Q4 2020Ilaris(USD 256 million, +20% cc) driven by double-digit volume growth across all regionsKisqali(USD 195 million, +19% cc) continued to see solid growth in Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, benefiting from the ongoing impact of positive overall survival dataJakavi(USD 363 million, +8% cc) growth in most markets was driven by strong demand in the myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera indicationsMayzent(USD 55 million, +80% cc) continued to grow, driven by fulfilling an important unmet need in patients with MS showing signs of progressionAdakveo(USD 37 million, +148% cc) US launch continued to progress well, with approximately 800 accounts purchasing Adakveo to dateXiidra(USD 108 million, +20% cc) grew TRx share in the US during the quarter driven by an increase in demand due to brand awareness among diagnosed patientsTafinlar + Mekinist(USD 393 million, +4% cc) saw continued demand in adjuvant melanoma and NSCLC; growth was at a slower pace reflecting the ongoing impact of COVID-19 Xolair(USD 335 million, +3% cc) continued growth, mainly driven by the chronic spontaneous urticaria indicationBiopharmaceuticals(USD 511 million, +7% cc) growth was driven by sales in EuropeEmerging Growth Markets*Overall, sales grew 3% (cc), with strong growth in China (+11% cc) to USD 744 million *All markets except US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand Net sales of the top 20 Innovative Medicines products in 2021 Q1 2021 % change USD mUSDccCosentyx1 0531311Entresto 7893934Gilenya 707-8-11Lucentis 545124Tasigna 51563Promacta/Revolade 4631513Tafinlar + Mekinist 39374Jakavi 363148Sandostatin 358-4-5Xolair 33593Zolgensma 3198881Gleevec/Glivec 272-17-20Galvus Group 262-22-24Ilaris 2562020Afinitor/Votubia 254-14-16Exforge Group 254-2-6Diovan Group 214-22-24Kisqali 1952119Exjade/Jadenu 153-11-16Kymriah 1516255Top 20 products total7 85174 R&D update - key developments from the first quarter New approvals Entresto The FDA approved an expanded indication in chronic heart failure patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal, based on evidence from PARAGON-HF and other trials, making Entresto the first therapy indicated for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and the majority of patients diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)Kesimpta Received EMA approval for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS).

The canakinumab development program continues, with two Ph3 non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials ongoing in first-line and adjuvant settingTislelizumabSuccessfully closed the in-licensing of tislelizumab from BeiGene for development and commercialization in North America, Europe and Japan. In January, BeiGene announced positive topline results for a Ph3 trial in patients with previously treated advanced unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In April, data from the Ph3 RATIONALE 303 trial was presented, in patients with pre-treated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The study achieved its primary endpoint, with tislelizumab significantly prolonging overall survival in all patients, regardless of PD-L1 statusEntrestoWhile numerical trends consistently favored Entresto in a head to head comparison with ramipril, a current standard of care, the Ph3 PARADISE-MI study did not meet its primary composite endpoint of reducing risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure events after an acute myocardial infarction. The safety profile of Entresto was confirmed. Novartis will continue to evaluate the data. Topline results will be presented at the American College of Cardiology 70th Annual Scientific SessionCosentyxPh3 study met its primary endpoint in pediatric patients with juvenile psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis – two subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Cosentyx showed significantly longer time to flare (worsening of symptoms) compared to placebo. Sustained efficacy was also demonstrated, with more patients achieving and maintaining ACR Pedi 30 and ACR Pedi 70 responses from Week 12 to Week 104 with Cosentyx compared to placeboZolgensma Data presented at the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association and American Academy of Neurology conferences demonstrated age-appropriate development when used early (SPR1NT), real-world benefit in older children ≥6 months of age (RESTORE) and durability in children with SMA now up to six years old and more than five years post-treatment (two long-term follow-up studies) Capital structure and net debt Retaining a good balance between investment in the business, a strong capital structure and attractive shareholder returns remains a priority. In Q1 2021, Novartis repurchased a total of 19.6 million shares for USD 1.8 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line under the up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback announced in November 2020. With these transactions, this share buyback has been completed with a total of 27.6 million shares repurchased for USD 2.5 billion. In addition, 1.4 million shares (for an equity value of USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from associates. In the same period, 9.3 million shares (for an equity value of USD 0.2 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of associates. Novartis aims to offset the dilutive impact from equity based participation plans of associates over the remainder of the year. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 11.7 million versus December 31, 2020. These treasury share transactions resulted in an equity decrease of USD 1.7 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 1.9 billion. In Q1 2021, Novartis repaid a EUR 1.25 billion, zero coupon bond issued in March 2017 at maturity. As of March 31, 2021, the net debt increased to USD 31.8 billion compared to USD 24.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly driven by the USD 7.4 billion annual dividend payment and net cash outflow for treasury share transactions of USD 1.9 billion, partially offset by USD 1.6 billion free cash flow in Q1 2021. The Group has not experienced liquidity or cash flow disruptions during Q1 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are confident that Novartis is well positioned to meet its ongoing financial obligations and has sufficient liquidity to support its normal business activities. As of Q1 2021, the long-term credit rating for the company is A1 with Moody’s Investors Service and AA- with S&P Global Ratings. ESG update ESG momentum continues with increasing recognition by third party rating agencies. We retained our Sustainalytics No.1 ranking, improving our ‘risk score’ from ‘medium’ to ‘low’, as well as our Access to Medicines Index No.2 ranking. Novartis recently joined global initiatives (EV100 and RE100) bringing together businesses committed to environmental sustainability. In addition, we are proud to be recognized for the steps we have taken on diversity and inclusion by the recent Bloomberg Gender-Equality index. 2021 outlook Barring unforeseen events Net salesExpected to grow low to mid single digit (cc)From a divisional perspective, we expect net sales performance (cc) in 2021 to be as follows: Innovative Medicines: expected to grow mid single digitSandoz: expected to decline low to mid single digit (revised from broadly in line) Core operating incomeExpected to grow mid single digit, ahead of sales (cc) Innovative Medicines: expected to grow mid to high single digit, ahead of salesSandoz: expected to decline low to mid teens Our guidance assumes that we see a return to normal global healthcare systems including prescription dynamics by mid 2021. In addition, we assume that no Gilenya and no Sandostatin LAR generics enter in 2021 in the US. Foreign exchange impactIf late-April exchange rates prevail for the remainder of 2021, the foreign exchange impact for the year would be positive 2 to 3 percentage points on net sales and positive 3 percentage points on core operating income.

Both studies met their primary endpoints of non-inferiority in change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline for Beovu 6 mg versus aflibercept 2 mg at year one1. In KESTREL, patients on Beovu 6 mg gained a mean of 9.2 letters versus 10.5 letters for patients on aflibercept 2 mg1. In KITE, patients on Beovu 6 mg gained a mean of 10.6 letters versus 9.4 letters for patients on aflibercept 2 mg1. These results will be presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2021 Annual Meeting. In pre-specified secondary endpoints, fewer eyes treated with Beovu had intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid (IRF/SRF) at week 32 (first assessment of disease activity) and week 52 versus eyes treated with aflibercept1. More eyes treated with Beovu 6 mg than eyes treated with aflibercept achieved central subfield thickness (CSFT) levels below 280 μm at weeks 32 and 521. Fluid is a key marker of disease activity in DME and CSFT is a key indicator of fluid in the retina1. “Treatment for diabetic macular edema is a high unmet medical need in the US and globally. Our goal as physicians is to work on preventing blindness for the significant proportion of diabetics affected by this condition,” said David M Brown MD FACS, Director of Clinical Research at the Retina Consultants of Texas and principal investigator of the KESTREL clinical trial. “DME patients often struggle with adherence due to the need to manage multiple comorbidities related to diabetes. The KESTREL and KITE clinical trials - the first pivotal trials to examine a longer dosing interval in the loading phase - confirm Beovu’s potential to be an important therapy for these patients.” To study its potential in reducing treatment burden, Beovu was given at six-week dosing intervals during the loading phase versus aflibercept, which was given at the standard four-week dosing intervals, in line with its label1,2. Following the loading phase, over half of patients in the Beovu 6 mg arm (55.1% in KESTREL and 50.3% in KITE) remained on a three-month dosing interval through year one, based on a treatment approach determined by disease activity assessment1. If disease activity was detected, Beovu 6 mg patients were switched to two-month intervals through the end of the trial1. All aflibercept patients were on a two-month interval after the loading phase1. “We are pleased to share these data, which underscore Beovu’s potential to address an unmet need in the DME landscape,” said Jill Hopkins, Global Development Unit Head, Ophthalmology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “With these data demonstrating vision gains, fluid resolution and the potential for less frequent injections for eligible patients, we are one step closer to providing DME patients with a potential new treatment option.” The Phase III KESTREL and KITE studies enrolled a total of 926 patients in 36 countries. Beovu 6 mg is the commercialized dose in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD)3. The brolucizumab 3 mg arm, which was only included in KESTREL, did not meet the primary endpoint1. Beovu was overall well-tolerated in KESTREL and KITE1. The most common ocular and non-ocular adverse events (≥5%) in KESTREL and KITE were conjunctival hemorrhage, nasopharyngitis and hypertension4. IOI rates in KESTREL were 4.7% for brolucizumab 3 mg (including 1.6% retinal vasculitis), 3.7% for Beovu 6 mg (including 0.5% retinal vasculitis), and 0.5% for aflibercept 2 mg1. IOI rates in KITE were equivalent (1.7%) between the Beovu 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg arms with no retinal vasculitis reported1. Retinal vascular occlusion was reported in KESTREL for brolucizumab 3 mg (1.1%) and 6 mg (0.5%), and in KITE for brolucizumab and aflibercept (0.6% each)1. The majority of these events were manageable and resolved with or without treatment1. Novartis is committed to bringing Beovu 6 mg to market for DME patients, subject to regulatory approvals, and will be submitting these one-year data from the KESTREL and KITE trials to global health authorities in H1 2021. Novartis anticipates two-year results from KESTREL and KITE later in 2021. About Diabetic Macular EdemaDiabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of blindness in adults in developed countries, affecting 12% of people with type 1 diabetes and 28% of those with type 2 diabetes5. Consistently high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage small blood vessels in the eye, causing them to leak fluid6. This damage leads to an excess of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)5,6. VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of blood vessels5,6. At elevated levels in DME, VEGF stimulates the growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels5,6. The resulting accumulation of fluid (known as edema) in the macula can lead to vision loss5,6. The macula is the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision6. Early symptoms of DME include blurry or wavy central vision and distorted color perception, although the disease can also progress without symptoms at early stages6,7. About Beovu (brolucizumab)Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in more than 60 countries, including in the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada and Australia3,8-11. Additional trials, which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with wet AMD, DME, retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), are currently ongoing.

2021-05-03,"Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) has reported that its Beovu (brolucizumab) drug met primary endpoints in Phase 3 KESTREL and KITE trials conducted in diabetic macular edema (DME) patients. According to one-year data, 6mg Beovu showed non-inferiority in change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline compared to 2mg Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's (NASDAQ: REGN) Eylea (aflibercept). In the KESTREL study, patients in the Beovu arm demonstrated a mean of 9.2 letters against 10.5 letters for those on aflibercept. Meanwhile, in the KITE trial, Beovu showed a mean of 10.6 letters compared to 9.4 letters with aflibercept. For secondary endpoints, data revealed intraretinal and subretinal fluid at weeks 32 and 52 in fewer eyes treated with Beovu versus those on aflibercept. The company added that central subfield thickness (CSFT) levels below 280μm were found at weeks 32 and 52 in more eyes treated with Beovu versus eyes treated with aflibercept. Fluid is considered a vital disease activity marker in DME, while CSFT is a crucial fluid marker in the retina. Novartis said that these trial data might enable fewer injections of Beovu. Results showed Beovu was overall well-tolerated in both trials. The most common ocular and non-ocular adverse events reported were conjunctival hemorrhage, nasopharyngitis, and hypertension. Novartis plans to submit these one-year results to regulatory authorities in the first half of this year. Two-year results from KESTREL and KITE are expected to be available later this year.

2021-05-03,"Sandoz to begin enrolling patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration in MYLIGHT Phase lll confirmatory efficacy and safety study1Neovascular age-related macular degeneration accounts for 10% of age-related macular degeneration cases, but is responsible for 90% of AMD-related blindness2With eight marketed biosimilar medicines globally and 15+ molecules in pipeline, Sandoz is investing in future of biosimilars for patients and healthcare systems Holzkirchen, May 3, 2021 – Sandoz, a Novartis division, today announced progress in the late-stage clinical development program for its proposed biosimilar aflibercept. Sandoz will begin enrolling the first patient in MYLIGHT, a clinical Phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety study, shortly1. Aflibercept is indicated to improve visual acuity in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular oedema, macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, and other specific neovascular retinal diseases3. “nAMD accounts for 10% of all age-related macular degeneration cases, but is responsible for 90% of AMD-related blindness2,” said Florian Bieber, Global Head of Biopharmaceuticals Development, Sandoz. “Aflibercept is a key treatment in ophthalmology. The initiation of this study marks an important milestone in the development of our biosimilar aflibercept. As with all our biosimilar programs, we aim to expand access to high-quality, more affordable biologics.” MYLIGHT is part of a comprehensive biosimilar development program including analytical, preclinical and clinical data. The study aims to confirm that the proposed biosimilar has equivalent efficacy and comparable safety to the reference medicine* in patients with nAMD1. Sandoz biosimilars help patients to access advanced biologic medicines more sustainably and affordably. The Sandoz division has a leading global portfolio with eight marketed biosimilars and a further 15-plus in various stages of development. The Sandoz biosimilar pipeline is a blend of in-house development and collaborations, both for co-development and commercialization, targeting key biologics in oncology, immunology, endocrinology and underserved complex disease areas. About aflibercept Aflibercept binds and inhibits ocular VEGF-A, and prevents abnormal growth of blood vessels in the choroid which impact visual function. It improves visual acuity in patients with neovascular retinal diseases like nAMD, Diabetic macular edema (DME), and Retinal vein occlusion (RVO). About MYLIGHT The MYLIGHT is a randomized, double-blind, parallel 2-arm study, which is projected to include 460 patients across 20 countries. The MYLIGHT study will be conducted in neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration as this is an adequately sensitive indication and representative of many patients who are treated with the medicine.1 nAMD patients will be randomized to receive either biosimilar aflibercept or the reference medicine for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is the mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score from baseline to week 8, using a standard test chart (EDTRS). The global development program for Sandoz’ biosimilar aflibercept was developed in consultation with major regulatory agencies and the results from this clinical study are expected to support regulatory submissions. *Eylea® is a trademark of Bayer AG and in the US of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The justices turned away Novartis subsidiary Sandoz Inc's appeal of a lower court decision that upheld the validity of the patents.

2021-05-17,"Decision not to review Federal Circuit July 2020 ruling continues to prevent Sandoz launch of more affordable Erelzi treatment option for US patients Sandoz is disappointed US patients affected by chronic autoimmune and inflammatory disease have to wait until 2029 for availability of biosimilar ErelziSandoz remains committed to pioneering access for patients and contributing to more sustainable healthcare by launching biosimilar and generic medicines Basel, Switzerland, May 17, 2021 – Sandoz, a global leader in biosimilar and generic medicines, today announced that the US Supreme Court has denied its petition to review the Federal Circuit’s July 2020 decision concerning the Sandoz biosimilar Erelzi® (etanercept-szzs) for reference medicine Enbrel®* (etanercept). The Federal Circuit previously ruled against Sandoz in a divided decision upholding Amgen’s patents.“We are disappointed the Supreme Court decided not to review our case,” said Keren Haruvi, President of Sandoz US and Head of North America. “Today’s decision means Erelzi, a more affordable biosimilar, will not be available to US patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases until 2029; nonetheless we remain committed to providing important treatment options for patients affected by these diseases.”With the trend towards increased spending on specialty medicines only expected to grow,1 biosimilars play an important role in enabling more patients to access biologic medicines and may offer significant savings for patients, helping to alleviate the overburdened healthcare system.2,3 Estimates suggest that a biosimilar etanercept could have saved the US healthcare system around USD one billion per year.4Sandoz was the first company to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a biosimilar etanercept and the first to launch a biosimilar medicine in the US. Erelzi has been approved in the US for more than four years, since August 2016, however Sandoz has been unable to launch this medicine in the US due to the patent litigation.About biosimilarsA biosimilar is a successor to a biological medicine (known as the “reference medicine”) for which the patent has expired and exclusivity has been lost. Biosimilars have been shown to have equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity. Therefore, physicians and patients can expect the same clinical outcome.About Erelzi®Erelzi is the Sandoz biosimilar of the reference medicine Enbrel®. Erelzi has been studied in a global development program, which included a comprehensive comparison of Erelzi and Enbrel® at the analytical, preclinical, and clinical levels. The program included preclinical studies, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, and the Phase III confirmatory safety and efficacy EGALITY study. Erelzi is being studied in a real world setting through COMPACT, a global non-interventional study conducted in countries such as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Erelzi is approved by the US FDA for the following indications: adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO).Erelzi® is a registered trademark of Novartis AG.Important Safety InformationPlease see full Prescribing Information for Erelzi here:https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/761042lbl.pdfDisclaimerThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2021-05-17,"Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) revealed details on Phase 3 PARADISE-MI trial evaluating Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) compared with ramipril in a contemporary acute myocardial infarction (AMI) population. Data were presented at the American College of Cardiology's virtual Scientific Session. In the Q1 earnings release, Novartis reported that Entresto missed its primary endpoint to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. In the 5,669-patient Paradise-MI trial, heart attack patients on Entresto were 10% less likely than those on ramipril to be hospitalized for heart failure, die of cardiovascular causes, or develop symptomatic heart failure. The drug needed to hit 15% for the win to be statistically significant. In the Paradise-MI trial, symptomatic heart failure diagnosis or hospitalization, or death from cardiovascular causes, cropped up in Entresto patients at a rate of 6.7 per 100 patient-years, or 11.9%. Ramipril charted a 13.2% event rate or 7.4 per 100 patient-years. An exploratory analysis of the total burden of heart failure, which included recurrent events, showed a 21% reduction in patients on Entresto versus ramipril. The rate of cardiovascular death for Entresto patients was 5.9% versus ramipril's 6.7%. There was a 6% rate of heart failure hospitalizations in the Entresto arm, versus 6.9% in the ACE inhibitor cohort. 1.4% of Entresto patients developed outpatient heart failure compared to 2% in subjects who received ramipril.

2021-05-17,"The Supreme Court turned away a petition from Sandoz seeking to challenge two Amgen Inc (NASDAQ: AMGN) patents related to rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, thus blocking Novartis AG’s (NYSE: NVS) Sandoz from selling a biosimilar of the drug in the U.S. until 2029. The justices turned away Novartis subsidiary Sandoz Inc’s appeal of a lower court decision that upheld the validity of the patents. The case involves the active ingredient in Enbrel. Enbrel is Amgen’s top-selling drug, accounting for nearly $5 billion of the company’s $24.2 billion in product sales for 2020. Enbrel was launched in 1998 by Immunex Corp, which Amgen acquired in 2002. Erelzi is available in Europe, where it helped contribute to a 20% increase in revenue sales for the Sandoz unit last year, Novartis said in its annual report. Sandoz got regulatory approval in 2016 to sell biosimilar dubbed Erelzi, Immunex sued for patent infringement. “Today’s decision means Erelzi, a more affordable biosimilar, will not be available to U.S. patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases until 2029,” Keren Haruvi, president of Sandoz US, said in a statement. Amgen said it was pleased the Supreme Court denied Sandoz’s petition, “finally bringing this dispute to an end.” Price Action: AMGN shares closed 0.40% higher at $252.38, and NVS shares closed 0.46% lower at $88.55 on Monday.

2021-05-18,"Sandoz to invest €150 million in new antibiotics manufacturing technology in Europe over next three to five years, to be optimally prepared for future needsKundl, Austria further strengthens production for oral antibiotics while facility in Palafolls, Spain expands for sterile active pharmaceutical ingredientsInvestment affirms long-term confidence in antibiotics strategy, delivering and building on published plans for European-based manufacturing network Basel, May 18, 2021 — Sandoz, a Novartis division, today announces plans to further strengthen its European antibiotics manufacturing network by further expanding production capabilities in Kundl, Austria and in Palafolls, Spain. By modernizing and simplifying its manufacturing setup, Sandoz will improve its ability to consistently deliver high-quality medicines to patients, while remaining cost-competitive on the global market. In line with plans announced with the Austrian government in July 2020, Sandoz confirms that in a first step it will proceed to invest more than €100 million to introduce new manufacturing technology for the production of oral amoxicillin, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for its leading penicillin product. This investment will allow Sandoz to leverage its position in Kundl as the hub and center of the only major end-to-end antibiotics supply chain in Europe, covering all production steps from API to Finished Dosage Forms (FDF) for many leading antibiotics. In addition to the investment in Kundl, Sandoz announces plans for an expansion of its Palafolls site in Spain, planning to invest around €50 million in new production technology and increased capacity for the production of sterile penicillin APIs and sterile API mixtures. As part of this network modernization plan, Sandoz will phase out the current production of oral APIs at the Les Franqueses site in Spain, which it plans to close in 2024. Sterile API production is planned to transfer from Kundl to the new facility at Palafolls in 2025. Sandoz is committed to its people and will offer full support to its associates who might be impacted. Sandoz CEO Richard Saynor said: “Antibiotics are the backbone of modern healthcare and a key strategic pillar of our business. Despite a temporary drop in demand due to the pandemic, we remain as confident as ever in the mid- to long-term prospects for this segment, which meets a significant quantity of the global disease burden. This investment, which comes shortly after we announced plans to acquire GSK’s global cephalosporin antibiotics, confirms our commitment to securing the future of our leading global business”. Giovanni Barbella, Head of Sandoz Technical Operations, said: “Our goal is to produce and supply high-quality antibiotics at a cost-competitive price to patients around the world. The important investments announced today will enable our world-class manufacturing network in Europe to meet future requirements”. Sandoz is the global leader in generic antibiotics and operates the only vertically-integrated antibiotic network left in Europe, despite fierce competition from Asia.

2021-05-27,"Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) along with Molecular Partners AG (OTC: MLLCF) is kicking off a Phase 2/3 EMPATHY study of DARPin therapeutic candidate, ensovibep (MP0420), to treat COVID-19. The program is investigating the safety and efficacy of ensovibep in patients with COVID-19, who are in the early stages of infection, to prevent worsening symptoms and hospitalization. The study will enroll 400 patients in Phase 2 to identify a dose with optimal safety and activity, with initial results anticipated in August 2021. Then Phase 3 will move ahead with an additional 1,700 patients with results anticipated in H1 2022. Pending the positive outcome, it would pave the way for Novartis to seek expedited approval via the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Initial findings from the Phase 1 trial of ensovibep found it safe and well-tolerated with no significant adverse events. Predictable exposure was seen post-administration, confirming the expected half-life of two to three weeks. Novartis paid $69 million in October 2020 to collaborate with Molecular Partners on ensovibep and MP0423. The preclinical work for MP0423 is still ongoing and led by Molecular Partners.

2021-05-27,"EMPATHY global multi-center Phase 2 - 3 study, recruiting patients with COVID-19 infection, aiming to prevent worsening symptoms and hospitalizationThe study plans to enroll 2100 patients, with 400 patients to be enrolled into Phase 2, followed by 1700 patients in Phase 3 Novartis has been granted an option from Molecular Partners to in-license global rights of ensovibep and MP0423 - DARPin® antiviral therapeutic candidates that are undergoing testing to target SARS-CoV-2 spike proteinDARPin® therapeutics well suited for a pandemic setting due to multi-specific target binding, long half-life for sustained activity and highly scalable production, compared to monoclonal antibodies Basel, May 27, 2021 — Novartis and Molecular Partners announced today the start of the clinical trial EMPATHY, a Phase 2 and 3 study, to explore the use of its novel DARPin® therapeutic candidate ensovibep (MP0420) for the treatment of COVID-19. Novartis will conduct the clinical trial program for ensovibep, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of the studies. In March 2021, Molecular Partners reported positive initial Phase 1 results in healthy volunteers. The EMPATHY clinical trial program is investigating the safety and efficacy of ensovibep in patients with COVID-19, who are in the early stages of infection, to prevent worsening symptoms and hospitalization. The study will enroll 400 patients in Phase 2 to identify a dose with optimal safety and activity, with initial results anticipated in August 2021. At that point Phase 3 will move ahead with an additional 1,700 patients with results anticipated in H1 2022. If the initial EMPATHY trial results are convincing, this would pave the way for Novartis to seek expedited approval via the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Those eligible for the EMPATHY trial are adults, over the age of 18, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and who are experiencing at least two pre-determined mild/moderate symptoms of COVID-19 within 7 days of their diagnosis. “Novartis remains unwavering in our efforts to help combat COVID-19, including our support to deliver treatment options for patients around the globe,” said Dr. Lutz Hegemann, Group Head, Corporate Affairs and Global Health, Novartis. “Today, with Molecular Partners, we’re announcing an important next step in the development of ensovibep, which holds promise to respond to breakthrough disease and new variants in the future. We are hopeful the results of this clinical trial program will provide a reliable treatment option for patients with COVID-19.” Novartis believes a multi-solution strategy is needed to overcome COVID-19, one that utilizes a range of diagnostic and therapeutic options, depending on the needs of individual patients. Every country should have access to effective medicines to treat COVID-19 and despite availability of vaccinations, there continues to be disease transmission and there is likely to continue to be breakthrough disease. “By virtue of its tri-specific design, ensovibep was built to resist viral mutations and indeed shows potent inhibition of all variants of concern to date, with the potential to maintain activity also for future variants. This type of broad spectrum activity is essential for any treatment of relevance for patients with COVID-19,” said Patrick Amstutz, Chief Executive Officer, Molecular Partners. “Reaching this important clinical milestone is not only a key step to combat this virus, but also validating our DARPin approach to generate multispecific antiviral therapies in the fight against global pandemics.” Initial findings from the Phase 1 trial of ensovibep showed it to be safe and well tolerated with no significant adverse events. Predictable exposure was seen post-administration, confirming the expected half-life of two to three weeks. These data confirmed the systemic administration of a multi-specific DARPin antiviral therapy to be safe and well tolerated and support plans for additional clinical work in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, as part of the EMPATHY trial. The preclinical work for MP0423 is still ongoing and is being led by Molecular Partners. Sustained binding against new variants of Covid-19Molecular Partners, in collaboration with academic and government partners, has conducted in vitro experiments using pseudovirion models of SARS-CoV-2 to analyze for infectivity in the presence of ensovibep. These models represent new variants first identified in UK (B1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1), California (B.1.429), New York (B.1.526), emerging variants R.1 and A.23.1, the individual key mutations of the variants identified in India, B.1.617 and B.1.618, and other key spike mutations identified to date. The results suggest ensovibep continues to retain full potency against the new viral variants of SARS-CoV-2, and could have the potential for sustained binding to additional COVID-19 variants, as they may appear in the future. Ensovibep enrollment in ACTIV-3 trialMolecular Partners and Novartis also recently announced the inclusion of ensovibep in the NIH-Sponsored ACTIV-3 Trial (National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) program) that aims to prioritize and push forward development of the most promising COVID-19 therapies. ACTIV-3 is a global Phase 3 trial that will investigate the safety and efficacy of ensovibep in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, with an aim to enroll up to 1,000 patients. The first patient dose is expected to be administered in June 2021, with an interim analysis after 300 patients with mild-to-moderate disease. These patients will receive either ensovibep or a placebo. Trial participants will also receive an existing standard of care for COVID-19, including the FDA-approved antiviral remdesivir. If the treatment has a positive risk-benefit profile, the study will enroll an additional 700 patients for further testing. Ensovibep is the first non-antibody therapy assessed in ACTIV-3, supporting a different approach for COVID-19 treatment. The collaboration with Molecular PartnersNovartis is proud to be collaborating with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19, ensovibep and MP0423, with an option to in-license global rights from Molecular Partners and development responsibilities to both therapies. Novartis will also be responsible for manufacturing, distribution and commercialization of both therapies. The development program will be led by Molecular Partners until Phase 1 is complete and will be handed over to Novartis to conduct the pivotal clinical trial EMPATHY, with Phase 2 and 3 trials, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of these trials. Molecular Partners will perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423. Novartis response to the COVID-19 pandemic Novartis is making a number of contributions to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting the stability of global health systems. The company recently announced initial agreements to provide manufacturing capacity for a COVID-19 vaccination for BioNtech at its site in Stein, Switzerland and for CureVac in Kundl, Austria. In addition, Novartis has signed an initial agreement to reserve capacity and implement the technology transfer for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Roche’s Actemra/RoActemra. Novartis is committed to donating US $40 million to help communities affected by the pandemic around the world. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis has also announced this collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19. The company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop the first oral medicines for COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low-and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is available. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID8.

Beovu met MERLIN’s primary endpoint of non-inferiority in change in best corrected visual acuity from baseline and superiority on select anatomical secondary endpoints at year one versus aflibercept when given every four weeks following the loading phase1. However, given every four weeks in MERLIN, IOI including RV, and RO were reported with a higher frequency in the Beovu 6 mg every four weeks arm when compared to aflibercept 2 mg every four weeks (IOI: 9.3% vs 4.5% of which RV: 0.8% vs 0.0%; RO: 2.0% vs 0.0%.)1. The overall rate of vision loss (15 letters or more) due to all causes was 4.8% in the Beovu arm and 1.7% in the aflibercept arm1. “Although longer dosing intervals may benefit many people living with wet AMD and other retinal diseases, some are in need of monthly dosing to address persistent fluid. We initiated MERLIN and other clinical programs to explore Beovu for these patients,” said John Tsai, MD, Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “These data help inform our trials moving forward, so we can best determine how appropriate patients can benefit most from this important medicine.” Novartis evaluated all ongoing brolucizumab clinical programs assessing studies with four week dosing intervals after the loading phase. In the interest of patient safety, Novartis has decided to terminate the MERLIN study and the RAPTOR and RAVEN studies, which were assessing the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab with six initial monthly injections in retinal vein occlusion. All other relevant ongoing trial protocols will be amended to discontinue four week dosing intervals after the loading phase. Clinical trial investigators have been informed and will appropriately follow up with their patients. Physicians should not treat patients with Beovu 6 mg at intervals less than two months beyond the first three doses. Novartis has proactively communicated these data to health authorities and will pursue an update to the Beovu prescribing information globally. When used on a two- to three-month interval following the loading phase, Beovu continues to be an important and effective treatment option for appropriate patients with wet AMD2,3. Novartis remains committed to supporting the retina community with information regarding Beovu. Beovu is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation or known hypersensitivity to brolucizumab4. Further analysis of the clinical data from MERLIN is ongoing, and detailed data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to Ophthalmology and to bringing innovative treatments to patients with or at risk of developing eye conditions where there is a high unmet need. About wet AMDWet AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss and legal blindness in people over the age of 65 in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, impacting an estimated 20 million people worldwide5-7. Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision8-10. These blood vessels are fragile and leak fluid, disrupting the normal retinal architecture and ultimately causing damage to the macula8-10. Early symptoms of wet AMD include distorted vision (or metamorphopsia) and difficulties seeing objects clearly11. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential. As the disease progresses, cell damage increases, further reducing vision quality12. This progression can lead to a complete loss of central vision, leaving the patient unable to read, drive or recognize familiar faces and potentially depriving them of their independence12,13. Without treatment, vision can rapidly deteriorate14. About Beovu (brolucizumab)Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in more than 60 countries, including in the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada and Australia4,15-18. Additional trials, which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with wet AMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), are currently ongoing.
