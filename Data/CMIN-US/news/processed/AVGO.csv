2019-01-10,"Over the past several years, there have been murmurs that the world was approaching peak smartphone. After all, smartphone penetration rates are around 80% for both developed and developing economies. Total mobile phone penetration rates, four decades after their introduction, are just a few points higher at 90%. Thus, the runway for growth in the smartphone market is increasingly short.

In early 2019, those murmurs turned into full-blown screams. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) cut its guidance based on weak iPhone demand in both developed and developing economies. Fellow smartphone giant Samsung cut its guidance, too. So did essentially every smartphone supplier in the world.

This is the first time we have seen such broad and widespread weakness across the entire smartphone industry. Perhaps that means the time has come. Peak smartphone is here. That isn't great news for smartphone-related stocks. There are a handful of stocks that have risen significantly on the coattails of secular growth in the smartphone market. This growth is drying up. It will remain weaker for longer considering everyone who wants a smartphone, already has one.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 Virtual Assistants for the Future of Smart Homes 



As such, smartphone-related stocks that soared with a rising smartphone tide will struggle with a falling smartphone tide. Which stocks fall under this umbrella? Let's take a deeper look at seven stocks affected by the global smartphone slowdown.

### Apple (AAPL)

Of course, this list starts with the world's premier smartphone-maker and the very company that confirmed we might be at peak smartphone -- Apple.

The bad thing about Apple is that this company is more than half iPhone. Depending on the quarter, the iPhone has represented anywhere from ~50% to ~70% of revenues. Last quarter, that number was right around 60%. Thus, if the iPhone business is slowing (which it certainly is), then Apple's entire business will slow, too.

The good thing is that Apple has a rapidly growing non-iPhone business that will ultimately lessen the company's dependence on iPhone growth. This non-iPhone business comprises new hardware, like the Apple Watch, and software, like the App Store. Revenues in the non-iPhone business rose nearly 20% in the otherwise troubled holiday quarter.

Broadly speaking, because of its burgeoning non-iPhone businesses, Apple stock will be just fine long term, despite the fact that we may have just hit peak smartphone.

### Broadcom (AVGO)

When Apple isn't selling a ton of iPhones, that's a big deal for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). According to the company's most recent 10-K Filing, Apple represented about 25% of the company's net revenue in 2018, with presumably a majority of that revenue coming from the iPhone. Thus, if Apple's iPhone business is struggling, that means 25% of Broadcom's business is struggling, too.

Because of this, AVGO stock fell just as much as AAPL stock following Apple's shocking guidance cut. But AVGO stock trades at just 10X forward earnings. That's pretty cheap. Plus, there is still the other 75% of the business. Some of that is wrapped up into smartphones. But, most of it deals with still-healthy end markets elsewhere along the semiconductor spectrum.

Long-term, AVGO stock will be just fine. First and foremost, this is a smartphone company, so the stock will reasonably struggle in the near future as the smartphone tide falls.

### Alphabet (GOOG)

Admittedly, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is significantly less affected by the smartphone slowdown than smartphone-maker peers like Apple or Samsung. The company does have a smartphone (the Pixel), however, and the smartphone market is declining.

Pixel is presumably still a very small portion of Alphabet's revenues. Between analysts and management, however, Pixel was mentioned 12 times in last quarter's conference call. YouTube and Cloud were mentioned 30 times. Thus, Pixel is a small part of the Alphabet picture. But, not small enough to be insignificant in terms of valuation or growth prospects.

On the flip-side, Pixel growth may not be slowing with the global smartphone market. There is an argument out there that traditional smartphone innovation has been lagging, whereas Pixel innovation has actually excelled recently. That's why consumers are more excited for the new Pixel phone than any other Android phone in 2019. Thus, there's reason to believe that Pixel may actually be bucking the broader smartphone trend.

In the big picture, GOOG stock has exposure to the smartphone market, but it shouldn't fall all that much because of a global smartphone slowdown. If it does, that is an opportunity to buy the dip.

### Universal Display (OLED)

When you talk about companies that rose to the moon with the rising smartphone trend and have since crashed with a stalling out smartphone market, OLED screen-maker Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) should come to mind.

Smartphones are a cornerstone of the OLED revolution. In a nutshell, OLEDs are the next-generation of LED smart screens that are thinner, more flexible, and display deeper and more vibrant colors. One of the most common and obvious applications of OLEDs is the smartphone market. That is why the most recent generation of smartphones all have OLED displays.

But, OLED screens are also more expensive, and smartphone-makers end up passing those costs onto customers. Customers aren't a big fan of this and are expressing so with their wallets. As iPhone prices have gone up to $1,000 and up, iPhone unit volumes have stalled out. That isn't a coincidence.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



As such, to reinvigorate growth, Apple and other smartphone makers may pass on OLED screens in the future. If so, the smartphone-led OLED revolution will take a break. As it does, shares of Universal Display will likely struggle.

### Micron (MU)

When it comes to memory chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU), it's all about the music. Buy the stock when the music is playing or when demand outstrips supply, and revenues, margins and profits rise. Sell Micron stock when the music isn't playing, or when supply outstrips demand, and revenues, margins and profits fall.

The music hasn't been playing for the past several months. Supply has been catching up to demand. Revenue growth has stalled out. Gross margin expansion is turning into gross margin compression. Profits are peaking.

Falling smartphone demand further dampens the demand outlook for Micron. The more demand falls, the lower prices go; the lower margins fall, and the more profits get cut.

In the big picture, though, MU stock is already so cheap (4X forward earnings) that one could reasonably argue that weak smartphone demand is already priced in. That may be true. Further downside is hard to imagine. But this stock won't stage its big comeback until margins improve, and its equally hard to see margins improving with smartphone demand depressed.

### Lumentum (LITE)

Opticals giant Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE) has strong parallels with Universal Display. Much like Universal Display, the smartphone market has sparked a big boom and bust in Lumentum.

Lumentum went boom by becoming the company which provides the technology behind the iPhone's new Face ID feature. This partnership sparked a huge rally in LITE stock from $15 in 2015, to $75 by early 2018. During that stretch, Apple also jumped to comprise 30% of Lumentum's revenue.

Then, Lumentum went bust as the smartphone market stalled out in 2018. Since peaking in early 2018, LITE stock has fallen 40% to $45. Considering this company has ample exposure to the smartphone market, this huge sell-off makes sense.

But, all the negatives seem priced in now. The stock trades at just 10X forward earnings and is still behind market-leading Face ID technology which should see greater proliferation over the next several years. Thus, while weakness is here to stay in the near term, the medium-to-long-term outlook for LITE stock is fairly positive.

### Skyworks (SWKS)

Following guidance cuts from Apple and Samsung, smartphone RF chipmaker Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) -- which has historically counted both Apple and Samsung as 10%-plus customers -- cut its guide, too.

That's no surprise, and SWKS stock had already fallen a bunch into the report. As such, because the bad news was already priced in, the guidance cut actually results in a rally for SWKS stock.

Despite Skyworks' huge exposure to the smartphone market (47% of Skyworks revenue came from Apple last year), SWKS stock does appear to have bottomed. The stock trades at under 10X forward earnings, a low valuation even for this list of depressed smartphone suppliers. The sales multiple is also at just 3X trailing sales. That is the lowest valuation since early 2016, around the same time the stock staged a huge bounce back from a massive 2015 selloff.

All in all, while Skyworks is a stock that is hugely affected by a smartphone slowdown, it appears this negative impact is already fully priced in. Any good news on the smartphone front could consequently result in a huge rally.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL, GOOG and SWKS.

## Dialog Semiconductor lowers its fourth-quarter revenue guidance

Apple (AAPL) stock has declined 35.8% in the last 100 days after reaching its all-time high of $233.47 in early October. It’s currently trading just above its new 52-week low of $142. The stock fell as Apple is set to report its first YoY (year-over-year) decline in iPhone sale in the December 2018 quarter, which CEO Tim Cook confirmed in his January 2 letter to investors. The letter sent stocks of major Apple suppliers like Qorvo (QRVO), Broadcom (AVGO), and Skyworks (SWKS) down more than 8% on January 3.

While weak iPhone sales affected Apple’s suppliers significantly, its United Kingdom–based power management chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor seems to have mitigated the impact. Today, Dialog lowered its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018 from the previous range of $430 million–$470 million to $431 million. Despite the lower guidance, Dialog’s stock is trending up as its revised guidance is better than Apple’s. Apple reduced its revenue estimate for the December 2018 quarter to $84 billion, way below its previous guided range of $89 billion–$93 billion.

## Why is Apple important for Dialog?  

Apple is the biggest customer of Dialog, which earns 75% of its revenue from the iPhone maker. Dialog’s revised revenue guidance suggests that weakness in iPhone sales may not have as severe an impact on Apple suppliers as Wall Street analysts suggested. Chips suppliers like Qorvo and Skyworks that have high exposure to Apple have recovered from the January 3 decline.

2019-01-15,"Investors started the new trading week in the same lethargic mood they left the old one … not bearish so much as disinterested until they have more clarity. The S&P 500's close of 2,858.61 was 0.53% lower than Friday's close, leaving the market as much within reach of a renewed rally as it is on the verge of a correction. Total volume behind the pullback relatively light.

Utility company PG&E (NYSE:PCG) led the way, losing a stunning 52% of its value after the organization announced it would be filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company, which faces an enormous liability for its role in California's recent wildfires, recognizes it won't be able to handle that burden otherwise.

Beyond that, however, the picture wasn't quite so grim. Citigroup (NYSE:C) jumped nearly 4% in response to a so-so fourth quarter report, while Goldcorp (NYSE:GG) gained more than 7% on Monday. The mega-bank anticipates impressive revenue growth this year, while the gold miner is to be bought by rival Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM). Newmont shares subsequently fell nearly 9%, as the deal will be a dilutive all-stock deal that arguably overvalues Goldcorp at $10 billion.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The best prospects for today's action, however, are names that are much less volatile. The stock charts of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) have been quietly moving into grooves that have largely been overlooked, leaving each on the cusp of trade-worthy moves.

### Broadcom (AVGO)

Back on Dec. 28, we pointed out Broadcom shares were in rally mode, and testing a key technical ceiling. That ceiling was closer to being tested the next two. That look is marked in the daily chart with a yellow arrow. Three days later, AVGO shares were in a freefall, calling the whole idea into question.

  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into 



The stock is back in rally mode though, and the next test of that very same technical ceiling is even better founded effort than the previous one was. The bulls are getting closer to that breakout move.

  
Click to Enlarge • The technical ceiling in question is the upper boundary of a narrowing trading range, plotted with dashed lines on both stock charts. We've now logged weeks of higher lows.

• Though shares of Broadcom were hammered on Jan. 3, all the key moving average lines have stepped up as support levels. Better yet, the purple 50-day moving average line just crossed above the white 200-day moving average line … a so-called &quot;Golden Cross.&quot;

• The upper boundary of the narrowing trading range is at $259.

### Facebook (FB)

A little over a month ago, Facebook was in trouble. Between the threat of regulation and the reality of a customer revolt, the sellers inadvertently framed a falling trading ranges that chopped the value of the stock by more than a third.

Shares broke out of that downtrend in December, though, and while it took an even lower low and then another bullish effort to finalize the bottom, that's happened too. Now there's just one more hurdle to clear if FB stock is going to start moving higher again.

  
Click to Enlarge • The ceiling in question is around $146, where shares peaked in December, and so far have peaked this month. Monday's test of that ceiling was the strongest test yet.

• In the meantime, the purple 50-day moving average line has been hurdled after it was a technical ceiling a month ago.

• On the weekly chart of Facebook we're already in the shadow of a bullish MACD crossover … the first time it has been bullish since the middle of last year.

### Merck (MRK)

Finally, had rival Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and other pharma names not further defined similar moves, the pattern Merck has left behind of late wouldn't be remarkable.

Given the clues at hand, however, investors can't afford to ignore the brewing risk. Merck and its peers have been unusually bullish since early last year, and that leaves them especially vulnerable right now. One more misstep could pull the rug out from underneath the group, and from MRK in particular.

  
Click to Enlarge • When it was tested in October, the gray 100-day moving average line held up as a floor, sparking a move to higher highs. Ditto for the December test. Monday's test so far has been successful as well, but the repeated test of that floor can't be ignored. The bears continue to swing, and sooner than later will break that floor.

• There is something different going on right now, however, that we've not seen in a while. That's strong selling volume. Two of the past three days have been high-volume selloffs, suggesting there are sellers waiting in the wings.

• On the weekly chart, we've already logged a bearish MACD cross that technically killed last year's incredible uptrend.

In 2018, the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index, one of the most widely followed gauges of chip stocks, slipped 6.50%. That drop was nearly 200 basis points worse than the S&P 500's.

While semiconductor stocks and mutual funds are rebounding to start 2019, some analysts are less than enthusiastic about the group. Morgan Stanley recently lowered its outlook on the semiconductor group, citing deteriorating conditions.

Several of the industry's marquee names have also warned about slack demand over the coming quarters. Still, there are some compelling long-term data points to consider when evaluating semiconductor stocks and mutual funds to invest in.

Here are the five best mutual funds for contrarian investors to invest in the semiconductor space.

### Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX)

Expense Ratio: 0.75%, or $75 annually per $10,000 invested

Compared to some of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the semiconductor universe, the Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (MUTF:FSELX) is pricey with an annual fee of 0.75%, but investors can realize some cost savings with one of the best mutual funds for semiconductor exposure because Fidelity clients can transact in FSELX free of commissions.

Adding to the case for FSELX as one of the best mutual funds for semiconductor exposure is the fund's long-term track record. This Fidelity fund has a lengthy history of outperforming the S&P 500, broader technology benchmarks and some well-known semiconductor indexes.

FSELX is a top-heavy fund as its top 10 holdings combine for almost 70% of the fund's weight. That group includes Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

### Fidelity Advisor Semiconductors Fund - Class A (FELAX)

Expense Ratio: 1.15%

The Fidelity Advisor Semiconductors Fund - Class A (MUTF:FELAX) is one of the best mutual funds for investors looking for actively managed exposure to chip stocks. FELAX's primary manager is Steve Barwikowski, who has more than 10 years managing this fund.

FELAX has a four-star Morningstar rating and its top 10 holdings represented nearly 71% of the portfolio at the end of last year. As is to be expected, there is some holding overlap between FELAX and the aforementioned FSELX. Not surprisingly, most of FELAX's holdings are classified as growth stocks, primarily large- and mid-cap growth names.

### iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

Expense Ratio: 0.47%

The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is not a mutual fund. It is an ETF, but ETFs are descendants of mutual funds, so a case can be made that SOXX is one of the best mutual funds for those looking for semiconductor funds to invest in. One of the factors making SOXX one of the best mutual funds for chip stocks is cost efficiency relative to the category average.

SOXX tracks the aforementioned PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and holds 30 stocks. Most semiconductor funds, including the best mutual funds, are concentrated in terms of roster size. As a cap-weighted fund, SOXX is also concentrated in terms of how many stocks really drive the fund's outcomes. Broadcom, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) combine for nearly a quarter of the fund's weight.

With a three-year standard deviation of 19.55%, SOXX reflects the volatile nature of the semiconductor space and other semiconductor funds, but its price-to-earnings ratio of just over 15 implies some attractive valuations for an industry that usually trades at a premium to the broader market.

### ProFunds Semiconductor UltraSector Investor Class (SMPIX)

Expense Ratio: 1.46%

The ProFunds Semiconductor UltraSector Investor Class (MUTF:SMPIX) is one of the best mutual funds for traders looking for some added juice on the semiconductor trade. SMIPX is designed to deliver 1.5 times the daily returns of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index.

That means that if that index rises 1% on a particular day, SMPIX should add 1.5%. Leveraged funds, be they mutual funds or ETFs, are particularly useful for active, risk-tolerant traders when there are looming catalysts. Earnings season could do the trick for SMPIX.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens 



From Jan. 22 to Feb. 18, about 72% of the PHLX Semiconductor Index's components report earnings, making SMPIX one of the best mutual funds to consider during that three-week span.

### SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD)

Expense Ratio: 0.35%

There are a limited number of dedicated semiconductor funds, so as was noted earlier, some of the best mutual funds in this space are actually ETFs. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) follows the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, which is an equal-weight benchmark.

That eliminates some of the concentration risk associated with cap-weighted semiconductor funds. None of XSD's 35 holdings account for more than 3.48% of the fund's weight. Many equal-weight funds are driven by exposure to smaller stocks, but XSD is a large-cap fund as highlighted by a weighted average market capitalization of $25.76 billion for its components.

Following a sour performance in 2018, XSD is off to a strong start this year with a year-to-date gain of almost 4%.

As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-25,"It was touch-and-go for the better part of Thursday's action, but the bulls managed to pull out another win. It was only a small gain of 0.14% for the S&P 500, but each day that doesn't result in a drubbing is another day's worth of improved confidence from investors.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) set the marketwide tone, and the pace for the tech sector, up 3.8% in front of its Q4 report posted after the close. Shares were deeper in the red in after-hours action, however, after first-quarter revenue projections disappointed. Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) was the day's big winner though, gaining 18.4% on an impressive third-quarter print. Between the two, investors were willing to wade into most tech stocks in a big way.

Not every name was a winner yesterday, however. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) tanked to the tune of 13.1% in response to declining revenue, and production, in its recently ended fourth quarter.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The market's better names continue to separate themselves from the lesser ones, but Thursday's action suggests another trend is developing. That is, stocks from the same sector or industry are starting to move in a herd, which generally points to longer-lived trends. Stock charts of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are particularly noteworthy beneficiaries of this new nuance.

### Broadcom (AVGO)

A week and a half ago, Broadcom was featured as a breakout candidate. After months of being squeezed into a narrowing range, the stock was finally being forced out … ready to make up for lost time.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



That didn't happen straight away, but with the help of a sector-wide tech rally on Thursday, AVGO is up and over a big hump and free to keep moving higher.

  
Click to Enlarge • The shrinking trading range is plotted with white dashed lines on both stock charts. Broadcom was shoved above the upper boundary on Thursday.

• It's relatively easy to overlook, but we're now in the shadow of all bullish moving average crossovers.

• Though it's unlikely to make a straight-line move there, the next most likely target is last year's peaks around $273, plotted with a red dashed line. That's only a checkpoint target though, and not necessarily an end to the rally.

### Merck & Co. (MRK)

A couple of different times this month we've looked Merck & Co. as well as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), though for the same reason. That is, both had a stellar 2018, but both have been toying with a breakdown. Each was waving its own separate red flag.

They both still are, too. But, while Pfizer is working its way to a breaking point, Merck moved even closer to a breakdown on Thursday. One more misstep could push it over the edge.

  
Click to Enlarge • That &quot;edge&quot; is the rising support line, dashed, that extends back to April's lows.

• While a floor still remains, another one has been broken. The 100-day moving average line, gray, had been a support line since October, but MRK closed below that line yesterday.

• Underscoring the brewing selling interest is the massive spike in bearish volume seen on Thursday.

### Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Finally, late last year Advanced Micro Devices shares were toying with a break under a key support level around $16. It never happened. Instead, AMD recovered quite nicely, even if not overwhelmingly. The stock pushed back above all of its key moving average lines early this month, and has been stagnant ever since.

That sideways action sets the stage for a potential breakout thrust though, if shares can get decent traction for just one more day.

  
Click to Enlarge • The ceiling in question is around $21, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart.

• Notice how well traders have kept Advanced Micro Devices at or above the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving average lines. The support found at these levels serves as a floor, or launch pad, for a breakout move, and a bullish MACD cross on the weekly chart would be the ideal trigger.

• The fact that the stock of rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not only getting similar but better traction underscores the bullish case for AMD.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter, at @jbrumley.

Despite the broad market's ongoing gains, winners and losers continue to diverge, leaving some names at pivot points while traders figure out what to do with them. The good news is, the lines in the sand for the stock charts of Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) are pretty clear.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Verizon Communications (VZ)

Back in late December, Verizon Communications had peeled back to a pivotal level. Though the bulls had finally started to push back against a pretty devastating pullback, the matter was far from settled at the time.

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



Incredibly enough, it's still not. Although it looked as of the bulls were taking charge after that rebound, we can look back now and say maybe they didn't. VZ stock is once again toying with the very same support levels that came into play over a month ago.

  
Click to Enlarge • One of those technical floors is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. Verizon shares fell under that line last week, but quickly recovered. The bears are going to test that floor again though.

• The make-or-break line, however, is the $52.30 mark. That's more or less the absolute low VZ has made since December, marked with a yellow dashed line. A move below that level will likely start a selloff that can't be easily stopped.

• Should that selloff take shape, the rising floor just above the $50 is the most plausible technical target. The weekly chart's stochastic indicator should also fall into oversold territory at a major low.

### Broadcom (AVGO)

With our last look at Broadcom back on Jan. 25, we acknowledged the break above a long-standing resistance line was a great first step, but more work needed to be done. Namely, AVGO shares needed to survive a real test and remain above that line in the sand.

That's happened in the meantime. Broadcom have continued to forge ahead, shrugging off profit-taking to make good on the breakout thrust. Another line in the sand has come into play as of last week though.

  
Click to Enlarge • The converging trading range is plotted on both stock charts with white dashed lines. AVGO broke above the upper boundary four weeks ago, and has continued to move higher.

• Last week's high of around $274 isn't anything to dismiss as inconsequential. That's where AVGO has peaked a few times since early 2018; follow the yellow dashed line back in time on both stock charts.

• Although potential resistance has to be cleared at $274, if that happens there's a great deal of upside to tap into. There's more than a year's worth of pent-up buying that's yet to be fully unleashed.

### Kinder Morgan (KMI)

With nothing more than a quick glance at the recent chart of Kinder Morgan shares, it would be easy to jump to a bullish conclusion. The stock's up 25% from its December low, and seeming still going strong.

Take a step back and look at the bigger picture though. While the rally is compelling, this is when, where and how it should be running into major technical trouble.

  
Click to Enlarge • Monday's high around $18.40 should be uncomfortably familiar to long-term investors. That's where KMI struggled for months in the middle of last year, never able to clear it cleanly.

• Though the recent rally has been impressive, in the weekly timeframe KMI shares are overbought, according to the stochastic indicator. History says Kinder Morgan shares tend to peel back once they become stochastically overbought.

• Although the current move seems like it has got lots of momentum, look closely at the daily chart's volume data. The buyers have been backing off for a couple of weeks now. There's not actually a lot of investor support for KMI at its current price.

2019-02-07,"Along with many other tech companies, Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) stock has pulled off an impressive rally so far this year. Micron stock has logged a return of 29%.Among other chip makers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is up 6.5% and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is up by a similar amount. Source: Shutterstock So what happened? Why has Micron stock rallied so much? Well, there has been some bullishness on the macro level. The Federal Reserve has hinted it will hold off on raising interest rates. There have also been encouraging signs that the U.S. and China will come to an agreement on trade.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond But perhaps the biggest factor driving MU stock has been that negative sentiment towards the name had gotten to extreme levels. From June 2018 until December 2018, Micron stock went from $61 to $39.  So it seemed like a pretty good bet that MU stock would bounce. Micron Stock And Its DRAM BusinessWhen it comes to the massive DRAM-chip industry, MU is the world leader. The company will also become a top player in the critical flash-NAND technology market. That's because MU is acquiring the shares it doesn't already own of its joint venture with INTC.The market for memory chips in general and DRAMs in particular is also highly consolidated, with a few mega players like Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and SK Hynix. As a result, the market has not been oversupplied.Yet there is still a nagging issue: deceleration of demand. Part of the deceleration was caused by a slowdown in spending on the cloud and smartphones, as seen in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) results.But China is still a major headwind for MU and MU stock. Even if China and the U.S. reach a trade agreement, China may still weigh on MU stock. The fact is that the country's economy could be at a negative turning point, as Beijing's stimulative actions have proven to be mostly ineffective.On Micron's latest earnings call, MU CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said: &quot;As we enter calendar 2019, we are seeing weakening demand from our customers. As a result, we are taking decisive actions, including a meaningful reduction in our fiscal 2019 CapEx plan, in both DRAM and NAND that will materially reduce our supply bit growth.&quot;Note that he provided terrible guidance for fiscal Q2, indicating that MU's revenue would range from $5.7 billion to $6.3 billion. The Street, on the other hand, was looking for a much more robust $7.2 billion.Yet that should have not been too much of a surprise. Memory is a commodity business, making it subject to cyclical swings in supply and demand. Unfortunately, after several years of a nice uptrend, it looks like things are going into reverse. The Bottom Line on Micron StockThe last time the DRAM market took a hit, back in 2015, Micron stock plunged to $10, showing how brutal the segment can be.So could Micron stock suffer a similar fate in the coming year? Probably not. MU has a solid balance sheet and is working hard to reduce its capacity. The valuation of Micron stock is also fairly low, with a forward price-earnings ratio of only six, and the company has plans to buy back a whopping $10 billion of Micron stock.But all this does not mean that MU will somehow return to its glory days of 2016 to 2018. For the most part, its performance will likely be choppy as its headwinds continue to linger. So holding off on buying MU stock is probably the best course for now.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-03-08,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.The earnings calendar starts getting a bit light. And that could be a problem for the market. Strong earnings reports have boosted key sectors, leading the S&P 500 to gain almost 10% so far this year. But earnings next week -- and in weeks to come -- may not have the same type of power.That said, there are some intriguing reports to watch next week, including three important releases on Thursday. And while they may not move the entire market, these earnings reports could give clues as to how near-term trading may play out across the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA semiconductor giant could strengthen the recent rally in chip stocks or undercut it. A major retailer could give some color on an important category of that industry. And a high-flying software stock will provide one more test for risk tolerance in tech.  * 5 Airline Stocks In Serious Trouble There's still some big news coming out of earnings next week -- even if it may not be enough to offset the market's other worries.Source: Shutterstock  Dollar General (DG)Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 14, before market openDollar General (NYSE:DG) is an interesting spot heading into fiscal Q4 earnings on Thursday. DG stock sits just off an all-time high. Rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) spiked to an all-time high itself after a blowout report on Wednesday.So expectations for Q4 results -- and fiscal 2019 guidance -- probably are reasonably high heading into Thursday morning's report. If Dollar General can meet those expectations, DG stock will continue its strong multi-year run.If not, however, this could get ugly for DG stock in a hurry. Results not just from Dollar Tree but Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) seems to show strength among U.S. consumers. Any signs of weakness from DG, whether in the Q4 performance or in this year's outlook, could make earnings next week a huge stumbling block for DG shares.Source: Shutterstock  Broadcom (AVGO)Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 14, after market closeFor a company with a market cap of $110 billion, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) seems to be somewhat forgotten. But the stock quietly has shown some strength in recent months, nearing a new all-time high last month before a recent modest pullback.For AVGO stock and the space, Thursday afternoon's report offers an opportunity. Broadcom stock trades at a reasonable 10x forward P/E multiple. Semiconductor stocks on the whole remain below 2018 highs. Broadcom's diversified portfolio makes it a barometer of the industry as a whole.  * 5 Reasons Stocks Are Falling Right Now Good news from Broadcom could assuage some of the worries investors still have toward the semiconductor cycle at the moment. With at least a month until fellow chip giants report, Broadcom may set the tone for trading in chip stocks over the next few weeks.Source: Shutterstock  Adobe (ADBE)Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 14, after market closeI've been a longtime fan of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But ADBE stock has stalled out a bit of late. With a recent pullback, ADBE now trades in line with levels from some nine months ago.The weakness makes some sense. ADBE isn't cheap, still trading at over 26x forward earnings. It's long been a classic case of a wonderful business where the valuation has been a question mark. For years, investors were willing to pay up for ADBE; in this market, they've been less aggressive.So the reaction to Adobe's report provides another data point for just what multiples investors are willing to pay. In recent weeks, I've called out Square (NYSE:SQ) and -- last week -- Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) as similar test cases. Both stocks now trade below pre-earnings levels despite solid reports. If Adobe does the same on Friday, it could be another sign that there's a limit to what investors are willing to pay for even the best businesses in tech.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-03-11,"Finding cheap stocks to buy in this market is a challenge. Broad market indices aren't far from all-time highs. Yet risks abound. The bull market has been going strong for a decade. Trade battles still haven't been resolved. And at some point, the U.S. macroeconomic situation will reverse.But there are opportunities out there, and some stocks remain attractive. These 15 stocks all potentially fit that bill for one simple reason. All 15 trade at less than 15x earnings, yet those earnings are growing. That means they provide a solid combination of value and growth.These stocks -- like the market as a whole -- aren't without risk. In many cases, there are reasons investors are keeping valuations low. But those valuations are low enough that those risks are priced in, while the potential rewards are not.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners With all of that in mind, here are 15 growth stocks with low P/E ratios.Source: Shutterstock  Broadcom (AVGO)In a chip sector seeing quite a bit of pressure at the moment, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) seems to be holding up just fine. AVGO stock briefly touched an all-time high last month, while most semiconductor stocks trade well off 2018 peaks.Even with the gains so far, however, Broadcom stock still looks attractive. An 8% pullback makes the stock even cheaper: AVGO now trades at just 11.6x FY19 (ending October) earnings-per-share estimates.Yet earnings continue to grow. Operating margins are expanding, with FY19 guidance suggesting a 51% adjusted figure -- one of the highest in any industry. And analysts are seeing even better growth next year, with earnings rising nearly 15%.There are risks here. Semiconductor stocks are usually cyclical, which suggests Broadcom earnings could peak in the next couple of years. Few companies have more impressively executed in terms of M&A over the years, but that success may not last forever.Still, those risks look worth taking. Broadcom's diversified base limits cyclical effects and increases exposure to long-term trends like Internet of Things. With the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) acquisition abandoned, Broadcom likely will stick to smaller deals. This has been one of the best stocks in tech for years now -- there's not much reason to suggest that will change. ABM Industries (ABM)Facility services provider ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) isn't exciting. The company provides outsourced labor and solutions for janitorial services, landscaping, parking and other needs. Margins are relatively thin; growth is steady but not spectacular.But the same has been true of the returns provided by ABM stock. The Dividend Champion has returned nearly 11% per year over the past quarter century, including dividends. That's true even with the stock 30% off 2017 levels.The concerns of late have been driven by worries about rising labor costs, and ABM's ability to pass along those costs. The stock dipped 8% after earnings last week. But the selloff seems overdone: fiscal Q1 numbers were fine, and ABM's margins, while still thin, are holding up.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 This is a stock that will take some patience, and not one that is likely to produce eye-popping returns. But ABM trades at less than 15x FY20 EPS estimates, while growth should continue for some time. And the nature of the business provides protection against a cyclical downturn, which actually could help ABM by pushing labor rates (and availability) back down. All told, ABM looks too cheap and likely to start producing 10%+ returns again in the not too distant future.Source: Shutterstock  Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM)To be fair, most bank stocks, not just Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), seem reasonably cheap at the moment. Big bank stocks are generally trading at 10x 2019 earnings estimates, and smaller banks are in the same range.The obvious concern is that the economic cycle will turn at some point, bringing bank profits down as a result. Optimism toward the sector after the 2016 U.S. presidential election has dissipated, though the sector has done better in 2019.There still should be more upside ahead. Regulations put in place after the financial crisis have been criticized in some quarters for limiting growth. But -- as far as we can tell -- they likely also limit risk. In the meantime, earnings continue to grow.BAC and JPM continue to the best bets in the industry, as I argued in December. The 'smart money' seems to agree. For investors who see the current economic strength continuing, these two stocks should be on the top of their shopping list.Source: Shutterstock  Photronics (PLAB)The risk with Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is that it's cheap, but will always be cheap. The company manufactures photomasks used in semiconductor production. It's a difficult, cyclical and capital-intensive business, which is one reason why PLAB has mostly traded sideways for years now, and usually receives low multiples.But there's still an intriguing case for PLAB stock at the moment, which is why I personally own the stock. PLAB trades at 16.5x trailing twelve-month EPS, but the multiple drops to 13x backing out net cash. New facilities in China are coming online this year, positioning the company as the leading supplier to a growing domestic semiconductor industry.  * 10 Top Pot Stocks 2019 Has to Offer The risks here are obvious, given recent weakness in both semiconductor stocks and Chinese equities. PLAB itself has pulled back after a decent, but not quite spectacular, earnings report last month. But below $10, PLAB is still too cheap. I argued last year that the stock could double, and looking a few years out, that's still a possibility.Source:  Dwight Burdette via WikiMedia Commons  Aaron's (AAN)To be honest, I'm not entirely sold on Aaron's (NYSE:AAN). The legacy rent-to-own business has struggled for years now. And there's obvious risk in the company's Progressive Leasing business, which provides financing to customers of retailers like Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) and Conn's (NASDAQ:CONN).But with AAN trading at 14x the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance, there are few stocks at a similar valuation with as much upside in the bullish scenario. The Aaron's concept is starting to show some signs of life, with same-store revenues guided to be flat to up 2% in 2019. Progressive has a massive opportunity in front of it, and this year should drive over 60% of profit. A clean balance sheet provides room for share buybacks, increasing returns and boosting EPS.Again, there are risks here. But if Progressive is what the company believes it can be, and Aaron's can start driving organic profit growth, this is a stock that could show huge returns for years to come.Source: Jerry Landers via Flickr (Modified) Southwest Airlines (LUV)Airline stocks like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have struggled in the last couple of years. Southwest stock itself was hit by a couple of factors last month. Grounded planes -- possibly due to a labor dispute -- will hit first quarter revenue. And Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock, citing higher costs related to its new service to Hawaii.  * 7 Best Fidelity Funds for 2019 But even Goldman admits that from a long-term perspective, LUV looks attractive. The firm is right. Southwest long has been one of the best domestic operators. It performed quite well in 2018, including a strong fourth quarter. LUV stock may see some near-term turbulence, but at less than 10x forward earnings, it looks far too cheap.Source: Shutterstock  Central Garden & Pet (CENT)Central Garden & Pet (NASDAQ:CENT, NASDAQ:CENTA) is trading near its lowest levels in over two years. The key catalyst of late has been a disappointing fiscal Q1 report that sent the stock down some 22%.But the selloff looks like an overreaction. Central has seen nice growth in both its Garden and Pet businesses. Debt and equity offerings last year leave the company with some $500 million targeted for M&A; Central's current results include the costs of the offerings but no benefits from the spend. And yet CENTA (the cheaper of the two classes) now trades just under 15x the company's FY19 EPS guidance of $1.80 or higher.For a company that has grown earnings steadily in recent years, and has solid market share in two stable, if not spectacular, consumer categories, that valuation is far too low. As Central works through the issues that hit Q1, and as it puts that cash to work, CENT and CENTA shares should recover.Source: Montgomery County Planning Commission via Flickr (Modified) Knoll (KNL)The concern when it comes to Knoll (NYSE:KNL) is that the company's exposure to office furniture represents a real risk. The sector didn't perform all that well as the economy rebounded. Lower demand due to &quot;open office&quot; trends and increased telecommuting offset higher spending from medium- and large-sized companies.But the case for Knoll is based on the idea that the office furniture side of the business is becoming less important. The company's residential businesses are growing, including high-end offerings like Holly Hunt and Muuto. They're more profitable as well and shouldn't see quite the same &quot;cyclicality&quot; as the office furniture industry generally does.  * 7 High-Yield Telecom Stocks to Avoid At just over 10x 2019 EPS estimates, Knoll is priced as if its business is headed for a decline. That doesn't appear to be the case, however. Rather, investors can own a high-end, well-managed, diversified business at an attractive multiple -- and with a 3% dividend yield.Source: a.dombrowski via Flickr Brunswick (BC), MasterCraft (MCFT), Malibu Boats (MBUU) and Johnson Outdoors (JOUT)Boating stocks, too, are valued as if earnings are going to peak. That might actually make some sense. The economic recovery will slow at some point. There are concerns that millennials may be less interested in motorized watersports (as opposed to kayaks or paddleboards). And potential boat-sharing models (something like Uber for boats) could impact demand.But industry sales still remain well below past peaks. And valuations in the sector suggest opportunity for investors who believe the industry will continue to grow -- and those valuations create a wealth of targets.Brunswick (NYSE:BC) probably is the safest play, given a broader international reach and a growing reliance on less-cyclical parts and accessories revenue. Malibu Boats (NASDAQ:MBUU) has been the best grower -- and the best-performing stock -- of late, and should be the choice for investors seeing renewed confidence toward the space.MasterCraft Boat Holdings (NASDAQ:MCFT) is the cheapest of the group. And Johnson Outdoors (NASDAQ:JOUT) is a bet on fishing growth, with smaller businesses in camping and diving supplies.All four stocks look somewhat attractive. Investors of all types may have their own particular favorite.Source: Shutterstock  Omnova Solutions (OMN)Chemical manufacturer Omnova Solutions (NYSE:OMN) is an intriguing turnaround opportunity. Operations have improved notably under a new CEO. Long-running declines in carpet and paper products are starting to fade as those categories become a small portion of total revenue.The big problem is that history colors any bull case for OMN. This is a stock that was spun off at the beginning of this century - yet hit an all-time high of just $12 last year.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 But it's possible that this time is different, to use the four most dangerous words in investing. Management has changed. Paper and carpet headwinds finally are moderating. And below $8, OMN trades at a notable discount to those highs despite a decent fiscal 2018 performance. At 12x FY19 EPS, it might be worth seeing if Omnova finally can inflect upward.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Target (TGT)Target (NYSE:TGT) is a stock that I've been skeptical of for quite a while and I'm still not completely convinced of the bull case. But it's much easier to turn bullish after the company's blowout Q4 report earlier this month. Target's omnichannel strategy has required billions of dollars in investments, but 5% same-store sales growth seems to show that spend is worth it.Meanwhile, Target is guiding for 7-12% EPS growth in fiscal 2019 (ending January 2020), as operating margins are expected to expand. Yet the stock trades for just 13x that guidance.Competition remains a risk, with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) building out their own omnichannel strategies. A cyclical swing downward could impact demand. But Target has done a much better job the last few years becoming a real rival to those other retail giants. It hasn't quite been rewarded enough.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of Photronics. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

2019-04-02,"The bull case for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) seems reasonably easy to make. Qualcomm stock provides ownership of one of the world's largest, and most important, semiconductor companies. And QCOM stock is cheap, at less than 15x FY19 consensus EPS, while providing a solid dividend yield of 4.35%.Source: Shutterstock Add to that fundamental case the potential for growth from the shift to 5G wireless, and it's not surprising many investors see Qualcomm stock as a screaming buy. But I'm not one of those investors. I've been skeptical toward QCOM stock for a few years now, and nothing of late has changed my opinion.Qualcomm isn't a bad company, necessarily and QCOM stock isn't a short. But this is a stock that has traded sideways for most of this decade, and barring something unforeseen, it's difficult to see how that changes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The Elite 8 Stocks to Buy for Massive Outperformance  The Battle with AppleAt the moment, the biggest aspect of the bull/bear argument over Qualcomm stock comes down to the company's ongoing legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). If Qualcomm wins, Apple-related revenues and profits return, boosting earnings, and the company could realize as much as $7 billion in damages and payments of cash currently being withheld. That's fully 10% of the company's current market capitalization.But the importance of a win in the fight with Apple goes beyond sheer numbers. A successful patent defense would validate Qualcomm's entire operating model. It would fend off regulators arguing that the company's model potentially violates antitrust rules. It also would keep any other clients from rebelling against Qualcomm's pricing strategies.To bears, Apple's response simply is a sign of what is to come. A loss to Apple might very well end Qualcomm's business model and significantly undercut its profitability. Operating margins already shrunk from 30% in fiscal 2017 (ending September) to less than 25% in FY18. Without pricing power, those margins fall further.Short-seller Kerrisdale Capital has argued that, in that scenario, Qualcomm stock could potentially fall to $21. And while that might be overwrought, there's no doubt that a series of legal losses would send QCOM stock tumbling. Earnings would fall, and the current 15x multiple very well might shrink. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's largest chip company, trades at just 12x.So far, the battle with Apple looks like a draw. But that, in turn, suggests the legal fight could drag on for some time. And while it does, the sheer effect of either a win or a loss means that Qualcomm stock likely will trade sideways until there's a resolution of some kind. 5G and Qualcomm GrowthThe other issue for Qualcomm stock is that even ignoring Apple, it isn't as if growth has been torrid. Adjusted EPS in fiscal 2012 was $3.71; the figure rose to $4.28 five years later. That's less than 3% annual growth. All of it, and then some, has come from share repurchases. Total adjusted net income in fiscal 2017 (mostly before the Apple fight) was below the level of fiscal 2012.The issue is simple: a reliance on the smartphone market is unquestionably not a good thing. We've seen that with Apple stock of late. We've seen that with Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), which trades below 2015 highs. Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) is back in line with 2012 highs.Even disregarding Apple, the status quo isn't good enough for Qualcomm. Assuming normalized earnings are in the $5 per share range (which still seems aggressive), a sub-12x multiple still seems appropriate because the business isn't growing. Until that changes, QCOM stock is likely to be dead money. Can QCOM Stock Rally?To be fair, it's possible Qualcomm can start driving growth again. 5G is the most obvious reason why, and bears should remember that Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) was willing to pay $82 per share for QCOM. Broadcom's long success in M&A suggests it knows what it's doing and that it saw real value in Qualcomm.But it remains to be seen whether Qualcomm can take advantage of 5G. A loss in the Apple case or further regulatory pressure would undercut Qualcomm's ability to profit from the shift. It's also important to remember that the opportunity still is some time off: Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has said it doesn't expect material 5G revenue until 2021.In the meantime, what happens to QCOM stock? The likely answer is: nothing. There's not much reason to suggest a big move until the Apple case is resolved and the nature and size of the 5G opportunity becomes clear.That's at least a few quarters off. Until then, it's difficult to see what changes the current trajectory of QCOM stock. For some investors, the 4%+ yield might be worth the wait. But it's hard to believe there isn't a better opportunity out there at least in 2019.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-15,"One-third of the way through 2019, we can see that the stock markets well and truly back on an upward path. The NASDAQ index is up 19% for the year, and the S&P 500 is back up to last October’s high levels. And as we move into the latter half of April, earnings reporting season will let us know if these returns to bullish conditions are for real. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, thinks so. After his company reported another forecast-beating quarter, he summed up the state of the markets: “Financial markets are healthy and consumer and business confidence remains strong.”TipRanks has the data you need to stay on top of the market’s ever-changing status. The Daily Analyst Ratings tool brings up the stocks that that are trending now, so you can see what has the attention of the market’s best analysts. A set of user-friendly filters lets you sort the results quickly – by analyst ranking, stock rating, company market cap, or market sector. The right investment is out there for everyone, and TipRanks makes it easy for you to find.Today, we’ve dipped into the Daily Analyst Ratings to find three tech stocks that are rising fast. Let's see what the best analysts are saying about these 3 top stock picks now. Atlassian Corporation, Plc. (TEAM – Research Report)You may have used Atlassian’s products before. The company’s best-known products are Jira, an issue-tracking workplace app, and Confluence, a team collaboration app.At its last earnings call, in January, Atlassian reported 25 cents EPS, 4 cents over the forecast, and $299 million in revenues against the $288 expected. The company’s Q3 earnings call is due on April 17; EPS is expected at 18 cents (80% higher than the year-ago quarter), and revenues are expected in the range $303 to $305 million.The earnings performance is reflected in its market performance; the company is up almost 26% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the NASDAQ.Atlassian held an investor day in Las Vegas last week, and some of Wall Street’s top analysts came away impressed by what they saw and heard. Richard Davis (Track Record & Ratings), from Canaccord Genuity, the 2 ranked analyst in the TipRanks database, said after the meeting, “The stock should be a core holding in just about any portfolio. Data points collected during the company's Summit event augment, and disproportionately support our favorable view on this company's fundamental outlook.” He added that this stock could double in the next 4 to 5 years, and set a $125 price target for the 12-month time horizon. That target suggests an 11% upside for TEAM.Agreeing with Davis is Gregg Moskowitz (Track Record & Ratings), of Mizuho Securities. After hearing management’s presentation, he described himself as “even more confident that the company's growth will remain strong for the foreseeable future,” and added, “Atlassian continues to broaden its product line and enjoy significant pricing power in the marketplace.” Moskowitz also gives TEAM a $125 price target.Atlassian currently holds a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus, based on 12 ratings given in the last three months: 6 buy, 5 hold, and 1 sell. TEAM shares sell for $112, so the $115 average price target indicates a 2% upside. But that price target may be starting to move higher, as analysts react to the company’s presentations and performance.View TEAM Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO – Research Report)Broadcom is a major player in the chip industry, having finished last year as the 6 manufacturer of semiconductors globally. The company posted $18.4 billion in sales for 2018.Looking forward, Broadcom is on track for continued growth. Q1 FY19 revenues, reported in March, were up 9% from one year earlier, and EPS showed a near-10% beat of the forecast. 2019 revenue guidance remains at $24.5 billion. All in all, it’s a solid start to the year and an indicator that the chip industry is getting on track after a rough time at the end of last year.Semiconductors don’t exist in a vacuum. They are components of larger devices. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh (Track Record & Ratings) points this out. In a review of Apple (AAPL) stock, he notes that the iPhone market stabilized in March, and with iPhone sales better than expected, AVGO stock is a solid buy. Broadcom, of course, plays a large role in Apple’s supply chain.Writing from Merrill Lynch, Vivek Arya (Track Record & Ratings) says that, based on current stock performance and valuations, AVGO is a top candidate for a higher price target. He points out two fundamental factors supporting the stock: that investors could be overlooking a high-quality sector that is 2x as profitable as the broader market, and that AVGO offers exposure to multiple secular growth themes (5G, AI, cloud computing, nextgen autos etc.) yet trades at a 20% discount to other cyclical sectors. Arya’s price target, $375, indicates an upside potential of 18% for this stock.Overall, AVGO shares get a ‘Strong Buy’ from the analyst consensus, based on 19 buy ratings and 5 holds in the last three months. The stock trades at $317 per share, with an average price target of $316 – there is actually a quarter percent downside here. As Arya pointed out in his review, however, this is a stock whose price target is out of date and ripe for change.View AVGO Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Verint Systems, Inc. (VRNT – Research Report)In today’s world of mass data collection, data analysis is an urgent priority. That’s where Verint comes in. The company produces software and hardware for data analytics for security, surveillance, business intelligence, and customer engagement management systems. To date, Verint has more than 10,000 corporate clients in over 150 countries worldwide.Like Atlassian and Broadcom, Verint posted strong quarterly results in March. Under GAAP standards, revenue came in at $1.23 billion, a gain of 8.3% over a year earlier, while the EPS of $1 compared to the $0.10 of the year prior.The quarterly results prompted five-star analyst Shaul Eyal (Track Record & Ratings), writing from Oppenheimer, to increase his price target to $65, saying, “The company's prospects are brightening as it is executing well, and segments are achieving both healthy revenue growth and improved profitability.”Also weighing in on VRNT shares was Jeff Kessler (Track Record & Ratings), of Imperial Capital. Kessler says that he “sees a significant opportunity in Cybersecurity for double-digit revenue growth, and notes that management estimates a gradual and steady increase of recurring revenue to 60%-70% over the next two years.” Like Eyal, Kessler set a $65 price target on this stock.That price target may be obsolete already. Since the March 27 quarterly report, VRNT has jumped 23% in the market, and now trades at $63. The average price target is only $66, making the upside a decidedly modest 3.4%. Look for this stock to attract additional analyst reviews, and possibly a new price target, in coming weeks.The consensus on VRNT remains a ‘Strong Buy,’ based on a unanimous 5 buy ratings in the last three months.View VRNT Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Enjoy the Research Reports on the Stocks in this Article:Atlassian Corporation, Plc.

2019-05-20,"The markets opened the week with more losses, with trade-war worries still on investors' minds. In particular, semiconductor stocks took a hit, but on the flip side, financials showed some resilience. It's a tricky market in the short term and one investors need to be careful with. Let's look at some must-see stock trades for Tuesday.  Must-See Stock Trades 1: T-Mobile  Click to EnlargeThe FCC chairman gave his OK for the T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) merger, sending shares higher by 3.7% and 22%, respectively. It's one more step in getting the deal done. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTMUS shares are jumping to new 52-week highs and over channel resistance on Monday. Interested buyers who were waiting for some clarity before getting long now have their chance. A pullback into prior channel resistance -- now near $77 -- could be their opportunity to get long.   * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) A larger correction down to channel support and the 50-day moving average may also be an advantageous spot to initiate a position. Must-See Stock Trades 2: Broadcom  Click to EnlargeBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has been hammered over the past few sessions. The stock fell 6% on Monday and has shed 10.5% over the last three trading days.   Where will it bottom?   I'm watching to see if AVGO will get down to $260. This $256 to $260 area has been notable over the past year, while the 50% retracement for the one-year range is at $257.70. Further, the 200-day moving average is just below at $253.76 and trending higher. While AVGO already sports an attractive dividend yield of more than 3.9%, that yield would surpass 4% on a pullback to $260. Finally, shares are entering an overbought condition.   While I don't really want to dabble much with stocks that could get caught in the trade-war crosshairs, this level offers a reasonable risk/reward in Broadcom stock.  Must-See Stock Trades 3: Burrito Breakout?  Click to EnlargeChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is flirting with a potential breakout right now. We highlighted this stock as an important one to watch given how strong it has been in the face of market-wide weakness. Learn to spot the stocks showing relative weakness. In any regard, the $721 level has kept a lid on CMG stock since April, but now shares are pushing through. Coupled with a series of higher lows and all of CMG's moving averages trending higher, and this one looks good for more upside. Look for a slightly lower open on Tuesday to see if CMG maintains or recovers this $721 level. A quick recovery likely sends it to new highs. A false breakout could send shares down to the 50-day. Must-See Stock Trades 4: AT&T I like AT&T (NYSE:T) for its cash flow and dividend, but the stock's aggressive rally on Monday morning certainly caught my eye. The stock has been moving much better over the past few sessions and Monday morning's 4% jolt was nice… at least while it lasted.  Click to EnlargeT stock has since given up most of those intraday gains, as the 200-week moving average is -- for now at least -- keeping a lid on the stock. A weekly close over $32.31 would gives us confidence more gains can be had. Otherwise, we'll have to see how T does on a pullback into the $30.40 to $31.40 area and see if it can put in another higher low. AT&T has been doing well, but Monday's pop-and-flop is a bit discouraging. Must-See Stock Trades 5: Stitch Fix  Click to EnlargeUp 5% on the day and Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) is looking better. However, the stock is far from out of the woods. Shares are lodged in a downtrend and are bouncing off channel support on Monday. I first want to see if SFIX can push through the $24 to $24.35 area. If it can, it sets up a test of its 20-day moving average and channel resistance near $25.32 to $25.50. Above that and it can gain some real momentum, but for now, I'm in the wait-and-see camp rather than the benefit-of-the-doubt camp.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential If $24 to $24.35 is resistance, look for another test of channel support.

The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.67%, with trade tensions still weighing on investors' confidence.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) led the way lower, falling almost 6% on the heels of news that the ban on deals with China's tech company Huawai would hit it particularly hard. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) fell almost as much for the same reason.There were some winners though. Chief among them was Sprint (NYSE:S), up almost 19% after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai commented he was in favor of its intended merger with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy None are great prospects headed into Tuesday's session, however. Rather, it's the stock charts of DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH), WellCare Health Plans (NYSE:WCG) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) worth closer looks. Synopsys (SNPS)Sometimes it takes one last big, high-volume selloff called a capitulation to get a new uptrend started. Other times, the opposite applies. It takes what looks to be a heating up of an already impressive rally to kickstart an overdue pullback.That appears to be what's materialized for Synopsys over the course of the past few days. For the better part of last week, it looked like it could do no wrong. As of yesterday though, it's breaking down key technical support in a rather decisive fashion.  Click to Enlarge  * Monday's close below the purple 50-day moving average line is a red flag, but made even more alarming by the fact that the stock jumped to new 52-week highs on a volume surge on Thursday.  * Zooming out to a weekly chart we get a feel for just how overextended the rebound from early in the year was. Up more than 50% for the four-month stretch, profit-takers are getting antsy. DISH Network (DISH)A couple of weeks back, DISH Network moved onto traders' radars as a bullish candidate thanks to its so-called 'golden cross,' where the 50-day moving average line moves back above the 200-day moving average. Shares ended up bumping into an established ceiling around $35.55 though, setting the stage for what ended up being a sizeable intraday pullback on Monday.The nature of that stumble and what happened in the middle of yesterday's action, however, sets the stage for not just more bullishness, but the breakout thrust that couldn't get going in earnest a month ago.  * 7 ETFs for Healthy Healthcare REITs   Click to Enlarge  * The sheer height and shape (and placement) of Monday's bar is the key. All it took was a kiss of the gray 100-day moving average line to chop the intraday loss in half.  * The volume spike is another key clue of potential bullishness. The mass migration in and out of the stock suggests all the would-be sellers and weak hands were flushed out.  * The clinchers for the clue are a follow-through break above the near-term ceiling around $35.55 and then last year's high around $37, marked in yellow on both stock charts. WellCare Health Plans (WCG)With nothing more than a quick glance, WellCare Health Plans just looks like a volatile, indecisive stock. And, perhaps that's all it is. There has been more method to the madness of late than it seems with just a superficial glance though, and the bullish argument got even better last week, and better still on Monday. There's just one proverbial fly in the ointment.The recent buy signal is last week's cross back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. That line appeared to serve as support yesterday.  Click to Enlarge  * At the same time, WCG shares are logging higher lows.  * Although impressively bullish since late last week despite the marketwide bearish tide, the bullish volume is thin and waning.  * The line to watch from here is just under $290, where WellCare Health Plans peaked a couple of times since the beginning of the year. That ceiling is marked in red on both stock charts.  * The long-term uptrend has been bullish for years, driven by a rising support line that extends back to 2016.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-23,"President Trump declared a national emergency last week -- and if you think that had something to do with global warming, terrorism, or even immigration policy, you may not have been paying close enough attention.No, this one has to do with competition in the tech sector, and specifically, competition from Huawei to lead the development of new 5G wireless technology around the world. Supported by generous state subsidies, and probably not a little state-sponsored espionage, Huawei has made great strides in developing the tech need to build a 5G infrastructure in China, in Europe, in Africa, and potentially, in the United States itself. However, as a company presumed to be under the influence of China's state security apparatus, the Trump Administration views Huawei as a clear and present danger -- if not necessarily to national security, then certainly to the peace of mind of U.S. tech firms that must compete with it.Thus, to stymie Huawei's growing influence, last week the President empowered the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to effectively &quot;blacklist&quot; Huawei and prevent U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese tech giant. This order cuts off Huawei from access to microchips and other tech components essential to the manufacture of much of its 5G equipment -- everything from handsets to base stations.It also, however, prevents many U.S. companies from making sales to Huawei. And in so doing, it's hitting the business of U.S. tech giants from California -- Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO) to North Carolina -- Qorvo (QRVO) and Cree (CREE) to Massachusetts where Skyworks (SWKS) resides. Qorvo in particular looks at risk, with analysts estimating the company derives as much as 15% of its revenue from sales to Huawei (versus, for example, Broadcom, which does &quot;de minimis&quot; business with the Chinese company).Conversely, the Trump Administration blacklist effectively cripples Huawei's business, which depends on electronic components such as radio frequency modules, antenna tuners and other components, supplied by these American tech firms and essential to Huawei's manufacture of its 4G handsets today. Without them, the company may not live to invent the 5G tech of tomorrow. Even if the company does survive, though, Huawei's 5G tech is believed to depend on such U.S.-supplied components as &quot;GaN power transistors&quot; needed to build RF power amplifiers, and &quot;silicon carbide (SiC) wafers&quot; on which those transistors are housed, as explained in a note this week from Charter Equity Research analyst Edward Snyder.For the time being, Huawei is drawing down stockpiles of such essential components, amassed in anticipation of a ban on trade with the company. Once these supplies run out, however, Snyder warns that the company could be in something of a bind.Snyder identifies Japan's Murata Manufacturing as one potential alternative supplier of &quot;diversity receive&quot; (DRX) radio frequency modules -- albeit a distant second to main supplier Skyworks -- and Japan's TDK is a potential source of filters. Then again, China isn't exactly on the best of terms with Japan right now, either. (The two countries are continually feuding over ownership of certain islands in the East China Sea). Further complicating matters, TDK has a joint venture with Qualcomm, and therefore may find itself subject to the same ban restricting Qualcomm's selling to Huawei.By and large, therefore, it's Snyder's assessment that &quot;there are no other suppliers, Chinese or otherwise, capable of filling the void left by the ban on U.S. components,&quot; and this blacklisting is likely to &quot;devastate Huawei's phone business,&quot; at least in the 4G realm, while its development of 5G tech will &quot;slow considerably.&quot; Conversely, in the analyst's opinion, the Trump Administration's ban on sales to Huawei is likely to accrue to the benefit of rivals like Korea's Samsung, and to Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi in China.At least, until the Trump Administration decides to blacklist those companies, as well.Read more:   * A Look at Qualcomm (QCOM)-FTC Outcome and Its Impact on Apple (AAPL)  * Will Qualcomm (QCOM) Stock Price Get Back to $60-65?  * Qualcomm (QCOM) Stock Is a Buy Despite Huawei Saga, Says Analyst  More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Aphria (APHA) Stock Could Be the Hidden Gem of the Cannabis Sector   * AMD Makes Splash at Computex, Rosenblatt Weighs in on the Stock   * Texas Mineral Resources (TMRC): This Rare Earth Metal Play Could See Substantial Upside   * 2020 Might Be the Year of Cannabis Stocks",Trump’s Trade War Hits U.S. Tech Companies from California to North Carolina

Here are some chip ETFs for risk takers to consider. iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)Expense Ratio: 0.47%, or $47 annually per $10,000 investedThe iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) tracks the aforementioned PHLX Semiconductor Index, so these are tenuous days for one of the largest chip ETFs. Several of the 30 stocks residing in this chip ETF have been caught up in the Huwaei flap, but that could be more of a near-term hurdle than a long-term detriment.&quot;Our valuations imply that the Huawei ban will be used as short-term leverage by the U.S. in ongoing negotiations with China involving tariffs and other trade negotiations,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note on semiconductor stocks. &quot;However, our models still assume that the ban won't last in the long term, as it would be highly destructive to technology companies in both China and the U.S., given the complexity and interwoven nature of the tech supply chain.&quot;The Huwaei issue is impactful for SOXX components because the Chinese telecom company is one of the largest semiconductor buyers in the world. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which combine for over 18% of SOXX's weight, have some China exposure that needs to be worked through over the near-term.With Qualcomm, &quot;there could be a risk here that Chinese original-equipment manufacturers don't buy chips or pay royalties (revenue from China was 67% of last fiscal year's revenue). We expect near-term pressure on Qualcomm's financial results will be at the high end of those affected in the semiconductor space,&quot; according to Morningstar. SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD)Expense Ratio: 0.35%The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) has been less bad than cap-weighted rivals in recent weeks due in part to this chip ETF being an equal-weight fund, meaning XSD is not dominated by the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm.The weighted average market value of XSD's 34 holdings is $28 billion, which is lower than the comparable metric on cap-weighted chip ETFs. While none of XSD's holdings command weights of more than 4.40% in the fund, the equal-weight strategy has not been enough to prevent this chip ETF from incurring significant damage in recent weeks. Month-to-date, XSD is lower by 14.60%.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends &quot;The latest bout of trade tensions around Huawei and the day-to-day tactics of the negotiations will probably lead to another bout of caution that could weigh on June quarterly results and perhaps the September forecasts for many chipmakers,&quot; said Morningstar. SPDR Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (XKST)Expense Ratio: 0.46%The SPDR Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (NYSEARCA:XKST) is not a dedicated chip ETF, but this unique fund allocates nearly 13% of its weight to semiconductor stocks and another 4.13% to semiconductor equipment makers and gives investors an avenue for tapping exciting new technology themes.XKST's underlying index &quot;is designed to capture companies whose products and services are driving innovation behind smart transportation, which includes the areas of autonomous and connected vehicle technology, drones and drone technologies used for commercial and civilian applications, and advanced transportation tracking and transport optimization systems,&quot; according to State Street.XKST's methodology is working, sort of, as the fund has been significantly less bad than dedicated chip ETFs in the month of May. In addition to its semiconductor exposure, XKST is heavily exposed to various facets of the transportation industry, making this is a highly cyclical ETF.This quasi-chip ETF could be a good buy for investors willing to wait out the current semiconductor shakeout. In other words, be patient and get some better pricing XKST.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-30,"Just when it looked like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) had put all of its legal woes in the rearview mirror, a new batch of them land in the company's lap, taking a significant toll on QCOM stock.Since last week's high, Qualcomm stock has fallen more than 17% on the heels of news that the FTC has successfully convinced a U.S. District Court that the company's royalty rates for use of its patented technologies are unfairly high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe matter is still up for debate; Qualcomm says it intends to appeal the recent ruling from Judge Lucy Koh. Success or failure on that front may be irrelevant, however. It's now clear that no matter what, the company will be dealing with legal headaches as long as it continues to work its current business model, using its current set of patents.The alternative? Simply accepting lower margins, though rolling over could prove amazingly unpopular with Qualcomm stock owners. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh believes the recent ruling prompted by the FTC's efforts could cut the company's profits in half, if the judge's decision holds up in appellate court.Take a closer look at some of the recent headlines though. Qualcomm has already been working on its proverbial &quot;plan B.&quot; It shows promise as a replacement for jeopardized high-margin revenue. Up-EndedA month ago, all seemed well. The company had just settled years-long legal wrangling with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and then went on to disclose that its third-quarter revenue from the iPhone maker would be far greater than most anyone anticipated. Qualcomm was also coming out as a 5G player on the verge of sweeping commercialization of 5G connectivity.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer Then the Huawei ban. Then the recent ruling from a California courtroom, which led Koh to order a renegotiation of patent licensing deals at &quot;fair and reasonable prices.&quot; The judge also made clear that exclusive deals -- like the one it had made with Apple -- were off-limits.The decision clearly takes dead aim at Qualcomm's bread and butter, given the tumble QCOM stock has seen since the latest chapter of a storied saga.The company has actually been developing and even launching new products though, which may relieve some of the brewing pressure on its margins. New ProductsWhile the pace of adoption of virtual reality and augmented reality tech has been much slower than expected, the need is still there; the technology was ready before the marketplace could handle it.To that end, Qualcomm just unveiled its Smart Viewer Reference Design, built on the Qualcomm(r) Snapdragon XR1 Platform. The technology could serve as the basis for next-generation AR and VR hardware, and deliver performance that could answer the &quot;what do we do with it?&quot; question that has so far bogged down the movement.More compelling than that, though, is the recently unveiled laptop built with on-board 5G (wireless) connection hardware. Co-developed with Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY), the device offers at-home broadband speeds wherever it goes… mobile like a smartphone, but all the computing power (and keyboard) of an actual PC.At first glance it's a solution to a problem that doesn't seem to exist. A second, closer look at the solution may suggest complete broadband mobility at 4G speeds wasn't worth the time, effort or expense. The device may mark the onset of a whole new standard in laptop development.More than that, it's a not-so-subtle reminder that 5G is mostly going to be supplied and powered by Qualcomm, more so with the tech you don't see than the tech you do.Bolstering this argument is the fact that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is abdicating its wireless broadband modem business altogether, further clearing a path for Qualcomm. Unusual SituationArguably the biggest upside for Qualcomm and QCOM stock in the midst of the madness, however, is the unique position the U.S.-China trade war's ultimately put the tech maker in.What it might look like remains unclear, but if Bloomberg's Shira Ovide is right, Washington may somehow bail Qualcomm out of any trouble it may find itself in going forward.Susquehanna Investment Group analyst Christopher Rolland's &quot;reasoning is that Qualcomm is the U.S.' 'great 5G hope,' explains Ovide, who goes on to say &quot;Qualcomm is one of the few American companies that is essential in guiding standards for next-generation mobile internet technology. This has become as much a symbol of nationalist self-interest as it is a technical project. The U.S. government has framed 5G as a race between the U.S. and China, and Qualcomm is running for flag and country.&quot;  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement Remember, it was the U.S. government that ultimately ran interference for Qualcomm last year when Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) attempted a hostile takeover of Qualcomm, citing the importance of its 5G know-how.Futurum Research's Daniel Newman says the same. Bottom Line for QCOM StockNone of the products or unspoken governmental support will alter the inevitable reality Qualcomm has been postponing for years. That is, its business model has more than pushed the envelope of what constitutes overly restrictive practices. Even if successful with its appeal (which is statistically unlikely), the company has managed to make multiple enemies … even if they appear to be partners on the surface.It's overly pessimistic to fear Qualcomm can't or won't overcome this headwind, though. As Futurum's Newman added to his bullish case, &quot;Qualcomm intellectual property is still the best. Apple settled on the merits of its agreement with Qualcomm, knowing full well that this ruling would have helped its case. It knew no other company could support its ambitions in 5G and mobile technology.&quot;There's also the mostly overlooked possibility that the more affordable (and less exclusive) Qualcomm's IP becomes, the more customers it may attract.In that light -- and given that shares had already moved to a price above $90 earlier this month -- the consensus target of $96.59 still doesn't seem unreasonable. One just has to be willing to take a step back and look at the bigger picture to realize the recent drop was sparked more investors looking through an overwhelmingly pessimistic lens.An end to the ban on doing business with Huawei could end up being a rebound catalyst.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-30,"When Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) announced recently it had won a favorable settlement from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its long-running legal battle, QCOM stock analysts breathed a sigh of relief and told their customers to buy, buy, buy.Source: Shutterstock In the aftermath, Qualcomm stock shot up. By the morning of May 21, it seemed clear skies were ahead. But Apple's lawsuit had a point.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. District Court judge Lucy Koh ruled on May 21 that Qualcomm's policy of forcing the industry to license patents on its terms in order to make communications chips violated the Federal Trade Commission Act.Suddenly all those optimistic projections for QCOM stock are open to question. Political PushbackQualcomm continues to defend its &quot;no license, no chips&quot; business model, which requires companies to license its patents in order to make, or buy, modem hardware, piling on patents to make those rights eternal, and keeping companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of the communications business.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June Apple's complaint was that Qualcomm charged it retail prices for wholesale orders. The FTC's complaint, lodged in the dying days of the Obama Administration, was that Qualcomm was refusing to license its patents to competitors under what are called Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) standards.On the merits, the FTC is right. That's precisely Qualcomm's business model. Before beating Apple in court, Qualcomm had forced South Korean and Chinese regulators to back down on the point, in exchange for fines.These governments acceded to the monopolist's demands because they needed the tech. But it was still an illegal monopoly. Working the RefsLike AT&T (NYSE:T), which goes from courts to states to federal regulators and back to courts in order to get its way, Qualcomm reacted to the decision politically.Stunned Qualcomm analysts called the ruling a &quot;gift&quot; to China, specifically Huawei, which the Trump Administration is fighting. The American Enterprise Institute called the Justice Department's action supporting the FTC &quot;unprecedented&quot;  (it's not).  The Wall Street Journal called it a &quot;coup,&quot;  claiming a decision ending a monopoly kneecaps &quot;competition.&quot; Legally, the Qualcomm position is simply unsustainable.But Qualcomm isn't concerned with the legal niceties. Qualcomm plays hardball and has even won decisions upholding its monopoly in China. This is practically a home game.In terms of technology the Trump Administration policy has been &quot;random&quot; and &quot;all over the place,&quot; according to Reuters. A policy without principles is bad for business, Reuters adds. They're right. Kleptocracy only benefits kleptomaniacs.Even if the Trump Administration supports Qualcomm's appeal, it could face a long legal road. But the Trump Administration has intervened directly on Qualcomm's behalf before. It killed an attempt by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to buy it in 2017, claiming national security concerns, even after Broadcom moved its headquarters from Singapore to San Jose.If enough of the President's friends scream at him long enough, he could make a similar decree here, law be damned. The Bottom Line for QCOM StockThe Koh decision doesn't end the matter. It just makes the future of QCOM stock as uncertain as it was before the Apple settlement. And investors agree; QCOM is down 15% since the ruling.If the company is required to renegotiate its license agreements it would be &quot;onerous,&quot; as critics maintain. QCOM stock's recent rise was based on the idea that if Apple can't beat it, and China can't beat it, Qualcomm's illegal monopoly must not be illegal.But it is.Patent rights are always limited, both in terms of time and the conditions under which they're licensed. Qualcomm is a monopolist. Politicians may believe that opening the market to competition benefits China more than the U.S., but the principle in this case seems clear.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War Monopoly rents are monopoly rents, even if a political friend is collecting them.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-03,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors thought the roller coaster ride might be over, but that's far from the case. Shares were on fire in 2018, surging higher and riding hundreds of percent in return over the last few years. However, NVDA took a dark turn in Q4, falling more than 50% from peak to trough.Source: via NvidiaShares hit a low near $124 in late December after peaking near $292 in early October. Despite poor guidance in January, Nvidia stock price quickly digested the news and moved higher. After recently holding steady near $190, we've seen another quick landslide in NVDA stock. Shares lost 22.9% for the month of May as the Nasdaq Composite index lost 7.4%.It's brutal, but is it an opportunity to get long?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Breaking Down NVDA StockNvidia buried any short-term optimism that I had in the stock last quarter when management didn't provide a full-year outlook. It suggests to me that, at the very least, the climate can stay turbulent. That really turned me off on NVDA stock, even though it was holding up after earnings on May 16. While Nvidia beat on earnings and revenue, the stock shed almost $20 since then.Of course, it doesn't help that this industry is in the crosshairs of the trade war. Nvidia generates a lot of revenue in China, as does Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). But be it Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) for their company-specific events, or Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) which has come down with the group, the selling pressure has been intense across the board.So what do we make of it all?Plenty of investors love to point out NVDA stock's price-to-sales ratio. While it was a lot higher nine months ago, it's not low now at 7.7 times this year's revenue estimates. However, 26 times earnings isn't that obnoxious, although investors could make a case that it's still too rich given that forecasts call for a 20% earnings decline this year. That may prove conservative if the environment remains rocky, as management opts for quarter-at-a-time outlooks given the current climate. Unfortunately, that's understandable, but it's hard for an investor.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June All that said, expectations call for a notable snap-back next year, with estimates calling for earnings and revenue growth of ~35% and ~20%, respectively. That may not hold up, but I am looking at Nvidia as a pivotal piece to the technological future. Be it in gaming, AI, autonomous driving, data center and more. It's simply too good to toss out over short-term worries. Trading Nvidia Stock Price  Click to EnlargeWe looked at NVDA stock earlier this month, noting that it's in the midst of a falling wedge pattern. Typically, this setup is bullish, but a break below support was the worry. With shares trading near $144, Nvidia stock price was near support from February and March.Absent the industry-wide selling pressure, this would typically set up NVDA stock price for a low-risk bounce play. The trade was &quot;low risk&quot; because we had a clear line of support. A close below would negate the trade and limit losses. However, given the industry pressure, more conservative traders in this case would rather wait to see if the stock could clear resistance, rather than bet on NVDA doing so beforehand.Okay, so that setup is in the trash. Now what?  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War If management is right, the worst is seemingly behind Nvidia stock at this point. So ~$15 a share off its lows and $10 above where investors stepped in as big-time buyers near $130 throughout Q4 and Q1, and it's worth giving NVDA stock some attention.To be honest, it doesn't feel like the selling is over due to the escalating trade war. But I'm nibbling down here. We're 52% off the highs and down 20%+ over the past few weeks. This is in an incredibly high-quality company going through a tough stretch right now. $124 to $130 is the downside target and with all of its moving averages trending lower, NVDA stock has its work cut out for it.I'm not backing up the truck here, but I'm accumulating some equity for the long haul.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Rather, it's the stock charts of Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP), Western Union (NYSE:WU) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) that are worth the closest looks. Here's what most interesting about each. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom may have mustered a gain yesterday while the overall market took as step back. But, don't be fooled. AVGO shares slipped into trouble last week, and have been unable to dig their way out of it. Perhaps worse, it has been verified by a failure to move back above the make-or-break line that failed as a floor last week.The one remaining support level also happens to be former technical ceiling.  Click to Enlarge  * Last week, Broadcom shares fell below their white 200-day moving average line. They've now tried a couple of times to move back above it, but only had to kiss that line on Monday to peel back.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the new floor, plotted in red on both stock charts, used to be a floor that tagged some major peaks.  * If that support line fails, the next most likely floor is the support line, plotted in blue, that tags the major lows from 2018. Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The last time we looked at Advance Auto Parts back in early March, it was in trouble. The 200-day moving average line was on the verge of breaking down as a floor, and shares were in the shadow of a huge sell signal. That breakdown ended up taking shape, but not decisively. In fact, by early April, AAP shares were at an even higher high than they were with the big sell signal … a key pivot bar.There was a method to the madness the whole time though. That is, a major technical floor was being established. It was validated even further late last month, and as of yesterday has taken the biggest chunk out of that floor yet.  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right   Click to Enlarge  * The floor in question is plotted in blue on both stock charts, lining up all the key lows from near the end of last year.  * Advance Auto Parts has already fallen below last month's low, marked with a yellow line on the daily chart.  * Although there's room for the bulls to take a couple more shots from here, if and when the purple 50-day moving average line is able to cross under the white 200-day moving average line, that so-called &quot;death cross&quot; will cast a bearish shadow on all future movement. Western Union (WU)Finally, with nothing more than a passing glance at the chart, it looks like Western Union shares might be slipping into a pullback. And that may well be the case. A second, closer look at WU, however, says there's still hope for a breakout on the table, if the stock can clear just one more hurdle.  Click to Enlarge  * The two big bullish hints here are the two times the key moving average lines have served as support, spurring higher highs. Both instances are highlighted on the daily chart.  * The bounce off of the white 200-day moving average line in early May is made even more significant by the fact that the same $18.40 level was a floor multiple times in 2017 and 2018. That floor is plotted with a yellow line on both stock charts.  * The big ceiling, of course, is the $19.76 area where Western Union has peaked several times since late April but has been unable to move above thus far.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

There are hundreds of stable dividend stocks with above-average yields - including a few in the typically growth-minded technology sector. Better still: These are affordable, sustainable payouts that even have room to grow.We've leaned on the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares to identify seven tech stocks with market-beating dividends that also have a high chance of growing in the future. DIVCON's methodology evaluates dividend health factors including profits, free cash flow and even bankruptcy risk, then assigns a score between 1 and 5. Low scores (1-2) are a sign of unstable dividends; high scores (4-5) signal healthy dividends that likely will grow in the years ahead.Here are seven &quot;double threat&quot; dividend stocks in the tech sector.

2019-06-17,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is cheap. The Intel stock price sits at just over 10 times earnings. Combined with a 2.7% dividend yield, there's a value case for INTC stock at current levels.Source: Shutterstock But I've been skeptical about that case for some time -- and recent developments don't change my mind. Fundamentally, Intel stock looks cheap. As a business, however, there are plenty of reasons why that is, and should be, the case.  Fundamental Concerns for INTC StockIntel stock was rolling not all that long ago. As of mid-April, the Intel stock price had risen nearly 30% in 2019 alone. And then first-quarter earnings sent the stock plummeting. INTC stock dropped 9%, wiping out some $23 billion in market value.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today The catalyst was reduced guidance for 2019. Analysts and investors had been looking for a rebound in the second half of the year, after what looked like an early-year pause in datacenter spending. Intel's guidance undercut that case.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIntel followed up a little over two weeks later with its three-year outlook -- and that, too, disappointed. Intel is looking for flat sales in PCs -- which investors might see as overly optimistic. Gross margins are going to be pressured amid Intel's 10nm ramp. Three-year revenue growth, on the whole, even with double-digit growth in datacenter, is supposed to be in the low single digits.It's worth remembering that in both cases, INTC stock fell -- and not because of investor overreactions. The guidance is coming from Intel itself and, in combination, it suggests that Intel's growth is going to be rather meager for three years. Cyclical semiconductor stocks with minimal growth aren't going to see big earnings multiples, which, alone, suggests that the Intel stock price at least is in the right ballpark. How Many Mistakes?There's a broader problem with the disappointing guidance, however. It's difficult for investors to trust Intel at this point, after a series of missteps. As Dana Blankenhorn pointed out last month, Intel is four years late in 10nm; Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) already is at 7nm.Last year, it was discovered its chips were susceptible to hackers. This year, chip shortages have put its datacenter lead at risk, allowing Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to take share in a market that Intel once dominated.In CPUs, Intel seems at risk as well. AMD's new Ryzen line has been a hit. Intel's shortages are frustrating customers like Dell Technologies (NASDAQ:DELL). Intel's long dominance in PCs may have allowed it to rest on its laurels; it does not, at the moment, have an answer for AMD's rise.So, can investors trust that PC revenue is going to stay flat -- when AMD clearly is taking market share? Is datacenter revenue going to rise double-digits every year when Intel can't keep up with even slower demand? Guidance was disappointing -- and it looks far from certain Intel will be able to even meet its projections.The fundamentals don't look great. The qualitative aspects look even worse. Nvidia and, in particular, AMD clearly are taking share. Intel not only doesn't have an answer right now, it actually seems to be shooting itself in the foot. Given trade war concerns and overall chip weakness, there are plenty of reasons for investors to be worried. The Intel Stock Price Can Get CheaperAll told, it's not a surprise that Intel stock has fallen so far. Indeed, it wouldn't be surprising if Intel stock fell further. 2019 expectations clearly are at risk. 2020 and 2021 growth doesn't look particularly impressive. In a chip space with no shortage of cheap stocks -- think Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), to name two -- INTC hardly looks like an attractive pick.  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy Admittedly, that could change. But it requires that Intel start fixing its mistakes -- and start improving its products. It seems we're still a ways off on both fronts. Until then, INTC is likely to trade sideways at best.As of this writing, Vince Martin has a bullish options position in Dell Technologies. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

Micron (NASDAQ:MU) jumped 5.7%, while equipment makers like Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Applied Material (NASDAQ:AMAT) rallied 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively.  Click to Enlarge Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is on investors' radar too, as it gears up to report second-quarter earnings after the close. Consensus expectations call for earnings of $1.78 per share on revenue of $2.7 billion. Those estimates suggest year-over-year growth of 18.5% and 23.2%, respectively.Finally, Microsoft is shaking off any worries about the trade war as shares hit new all-time highs. MSFT closed at $135.16, up 1.74%,  while rallying almost 10% so far this month. Bottom Line on the Nasdaq TodayThe trade war is what dragged the Nasdaq from its all-time highs in early May. But a resolution is likely what will vault the index back up to them. The markets came into June in an oversold condition, but the bounce was most telling. After the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow all rallied to start the month, the bears weren't able to push it back down.That action is important, suggesting that a larger rally was brewing after some consolidation. That extension could be taking place now, but we still have the Fed to get through.Fed Chair Powell has not been the smoothest talker when it comes to FOMC events, so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts tomorrow. A dovish Fed could ignite stocks even higher, while a hawkish Fed could undo many of today's nice gains. The same rally/puke potential exists with the President's Twitter account.All said, it was a very strong day for the Nasdaq today, although Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was a noteworthy laggard.The social media giant finally announced its Libra cryptocurrency. While this was anything but a secret, it was interesting to see FB give up all of its Tuesday gains. Ending slightly lower on the day, down 29 basis points, is not what many investors had in mind given the strength in tech.The bottom line: Watch the Fed on Wednesday.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-18,"Chip stocks have been on a volatile ride over the past year as investors have struggled to grapple with where exactly the semiconductor industry goes next.The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) rallied to all-time highs in mid-2018 as the industry broadly benefited from record cloud data-center spend, steady PC and smartphone growth, strong global auto growth and burgeoning demand in the AI and IoT end-markets. But, in late 2018, the SOXX ETF tumbled more than 25% on concerns that a slowing global economy was going killing all that robust demand, at the same time that supply was building across the whole sector.Chip stocks shrugged off those fears in early 2019. As the global economy stabilized and recession fears disappeared, so did concerns regarding a slowdown in the semiconductor space. The SOXX ETF rallied back to all-time highs by late April 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThen, another sell-off began. Trade tensions re-escalated. Recession fears came back. So did concerns surrounding global semi demand. Chip stocks sold off. They remain in selloff mode today. As of this writing, the SOXX ETF trades 15% off its April 2019 highs.What's next in this wild trip for chip stocks? Tough to say. But, it is easy to say that these stocks are broadly staring at big demand headwinds in 2019.The PC and smartphone markets globally are flattening out, because everyone who wants either a computer or a smartphone, already has one. Global auto sales are dropping, especially in China, as consumers continue to express caution with the global economy slowing. Big tech companies are likewise acting more cautiously, and record data-center spend in 2018 is coming down in 2019.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Net net, the backdrop isn't great for chip stocks right now. As such, investors should be cautious when considering an investment in any of the following chip stocks. Micron (MU)Source: Shutterstock One of the riskiest chip stocks here and now is memory chip giant Micron (NASDAQ:MU), for the simple reason that the memory market is notoriously and violently cyclical.In the memory market, it's all about supply-demand fundamentals. When demand is high and supply is low, memory chip prices are high, and memory chip-makers make boat loads of profits. But, when demand is low and supply is high, memory chip prices are low, and memory chip-makers make no profits. Unfortunately, supply and demand in the memory market cycle often and dramatically. Eras of high demand and low supply are usually followed by eras of low demand and high supply. Just look at a chart of Micron's profits or stock price over the past two decades.Right now, we are in the process of the memory market going form high demand and low supply, and to rising supply and falling demand. The rising supply part seems to be moderating. But, the falling demand part isn't moderating, mostly because rising geopolitical tensions continue to dilute memory chip demand. So long as that remains true, Micron's profits will continue to drop, and so will MU stock.As such, until the global memory market demand picture turns positive, MU stock will have a tough time staging a big turnaround. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Shutterstock One of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), is not exempt from the macro factors diluting demand across the global semi industry.Broadcom just reported solid second-quarter numbers, which broadly topped expectations and included double-digit revenue growth alongside healthy margin expansion. But, management also delivered a significantly sub-par, full-year guide thanks to what they are calling a &quot;broad-based slowdown in the demand environment&quot;. The culprit? Rising geopolitical uncertainties that are causing customers to reduce inventory levels.So long as this slowdown persists, AVGO stock will have a tough time rallying. The stock isn't particularly cheap here relative to its historical standard, at 12-times forward earnings today versus a five-year average forward multiple of 13. As such, you have a stock with not-so-good, go-forward fundamentals, trading at a historically average valuation.  * The 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 That's not a great combo. Until this stock gets cheaper -- or until the fundamentals improve -- AVGO stock will likely fail to rally. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock The story at Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is riddled with question marks. All those question marks against the backdrop of a depressed semi market backdrop could keep QCOM stock stuck in neutral for the foreseeable future.Qualcomm scored a huge win recently, when Apple settled with the chip giant, paid the company a huge lump sum royalty payment and came back on as a Qualcomm customer. Shortly after that, though, it was ruled that Qualcomm's patent royalty practices violated U.S. antitrust law. That's a big deal, since most of Qualcomm's profits come from the high-margin licensing business. The ruling broadly implies that the licensing business is going to have to change, and in a way that will probably dilute profits.Consequently, investors are stuck asking themselves exactly what Qualcomm's licensing business will look like in a few years. The truth is, no one knows. Investors don't like uncertainty. They especially don't like uncertainty when it comes against the backdrop of a depressed macro semi market struggling with falling demand and geopolitical tensions.To be sure, none of these issues will last for QCOM stock. The stock does look like a good long-term buy here, since long-term fundamentals are healthy. But, near-term uncertainty will ultimately keep QCOM stock depressed for the foreseeable future. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: AMD The story at Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a bit different than the story supporting other chip stocks at the current moment.Specifically, the story at AMD is actually much better. AMD has taken an innovation lead over competitor Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market, and it has leveraged that innovation lead to rapidly grow market share over the past several quarters. This market share expansion has driven out-sized revenue growth and margin expansion, which has produced robust profit growth. This market share expansion narrative projects to persist for the foreseeable future, meaning AMD should continue to report pretty good numbers.But, this market share expansion is happening in a market that's struggling with falling demand. At the core of this falling demand is reduced cloud data-center spend from the titans of tech. This spend reduction is a temporary phenomena. But, so long as it lasts, AMD's numbers won't be as good as they need to be, to support the stock's near 50-times forward multiple.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 As such, while the story at AMD is better than the story for other chip stocks, the stock is not exempt from macro demand headwinds, and those macro demand headwinds could ultimately hinder the richly valued AMD stock from rallying much further. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to shares of GPU giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), you have a situation of near-term pain and long-term gain.In the near term, Nvidia will continue to struggle with inventory and pricing issues as cloud data-center spend moderates against the backdrop of a slowing global economy and rising geopolitical tensions. So long as these inventory and pricing issues remain, revenue growth at Nvidia will remain tepid, while margins will remain under pressure. NVDA stock will struggle to rally.In the long term, Nvidia will work through these inventory and pricing issues since secular tailwinds support robust demand for the next several years in the data and AI-related markets that Nvidia services. Once those issues are cleared, big revenue growth will come back into the picture, as will margin expansion. This combination will power healthy profit growth, and that healthy profit growth will drive NVDA stock higher.Net net, the situation at Nvidia is one defined by near-term pain and long-term gain. Thus, depending on your time horizon, NVDA stock is either an avoid here, or a good buy. Texas Instruments (TXN)Source: Shutterstock Over at semiconductor giant Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), you have a chip stock that has worrisome exposure to the slowing global auto market.Texas Instruments views the industrial and auto markets as the best markets in the semiconductor space, and as such, has focused their resources on maximizing exposure to those markets. Over 50% of revenues now come from the auto and industrial markets. Four to five years ago, that number hovered around 40%.The problem here is that the auto market is fading globally. China auto sales have been tumbling for several months. The U.S. auto market has been weak lately, even with low interest rates. The European auto market is seeing declines for the first time since 2013. Broadly, after several years of red-hot growth, the global auto market is in retreat, and that's not good news for Texas Instruments.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold At the same time, TXN stock isn't cheap for a semi stock, trading at 20-times forward earnings. That combination of a not-cheap valuation and mounting headwinds in the company's most important market, ultimately means that TXN stock may not have much room for further upside in the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long QCOM and INTC.

2019-06-18,"It’s no secret that the markets overall are on a tear. The S&P 500 is up 15.1% year-to-date, while the NASDAQ is up 17.7%. Investor profits are following suit, unemployment is low, and times are good.We’d be fools not to admit all of that, but equally foolish to ignore some clouds gathering off in the distance, a spot of fog here, a patch of mist there. It hasn’t coalesced yet, but warning signs are showing up. We’ll open up the TipRanks database and take a look at three of those warnings, major companies that are sending out bearish markers in the boom. Some of these markers apply to the economy at large, while others are very much company-specific, but there’s plenty to learn from the flashing yellow lights. Boeing Company (BA)First up is the world’s largest aerospace corporation, the fifth-largest defense contractor, and the United States’ largest exporter. Boeing has long been a staple of investing portfolios, offering steady profits, reliable equity gains, and an excellent dividend. But this past March, BA shares dropped sharply and have been unable to regain traction since.The immediate reason is well known: the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 aircraft, the second such crash of that model in less than 5 months. The accident was attributed to the same cause as the earlier October 2017 crash in Indonesia. Everyone aboard each flight was killed, and in the wake of the second accident, the world’s operational 737 MAX 8 aircraft have been grounded.Boeing has the resources to weather this setback, but is suffering from two exacerbating factors. First, the 737 is the company’s most popular commercial aircraft model, a long-time workhorse in the narrow-body airliner segment, and the MAX 8 is Boeing’s newest and most popular version of this venerable design. Halting production is a major hit to the bottom line. And second, company management has badly handled the PR around the MAX 8.The production issue is likely to work itself out, given time. Crash investigators – from the airlines, from governments, and from Boeing – have traced the cause of both accidents to a flaw in the autopilot software, and the company says it has already worked out a software patch. Once they have gained regulatory approval, and installed the fix, production and deliver of 737 MAX 8 aircraft can resume.The second issue, management’s failure at PR, is probably less easy to address. A long report in Forbes magazine, back in March, showed how Boeing’s initial response led to exactly the wrong public perception: that the company was putting liability and profit above lives. More recently, company CEO Dennis Muilenburg, referring to the MAX 8, said on June 17, at the Paris airshow, “We’ll get it back in the air when it’s safe.” While emphasizing the right them – safety and lives – his statement is still taken as tacit admission that the company was in the wrong.The result can be seen in both product sales and market performance. Boeing recorded a total of 0 new orders on the first day at Paris (while competitor Airbus tallied 123), and BA shares are down 15.7% since March 8 (the last trading session before the Ethiopian Air accident).  News coverage of Boeing has been decidedly negative over past weeks, with TipRanks data showing that bearish articles make up 61% of the total. Unsurprisingly, investor sentiment is also negative, with individual portfolios in the TipRanks database showing a net pullback from BA.Despite all of this, a majority of Wall Street’s analysts see hope for Boeing. Bottom line, there are only two mega-cap commercial airliner producers in the world, and Boeing is the larger of them. This is a company that is, literally, too big to fail. With that in mind, Cowen’s Cai Rumohr (Track Record & Ratings), a five-star analyst and long-time expert on the aerospace industry, gave Boeing a ‘Buy’ rating and a $460 price target. His target suggests a 29% upside to the stock.Overall, despite the bearish signals, BA stock still has a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus. The average price target, $436, gives a 23% upside compared to the share price of $354.View BA Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)The microchip industry has been giving mixed signals for years, despite the high profitability of its industry leaders. Broadcom is the world’s sixth-largest semiconductor chip company, with over $18 billion in sales last year, and it just released Q2 earnings, showing year-over-year revenue growth of 10% and an EPS beat of 1%. On the debit side, revenues did not grow enough, as the $5.52 billion reported was almost 3% lower than the $5.68 billion expected. Worse than the revenue miss, however, was the downward revision of full-year revenue guidance, from $24.5 billion to $22.5 billion. AVGO shares slipped almost 8% after the earnings report went public.Blame China, tariffs, and Trump. There are recent indications of a slowing Chinese economy, and Apple (AAPL) has revised iPhone sales forecasts down to compensate. The widely publicized trade dispute between President Trump and China has resulted in a spate of tit-for-tat protective tariffs which have been impacted trade figures in both countries. At the same time, Trump took action to limit Chinese telecom giant Huawei from purchasing US technology. Approximately 3% of Broadcom’s sales revenue comes from Huawei deals.Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, did not try to sugarcoat the situation, laying it out in the earnings conference call: “We currently see a broad-based slowdown in the demand environment, which we believe is driven by continued geopolitical uncertainties, as well as the effects of export restrictions on one of our largest customers. As a result, our customers are actively reducing their inventory levels, and we are taking a conservative stance for the rest of the year.”Despite the cautionary tone of Broadcom’s management, the pullbacks from investors, and sympathetic drops in other major chip stocks (INTC lost 1.1%, NVDA slipped 2.4%), top analysts are not ready to call it quits on Broadcom. Tech sector expert Vijay Rakesh (Track Record & Ratings), of Mizuho Securities, acknowledged all of those factors, but still saw reason for optimism: “Looking into 2020, a resolution of geopolitical tensions and bans could drive a mean reversion in stronger demand and inventory build.” Rakesh sets a $330 price target on AVGO shares, for a 24% upside.Broadcom still has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus, even after the earnings report, based on 23 buy and 4 hold ratings given over the past three months. Shares sell for $265, and the average price target of $313 gives the stock an upside potential of 17%.View AVGO Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Walt Disney Company (DIS)Our final bearish signal comes from Disney. The entertainment giant has seen its stocks take off this year, gaining 29% since January. Theme parks and movies, including the enormously successful “Avengers: Endgame,” have kept the company solidly in the black, while operational control of streaming service Hulu and the announcement of the new Disney+ online channel have kept investors and customers alike interested in the company’s future. It looks golden.But…Imperial Capital analyst David Miller (Track Record & Ratings) yesterday gave Disney a rare piece of bad news. He downgraded his rating of the stock, from ‘Buy’ to ‘Neutral.’ He offers several points supporting a lower rating to DIS shares:&gt; The core rationale for lowering our rating … is simply due to the fact that the stock has performed consistent with our previous Outperform rating – up by 25.7% since we established that rating on 11/21/18, and ahead of the S&P 500, which is up 7.8% in that same span of time. Most of the catalysts we focused on at the time of that ratings change: the film slate (specifically the release of Avenger’s Endgame), the opening of the two Star Wars lands, the disposal of the Regional Sports Networks (RSNs), the Disney+ analyst day, and the re-financing of the various 21st Century Fox legacy debt tranches, have either happened, or are set to happen, and at a record multiple on 2021 earnings, are pretty much built in to the stock, in our view.Miller held his price target steady, at $147, which is 4.28% over current trading levels.So far, Miller is alone in his bearish outlook on DIS. Most analysts are focused on the company’s proven record of generating profits, especially through blockbuster movies. Miller, however, points out an important negative factor going forward, that has not yet sunk into the general consciousness, adding to his above comment: “Disney+ and streaming service Hulu are not expected to break even until 2024.”Perhaps the most important point here, for investors, is that Disney’s strong gains this year have caught it up to its price target. Where the company had an upside potential above 25% six months ago, the share price of $140 and the average target of $154 now give an upside of just 9.4%. The analyst consensus is still a ‘Strong Buy,’ as DIS has received 14 buys and 4 holds in the last three months.View DIS Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail",3 Blue Chip Stocks on the Bears’ Radar

2019-06-18,"Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) situation continues to deteriorate. With its margins waning and its revenue and profitability falling, MU stock price has fallen meaningfully from its highs. Just two months ago in April, Micron stock was trying to break out and exceed $45. What happened?Source: Shutterstock While the trade war was seemingly heading towards a friendly resolution a few months ago, a tweet from President Trump sent those assumptions down the drain. The tweet sank the stock market, as the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) calmly shed 11.5% in the month of May.However, it's had a much more devastating impact on semiconductors, chip makers and memory producers. For instance, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tumbled more than 23% in May, MU stock dropped almost 26% from peak to trough and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) dropped roughly 18%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less Comments that Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) made in conjunction with its second-quarter results didn't help. On Thursday evening, the chip maker said it expects first-half headwinds to persist in the second half of the year, after previously expecting them to lift. That caused Broadcom to issue full-year revenue guidance that was well below analysts' average estimate ($22.5 billion vs. $24.31 billion), inflicting even more pain on the group. What About the Valuation of Micron Stock?Too many people look at MU stock and assume it's a buy because of its low valuation. Many understand how price-earnings (P/E) ratios work, but some don't. They see Micron stock trading at four or five times its earnings and say, &quot;That's a buy to me!&quot;What they don't consider is the very basic equation of the P/E ratio. Quite simply, the ratio is price divided by earnings. When a company's stock falls and its earnings stay flat, its valuation or P/E ratio falls, making it more attractive. However, when companies' earnings fall, their stocks become more expensive.When both price and earnings fall -- which is what's been happening to Micron -- the  company's P/E can remain almost constant. Last July, MU stock was trading at almost $60. Analysts' average estimate called for earnings of almost $12 per share during the fiscal year, giving MU stock a forward P/E ratio of about five. Fast forward to June 2019 and the  forward consensus earnings estimate has cratered almost 50%, down to $6.35 per share. So, too, has the stock price, which is also down almost 50%.That's not surprising. The decline in estimates, in conjunction with the decline of MU stock, has kept the P/E ratio relatively constant. Thus, MU stock isn't that much cheaper now than it was in the past. Micron's Underlying BusinessNAND memory is a component of Micron's business, making up roughly 30% of its total revenue last quarter. However, another form of memory, DRAM, is the largest piece of MU's pie, making up 64% of its total revenue.Micron's President and CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, said this about  NAND and DRAM:&quot;NAND markets remain oversupplied from the acceleration in bit growth driven by the industry transition to 64-layer 3D NAND. Although fiscal Q2 pricing came in below our expectations, we are optimistic that demand elasticity and seasonal trends will support improving demand growth in the second half of the calendar year.Since our last earnings call, DRAM pricing weakened more than expected. Our demand outlook for calendar 2019 has moderated, led by somewhat greater levels of customer inventory, weakening server demand at several enterprise OEM customers and worse-than-expected CPU shortages.&quot;Other executives have made unfavorable observations about memory:Anthony Neri, president and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NASDAQ:HPE): &quot;So the overall commodity environment continue to be favorable and there is an oversupply now compared to last year's as you recall there was shortages and costs going up. The DRAM prices are down.&quot;Dion Weisler, CEO of HP Inc (NASDAQ:HPQ): &quot;I think broadly speaking, we have seen some easing  around the overall supply chain costs in the basket of commodities and logistics.&quot;Kelly Kramer, CFO of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), also said the company was benefiting from reduced DRAM prices. Trading MU Stock  Click to EnlargeMicron's price action was very discouraging last week , with MU stock topping out near $36. It's now down about 8% from those levels.If MU stock falls below Friday's lows, it could be in some trouble. Those lows buoyed Micron stock in late May and early June. If they can't do so now, then MU stock could tumble to $30. If the selling pressure doesn't relent, it could continue even lower.Now that semis and tech have caught a bid, see if Micron can hurdle $34 and its 20-day moving average. Otherwise, Micron stock looks risky on the long side in the short-term, particularly with a percolating trade war.With all that said, Micron is a boom-bust company. When its business is tough -- like now -- the ride is rough for investors. When its business is good -- and it eventually will be -- MU stock will be a huge winner. Even if MU slides further from here, it will likely be a good hold over the long term. DRAM and NAND aren't going anywhere, and neither is MU stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long NVDA.

2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of semiconductor companies rallied on Tuesday as optimism that trade tensions between the U.S. and China could be easing pushed investors to look past a growing consensus that an industry rebound is unlikely to occur in the second half of the year.The Philadelphia semiconductor index advanced as much as 5%, compared with a 1.4% increase in the S&P 500 Index. Among notable gainers, Nvidia Corp. rose 6.8% while Micron Technology Inc. jumped 6.8% and Western Digital Corp. added 6.4%. Texas Instruments Inc. gained 4.2% while Intel Corp. rose 4%.The advance came after President Donald Trump said he had a “very good” phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that he would hold an “extended meeting” with him at the G-20 meeting. Trump had previously threatened to raise tariffs if Xi didn’t sit with him at next week’s meeting in Japan.Chipmakers have been highly correlated to the trade issue, as the companies derive a hefty percentage of their revenue from China. The country is also a key part of their supply chains. Recently, semiconductor volatility rose after the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei, a major consumer to a number of semiconductor companies. Last week, Broadcom Inc. cut its full-year sales forecast because of trade risks and its Huawei exposure.“Huawei casts a large shadow,” Stifel analysts wrote on Tuesday. “There is no getting around its significance.” Analyst Brian Chin lowered his estimates for a number of semiconductor companies for the second half of the year, saying that the industry’s “malaise” in May was “now too acute to ignore.”That view was echoed by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets in a report dated June 17. The firm wrote that “the recent U.S./China trade war escalation, including the Huawei ban, has dashed hopes for a 2H recovery for broad-based semiconductors.” Analyst Weston Twigg added that a trip to Asia “left us more cautious” on the industry, and that there was an “increased risk to forward estimates” as the trade dispute “has led to a meaningful decline in bookings.”Deutsche Bank analysts recently returned from an Asia trip of their own, emerging “more cautious on the semiconductor and semicap sectors” as a result, “especially given that the often promised H2 rebound is looking increasingly optimistic.”Analyst Rob Sanders wrote that trade tensions were “significantly elevating uncertainty surrounding near- and mid-term business conditions,” and that “in most instances, this uncertainty is acting as a headwind to demand.”The escalation in trade-related tensions came at a time when the industry has already been struggling with weak demand and high inventory levels. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, total semiconductor sales sank 17.7% in April, its most recent month of data.To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Jennifer Bissell-Linsk, Richard RichtmyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Chipmakers Surge as Trade Optimism Offsets Analyst Caution

2019-06-19,"After Tuesday's big rally, Wednesday's session was muted most of the day, but it wasn't boring. What moved the Nasdaq today? As is typically the case on FOMC meeting days, the Federal Reserve was on everyone's radar.Source: Shutterstock While the market was pricing in a roughly 25% chance of a rate cut this month, it was no surprise that the Fed held steady. But that doesn't mean they will continue to do so going forward. According to the Fed Funds futures, there's a 77% chance that the Fed will cut rates next month. Further, the market is pricing in a 62% chance that the Fed cuts twice by its September meeting.On some level, that feels bearish given that the Fed shouldn't be cutting rates in a healthy environment. That said, with the U.S. economy mostly humming along, investors don't want to fight the Fed. If it's willing to be accommodative and dovish, investors don't want to be stubborn.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: UBER, JBL, ADBE, SHOP That can be a boon for tech stocks, which tend to thrive in a low interest rate environment. If that ends up being the case, look for the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) to benefit. Wednesday's WinnersChip stocks, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) held up well on Wednesday after Tuesday's powerful rally. Should the trade-war rhetoric continue to improve, the semiconductors should continue to see upside.Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) jumped more than 5% in Wednesday's session, after the company beat on earnings and revenue expectations. However, management's outlook for next quarter came up short of expectations, which makes today's rally somewhat peculiar. It appears that investors are willing to give ADBE the benefit of the doubt and seem to like the partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Speaking of MSFT, shares hit yet another new highs on the day, after doing so on Tuesday as well.Jabil Inc (NYSE:JBL) jumped double digits on the day, rising more than 10% after better-than-expected earnings. Non-GAAP earnings of 57 cents per share was in-line with expectations, while revenue of $6.14 billion beat consensus estimates by $130 million and grew 12.9% year-over-year. Now, the stock is flirting with a major multi-year breakout.T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) tacked on another 2.4% gain on Thursday, as it looks increasingly likely that it will get the green light from the DoJ to acquire Sprint (NYSE:S). The latter rose 3% on the same optimism, as reports peg Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) as the likely suitor to buy the duo's asset sales, which are necessary for regulatory approval.Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) jumped 7.5% to new highs following a positive take from its investor meeting. The stock hit another new all-time high on the day as the Shopify train just keeps on rolling. Should shares hit $356, it will be a triple from the December lows. The LosersVideo game stocks struggled on Wednesday, led lower by Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which fell about 1%. Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) ended flat after a strong last hour of trading, while Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) ending higher on the day despite a lower open. The group was under pressure Wednesday following video game sales data showing an 11% year-over-year decline for May, while hardware sales slumped 20%.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) struggled again on Wednesday. The stock opened at its highs on Tuesday, but fell despite announcing its new cryptocurrency. That selling continued today, with the stock down 0.53%.

Or will investors sell the market lower despite the Fed's accommodative stance?Let price be the guide. If Wednesday's closing action is any indication, buyers want in on the market heading into the early part of summer.What I really want to see how is how the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones trade through the rest of the week. While they rose 0.42%, 0.33% and 0.15% on Wednesday, respectively, I want to see if the move has staying power.

Over the past month, Qualcomm stock is off by 16.54%, a loss that is more than 1,000 basis points worse than the decline by the widely followed PHLX Semiconductor index over the same period.Many of the recent ills endured by Qualcomm stock are attributable to the company's relationship with the controversial Chinese company Huawei, which was recently blacklisted by U.S. regulators.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;While coverage surrounding the U.S. government's Huawei ban has focused primarily on how the Chinese tech giant will be affected, it's worth remembering that the company's U.S. suppliers also stand to lose a great deal of money in the fallout of President Trump's executive order,&quot; reported TechRadar.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Coming down hard on a Chinese company can make for good politics, but there are consequences for American companies, too, particularly in the technology sector. In fact, Qualcomm and rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are among the firms lobbying hard against the Huawei ban.Other Qualcomm rivals, notably Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), are delivering glum earnings or revenue guidance, citing the China trade war. Issues Besides ChinaMay was a bad month for QCOM stock for reasons besides China. Actually, trade tensions were more like another sour ingredient to an already-toxic cocktail that was Qualcomm stock last month. The shares were hit by a double-digit loss on May 24 after U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled in favor of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in an antitrust action it brought against Qualcomm.The judge ruled the company used its strong position in the wireless chip market to charge excessive royalties for its patents, unlawfully hurting competition, Barron's reported.Of course, Qualcomm is appealing that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, representing yet another legal overhang for QCOM stock and that means uncertainty and there's nothing that markets hate more than uncertainty.&quot;We fully expect Qualcomm to appeal this ruling and try to get the injunctive remedies put off,&quot; said Morningstar analysts. &quot;We don't believe Qualcomm's recent licensing agreement with Apple is at risk, yet. That said, we are lowering our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Qualcomm from $80 to $72 and increasing our uncertainty rating to very high as we believe there is too much up in the air related to this ruling and the ongoing Huawei-related issues.&quot;Swap &quot;ucertainty&quot; for &quot;lack of clarity,&quot; and that's how other analysts are viewing Qualcomm stock right following the company's legal scrap with the FTC.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 &quot;What is clear is that this decision was entirely unexpected and the impact on the business model could be material, assuming QCOM loses on appeal,&quot; said Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse. &quot;No changes to our rating and price target now as we await more clarity, but there is no doubt this decision will drive shares lower and potentially keep investors (again) on the sidelines until there is more clarity to the certainty of QCOM's royalty and chipset businesses. We will come back as soon as we have more clarity.&quot; Bottom Line on QCOM Stock: A Lot Of RisksOn a technical basis, QCOM stock has support at $69, but a violation of that area could result in a decline down to the 200-day moving average more than 9% away.The company's next earnings report is due on July 24 and analysts are expecting Qualcomm to post earnings of 62 cents a share. Should negative guidance, a la Broadcom, emerge, QCOM stock would likely be punished.Additionally, Qualcomm stock trades well below the average analyst price target of almost $89, meaning that if the sell-side starts revising that forecast down, with several negative revisions in a condensed period of time, the shares will sag.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-21,"Support has held for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares again. In late May, the Nvidia stock price dipped below $135. As was the case in November, late December, and late January, NVDA stock rebounded.Source: Nvidia There has been some outside help, admittedly. Progress on the trade war with China has boosted the entire chip sector. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite looks like it's targeting new all-time highs. But at least for now, the market seems to have a threshold where it decides the Nvidia stock price is just too cheap.The question now is whether that support can hold again, if tested. And that comes down to the chipmaker's performance in the second half of its fiscal 2020. That starts about six weeks from now. This is a second-half story, as I've written earlier this year and as NVDA management itself has insisted.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf management is right, the rally could keep going. I remain skeptical, given long-term risks. Plus, the short-term news of late looks mixed. NVDA Stock and the Second HalfTo be sure, it's widely known that NVDA relies on a second-half recovery. Management made that case after fiscal-fourth-quarter results. They even took the unusual step of offering full-year guidance to highlight the dichotomy between the first and second half.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal So far, Nvidia continues to sing the same tune. CFO Colette Kress reiterated on Q1's conference call in mid-May that &quot;we expect a stronger second half than the first.&quot; Last week, at an investment conference, she said much the same regarding data-center demand.There are two factors at play here. First-half results last year, in the company's fiscal 2019, were enormously impressive. In retrospect, those results were driven by demand for cryptocurrency mining. In the first half of this year, Nvidia faces very difficult comparisons. It's also suffering from what the company itself has called a &quot;crypto hangover.&quot; At the same time, data-center demand has slowed, as key customers paused spending.In the second half, however, the situation reverses. Comparisons get easier, particularly in Q4. And data-center growth -- as Kress said last week -- should return. And so the Street at least sees revenue declining 18% in Q2 and 6% in Q3 before a sharp rebound (+47%) in Q4 sets up 20% growth in fiscal 2021. The Importance of the RecoveryThe question now is whether that recovery is on the way. And it's not just a matter of NVDA earnings rebounding a quarter or two early -- or a quarter or two late.First, management's credibility is at stake. Last year, Nvidia clearly misjudged cryptocurrency demand both financially and operationally. The company didn't see the drop-off in sales coming. Unfortunately, it overproduced GPUs, leading to an inventory glut in the first half of this year. Another broken promise will make Nvidia a &quot;show me&quot; story for some time to come.Secondly, data-center demand in particular must come back quickly. That's an area where investors see years of double-digit growth ahead. A longer slowdown will raise fears that demand issues aren't short-term, but rather a sign that investors (and management) simply overestimated the market opportunity.And third, Nvidia has an opportunity to take share from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in that market. Intel is dealing with shortages and a number of other unforced errors. Its leadership team seems more cautious about second-half demand. If Nvidia sees a recovery and Intel doesn't, that's a sign that Intel's dominance in that market is eroding further. That leaves NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) likely picking up share. But Is It en Route?Is that recovery on the way? We'll see. CFO Kress' sentiment toward data center, and similar comments from another Nvidia executive regarding AI a week before, unquestionably are good news. We don't know exactly how clear is Nvidia's visibility into Q3 and Q4. However, the company hasn't backed off its forecast yet.On the other hand, chip giant Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) sounded much more cautious after its fiscal Q2 report last week. The day before, Evercore (NYSE:EVR) pushed its forecast for a recovery well into 2020. As MarketWatch noted after Nvidia earnings last month, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) CEO Steve Sanghi &quot;lightly walked back&quot; his call of a bottom in chips.To be sure, Nvidia doesn't necessarily play in the same markets as those other chipmakers. It's possible NVDA could follow the bullish trajectory while the rest of the space stays stuck near the bottom of the cycle. Still, after the debacle last year, it's wise to take Nvidia management's projections with a grain of salt.With Nvidia stock still off the lows, there is a case to stay patient. After all, the recovery can come in Q4 FY2020 or Q3 FY2021. NVDA still isn't that expensive on an earnings basis, though it's not cheap by chip standards. The long-term growth drivers -- data center, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving -- are mostly in place.But AMD is rising as a real competitor. I personally still see self-driving cars as a long way off. And investor patience is likely going to wane if NVDA is overpromising again. Nvidia stock has bounced off support several times. It won't be able to do so forever.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ten months ago, I warned that storm clouds were brewing over the global technology industry. The situation today is much worse.Back then, a U.S.-China trade war was more risk than reality, Apple Inc.’s pending iPhone update held promise, and central banks were still in tightening mode. Yet inventories at the end of June 2018 had climbed to the highest since the financial crisis a decade earlier and a sector-wide slowdown was looming.At the time, the Pollyannas were louder than the Chicken Littles. The next iPhone had yet to launch and Christmas shopping season was coming, argued the optimists.Since then, global technology companies have issued loud warnings about lost sales due to U.S. actions against Huawei Technologies Inc. In short, because the U.S. is restricting what can be sold to the Chinese giant, the company and its suppliers are cutting orders. This is causing a ripple effect from semiconductor materials supplier IQE Plc to chip designer Broadcom Inc.But there’s something you need to know about the Huawei effect: It isn’t the cause of this technology recession. If anything, the company is the reason why the situation didn’t worsen earlier. The U.S. war on Huawei propped up the tech sector, notably semiconductors, over the past year.Let me explain. Immediately after the Trump administration in May blacklisted Huawei from buying U.S. components, Bloomberg News reported that the maker of telecommunications equipment and smartphones had been been stockpiling components in anticipation of some kind of action. Chairman Ren Zhengfei saw his own storm brewing and started saving for the rainy day that came on May 17.This tells us that some proportion of global component demand over the past year wasn’t led by end-product sales, but merely by shelf-stocking. More significantly, what revenue component makers did see was probably a false signal, pointing to demand that didn’t exist.These suspicions were confirmed earlier this month when Mark Liu, chairman of made-to-order chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., told me that he wasn’t sure how much of his company's recent revenue had gone to supplying Huawei’s end-product demand versus building the Chinese company’s inventory. Almost every technology company is a client of TSMC. If Liu, who has the broadest and deepest picture of the global tech sector, can’t make out the difference between demand and inventory build, then you can be sure he’s not alone.There’s also solid data to show the scale of Huawei’s stockpiling. Total inventories climbed 33% last year. Its stash of components – measured as raw materials and works in progress – jumped 76%. At even its most optimistic, there’s no way that Huawei expected 76% revenue growth this year.Which brings us back to the sector as a whole.Here’s an update of the numbers compiled 10 months ago, based on nine leading technology hardware companies and charted by my colleague Elaine He. The results aren’t heartening:With few exceptions, inventories – measured in dollar terms or days outstanding – climbed since June 30, 2018, and were unequivocally higher than two years ago. The revenue slowdowns that have affected every corner of the hardware sector this year make this buildup ominous.Of even greater concern are data pointing to prolonged cash conversion cycles, a measure of how long companies take to turn manufactured goods into money. The only firm to see a solid dip is Apple, and that’s because it tends to generate revenue from customers before having to pay suppliers. Both TSMC and iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (aka Foxconn) have said they hold inventory on their books for their key client. Were it not for that fact, Apple’s rising inventory days outstanding would probably be even higher.A major reason for Hon Hai posting weak earnings in the first quarter was inventory provisions. Those can be reversed if products sitting on shelves get sold to consumers, Hon Hai CFO David Huang told me this month. But shipping an already-made device to meet demand means you don’t need to manufacture a new phone, which in turn means no need to buy components from suppliers, and so forth.That’s the situation we’re in now: plenty of inventory, false signals from the Huawei effect, and a pending global economic slowdown that’s likely to suppress demand. If that doesn’t make make you worry about the state of global technology hardware, then I applaud your optimism. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-07-01,"When the futures market opened to big gains on Sunday evening, there were a number of traders saying they planned to fade the open on Monday. Or at the very least, take profits in a number of long positions. Given how many people seemed to be on the fade trade, I thought it was possible that we didn't get that move in the Nasdaq today.Source: Shutterstock However, that's exactly what we got.The markets still logged solid gains, but we simply came into the open way too hot. Some were caught short or in a risk-off position coming into Monday which drew in initial buyers. But those who were long coming into Monday used the Nasdaq's early gains of almost 2% as an opportune time to hit the exits, particularly with the S&P 500 hitting new highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be fair, the Nasdaq did press above that 8,100 resistance level we mapped out on Friday. With a last-hour rally, buyers looked like they might recapture the mark. Even though bulls couldn't muster the strength, investors got off to a good start in the second half of 2019. It will be interesting to see if we run to new highs ahead of earnings, or chop/pullback into the quarterly results later this month.  Click to Enlarge Winners in the Nasdaq TodayEarnings season will pick back up in a few weeks, but until then, the news cycle may be a bit quiet. Monday's exception? Huawei.  * 3 Best Stocks to Buy After Sizable Drops The Chinese technology company was essentially blacklisted from the U.S., with American firms banned from shipping components to the company. Huawei has been suffering a massive financial burden due to trade war, but others have felt the pain too.Specifically, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have all been struggling as a result. Many were expecting a trade truce between President Trump and President Xi this weekend and that's exactly what we got. Not many thought Trump would lift the ban on supplies to Huawei though.That gave a big boost to these companies and deservedly so -- they were suffering notable losses as a result of this lost business. MU logged 4% gains (and here's how to trade it, by the way) as did AVGO. Qualcomm gave up most of its gains, but still notched 1.9% in gains on the day.For the most part, chips and semi stocks did well on the day.Also no surprise is that Chinese stocks did pretty well on Monday. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) jumped 3.3%, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) climbed 3% and Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN) ripped 7.5%. Huya (NYSE:HUYA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and even Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) climbed on the day as well.You can tell these stocks are itching to rip if and when we get a trade deal.Large cap tech also did well. MAANG -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) -- all logged nice gains on the day too. And no, that wasn't a typo with the &quot;F&quot; from FANG. Let's use it to transition to the next group… Losers in the Nasdaq TodayFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended flat on the day, which is pitiful in the face of an otherwise solid day for its peers. It joins other large cap tech stocks like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which also majorly underperformed on the day.InvestorPlace readers shouldn't be surprised by the weakness in INTC or CSCO though, given that it was emphasized last week.While Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) had good days, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) did not, falling about 2%. While other recent IPOs have done well, this one continues to struggle when it comes to finding any upside momentum.Uber (NYSE:UBER), another recent IPO, finally looked like it was breaking on Friday. In fact, it did breakout. But closing below $45 does not bode well for short-term bulls. If it can reclaim the $45 IPO price, perhaps it can make a run to its current highs near $47. Otherwise, investors should wait on Uber.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) took a tumble on Monday, falling almost 3% after it was downgraded by analysts at Goldman Sachs.

2019-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest data on semiconductor sales is pointing to stabilization in the industry, suggesting that months of weakness and tepid demand could be nearing an end, analysts said on Monday.According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, total monthly sales came in at $33 billion in May, up 7.1% from April. While the May data represented a year-over-year decline of 14.5%, it also represented a moderation from the 17.7% drop in April.“While the industry is still working through a cycle, the y/y declines appear to be decelerating,” wrote Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Given that forecasts were cut during a period where sentiment was heavily negative, we think there is upside bias to the numbers expected for 2019/2020.”The data comes at a time when analysts have been concerned about the prospects for the industry in the second half of the year, especially since the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is within 7% of record levels. A number of companies, notably Broadcom Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., have issued cautious outlooks in recent weeks.Morgan Stanley wrote that the data pointed to “some signs of life” after “an exceptionally weak April,” and noted that sales -- along with the product categories of micro, logic and memory chips -- came in ahead of its expectations. However, analyst Joseph Moore maintained his cautious view on the sector, seeing “very challenging industry conditions” despite the data.The data was also above Citi’s estimate, according to analyst Christopher Danely, who raised his full-year semiconductor sales forecast to $413.3 billion from $408.2 billion. The outlook represents a full-year decline of 12%, compared with a previous view of down 13%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose as much as 5% on Monday, though it last traded up 2% on the day. The day’s rally came as the U.S. and China declared a truce in their trade war over the weekend; President Donald Trump also said he would delay trade restrictions against Huawei Technologies Co., a major customer to a number of chipmakers.To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Morwenna ConiamFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Semiconductor Sales Data Point to ‘Signs of Life,’ Analysts Say"

2019-07-02,Bank of America says the sector will benefit from a trade deal that also eases restrictions on Huawei.,Why Bulls See Chip Stocks Rising Despite Giant Red Flags
2019-07-02,"Presidents Trump and Xi held their meeting at the G20 summit this past weekend, and came out smiling. While both governments are vague about details, their public tone has been upbeat. The conventional wisdom is that both leaders got part of what they wanted; Trump can claim success by continuing the current tariffs and getting China to resume purchasing US agricultural products, and Xi can point to the hold on further tariffs and resumption of US commercial ties to Huawei as wins. Both governments are pleased that trade negotiations will resume.The news gave markets a shot in the arm. The S&P 500 hit another all-time high on July 1, closing at 2,964, and the Dow and Nasdaq showed near-record levels. Among the biggest winners, however, were the semiconductor companies. The chip industry generally, but American chip makers especially, had been hit hard by the trade tensions. Restrictions on American imports to Huawei, and the threat of additional tariffs on Chinese trade, put intense pressure on America’s chip industry. That pressure is now reduced, and the big names in American semiconductors are rising. Let’s dip into TipRanks’ database for the details. Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)Qualcomm’s stock got a 1.9% bump after the Trump-Xi meeting, closing on July 1 at $77.52. The company’s main relief was on the Huawei front; Qualcomm was one of several chipmakers that directly lobbied the White House to ease restrictions on the Chinese telecom company’s access to US-sourced components.Maintaining trade links between American chip producers and Chinese markets is of major importance to Qualcomm. The company is exposed to China’s markets directly, through its links with Huawei, and indirectly, through its position in Apple’s supply chain. Both links are threatened by a US-China trade war, but as long as the countries talk and hold off on tit-for-tat tariffs, Qualcomm and its investors can breathe easier.QCOM’s most recent analyst review comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Faucette points out that Qualcomm’s investors “[require] a bit more mettle given its history of political and legal risks, but at current levels the stock is still worth the noise.” His comments referred to the company’s recent legal battle with Apple (AAPL), but goes on to say that QCOM can see a positive impact from an uplift in Huawei. He estimates Qualcomm’s FY2021 EPS at a robust $6.80, and gives the stock a $95 price target. This suggests an upside of 22%.Overall, QCOM shares have a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus, and an average price target of $85. With a share price of $77, this gives the stock a 10% upside potential.View QCOM Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)Micron was another winner, posting a 3.9% gain in Monday’s trading. Micron had managed to maintain its shipments to Huawei despite the restrictions imposed on the Chinese company. With that trade now less vulnerable, MU can breathe easier. Trade with Huawei makes up some 13% of Micron’s revenue stream.Easing trade tensions aren’t the only good news for MU, however. The company also posted a rosy Q3 report for FY19. Revenues were up, at $4.79 billion, and 2% above the forecast. EPS, reported at $1.05, was an impressive 33% above expectation. With a strong quarter behind it, and clearer trade with China ahead of it, it’s no wonder that Micron’s shares are rising.Wall Street’s analysts are responding to the MU’s good news as you may expect, with positive ratings on the stock. Rajvindra Gill, five-star analyst from Needham, upgraded his stance on MU, moving it from ‘hold’ to ‘buy.’ His price target, $50, suggests a 24% upside to the stock.JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur, writing just before the Trump-Xi meeting, also took an upbeat posture on Micron. Noting that the company was maintaining its links with Huawei, he added, “technology migrations and manufacturing ramps in DRAM and NAND, combined with a focus on higher value-add products, should be tailwinds to gross margins into next year.” Like Gill, Sur gave MU a $50 price target.With buys, 6 holds, and 4 sells assigned in the past three month, MU shares get a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus. The stock is currently priced at $40.11, so the $42.29 average price target indicates a potential upside of 5.4%.View MU Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Broadcom gained 4.3% after news of the successful trade meeting, making it the biggest winner among the major US chip companies. With a 5% sales exposure to Huawei, Broadcom faced a somewhat lower threat than its competitors, but the improvement in US-China relations still came as a relief. The company had predicted a $2 billion reduction in sales in 2019, had the Huawei ban remained in place.Wall Street’s analysts were cautious in their reviews of AVGO shares before the trade talks thawed. Writing from Mizuho, Vijay Rakesh specifically noted “a broad-based slowdown with geopolitical tensions, the Huawei ban, and tariff concerns in lowering its fiscal 2019 sales guidance 8%.” Looking ahead, however, Rakesh saw potential for improvement, and said, “a resolution of geopolitical tensions and bans could drive a mean reversion in stronger demand and inventory build.” Tensions have eased; AVGO’s quick market gains are a clear indication that traders agree with the analyst on near-term possibilities for gains. Rakesh’s price target, $330, suggests that those gains will be on the order of 10%.With a ‘Strong Buy’ from the analyst consensus, and a 3% average upside, Broadcom has both the best rating and the lowest potential of the stocks in this article, reflecting, perhaps, its lower-risk exposure to Huawei. Shares are priced at $300; the average price target is $308.View AVGO Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail",3 Biggest China Winners Among US Chipmakers

2019-07-03,"Like many would have expected, Wednesday's half-day trading session was relatively mellow, with stocks drifting higher throughout the day. The markets will be closed on Thursday for the Fourth of July and will reopen for a regular session on Friday. Also, don't forget we have a jobs report that day, too. Let's take a look at a few top stock trades based on Wednesday's action. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Symantec  Click to EnlargeShares of Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) are surging more than 13% on Wednesday on reports that Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is working on a deal to acquire the company. AVGO is big into the M&A game, given its immense cash flow. With SYMC's slow-and-steady growth and low valuation, it's a reasonable target for AVGO, even though investors are showing some disapproval, sending shares down by about 4% on the day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor SYMC, the rally is sending shares through that vital $24.50 area. That's great news for the stock and if it didn't have a potential buyout cap tied to it, this would be a must-buy breakout.  * 7 of the Best SPDR ETFs -- Besides SPY and GLD But either AVGO is buying the company and there's limited upside left or it's not buying it and shares will plunge from here. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Broadcom  Click to EnlargeWith Broadcom stock, though, there's a decent risk/reward setting up. However, I should mention that this one is tricky. I own AVGO for its low valuation and strong free cash flow, and bought it when its dividend yield was north of 4%. Essentially, I'm in it for the yield and solid fundamentals.From a pure trading perspective though, there may be better candidates. That's because the trade-war noise, conflicting reports on the restriction lifts on Huawei and now the potential acquisition of SYMC add more volatility into the stock. Just look at the last few days of action.In any regard, the stock is holding its 50-day moving average, while its 20-day is trending higher and just below current levels. Further, the $280 level has been notable in the past. If AVGO can hold $280 and its 20-day moving average, bulls can try to ride it back to $300.If it fails, see if the 200-day acts as support. Investors going long on this setup are risking about $4 per share and are looking for $10 to $20 in potential upside. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Kellogg  Click to EnlargeNot usually a big trading candidate, Kellogg (NYSE:K) is making waves with its almost 7% rally. The stock's up on a Barron's piece highlighting its fake-meat potential. Given the rise in Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), it's no wonder K is catching such a boost.The rally has sent shares surging through its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, with some longs looking for a potential squeeze up to the $58 area. This level has been notable in the past, while the 200-day moving average sits just above at $58.77.So what now?Investors can either wait for a pullback, perhaps down to its 50-day moving average. Otherwise, let's watch for a breakout over the $57.50 to $58 area. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Canopy Growth  Click to EnlargeThe good new or the bad news for Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) -- which do you want first? And no, the CEO's apparent firing isn't the bad news.The bad news, which we'll do first, is that CGC continues to put in a series of lower highs and lower lows. This is a bearish technical setup. The good news? CGC keeps attracting buyers in the upper-$30s and despite falling some 8% in pre-market trading, shares are actually positive on the day.Take it for what you will though, as this one tends to be volatile. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Bank of America  Click to EnlargeOh how I want to give Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) the benefit of the doubt. But the bank stocks just can't seem to catch a bid, even after the group gave a huge increase to their buybacks and dividends.Some investors ignore the chart's wicks and go by closing prices, which suggests BAC broke out this week (over that blue line). Others do use the wicks and say BAC failed to breakout (still under its purple line).What's this &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; talk? After such positive news, I want to say BAC stock is in breakout mode. For me, a strong stock gets the benefit of the doubt (it broke out), while weak stocks do not (prove it to me and re-breakout again). Unfortunately, BAC does not get the benefit of the doubt treatment from me.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice For BAC, I need to see shares over $29.50 to feel confident. Otherwise, I want to see a pullback to the $28.30 to $28.50 area hold for a dip-buy.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

If the reports are true, it will be shelling out $15.00 billion to add SYMC to its list of recent acquisitions.

2019-07-03,"Given that the U.S. stock market was only open until 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, it's no surprise that volumes were light. And given that stocks are hovering at or near all-time highs, it's no wonder that bulls used this light-volume session to notch more gains. Tech tacked on a 0.75% gain for the Nasdaq today, which is oh-so-close to new highs, while the S&P 500 also rose 0.68% to more new highs. Source: Shutterstock However, it puts us in a precarious situation heading into the end of the week. The stock market will be closed on Thursday for the Fourth of July and reopen for a regular trading session on Friday. But, it's not just a regular Friday, with the June labor report scheduled for an 8:30 a.m. ET release. Economists expect 160,000 jobs to be added to the economy and a beat would usually be good news. In this case though, a beat could drive investors to the conclusion that the Fed will not raise rates later this month. A miss will almost surely trigger bulls to buy stocks on the premise that the Fed will certainly cut rates. After all, the market is pricing it in. It's more of a &quot;how much&quot; will the cut be, rather than will the Fed actually do it. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJustified or not, that's our current market.  News in the Nasdaq TodayThe big news is that Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is apparently in the middle of trying to acquire Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC). These reports have thrust shares of SYMC higher, surging more than 13% on the day and past the key $25 level. Shares of Broadcom fell more than 4% on the report, as shares now teeter on a key level.   * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice In any regard, the deal emphasizes a few things. The first, Broadcom is continuing its M&A strategy. Before news broke, shares of SYMC were trading at less than 13 times current earnings, giving it a nice, low valuation for AVGO. Symantec sports high-single-digit earnings growth expectations this year and next, and generates solid cash flow. The deal also emphasizes Broadcom's focus on shifting to software and services, relying less and less on hardware. Speaking on the deal, analyst Dan Ives said, &quot;If Broadcom goes down this route we believe there are some significant synergies and cost cutting on the enterprise side, coupled with a cash cow machine on the consumer front.&quot; Analysts from Piper Jaffray and Bernstein also felt good about the deal, so maybe AVGO will be due for a bounce once investors digest the news. The other big news? Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) big delivery report. Last quarter, the company delivered about 63,000 vehicles. The big shortfall crimped profits and squeezed cash flow. Management pegged logistic headaches as the main issue and said it would deliver between 90,000 and 100,000 vehicle in the second quarter. Consensus expectations were looking for anything between 88,000 and 90,700. The final tally? 95,200 deliveries. It sent shares higher by 7% in early trading, which faded to a gain of &quot;just&quot; 4.6%. Part of that fade may be because the company's press release did not comment on full-year guidance or when it would get back to profitability and positive cash flow.  The news also pushed Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) stock higher, which ripped 11%. That's not completely surprisingly, as we mapped out this recently strong name just the other day.  Other Winners in the Nasdaq TodayThere weren't many losers in the Nasdaq today, but we saw some strong winners. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) remains one of the strongest names out there. Shares didn't flinch in the fourth quarter and have continued to move higher in 10 of the last 12 months. The stock is up 36% so far in 2019 and is up over 78% over the past 12 months. What a beast. Ever since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its Libra cryptocurrency plans, shares have been on fire. Of course, it helps that bitcoin has been pretty hot too. Still, shares are less than $1 away from taking out the April highs, which could ignite a rally to fill the gap back up toward $215. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is also flirting with a move higher. Not all of FANG has been strong, but NFLX is trying to do its part, with a potential move over $380 resistance. It helps that the Nasdaq is adding to its gains over the past few sessions. The index's highs are now on the table as it maintains above the key 8,100 level.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Let's see where the jobs report leaves us.

Semis received further help as President Trump eased restrictions on selling to Huawei.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer On the surface, one can easily understand why MU stock surged so much. Few other American companies depend more on China than does Micron. Currently, Micron's revenue exposure to China stands at 66%, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). At least for now, this truce brings Micron less uncertainty.Micron stock has also moved ahead since announcing earnings on June 25. The company beat lowered estimates on both revenue and profits. This took MU higher by almost 22.75% over the course of four trading sessions. Micron Profits, Expenditures DroppingUnfortunately for MU stock bulls, Micron remains the same company that has traded on memory chip cycles for as long as anyone can remember. Every indication shows the cycle moving down. Last quarter's earnings of $1.05 per share beat estimates by 27 cents per share. However, the company earned $3.15 in the same quarter the previous year. Likewise, revenues of $4.79 billion dropped by 38.6% year-over-year.Our own Ian Bezek believes that people who buy MU stock after these earnings reports will be disappointed. I agree. Bezek also took this quote from Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra that tells traders everything they need to know about the short-term future of Micron stock.&quot;Micron's improved competitive position and strong execution helped us deliver solid results despite a challenging environment. While we are seeing early signs of demand improvement, we plan to reduce our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 to help improve industry supply-demand balance.&quot; Micron Is a Memory Price ProxyIn many previous articles, I called MU stock a proxy for memory prices. Reduced expenditures indicate both revenue and profits will continue to fall. Analysts also outline this in their earnings forecasts. These predictions have gradually decreased over the last 90 days.However, over the previous seven days, earnings estimates for fiscal 2020 fell from $4.27 per share to just $2.68 per share. About 25 years of history tells traders that MU tends to drop when earnings decline so dramatically.Amid this slide, I see one bit of good news for MU bulls. In past down cycles, Micron lost money, taking MU stock below $10 per share. While current forecasts called for deeply-reduced profits, analysts expect the company to remain profitable. I see MU stock at least retesting the $28.39 per share low of last December.However, I do not predict a return to single-digit price levels. Nonetheless, cycles remain, and traders should get out of MU sooner rather than later. Concluding Thoughts on Micron StockThe earnings and trade news will not reverse the downtrend in MU stock. MU has seen an impressive run as an earnings beat, and a trade truce helped to take Micron almost 23% higher in less than a week.Unfortunately for MU stock bulls, the decades-long pattern of trading on memory prices remains in place. The earnings beat does not change the fact that year-over-year profits fell by two-thirds. Moreover, with the company reducing capital expenditures, profits will probably continue to fall. These lowered earnings will inevitably bring a lower stock price.Despite my negative outlook, I would advise traders to still watch MU stock. Innovations in self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality will lead to a permanent demand increase in memory chip prices. Micron is one of only three companies in the world making the needed memory chips.Once this technology sees more widespread adoption, this should bring another up cycle to Micron. However, until we see that demand coming, I would advise against holding any long position in MU stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Technology companies that target fickle consumers can die in a flash. (Juicero, anyone?) The ones that sell technology to businesses tend to hang on a bit longer. That's why old-guard technology companies that have lost relevance and stopped growing – think BMC Software, Compuware and Tibco Software – have been ripe takeover targets in recent years for the private equity firms that take an unloved company and rehab it, or milk it for every last dime. The chip maker Broadcom Inc. and its chief executive officer, Hock Tan, have honed reputations as private equity-like seers of technology sectors that can be consolidated and pruned to extract value. But Broadcom is taking this idea too far.A year ago, it made a deal to buy a slowly dying business software company, CA Inc., for nearly $19 billion. It was an odd foray into software, and a fairly expensive one. Broadcom handled communications around the acquisition poorly, and its stock price initially suffered as a result, although it has managed to squeezed costs out of CA to the point where the acquisition has justified itself financially.Now, Broadcom is in talks to purchase the troubled security software company Symantec Corp., according to Bloomberg News, in a deal that would likely cost significantly more than $13 billion. Financially, the Symantec deal is a classic Broadcom tactic. Tan and Broadcom have their eye on rolling up aging business-software companies like Symantec and CA, similar to how the company made a series of deals to acquire and consolidate multiple semiconductor companies.Using the typical Broadcom blueprint, Symantec can pare costs and improve operations to the point where it is contributing profits at a significantly healthy margin. Piper Jaffray analysts estimated that under Broadcom's watch, Symantec could have operating margins of more than 60%, up from an operating margin of about 13%, excluding restructuring costs, in Symantec's fiscal year ended in March. With those margins and an estimated $1 billion in cost costs, Piper Jaffray reckons Symantec can add nearly $1.8 billion to Broadcom’s annual net income.But Broadcom's extension of its private equity-style play risks undermining confidence in the company just as it and other semiconductor manufacturers are grappling with existential threats. Ultimately, investors need to ask themselves how much longer Broadcom can play out its strategy of being an operating company in a rapidly changing industry, while simultaneously managing a private equity portfolio to milk for profits.Yes, that's how Broadcom made its reputation. Overplaying that strategy threatens to undo that hard-won reputation. Consider the timing and the financial costs of Broadcom's effort to consolidate battered business-software firms. Last month, Broadcom reduced its revenue forecast for the year, citing the U.S.-China trade war and companies cutting their inventories of computer chips. Broadcom is highly exposed to the smartphone industry, where sales are stagnating, and to corporate networking equipment, where demand has been uncertain. Broadcom was being conservative in slashing its forecast, and the numbers may not come in as ugly as forecast. But it's worth asking whether Broadcom is spreading itself too thin by expanding its consolidation play in corporate software while it is grappling with serious issues in many of its product categories.A deal for Symantec also would be a potential hit to Broadcom's balance sheet. At the end of April, it had $37.5 billion in total debt, after the CA acquisition doubled its debt load. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts on Wednesday said Broadcom's credit ratings could sink below investment grade if a Symantec acquisition goes through.Stock buyers are now wary of the same Broadcom acquisition-hunting that they once loved. Shares of Broadcom fell almost 4% in early trading on Wednesday. Broadcom's failed pursuit of Qualcomm Inc., and its miscalculations of the politics around what would have been the biggest acquisition in technology history, bruised Broadcom's standing with investors. The continued pursuit of software consolidation hurts even more.To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-07-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. is in advanced talks to buy cybersecurity firm Symantec Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, seeking a further expansion into the more profitable software business.Broadcom could reach an agreement to buy the Mountain View, California-based company within weeks, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. No deal has been finalized and the talks could fall through, the people said.A representative for Symantec declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Symantec’s shares rose as much as 16% Wednesday in New York, their biggest intraday gain in almost eight months. They closed Tuesday at $22.10, giving the company a market value of about $13.7 billion. Broadcom shares slipped about 3.5%. They closed at $295.33 Tuesday, giving the semiconductor maker a market value of about $118 billion.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:Broadcom’s potential purchase of another asset with $4+ billion in software sales is likely its most ambitious deal yet - leaderless Symantec has been losing share, even in its core segments. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan will likely need to aggressively cut Symantec costs while keeping sales stable.&#92;- Anand Srinivasan, technology analystThe deal would mark Broadcom’s second big bet in software, following its $18 billion takeover last year of CA Technologies. That transaction spurred some investors to express concern that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan’s acquisition strategy was being stretched too far after playing a key role in consolidating in the $470 billion chip industry.That deal also came after San Jose, California-based Broadcom abandoned a hostile pursuit of rival chipmaker Qualcomm Inc., when U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the transaction citing national security risks.Some analysts saw the potential purchase of Symantec as a positive for Broadcom.“Symantec would make a perfect fit for the Broadcom portfolio,” Harsh Kumar, an analyst at Piper Jaffray wrote in a note to investors. He said the situation is similar to Broadcom’s CA acquisition, “which ultimately turned out to be extremely successful under the Broadcom umbrella.”Symantec ChallengesSymantec is the world’s biggest maker of cybersecurity software, providing products and services to more than 350,000 organizations and 50 million people, according to its annual report.The company has faced a list of challenges in the past year, grappling with heightened competition, the abrupt departure of its chief executive officer, waning consumer interest in antivirus programs and a financial investigation that ended with restated earnings. The shares have gained about 17% this year, recovering from a 33% slump in 2018.Activist investor Starboard Value LP won three board seats on the company in September.Broadcom wouldn’t be the first chipmaker to try a foray into security software. In 2011, Intel Corp. acquired McAfee Inc. for $7.7 billion. Intel’s plan was to hard-wire some of the software’s capabilities into its market-leading personal-computer processors. The semiconductor maker was never able to pull that off, and ended up spinning off the unit in 2016 in a sale to TPG that valued the business at $4.2 billion.Under Tan, Broadcom has pursued a different strategy for software. Tan said he acquires ‘‘franchises,’’ groups or businesses within companies that have sustainable market positions through technology leadership. He then invests in them to maintain that leadership, running them as distinct parts of Broadcom, rather than integrating the acquired products.“Broadcom’s approach to M&A is to deliver high cash on cash returns, which it has been quite successful in achieving,” Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach wrote in a report earlier this week. “In semiconductors, the company was early and led the wave of consolidation seen across the industry. However, with many assets already off the board and remaining companies trading at high valuation multiples, the opportunity set in semis is much lower today.”(Updates with share trading in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Dinesh Nair.To contact the reporters on this story: Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.net;Kiel Porter in Chicago at kporter17@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Dan WilchinsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Is in Advanced Talks to Acquire Symantec

Stocks initially sold off somewhat hard in the session after the June jobs report was released.Source: Shutterstock The non-farm payrolls report showed that 224,000 jobs were added to the economy in June. That far outpaced economists' expectations of 160,000 jobs and follows the May report which missed analysts' expectations by a wide margin.There were already calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before the May jobs report was released. Once it missed expectations though, those calls grew even louder. In fact, investors started to clamor for a 50 basis point cut, rather than just a 25 basis point cut.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the latest report coming in notably ahead of estimates, the expectations for a 50 bps cut are dwindling quickly. Breaking Down the Rate CutsObviously, the jobs report is the big driver on Friday. Particularly when the market was closed on Thursday for the Fourth of July and while volumes are light. Just hours after the NFP report was released, we now see that Fed Funds futures are calling for a less than 5% chance of a 50 basis point cut.  * 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week Notably though, they still call for a 95% chance of a 25 basis point cut. If the Fed opts not to cut interest rates at this month's meeting (July 30-31), it's going to cause issues in the stock market.How do rates relate to tech stocks and the Nasdaq today? The Nasdaq fell almost 1% on the day at the lows, before recovering later in the day. While tech is not the most rate-sensitive sector out there, it's hard to argue that lower rates are bad for tech stocks. It makes borrowing cheaper and given that many of these companies use debt to fuel their growth -- like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for instance -- that's good for their financials. Further, stock valuations benefit from lower interest rates and when multiples expand, tech is one of the biggest beneficiaries.  Click to EnlargeAs for the Nasdaq today, the index made a near-perfect pullback to the key 8,100 level. The index promptly bounced from this mark and closed up toward 8,162. While it did breach 8,100 temporarily, Friday's action was pretty healthy overall. Let's see if 8,100 can hold up as support again next week, and potentially push the Nasdaq to new highs. News in the Nasdaq TodaySamsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) warned that its profit fell by 56% in the quarter. Sluggish demand for smartphones and memory chips weighed on the tech giant's bottom line.Given the action and news we've seen and heard from other chip and memory stocks -- Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) for instance -- Samsung's announcement is no surprise. Micron, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) and others fell on the news too.Shares of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) were under further pressure Friday, falling more than 4% on the day. The stock is now down 7.5% for the week, as the company releases its second season of Apex Legends. The action is very disappointing, with the stock blowing through various moving averages and solidifying its range resistance. On the plus side though, key support is still holding up.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) found itself in the news for a few reasons on Friday.First, Amazon filed for permission with the FCC to launch more than 3,200 satellites into orbit with the intention to provide broadband internet.

Still, the move to a new record high sets the stage for optimism headed into the final trading day of the week.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) was the ringleader for the rally, up more than 13% following news that Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) would be acquiring it at a fairly generous premium. Broadcom, conversely, sank on worries that it was buying another troubled software business.At the other end of the spectrum, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) stumbled 4.5% mostly in response to a commentary from MarkWatch columnist Jurica Dujmovic suggesting that PC gaming was shrinking market. Although EA publishes more than computer games, it's a significant piece of its revenue mix.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice As for today's top trading prospects, take a look at the stock charts of Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG), NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB). Here's why, and what needs to happen next. M&T Bank (MTB)Most bank stocks have been rising lately, shrugging off weakness from late last year and early this year spurred by concerns of falling interest rates, and an outright economic slowdown. M&T Bank hasn't been an exception to this norm.MTB has hammered out a turnaround effort that's much more technically sound than those efforts from other banking names, however. Better still, that move has technically solidified in just the past few days, setting the stage for more forward progress.  Click to Enlarge  * M&T has crossed above all of its key moving average lines, but more importantly, the purple 50-day moving average line is now above and pulling away from the white 200-day moving average.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart we can also see MTB shares have pushed their way above the falling resistance line that had been guiding it lower since early last year.  * Although it has been choppy and should remain so in the foreseeable future, the higher lows made since March is the first string of higher lows made in over a year. Citizens Financial Group (CFG)In the same vein as M&T Bank, and for the same reason, Citizens Financial Group shares have just wiggled their way out of a rut and almost back into an uptrend. In this case, however, there's one last clear technical hurdle to get past before the advance has an unfettered path higher.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019   Click to Enlarge  * That resistance level is plotted in purple on the daily chart, connecting all the peak highs since February.  * Although not quite yet, the purple 50-day line is about to cross above the 200-day moving average line plotted in white on both stock charts. Once that happens we'll have a key &quot;golden cross&quot; fanning the bullish flames.  * That being said, Citizens Financial Group have already fought their way back above a key ceiling for a third time. That's the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line at $35.44. That puts the next key ceiling somewhere around $40.50. NRG Energy (NRG)Two months ago, NRG Energy shares were in serious trouble. Not only had they broken below the pivotal 200-day moving average line, they fell below a long-standing and rising support line that had been guiding NRG stock upward since 2017.Shares proceeded a little lower following the bearish catalyst, and may still be destined for a renewal of that downtrend. But, a chart pattern that took shape last week has major bullish implications that could easily lead to a full-blown recovery.  Click to Enlarge  * The pattern in question is highlighted on the daily chart. A sizeable setback followed by a hammer-shaped bar near the previous day's low followed by a tall bullish bar. Called a morning doji star, it suggests a transition from a net-bearish to a net-bullish environment.  * Bolstering the potential bullishness is the weekly chart's RSI indicator. It slipped into oversold territory for the first time in months in May.  * The follow-through has been respectable so far, though not perfect. The purple 50-day average could still act as resistance.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-08,"The stock price of Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is prone to sudden explosive moves. Just look at the past month. During this period, Micron stock swung from $35.20 to its current price of close to $40.50.Source: Shutterstock The main reason for this, of course, is the lessening of tension between the U.S. and China on trade.  There was, for example, a truce on tariffs as well as a backing off on the severe restrictions on Huawei, which is a huge buyer of U.S. technology. All this sparked a rally in the chip sector, boosting stocks of companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).But for MU stock, the thawing of the trade war was particularly important. Keep in mind that a majority of its sales come from China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet MU's quarterly announcement also boosted MU stock. Its earnings per share came in at $1.05, which beat analysts' average estimate by 27 cents. MU's top line beat expectations by about $100 million.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 So all in all, the bull move of MU stock is based on encouraging fundamentals. But the big question is: Can the rally of Micron stock continue?Well, I'd be cautious on MU.  First of all, it's important to note that - before the strong move of MU stock - sentiment towards MU was downright awful. In other words, any kind of good news would have likely sparked an acceleration of buying.Next, after drilling down further on the earnings report,  it's clear that MU still has some nagging issues.  During the quarter, its profit fell about 67% from the same period last year. There was also a grueling 38.6% plunge in its revenues to $4.79 billion.Unfortunately, it looks like these large declines will not be temporary. For the fiscal fourth quarter, MU expects its revenues to range from $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion, while the average estimate was for $4.9 billion. As for earnings per share, the company's estimate is for 38 cents to 52 cents a share.  Analysts, on average, had forecast a more robust 78 cents.But that should not be a surprise. Europe and Asia are reporting decelerating growth. In fact,  World Semiconductor Trade Statistics is projecting a 12% drop in chip sales across the globe this year.No doubt, the boom-bust cycle has been an essential part of the industry. But during the past few years, there has been talk that somehow this would no longer be the case because of non-cycical trends in categories like smartphones, IoT (Internet-of-Things), robotics, AR (Augmented Reality) and AI (Artificial Intelligence). But, as shown by the steep drop of MU's revenues, this notion looks far from realistic. Last quarter, there was weakness across all the major parts of the company's business.Interestingly enough, the latest M&A moves from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also seems to invalidate the theory that the semiconductor sector has become non-cyclical. Last year, the company acquired software developer CA, and there's buzz that it will acquire Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC). Does this aggressive effort to diversify signal that AVGO believes that the chip industry is headed for problems? The Bottom Line on MU StockIt would probably be a stretch to say that MU stock is headed for a big drop. Its cash flows remain high and it will probably continue to buy back Micron stock. The valuation of MU stock, which has a forward price-earnings ratio of eight or so, is also reasonable.Yet for now, it's probably best to hold off on buying Micron stock. It could get tougher for MU to churn out gains as its growth profile looks dicey.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

Oppenheimer analysts named Costco stock a top pick and assigned a $295 price target to the name. After Wednesday's rally, that target implies roughly 9% upside. Further, the analyst speculated about a potential special dividend in the range of $10 to $15 per share.Speaking of top picks, Goldman Sachs analysts put Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) on its conviction list. That came alongside an upgrade from neutral to buy and a significant bump in its price target from $44 to $54. The new target implies more than 23% upside. News in the Nasdaq TodayMcAfee is reportedly considering a $1 billion IPO and seeking a valuation up to $5 billion.

Anyone who owns an Alexa device has to be happy with how it &quot;learns&quot; over time, although it's drawn criticism over privacy in the past. Amazon promises to keep the data secure though, and not share it with third parties.

The company is reportedly gearing up its Fremont plant to increase its production.

We saw an 0.17% gain in the Nasdaq today, followed by slight gains for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones.Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat said, there's a lot individual news to dig through.  Bitcoin, Libra and CryptoThe bitcoin market has been wildly volatile lately, hasn't it? Bitcoin prices ran from $5,500 at the start of May to more than $8,700 by June 1st. Just a few weeks later it was north of $13,000. It topped out around $13,600, before it promptly fell to just under $10,000. Crypto bulls said it was an opportunity. Bears argued it was a blowoff top and it was coming back down. Another run to $13,000 earlier this month was again met with sellers as bitcoin prices dropped back down to $10,000.   * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy I'll stop the onslaught of price history, but it's sort of necessary for an asset like bitcoin. Put simply, this thing is volatile. Perhaps we're entering a range-bound trade, between $10,000 and $13,000. At the very least, traders now have a few lines in the sand, where a move above resistance or below support could spell a further move in that direction. The advances in bitcoin have helped give a boost to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock, even as it's drawn the ire of regulators for its Libra cryptocurrency. Congress has asked Facebook to hold off on Libra until it knows more. It's drawn comments from the president, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Treasury has serious concerns over Libra.For its part, Facebook -- which will reportedly settle with the FTC for $5 billion -- said it will wait until it has regulatory support before launching.  Heard at the Nasdaq TodayShares of Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) were on the move Monday, rising 2.7% and closing at $68.07. It will invest $5.1 billion in Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG), increasing its stake in the company from 12.2% to 22%. Galapagos will now see if shareholders approve an eventual stake increase to 29.9%. Given today's action, it's hard to see shareholders saying no, with GLPG stock rising more than 17% to new highs. Further, Gilead Sciences stock was upgraded to outperform at Wells Fargo. The analysts assigned an $88 price target, implying about 30% upside from current levels and signaling new 52-week highs should GILD stock get there. OK, so what's going on with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC)?   Broadcom was reportedly in talks to acquire SYMC. However, on Monday, shares of Symantec abruptly tumbled lower, falling over 10% on news that AVGO is no longer in talks to buy the company. However, the stock recovered off its initial lows -- and actually closed at session highs -- while AVGO stock rallied almost 3% on the news, before ending higher by just 1%. New reports say that Broadcom isn't walking away from the deal just yet. So what gives? This is just typical M&A drama. I don't know if Broadcom will pull the trigger for SYMC. Maybe the latter wanted even more money. Perhaps the terms weren't right. Either way, the market seems happy for AVGO to walk away, if that should be a sign of anything. Broadcom stock has been under pressure since the buyout news surfaced and rallied when it looked like the deal was off.  Movers in the Nasdaq Today  Click to EnlargeAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, as well as several social media sites have fallen under criticism that they display a political bias. Google's vice president of government affairs Karan Bhatia wrote an op-ed stating that the company does not have a bias and stated he will tell U.S. Senators that is the case as well. Social media is playing an enormous role in the distribution of political news, both real and fake. It's created a frenzy of both misinformation and information overload, drawing criticism from both political parties. No matter which side of the aisle readers stand on, they should be reading factually correct information, although tech companies haven't seemed to find a very good way to govern it thus far. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is hitting its highest levels since May, rising 3.4% on Monday on above-average volume. The stock is now running into prior support though, which acted as resistance a few months ago. The stock has to reclaim this area to really get the bullish train moving. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) much-awaited Prime Day is finally here, with sales going strong on Monday and Tuesday. The e-commerce retailer will pull in billions in revenue from the event and is drawing in competition from seemingly every online retailer (seriously, have you checked your inbox lately?)   * 5 EV Stocks to Buy for Big Gains Over the Next Decade Target (NYSE:TGT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) -- three strong retailers by the way -- have been hitting it hard, as has Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and others.

2019-07-15,"Stocks stagnated on Monday, as investors gear up for the start of earnings throughout the week. Let's look at a few top stock trades to kick off the week.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Symantec  Click to EnlargeBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is reportedly walking away from talks to buy Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), causing the latter to drop by almost 12% on the day. On the plus side though, SYMC is rallying off its low. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares are up off the lows and north of the 200-day and 50-day moving averages. For those that feel compelled to buy SYMC -- I am not one of them -- they may want to consider using a stop loss at Monday's lows. If that's too tight, then we at least need to see the stock hold these two key moving averages. See if it can climb over its 20-day moving average on the upside, or if it acts as resistance. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Advanced Micro Devices  Click to EnlargeAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged to $34 and backed off last week. On Monday, it's right back to its bullish ways, pushing up to new highs. The stock is holding up over $34, while prior resistance at $33 is now proving to be support. As long as this one holds the 20-day, uptrend support and $33, investors can keep riding it higher. Below and AMD may need some time to digest the gains.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Twitter  Click to EnlargeLast week, shares of Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) broke out over downtrend resistance (blue line). It's now over its 20-day and 50-day moving average as well.   As far as upside targets go, $40 would bring TWTR back near its May highs, while a run to $42 would fill the gap from last July. Shares need to hold above $37 to keep the setup intact.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Netflix    Click to EnlargeNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) remains range-bound, stuck between $340 and $385. If I were long NFLX, I would like to see the stock cooling off as it is ahead of its July 17th earnings report. Going in too hot could cause a selloff.   On its post-earnings reaction, see if NFLX can breakout over $385 or hold $340 on a pullback. Sooner or later, we'll have some action.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Guardant Health  Click to EnlargeGuardant Health (NASDAQ:GH) shares are moving well on Monday, up almost 10%. Shares are pushing through current resistance near $92.50 to $94. As long as it holds above this mark, a push to $100 and possibly the 52-week highs near $106.50 are in play.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy  If prior resistance fails to hold as support, see that uptrend support near $85 holds.

Symantec shares fell as much as 15% to $21.70.Discussions hit an impasse over the weekend after Broadcom sought to reduce its offer by more than $1.50 per share after determining in due diligence that it was no longer willing to meet their agreed-upon price of $28.25, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public.They had been preparing to announce the transaction as soon as Tuesday, one of the people said. At $28.25 per share, Symantec would have been valued at about $17.5 billion.While talks are off for now, they could be resumed if both parties are able to compromise on price or if Symantec comes under sufficient pressure to re-engage, the people said.Two weeks ago, Bloomberg News reported that Broadcom was in advanced talks to buy the cybersecurity firm, seeking to expand into the more profitable software business.

Broadcom, based in San Jose, California, rose 2.4% to $292.20.The deal would be Broadcom’s second big bet in software, following its $18 billion takeover last year of CA Technologies. And while some analysts said Symantec would be a perfect fit for Broadcom, others noted that it comes with several challenges, including increased competition, the abrupt departure of its chief executive officer, waning consumer interest in antivirus programs and a financial investigation that ended with restated earnings.Activist investor Starboard Value LP won three seats on Symantec’s board in September, including one for the firm’s Managing Member Peter Feld.(Updates with additional details starting in second paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Matthew MonksFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Symantec Falls as Deal Talks With Broadcom Are Said Stall

2019-07-16,"Although down for the better part of the day, stocks managed to fight their way back into the black on Monday. The S&P 500's 0.02% rise is anything but impressive, but it gives the bulls another day to build their technical and psychological support.Source: Shutterstock Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) held the rally back more than any other name, falling more than 10% after Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced it was throwing in the towel in its acquisition effort. Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) was problematic too, however, falling nearly 8% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. Analyst David Risinger is worried about underestimated competition and litigation risks related to its opioid business.At the other end of the spectrum, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped more than 3% for a bevy of reasons, including winning two different &quot;car of the year&quot; awards.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills As Tuesday's action gets going, however, it's the stock charts of Ford (NYSE:F), International Paper (NYSE:IP) and LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) that merit the most attention. Here's why. International Paper (IP)The last time we looked at International Paper back in mid May, it was trapped in a downtrend largely guided by resistance at the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. A near-term technical floor was holding it, but the sellers were persistently chipping away.They ultimately won the fight, dragging shares below that support area. The stock tried to bounce back, as it has since early 2018. As has also been the case since then, however, IP once again lost a fight when another ceiling stepped up to the plate. Things are apt to get worse before they get better.  Click to Enlarge  * The newest technical ceiling is the 50-day moving average line, plotted in purple. Rebound efforts repelled there in early June and again in early July.  * This month's weakness has also been on above-average selling volume, suggesting there are more bears waiting in the wings.  * The next major technical floor is around $39.50, marked in red. International Paper shares have found a floor there a few times since the beginning of 2016, and late last year in particular. LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)Two weeks ago, LyondellBasell Industries shares appeared to be on the mend. They had snapped back from a rough May, crawling back above the purple 50-day moving average line and then the gray 100-day average line, and then started to find support at that moving average. However, a push up and off the 100-day line to test the white 200-day moving average line ultimately proved disastrous. All it took was a kiss of the 200-day moving average to lead into a significant loss for that day.Before sliding back into trouble though, LYB stock found support at an established floor again, and appears to be positioning for another shot at clearing the 200-day moving average. It's less than an ideal effort though.  Click to Enlarge  * The support area in play now is once again the 50-day moving average line, bolstered by horizontal support around $83.60 where shares found a floor a few times in the first quarter of the year.  * Although the bleeding stopped before too much damage was done, the recent setback has been on huge volume, and the two rebound days were on subpar volume.  * If LyondellBasell can punch through the ceiling near $88, the next most meaningful level is around $96, marked in yellow, where LYB stock found support and resistance several times since 2017. Ford Motor Company (F)Ford has been a tough name to own for a long time. Even with the recent rebound effort, the stock remains down more than 40% from its 2014 peak price.This effort could be different though. While we've seen past recovery effort falter when bumping into an established technical ceiling, reinforcing that very ceiling, this advance is better grounded than most of the past ones have been.  Click to Enlarge  * The ceiling in question is the resistance line that tags all the key peaks going back to 2015, plotted in blue on the weekly chart. It has being tested again.  * Since early June, F stock has found pretty persistent support at its purple 50-day moving average line. This support is highlighted on the daily chart.  * Although it wouldn't readily appear this is the case on the daily chart, the weekly chart's Chaikin line -- by virtue of pointing upward again after crossing zero in April -- says there's consistent buying volume in place.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Ford.

2019-07-16,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is back at the highs. The AMD stock price cleared $33 last week, something it's managed to do a few times in the past year. Each time, those levels have proven to be bad news for Advanced Micro Devices stock.Source: Shutterstock AMD stock got there for the first time last September, reaching a 12-year high at the time. It immediately dipped. After two more tries, the chip sector as a whole collapsed. The AMD stock price went from $33 to $17 in a matter of weeks.AMD stock briefly touched $34 last month. It fell promptly declined 15% over the next five sessions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's pretty clear that levels around $33-$34 have proven to be resistance for the AMD stock price. The question now, particularly with Q2 earnings on the way in two weeks or so, is whether this time will be different.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy  The Risks to the AMD Stock PriceThere are three reasons to see current levels as potentially risky for Advanced Micro Devices stock. The first is precisely that history, particularly in the context of chip stocks more broadly. Big earnings from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) have helped boost the sector in recent weeks, admittedly.But semiconductor stocks have seen quite a bit of volatility over the past year. Micron may have touted optimism - but Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) did largely the opposite. Even before those reports, this has been a space where investors are best off zigging while the market zags, buying when sentiment turns sour and selling when optimism returns. That's held for AMD as well, obviously, given the stock has doubled from December lows.As such, resistance here may be firm. And that risk is buttressed by fundamental concerns. As I wrote last month, at those June highs, AMD stock isn't cheap. It trades at over 32x next year's consensus EPS. The average Wall Street price target still sits below the current price.Analysts don't always have it right, obviously (that's been particularly true in the chip space over the past eighteen months), but 32x is a big multiple for chip stock. Investors in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) learned what happens when an investor overpays for growth in such a cyclical industry. If only on a short-term basis, investors in Advanced Micro Devices have learned the same lesson a few times.And the third risk for AMD is the earnings report on the way, likely at or around the end of this month. Expectations clearly are high. AMD has stumbled after earnings in the past - most notably with a 22% decline after the Q3 report in October. AMD needs a big quarter to keep a repeat from occurring this time around. The Case for Advanced Micro Devices StockThe simple answer to all those worries is: so what? AMD stock has climbed the &quot;wall of worry&quot; for years now. After all, this was a $2 stock as recently as 2016, with real fears that the company might eventually declare bankruptcy.That's obviously no longer the case. AMD's new chips have made it a formidable competitor to Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel's repeated mistakes only increase the possibility of more market share gains, more growth, and a higher AMD stock price. And those self-inflicted wounds at AMD's key competitor, along with reports of strong PC sales, suggest Q2 numbers will be impressive.Broadly speaking, this simply is a much better business than it was, and it's a really good business on its own. The &quot;old&quot; Advanced Micro Devices was a second-tier provider of chips for low-priced PCs. But it's now a more diversified player in terms of both PCs and growing end markets like data centers. AMD stock might not be cheap, but it shouldn't be cheap. The Bottom Line on Advanced Micro Devices StockBoth sides can make a strong case at the moment, which makes Q2 earnings particularly important. Technically and fundamentally, AMD stock is likely to move further in whatever direction it trades after the report.Big numbers lead to higher earnings estimates and likely a series of analyst upgrades that can further goose the stock. That, in turn, pushes AMD through resistance, which usually (though not always) triggers higher prices.Anything less, however, and history suggests Advanced Micro Devices stock could have a problem. We've seen AMD move from $33+ to under $30 in a blink. Bad news, or even an outlook that doesn't quite match currently optimistic expectations, could do the same, or worse.All told, I'd expect that a month or two out, AMD stock isn't trading at $33. But which way it moves will depend largely on what kind of story Advanced Micro Devices can tell with its second-quarter report.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-17,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has its share of challenges.The mobile chip maker saw a nice pop in mid-April, with shares rising from about $57 up to as high as $90 after settling its litigation with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But concerns with a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust ruling have pushed the stock down to the $65-$75 price level.With government rulings threatening the company's competitive advantage, what is the next move for Qualcomm stock?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Read on to see why QCOM stock is a hold: Good News and Bad News for QCOMThe April Apple settlement boosted Qualcomm stock. After years of an ugly patent dispute, Apple settled, agreeing to pay Qualcomm between $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion and start a six-year licensing agreement.This good news helped push QCOM stock to new highs. Unfortunately, it was chased with a heavy dose of bad news.In May, Qualcomm stock tumbled after a ruling from the FTC. The FTC found that the company was engaging in unfair trade practices, exploiting its size to keep out competition and squeeze cell phone manufacturers. Qualcomm was ordered to license its technology to rival chip makers, negatively impacting the company's &quot;edge.&quot;But Qualcomm has received a reprieve: the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has asked the appeals cause to pause the antitrust ruling. The DoJ cited &quot;Qualcomm's critical role in 5G technology in the short-term&quot; as the rationale behind their decision.Does this mean QCOM is out of the woods? Maybe, maybe not. While the DoJ and other agencies believe Qualcomm's market power to be in the national interest, it is clear that QCOM's days of high margin licensing could be over.Without high margins, it becomes tougher to justify Qualcomm's valuation. With nonexistent growth, investors need a reason to keep bidding up QCOM shares. Qualcomm Earnings: Where is the Growth?QCOM last announced earnings on May 1st. For the quarter ending March 31, 2019, sales were down 5% year-over-year (YoY), primarily due to declines in the company's QTL licensing segment (down 8% YoY).Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 FY19 was 77 cents a share, about the same (78 cents) as in Q2 FY18.The company's aggressive share buyback program has been a factor in maintaining EPS. Qualcomm bought back $22.6 billion worth of shares in FY18, and has already bought back $1.02 billion in FY19. The company has $7.8 billion remaining under their current stock repurchase program.Qualcomm has also been able to maintain EPS via cost cutting. As discussed in the last 10-Q, QCOM successfully reduced annual operating costs by $1 billion.But to move the needle, Qualcomm needs organic growth. While the adoption of 5G is a solid future catalyst, it could be years before the new technology reaches critical mass. Qualcomm's investor communications speak little of &quot;game-changers&quot; in the pipeline.However, even with a lack of a growth story, Qualcomm does not trade at a discount. Let's take a look at its earnings multiples relative to peers: QCOM Stock Fairly ValuedCompared to its peers in the semiconductor space, Qualcomm's valuation seems reasonable. QCOM stock trades at 15 times forward earnings, and has a EV/EBITDA ratio of 14.9.Here are the earnings multiple metrics for Qualcomm's peers:Intel (NASDAQ:INTC): 11x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 7.3Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN): 20.6x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 15.4Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO): 12x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 14.2With Qualcomm stock trading at EBITDA multiples similar to AVGO and TXN, it is hard to make a value case for QCOM. Until a solid discount to peers emerges, it is tough to find a compelling reason to enter the stock. Bottom Line: Avoid QCOM StockFor investors looking to enter Qualcomm today, the stock is not a buy. Despite the reprieve from the DoJ, Qualcomm's competitive advantage is materially impacted by the FTC decision.If the high operating margins of licensing are impacted, it becomes tougher to justify QCOM stock's current valuation. QCOM could be a buy if it starts trading at a discount to TXN and AVGO, but for the time being the stock appears fairly valued relative to its peers.On the other hand, QCOM could be attractive to dividend investors. As InvestorPlace contributor Brad Kenagy pointed out, QCOM offers a fairly high dividend yield (3.3%). Coupled with the company's buyback strategy, QCOM shareholders could see benefit even if the share price treads water.The next big move in QCOM stock will likely come from the company's earnings announcement on July 31st. Excluding the one-time item from the Apple agreement, QCOM projects quarterly non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between 70 cents and 80 cents per share, down 20-30% YoY.If QCOM exceeds expectations, shares could see a bump. But given they are not out of the woods regarding the antitrust decision, additional upside remains limited.Investors should take all of these factors into consideration before initiating a position in Qualcomm stock.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-17,"Markets are high, as investors have rushed back into stocks on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least once before year’s end. With bond yields already low, and lower rates in the offing, stocks are the natural place to turn. And among the stocks, high-yield dividends offer investors an additional income stream to supplement share price growth. Here we look at three stocks offering high dividend payouts. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Shares in Broadcom slipped in recent sessions, when acquisition talks between the chipmaker and cyber security corporation Symantec (SYMC) broke off. Symantec ended the negotiations, saying that Broadcom’s per-share offer was too low. Both companies saw a retreat in share price; Broadcom much less.Macro factors have been more important to AVGO’s share performance than possible acquisitions. The US semiconductor industry was hit hard last month when tariff fears flared up, but that has eased since Presidents Trump and Xi met cordially at the G20 summit and announced that formal trade talks would resume.So, Broadcom is looking stable, but more attractive to investors is the company’s 3.73% dividend yield. While that percentage may not seem high, AVGO’s $284 share price makes the annualized payout $10.60. Quarterly, it pays out $2.65 per share. Even better, AVGO has a history of both consistent payouts and steady increases of the dividend. It’s a guaranteed income that nicely complements the stock’s 9% upside potential.Broadcom has gained over 13% since the beginning of June, and analysts are sanguine about the stock’s future. William Stein, of SunTrust Robinson, remains “positive on Broadcom's outstanding historical track record of value creation from its investing decisions and expects its management to continue to make intelligent capital allocation decisions.” His price target, $307, suggests an 8% upside to the stock.A look at Stein’s ratings history on Broadcom shows that he has been consistently bullish on this stock for the last year. Even better, his ratings are frequently borne out by performance – he has a 19% average return on his recommendations for AVGO shares.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see William Stein’s complete Analyst ProfileOverall, Broadcom holds a strong buy from the analyst consensus, based on 21 buy ratings and 6 holds assigned in the last 3 months. The stocks $311 average price target suggests room for 9.6% growth from the $284 current share price. Home Depot, Inc. (HD)Home Depot leads the big-box home improvement superstore niche, with double the market share, double the share price, and triple the market cap of its largest competitor, Lowe’s (LOW). With recent positive economic indicators, especially June’s strong jobs numbers and the prospect of a Fed interest rate cut putting downward pressure on mortgage rates, the home improvement niche is looking strong.A solid business niche leads to profit and cash flow. HD is set to release Q2 earnings on Aug 13, and the expectation is for $3.09 per share, and increase of 36% from last quarter’s $2.27 EPS. Historically, the company’s fiscal second quarter is its strongest for earnings.HD also has a history of sharing earnings with investors through a robust dividend. The yield is a modest 2.5%, but the high share price makes the annual payout $5.44. Quarterly payments are $1.36, and HD has a history of raising the dividend each year.&gt;&gt;Click here to see the HD Dividend CalendarThe reliable dividend and profitable business model may explain HD’s popularity among investors. TipRanks tracks over 50,000 individual portfolios; among the best performing of these, Home Depot shares appear in 16.3%, or 1 out of 6. Top performing investors have increased their HD holdings by more than 2% over the past month, reflecting the overall “very positive” investor sentiment on the stock.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see HD Investor SentimentInvestors and dividend fans aren’t the only ones bullish on Home Depot. Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane reviewed the stock earlier this month and gave it a $235 price target, implying an upside potential over 8%. In her comments, McShane wrote: “Home Depot hits all the marks when it comes to gaining market share and increasing operating dollar growth. Expect these two attributes to drive upside to the stock over the next 12 months.”Home Depot’s price target presents us with the interesting case of a solid stock whose recent gains have pushed its share price above recent analyst expectations. HD is trading at $217; the average price target, however, is only $209, and still reflects older analyst ratings. As McShane’s comments and target show, Wall Street is beginning to readjust its outlook on the company. HD remains a strong buy, based on an analyst consensus of 8 buys and 5 holds in the past three months. Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM)Yes, this is a cigarette company, a classic “sin stock.” But investors are in the market to make a profit, and that’s where Philip Morris delivers. Year-to-date, shares in PM are up 22%. The profits come while cigarette sales are slowing, as the tobacco companies have been casting about for other business opportunities, making investments in cannabis, alcohol, and e-cigarettes.In looking for alternate revenue streams, Big Tobacco hasn’t forgotten the investor. PM pays out a regular dividend of $1.14 quarterly. Annualized, this represents an income of $4.56 per share and a yield of 5.59%. More important, is PM’s 11-year history of growing the dividend, making this stock particularly attractive to value investors.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the PM Dividend CalendarSecular trends – especially the poor reputation of tobacco and smoking products – may be lined up against the tobacco companies, but some Wall Street analysts see this as a buying opportunity. Writing from Goldman Sachs, Judy Hong says, “Tobacco valuations are &quot;at a 10-year trough despite a more accommodating market backdrop.”She sees a floor to cigarettes’ unpopularity, and a stabilization in sales and profits. Continuing, she says, “Expect the current discount on tobacco stocks to narrow as cigarette fundamentals hold up better than feared, contribution from next generation tobacco products builds, and regulatory concerns subside over time.”Hong says that the bearishness on tobacco traces back to lower sales volumes for cigarettes along with up-front costs of the shift to e-cigs and other alternative products. However, she adds, “Expect the decline in cigarette consumption to abate and the shift to e-cigarettes to moderate. And international cigarette volume trends have been mostly stable.” In line with her bullish stance on the industry, Hong gives PM a solid buy rating.Bonnie Herzog, of Wells Fargo, agrees with Hong on the outlook for Philip Morris. She bases her optimism, however, on a successful move toward alternative tobacco products, specifically the iQOS heat-not-burn option. Writing of PM, she says she expects the company to beat the Q2 earnings estimate, saying, “We expect PM will beat conservative EPS of $1.32 (vs our $1.36) and we expect: (1) sequential acceleration of iQOS shipment volume in Japan (+14.5%) given strength from next generation iQOS 3/Multi platforms; (2) iQOS to lead heat-not-burn (HNB) category growth in Japan and gain market share elsewhere; and (3) strong cigarette price realization.”Herzog gives PM a price target of $100, suggesting an upside potential of 22% to the stock. Her rating suggests that PM has more room for growth than the conventional wisdom would indicate – PM’s average price target is $93, indicating a possible upside of 15% from the share price of $81.PM’s analyst consensus rating is a moderate buy, derived from 7 buys and 3 holds in the last three months.TipRanks puts a wide variety of data analysis tools at your fingertips, so you can find the right investment for your portfolio.

2019-07-17,"Chip stocks face numerous challenges right now. Fundamentally speaking, markets continue to weaken due to the ongoing U.S./China trade war, while channel inventories remain elevated. Further headwinds arise from the US government's Huawei restrictions and weak 2H19 iPhone builds (down 15% year-over-year) aren't helping either. Luckily, top-rated KeyBanc analyst John Vinh has just released a valuable report setting out his chip expectations going into second quarter earnings. And he selects two chip stocks that still offer a compelling outlook for investors. However the analyst does caution “Huawei expectations are likely to be a source of confusion, as it remains unclear as to which suppliers have stopped or resumed shipments given different interpretations of the entity list rules.” With this warning in mind, let’s take a closer look at the two buy-rated stocks now:  Broadcom Inc (AVGO)The number one chip stock for Vinh is semiconductor giant Broadcom. Vinh sees positive risk/reward for AVGO right now thanks to a slew of encouraging reasons. Most notably, the company’s current guidance excludes contributions from Huawei. As a result the analyst believes the easing of trade restrictions and possibility Broadcom has already begun shipping will allow the company to reiterate full -year guidance. At the same time, Vinh singles out M&A as a defensive mechanism in the current downturn. That’s because accretive cost synergies should limit downside risk to EPS. “While the acquisition of another software company is unlikely to result in multiple expansion, outsized earnings growth is likely to lead to stock outperformance assuming the current valuation multiple remains constant” explains the analyst on July 16. For example, the company was recently in talks to buy out cybersecurity stock Symantec (SYMC), although the deal has now reportedly stalled over price disagreements. Nonetheless, as Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein commented: “Broadcom buys software companies, that’s their strategy. If this falls apart, they’ll buy something else at some point.” Putting this altogether, Vinh expect AVGO to post in line F3 Q19 (Jul) results and reiterate full -year guidance. (Note that Broadcom reports results off quarter, which means that its next earnings are for the fiscal third quarter.) The analyst’s current $310 price target indicates 9% upside from the stock’s $284 price target. Even though the stock has faltered in the last three months, shares still are up 12% year-to-date. That’s with an impressive 1-year change of 40%. Adding weight to his call is the fact that we can see Vinh has a strong 88% success rate return when it comes to his AVGO ratings. That’s with an average return per Broadcom rating of 31.8%. Encouragingly, the Street shares this bullish approach. The stock holds a Strong Buy analyst consensus, and a $312 average price target (10% upside potential). In fact, out of 27 analysts polled on the stock in the last three months, 21 rate the stock a buy and only 6 rate the stock a hold.  Xilinx, Inc. (XLNX)Also on Vinh’s ‘buy’ list is Xilinx, a supplier of programmable logic devices. The stock has surged since June when the company revealed that its seven nanometer (nm) Versal adaptive compute acceleration program (ACAP) chips had already begun shipping to customers.“We believe current estimates are achievable given 5G rollouts exChina and the anticipated recovery in AIT (A&D, Industrial, TME). We anticipate in-line F1Q20 (June) results and in-line to higher F2Q20 (Sept.) guidance” writes Vinh. The company is set to report June quarter earnings on Wednesday, July 24th, after the market close. The analyst adds: “We believe expectations for XLNX have already been largely been derisked, when the Company previously lowered its outlook for WWG (Wired and Wireless Group) to 12.5% growth in FY20 (March).” He has a $130 price target on the stock- which is exactly in line with the Street’s average price target. Meanwhile Vinh’s track record on Xilinx works out slightly under his AVGO record- but the success rate is still an impressive 76% with a 24.4% average return per rating. Overall, the Street shows a cautiously optimistic outlook for Xilinx stock. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus with analysts equally split between hold and buy. Right now, the most bullish analyst on the stock is Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities. He recently ramped up his price target to $165, indicating 37% upside potential.“Even with Huawei not expected to be a major customer for Xilinx in the future, we believe management will continue to support a 5-year mid-teens sales and earnings growth profile driven by data center acceleration, 5G broad-based exposure outside of Huawei, and industrial/ automotive traction enabled by an aggressive 7nm process technology ramp” explains Mosesmann.",KeyBanc: These Are The Only 2 Chip Stocks to Buy Into Earnings

2019-07-19,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s senior advisers have invited U.S. technology companies to the White House on Monday to discuss a resumption of sales to blacklisted Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co., according to people familiar with the matter.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arranged the meeting with semiconductor and software companies because they wanted to talk about how to move forward. A person familiar with the meeting said the White House asked the companies “to discuss economic matters.”Among those invited are Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., according to the people. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a tentative pause in their trade war and to resume negotiations after meeting at the Group-of-20 leaders’ summit in Japan on June 29. The U.S. president at the time said he would loosen restrictions on Huawei and that China had agreed to make agricultural purchases.The White House meeting is an effort to show China that Trump is serious about allowing U.S. companies to resume business with Huawei and encourage Beijing to move forward with buying more from U.S. farmers, one of the people said.Farm GoodsChina has told the Trump administration that it would only follow through on the farm purchases once the president issues export licenses for American companies to continue shipments to Huawei. The Commerce Department is leading the process, and has said it will only grant exceptions in cases where there’s no threat to national security.U.S. companies had halted shipments after the U.S. added Huawei to a trade blacklist in May, though some have resumed certain sales after reviewing the terms of the ban.Some in the U.S. administration are arguing for America to cut off Huawei from American suppliers entirely for national security reasons, and their view is supported by China hawks on Capitol Hill.White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this month that Trump is allowing the sale to Huawei of “low grade” chips that aren’t a security risk. The administration will ensure the Chinese telecom company won’t end up dominating 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Navarro told CNN.Chipmaker FortunesHuawei is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of semiconductors. Continuing access to Chinese customers is crucial to the fortunes of chipmakers such as Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom Inc.Some U.S.-based makers of the vital electronic components have already reported earnings and given forecasts that show the negative effects of the trade dispute. They’ve argued that their financial health is crucial to U.S. leadership of a strategically important industry.Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke by phone with their Chinese counterparts about trade on Thursday. Mnuchin has said if the talks progress over the phone, he and Lighthizer may travel to Beijing for in-person meetings.Trump said on Friday that the call with Chinese officials a day earlier was “very good” but that they’ll “see what happens.”The Washington Post reported earlier that U.S. technology companies planned to meet Kudlow at the White House on Monday.&#92;--With assistance from Mark Bergen.To contact the reporters on this story: Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.net;Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Sarah McGregor, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Mnuchin, Kudlow Invite U.S. Tech Giants to Discuss Huawei Ban"

2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China are moving closer to their first face-to-face trade negotiations in months, with a meeting between tech chief executives and President Donald Trump on Monday marking another step toward easing a ban on sales to China’s Huawei Technologies Co.The White House invited many of the U.S.’s biggest technology companies to discuss economic issues including a possible resumption of sales to Huawei. Trump and senior administration officials met with CEOs from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Broadcom Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp., Micron Technology Inc., Western Digital Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., according to White House spokesman Judd Deere.Deere said the CEOs had requested &quot;timely&quot; decisions on license applications to sell to Huawei and Trump agreed. National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow told reporters Tuesday that the meeting was positive and cited it as one reason he’s optimistic that in-person talks with China are likely to resume soon.The meeting between government officials and U.S. technology leaders may assuage Chinese concern that one of its largest technology companies is under existential threat from a blacklisting. But lawmakers and others in the administration who oppose any relief for Huawei could stymie any tentative progress in resolving a trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.Negotiating MissionChinese state media on Monday hailed signs of progress on Huawei as part of what it called efforts to display “sincerity and goodwill’’ by both sides. Any easing of restrictions on Huawei is expected to be met with a resumption of Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural commodities.“We expect, we hope strongly that China will very soon start buying agriculture products, number one as part of an overall deal and part two as a goodwill gesture,&quot; Kudlow said. “So I’m going to strike a note of hopefulness, and I think we will see the ag purchases come on soon.”The moves, which followed a meeting between Trump and China’s Xi Jinping in Japan late last month, are meant to clear the way for a trip to China by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as soon as next week.Such a trip would mark the first high-level negotiating mission to China since talks broke down in May.Business PerspectiveKudlow and Mnuchin led the meeting Monday, which also included Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Lighthizer attended as well, according to people familiar with the gathering. It was called to inject a business perspective into a debate that has often been driven by an intelligence and national security community eager to see an outright ban on Huawei, one of the people said.Xiaomeng Lu, international policy manager and head of the China practice at Access Partnership, said the meeting is an opportunity for U.S. companies to demonstrate how resuming sales to Huawei’s consumer business can help American corporations innovate better and outperform the Chinese telecoms giant in the long run.Trump will very likely face backlash from Congress if he chooses to allow shipments to the Chinese telecoms giant, especially after the Washington Post Monday reported that the company helped build North Korea’s 3G network in a potential violation of U.S. export control laws.Legislative Push BackMany U.S. lawmakers, including hawks in Trump’s own party, are opposed to the president’s approach on the issue and have made the case for a complete decoupling of supply chains that would cut off Huawei from American components.“At every turn, we learn more and more about what a malign actor Huawei is,” Senators Tom Cotton and Chris Van Hollen said in a statement following the Washington Post report. The revelation underscores Huawei’s serial violations of U.S. law, they added, saying it’s crucial Congress pass legislation they’ve sponsored.A spokesman for the Commerce Department, which oversaw the blacklisting of Huawei in May, declined to comment.Semiconductor TechnologyMost of those invited are suppliers of technology to Huawei, one of the biggest makers of smartphones and computer-network equipment. The chipmakers in particular have said that a blanket ban on doing business with the Chinese company may do more harm than good to U.S. national security.Many of the components they supply to Huawei can be easily obtained from companies elsewhere and jeopardizing their access to their biggest market risks cutting them off from revenue that’s vital to investing in their ability to maintain the U.S.’s lead in semiconductors, they’ve argued.Intel said in an emailed statement after the meeting that the company appreciated the opportunity to share its “perspective on economic issues, including how the current trade situation with China impacts the critical US semiconductor industry.&quot;Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company appreciated the opportunity to meet and stressed that &quot;open and fair trade are essential to ongoing U.S. technology leadership.&quot;Chinese companies, meanwhile, have begun asking U.S. exporters about buying agricultural products and also applied for exemptions from China’s retaliatory tariffs on the goods, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.The Chinese government met Friday with domestic soybean buyers about a plan to purchase more U.S. supplies, according to people familiar with the situation. That could include waiving China’s retaliatory tariffs, but details have not been decided yet, the people said.Face-to-FaceWith China’s top leadership likely to be out of Beijing from early August for their annual seaside conclave, people close to the talks say there is a narrow window for face-to-face meeting in the coming two weeks. Mnuchin, Lighthizer and their Chinese counterparts talked by phone last week for the second time since the two nations’ presidents met.Separate to the possible agricultural purchases, China announced Saturday new measures to further open up the nation’s financial sector to foreign investors. Foreign companies will be able to take a stake in or control entities including wealth management units of commercial lenders, pension fund managers and currency brokers.The changes weren’t announced as directly related to the trade talks with the U.S., but American criticism of China’s protection of various domestic markets is a core issue in the ongoing trade tensions.(Updates with Kudlow comment in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Miao Han, Justin Sink, Laura Litvan and Mark Milian.To contact the reporters on this story: Shawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.net;Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Alister BullFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Agrees to Timely Decisions on Huawei as China Talks Near

2019-07-24,"All seems quiet for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) now. And that's been a good thing so far for Nvidia stock. NVDA has gained 28% just since the beginning of June.Source: Shutterstock But news is on the way. Nvidia's fiscal second-quarter earnings should be reported in the middle of next month. And the company's guidance for the second half of fiscal 2020 will be closely scrutinized. NVDA - like many of its chip peers - has promised to deliver better results in the second half of the year. If it can deliver on its guidance, Nvidia stock price, which still sits 40%+ below its October highs, can continue to climb.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season What's helped Nvidia stock of late is that there's been no reason,apparently, for the company to cut its outlook. Its disappointing performance last year, when the company misjudged cryptocurrency demand and accumulated excess inventory as a result, no doubt drove skepticism toward Nvidia's outlook for this year. Surely there was at least a possibility that the company was overly optimistic about fiscal 2020 after its FY19 guidance proved to be excessively upbeat.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut as of right now, at least, NVDA looks like it's back on track. That's why Nvidia stock price has rallied in recent weeks, indicating that it could continue to climb for the rest of the year. The Big Second HalfAs I wrote back in March, NVDA is a second-half story. That's not exactly news. Nvidia's management has made that point repeatedly, even taking the unusual step of providing expectations for each half of the year. Year-over-year comparisons are notably easier in Q3 and Q4, thanks to the company's self-described &quot;crypto hangover&quot; that hit demand for its products in those quarters last year.Nvidia isn't the only chip maker that expects a second-half rebound. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) forecast a second-half recovery in the sales of its data-center business, which is fending off competition from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Chip leader Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) gave a similar outlook this spring, though recent commentary from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) after its fiscal Q2 report was more circumspect.Nvidia's guidance certainly appeared logical  and still does. Again, its comparisons are easier. And it does seem like data-center demand paused earlier this year, but there's no reason to believe that demand from datacenters is stopping any time soon. However, the question was whether Nvidia's guidance would be accurate, given competition and its big miss in Q3 of last year. Increasingly, it seems likely that the company's guidance will be on target. A Bit of Good News for NVDATwo key factors should make investors optimistic about NVDA's Q2 results  and Q3 guidance. First, Nvidia hasn't changed its tune. At a conference last month, CFO Colette Kress reiterated her call for a recovery in data-center demand. Q2 is &quot;still a little cloudy&quot;, she admitted. But the company kept its broad forecast intact.That's important. In light of the haircut given to Nvidia stock last year - the stock dropped over 50% in less than three months - Nvidia management knows its credibility is on the line in the second half of this year. If NVDA's top executives were at all uncertain about its outlook, it's likely that the company would be signaling that uncertainty ahead of next month's earnings release.That doesn't appear to be the case, at least in public. And Nvidia isn't sending those signals to Wall Street, either. Rather, analysts are becoming more upbeat on Nvidia stock. Wedbush initiated NVDA with a &quot;buy&quot; rating. A survey from Piper Jaffray (NYSE:PJC) highlighted strong gaming demand ahead for NVDA. Cascend Securities upgraded Nvidia stock this month. Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) forecast a second-half gaming recovery, underpinning its upgrade of Nvidia stock last month.Analysts can be wrong. But ahead of NVDA's bloodbath last year, Wall Street was warning of crypto weakness. ( AMD, which reported earnings three weeks before Nvidia, identified the crypto plunge, helping those calls.)This time, however, Wall Street seems to getting more positive on Nvidia stock. That would seem to bode well for its performance during the rest of the year. Questions About the Valuation of Nvidia StockThe one worry about NVDA at this point might be valuation. Again, Nvidia stock price has rallied sharply in the past seven weeks. The stock now trades at 24 times next year's average EPS estimates, which reflect a quick return to growth.24 times isn't a huge multiple in this tech market, but it's still a big number for a chip stock. Increasingly, the valuation suggests that NVDA will definitely recover in the second half, and it also reflects the company's easy comparison in the first half of FY21.In other words, at least some of the recent lack of news probably is priced into NVDA stock. And that might suggest rising expectations ahead of Q3 - and maybe something closer to a ceiling on NVDA stock.Still, NVDA long-term opportunity  still looks intact. Nvidia should be able to take share from a struggling Intel. And its valuation is acceptable, since its P/E multiple was 35+ less than a year ago. If Nvidia truly is back on track, NVDA stock can keep rallying. Increasingly, that looks like the case.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-30,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock slipped a bit last week. It's easy to see why. Longtime Qualcomm troublemaker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) threw another jab at QCOM. It did so by announcing plans to buy Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) smartphone-modem chip business.Why is that important to QCOM stock?  Apple is using Qualcomm's chips in its smartphones and has for some time. By paying Intel at least $1 billion for its modem business, Apple is showing that it's eager to reduce its dependency on  Qualcomm. By 2021, AAPL may not buy any chips from QCOM.That probably shouldn't come as a surprise after Qualcomm crushed Apple in the companies'  long-running patent litigation earlier this year. Qualcomm scored a settlement of at least $4.5 billion up front, plus future patent royalties, so Apple's bitterness towards QCOM makes sense.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels QCOM stock skyrocketed from $55 to $90 in a few weeks following its huge patent victory over Apple. It appeared that Qualcomm was on a steady path higher going forward. But a different foe emerged in May, leading Qualcomm stock to dive back to $70 again. A Judge Derails Qualcomm Stock's RallyQualcomm  enjoyed an absolutely massive rally following its patent victory over Apple. At the time, many analysts suggested that QCOM stock could hit $100 or more in coming months. Instead, Qualcomm stock has slumped recently due to a district judge's ruling against QCOM. She said that Qualcomm charged excessive licensing fees and impeded competition unfairly.It's not hard to see how she could reach that conclusion. Qualcomm's opponents have long claimed that the company charged more for licensing its intellectual property than rival firms. The court's decision backed that line of reasoning and threatens Qualcomm's patent revenue stream to some extent.However, it's unclear whether the legal issues will affect Qualcomm's prospects in the long run. For one thing, Qualcomm is appealing the decision. Some analysts have suggested that the judge took the FTC's word as gospel and didn't decide the case fairly. And from a broader perspective, Apple has been trying to get away from relying on Qualcomm's technology for years. Selling QCOM stock due to day-to-day developments in the long-running Apple versus Qualcomm drama has rarely worked out well. The Attractive Valuation of Qualcomm StockQualcomm's ups and downs over the years haven't diminished its tremendous allure as a growth and income play. If you like getting a solid and rising income stream from a leading tech company, you should buy QCOM stock.Rather remarkably for a tech firm, Qualcomm has now boosted its annual dividend for 16 years in a row. Since 2004, Qualcomm stock's annual dividend has grown more than tenfold from 22 cents per year to $2.40 annually now. Its dividend has jumped by compound annual growth rates of 19% and 17% over the past five and ten years, respectively.These dividend hikes are backed by a robust earnings outlook. Analysts, on average, see Qualcomm delivering earnings per share of $5.07 over the next year. Given the current  QCOM stock price of $75, that amounts to a price-earnings ratio of just 15. And that's just as telecom spending is starting to surge as carriers deploy their 5G technology.Analysts, on average, expect Qualcomm's EPS to jump 27% per year over the next five years. Even assuming  that QCOM's earnings rise by a more conservative 18% per year, they would double in four years. Given QCOM's starting dividend and P/E ratio, that would make QCOM stock quite compelling. The Verdict on QCOM StockIt's been a roller coaster for Qualcomm's shareholders. The stock periodically surges for some reason. such as the attempted Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) takeover last year. Then, invariably, QCOM has  fallen back to earth due to outside factors.Last year, the Trump administration scuttled the Broadcom deal. This year, Qualcomm hit a major legal setback just a month after its huge win against Apple. The trade war is continuing. Qualcomm, like most other semiconductor companies, remains under a dark cloud until that is resolved.In the long run, however, QCOM stock is set to recover. In fact, it should hit $100 at some point over the next year or two. Through all the political noise and legal drama, Qualcomm keeps spitting out profits. With the adoption of 5G set to really take off in 2020, Qualcomm is at the center of another big round of infrastructure spending.The accelerating rise of connected cars and the internet of things will be two more big drivers for QCOM stock in coming years. There will be ups and downs for QCOM when it comes to patent royalties and legal battles, but Qualcomm will win the majority of the time.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned QCOM stock and INTC stock.

2019-08-06,"The markets are looking perilous right now, with rising trade tensions and Federal Reserve uncertainty sparking heavy selling. While there has been a flight out of stocks generally - Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is off almost 6% over the past five days - dividend stocks are gaining a little appeal.Investors were caught off guard after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point. Some were expecting a half-point cut, and others were expecting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to signal another quarter-point cut later in the year (he didn't). Then America's trade war with China flared up after President Donald Trump threatened a new round of tariffs, which the Chinese replied to by cutting off imports of U.S. agricultural products and momentarily letting its yuan currency slip above a key level.Dividend stocks can help smooth out returns during volatile periods like this. Morgan Stanley private wealth adviser Christopher Poch is a firm believer in dividend investing. He writes, &quot;In over 33 years in the wealth management industry, I have seen what works for the long-term, tax paying investor. The importance of dividends and the contribution to overall total return, for new and experienced investors alike, should not be overlooked.&quot;&quot;Not only do dividend stocks as a group have less volatility year- to- year, they outperform nondividend paying stocks over time as well,&quot; Poch writes. &quot;Over the last 90+ years, dividends have accounted for more than 40% of the total return equation.&quot;Here are five dividend stocks that TipRanks has identified as earning a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; rating by Wall Street's analyst community. Each of these stocks boasts relatively high yields between 3% and 5% - well more than the broader market's current 1.9% - and are projected to gain between 17% and 65% over the next 12 months.

2019-08-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. is nearing an agreement to buy the division of Symantec Corp. that serves large corporate customers for roughly $10 billion in cash after talks for a full acquisition of the cybersecurity company failed, according to people familiar with the matter.A deal for Symantec’s enterprise unit would come less than a month after the companies’ discussions for a full merger fell apart over disagreements about the price. Such a transaction would reshape Symantec to focus on its consumer-facing products, such as the LifeLock identity-protection brand and Norton anti-virus software.If talks to buy the unit are successful, a deal could be announced as soon as Thursday, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. No decision is final and negotiations may still fall apart.Representatives for Broadcom and Symantec couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. The new talks were reported earlier Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal. Symantec shares surged 14% in extended trading on the news.The divestiture would be the latest shakeup at Symantec, which has faced major challenges in the past year, including the abrupt departure of its chief executive officer, an activist investor and a financial investigation that ended with restated earnings. Activist investor Starboard Value LP won three seats on Symantec’s board in September, including one for the firm’s managing member, Peter Feld.San Jose, California-based Broadcom had been on the hunt to buy software assets, following its $18 billion takeover last year of CA Technologies. That transaction spurred some investors to express concern that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan was stretching his acquisition strategy too far, after playing a key role in consolidating the $470 billion chip industry.To contact the reporters on this story: Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, ;Daniel Hauck at dhauck1@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Nears Deal to Buy Symantec Enterprise Unit

2019-08-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Huawei Technologies Co. took the wraps off its “HarmonyOS” operating system Friday, offering the first glimpses of in-house software that may someday replace Google’s Android and reduce its reliance on American technology.To begin with, the open-source software will skip smartphones and instead find its way into everything from cars and watches to personal computers by 2020, Richard Yu, chief executive of the consumer business said during a launch event. Earbuds and virtual reality goggles will follow. Huawei is considering running the OS on its upcoming flagship Mate 30, he told reporters.“Because we support Google’s Android ecosystem, we will prioritize Android for smartphones. If we can’t use Android, we can install HarmonyOS quickly,” Yu said at Huawei’s developers conference in Dongguan. “We had a great chance to become the world’s biggest vendor by shipment -- if not for the trade war.”HarmonyOS, previously code-named “Hongmeng” or “Ark,” is an important part of Huawei’s effort to develop alternatives in response to sanctions on American technology it needs to make its gear. Underscoring the unpredictability of supply, Bloomberg News reported the White House is delaying a decision about licenses for U.S. companies to resume selling to Huawei.China’s largest technology company has found itself at the center of sensitive trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, with the latter accusing its geopolitical rival of stealing technology and posing a risk to U.S. national security. Irrespective of how the talks play out, Trump administrative curbs have all but smothered Huawei’s goal of overtaking Samsung Electronics Co. to become the world’s largest maker of smartphones.While Huawei’s operating system may serve it well in its domestic market, any plans to dethrone Google’s Android globally will be misplaced, according to Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.“Huawei with deep pockets and scale in China can pull this off in the domestic market, but to reach Google Android level service integration and app quality outside China is going to be less trivial and a mammoth task,” he said.Huawei seems confident it can do it. “Our HarmonyOS is more powerful and secure than Android, and it has greater distributed capability and is future-facing,” Yu said. “Can HarmonyOS be installed on smartphones? Of course.”For HarmonyOS to work, Huawei will need developers to build apps for its ecosystem -- a major question mark around its fledgling software. “It took Android a decade to reach here with deep integration of Google Mobile Services, and it now has a well curated and relatively secure App Store with millions of apps, advanced AI capabilities,” Shah added.Last year, Huawei spent at least 500 million yuan ($70 million) to lure developers to work on its homegrown OS, and the company may invest more this year, said Yu. “The biggest attraction is our profit-sharing scheme. We may only keep 10% of the app profits and leave the rest to developers,” he said.The efficacy of HarmonyOS is something Huawei still has to prove. Yu went into back-end technical details but refrained from describing consumer-facing features, suggesting it may not yet be ready for prime-time.To help with app migration, HarmonyOS will be built on the Linux and Huawei’s own LiteOS kernels for now, Yu said, which will change in future generations of the OS.Two months into a Trump administration ban that cut off Huawei from American suppliers, Huawei is starting to feel the pinch. It warned of a tougher performance in the second half of 2019 and has been internally preparing for a drop in overseas smartphone shipments of a staggering 60 million units. Yu said Friday that sanctions imposed in May had already reduced smartphone shipments by more than 10 million units in the second quarter.Huawei is delaying the release of its first foldable smartphone Mate X because of “production volume issues”. Yu warned buyers may have to wait until November for the long-awaited product. The postponement is a major blow for the Chinese company, which is battling Samsung and Apple in the global smartphone market.Huawei has looked to its home turf to offset international headwinds. The company has assigned as many as 10,000 engineers, working across three shifts a day, to develop alternatives to American software and components. Huawei already designs its own HiSilicon Kirin processors, though it retains a reliance on U.S. firms such as Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. for additional wireless chips.And it’s focusing on domestic sales: the company commanded 37% of the Chinese smartphone market in the second quarter, according to IDC, giving it roughly the same share as the second and third largest vendors combined. Strong home-market sales boosted Huawei’s shipments by 24% to 118 million units in the first half, the company said earlier.(Updates with comments from analyst in the seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Simran Jagdev.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Huawei Takes a Step Toward Replacing Google’s Phone Software

2019-08-09,"(Bloomberg) -- The White House is holding off on a decision about licenses for U.S. companies to restart business with Huawei Technologies Co. after Beijing said it was halting purchases of U.S. farming goods, according to people familiar with the matter.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department has vetted the applications to resume sales, said last week he’s received 50 requests and that a decision on them was pending. American businesses require a special license to supply goods to Huawei after the U.S. added the Chinese telecommunications giant to a trade blacklist in May over national-security concerns.The U.S. decision rattled stocks, bonds, currencies and even soybean prices around the world. Huawei suppliers Micron Technology Inc. and Western Digital Corp. declined as much as 2.2% after news of the delay in license approvals, while Qualcomm Inc., Xilinx Inc. and NeoPhotonics Corp. all fell more than 1% in after-hours trading. Huawei’s dollar bond spreads widened by 10 to 15 basis points Friday morning, while the Australian dollar and offshore yuan weakened versus the greenback and the yen gained.Trade TrucePresident Donald Trump said in late June after agreeing to a now-broken trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Japan that some restrictions on Huawei would be loosened. But that promise was contingent upon China beefing up its purchases from American farmers, which Trump has complained the country has failed to do.In the past week tensions have escalated further as Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports as of Sept. 1 and his Treasury Department formally labeled China a currency manipulator.Still, Trump said last week there were no plans to reverse the decision he made in Japan to allow more sales by U.S. suppliers of non-sensitive products to Huawei. He said the issue of Huawei is not related to the trade talks.The White House had no immediate comment, and the Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei also declined to comment. China’s foreign affairs and commerce ministries didn’t immediately respond to faxed requests for comment.Tech PitchTechnology companies have already made their pitch to the White House for a rapid granting of licenses that would allow them to resume some shipments of components to Huawei.The Chinese company is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of semiconductors. Continuing access to that market is crucial to the fortunes of chipmakers such as Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. who sent their chief executives to meet with Trump in July.Companies such as Xilinx Inc. and Micron have publicly said they’ve applied for licenses and called on the U.S. to allow them to resume doing business with Huawei. They argue that many of their products are easily obtainable from their overseas rivals, making a ban ineffective and also harmful to the industry that the trade dispute with China is supposed to be helping.Some U.S.-based makers of electronic components have already reported earnings and given forecasts that show the negative effects of the trade dispute.(Updates with bond spread moves in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Adam Haigh and Jeran Wittenstein.To contact the reporters on this story: Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.net;Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, ;Michael Shepard at mshepard7@bloomberg.net, ;Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Sarah McGregor, Scott LanmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Holds Off on Huawei Licenses as China Halts Crop-Buying
2019-08-09,In contrast to the intense optimism we saw on the market during the trading day the after hours scene is mixed There are reasons for investors to be optimistic after months of will they or won t they suspense IT companies Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO and Symantec NASDAQ,"After Hours: Uber's Big Q2 Whiffs, Broadcom and Symantec Seal Their Deal"
2019-08-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. said it agreed to buy Symantec Corp.’s division that serves business customers for $10.7 billion in cash, adding software designed to keep hackers out of corporate systems.The deal, which is expected to close in Broadcom’s fiscal first quarter ending in January, comes less than a month after the two companies’ discussions for a full merger fell apart over disagreements about the price. The transaction announced Thursday will refocus Symantec on its consumer-facing products, such as the LifeLock identity-protection brand and Norton antivirus software.The acquisition marks Broadcom’s second big bet in software, following its $19 billion takeover of CA Technologies last year. Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan is spreading the reach of the company he built through acquisitions in the chip industry, and is now using a similar playbook to extract value from software assets that are struggling to grow.Symantec has been grappling with major challenges in the past year, facing job cuts, an internal investigation that led to restated earnings and the sudden departure of its CEO in May. The 37-year-old company provides products and services to more than 300,000 businesses and 50 million consumers, according to its website.“This transaction represents the next logical step in our strategy following our acquisitions of Brocade and CA Technologies,” Tan said in a statement. Broadcom will use its sales channels to pitch Symantec products to its corporate customers.Broadcom said it expects $2 billion in sustainable revenue from the acquisition, which will deliver earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $1.3 billion. The company will carve out “more than $1 billion of run-rate cost synergies within 12 months following close,” it said in the statement. The transaction doesn’t need approval in China, Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause said on a conference call.Broadcom is maintaining its fiscal year 2019 sales forecast of $22.5 billion. About $17.5 billion of that revenue will come from chips and $5 billion from infrastructure software, the company said in the statement.The chip market is still suffering from the impact of the trade dispute between China and the U.S., but business conditions haven’t worsened since the company gave its forecast in June.Broadcom is going to concentrate the use of its cash flow on paying down debt to make sure it retains its investment rating, Krause said.Symantec had been projected to report overall sales growth of just 1% in its current fiscal year, according to analysts’ estimates. That would follow a 2% decline in the previous 12 months. Symantec’s lackluster outlook mirrors the performance of previous targets for Tan and his team. So far he’s been successful in turning them around.The enterprise business generated about $2.3 billion in sales in the last fiscal year for the Mountain View, California-based company. While Symantec’s revenue may not be growing, the purchase of a piece of the company will bring with it wider profit margins -- higher than those typically achieved in the chip industry, which historically requires greater levels of investment and higher costs to build products. Symantec’s gross margin, the percentage of sales remaining after deducting costs of production, will reach 83% this year, according to estimates. Broadcom’s margin is predicted to be a full 10 percentage points lower than that.Symantec said the sale is expected to generate $8.2 billion after taxes, which it will provide to shareholders after the completion of the deal in the form of a special dividend of $12 a share. It plans to cut jobs, reducing its headcount by about 7%. It’ll also close some facilities incurring charges of about $100 million.Tan’s strategy has been to acquire “franchises,” groups or businesses within companies that have sustainable market positions through technology leadership. He then invests in them to maintain that leadership, running the purchased units as distinct parts of Broadcom, rather than integrating them.The discipline he’s brought to his acquisitions and the spinoff or sale of other assets has created a more profitable company. Broadcom’s estimated gross margin for fiscal 2019 is more than 10 points wider than what the company reported in 2016.Symantec was advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and its legal adviser was Fenwick & West LLP. Broadcom was working with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp, Barclays Plc, Bank of Montreal, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Canada and Morgan Stanley, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was its legal adviser.(Updates advisers in the final paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Nabila Ahmed.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom to Buy Symantec’s Enterprise Unit for $10.7 Billion

2019-08-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Huawei Technologies Co. hired the law firm Sidley Austin LLP to lobby on trade as the U.S. pressures allies to join it in blacklisting the Chinese telecom giant and the company finds itself increasingly mired in President Donald Trump’s trade war with Beijing.The lobbying, which began in July, will focus on export controls, trade sanctions “and other national security-related topics,” according to a disclosure filed with the U.S. Senate. The document shows that Huawei is deepening its ties to Sidley Austin, which is already working on the company’s legal challenges in the U.S., while also ramping up its lobbying presence.Huawei, which is under an existential threat after the Trump administration blocked it from buying American technology over national-security concerns, has been drawn into the latest escalation of the trade war.Only six weeks ago, following a meeting in Japan with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said he’d delay imposing some restrictions on U.S. companies’ sales to Huawei. The U.S. even invited companies to apply for licenses under an exemption to the Huawei ban.But Bloomberg reported on Aug. 8 that the White House was holding off any decisions on those licenses. The delay follows a series of rapid-fire, tit-for-tat moves including Trump announcing plans to impose tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports in September and China halting purchases of U.S farm goods. The U.S. also declared China a currency manipulator.Deepens TiesSidley Austin is already defending Huawei and a U.S. affiliate against charges that they defrauded at least four banks by concealing business dealings in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.U.S. prosecutors are seeking to disqualify the company’s lead lawyer in the case, James Cole, because they say his former role as the No. 2 at the Justice Department gave him access to classified information that represents an “obvious conflict of interest.” A hearing has been scheduled in the matter in September.Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei, is also charged in the case. She remains free on bail in Vancouver while she fights extradition to the U.S.Sidley is also representing Huawei in a suit against the U.S. over seizure of telecommunications equipment during an investigation into whether the gear required export licenses. Neither Cole nor the lawyers listed in that lawsuit are among the lobbyists on the disclosure.The Chinese company is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of semiconductors. Continuing those sales is crucial to the fortunes of chipmakers such as Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc., who sent their chief executives to meet with Trump in July.Huawei has seen a dramatic slowdown in sales growth as it deals with the U.S. campaign.Alphabet Inc.’s Google stopped providing Huawei with a version of its Android operating system, which lets apps run and provides mobile security on smartphones. That means Huawei, the world’s second-biggest smartphone seller, can no longer pre-install Google’s popular apps, like Gmail and YouTube, on Huawei devices.To fight back, Huawei last week unveiled an in-house operating system, called HarmonyOS, saying it can replace Android if Google’s software is barred from its future smartphones. But Ren also said the company needed a lot more time to build an apps ecosystem, a requirement for any operating software to thrive in the long run.American OnslaughtHuawei, which the U.S. says poses a risk because it must cooperate with Beijing’s espionage agencies under Chinese law, is kicking off a yearslong overhaul to create an “iron army” that can help it survive an American onslaught while protecting its lead in next-generation wireless, Ren warned in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.The U.S. says Huawei can build backdoors into its equipment and that it has stolen other companies’ intellectual property. The Shenzhen-based company counters that governments and customers in 170 countries use its equipment, which poses no greater cybersecurity threat than that of any communications technology vendor. Huawei says that the campaign results from Washington’s realization that the U.S. has fallen behind in developing fifth-generation mobile networks.Huawei, which had all but shut down its Washington lobbying operation at the end of 2018, has also recently hired the law firms of Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Jones Day as lobbyists. After Samir Jain, a Jones Day partner who served on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, registered to lobby for the company, Trump criticized the move in a tweet. The company says Jain will help with legal efforts and not lobby.Sidley Austin also represents the U.S. division of Chinese video surveillance company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and organizations with ties to the governments of Hong Kong and Russia, according to disclosures. It also represents Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News.&#92;--With assistance from Ian King, Jenny Leonard, Shawn Donnan, Mark Bergen and Bill Allison.To contact the reporter on this story: Ben Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Jillian Ward, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Huawei Hires Trade Lobbyists as Sales Slow in U.S.-China Fight

2019-08-14,"Investing is all about returns, and investors want to see their money work. The tech sector has long been known for spectacular return on investment (ROI) among the giant corporations. Just think about Amazon’s (AMZN) sky-high share price, or Microsoft’s (MSFT) trillion-dollar market cap – but the average tech stocks have shown themselves to be vulnerable to market pressures, especially from China. In today’s environment, with US-China trade tensions continuing to simmer and fears growing of a Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong, it only makes sense to expect tech stocks to suffer.But not all of them are. Here, we’ll look at two chip stocks that have been delivering for their shareholders, and have what it takes to succeed in these dynamic times. Flagging Microchip Technologies for a Bullish BreakoutThe semiconductor industry is broad, and Microchip Technologies (MCHP) has found its niche within it. The company focuses on integrated circuits, microcontrollers, and related processor chips for professional and home uses. MCHP’s products have a wide range of applications, from IoT to touchscreen technology to home appliances to the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. It just goes to show that a narrowly focused product can have broader applications.And broader applications are good for profits. MCHP is up 25% year-to-date, beating the S&P 500’s 16% return, and in its recent fiscal Q1 earnings report beat the EPS estimate by 12.8%, on revenues that met expectations. In an added bonus for investors, MCHP has a history of regular dividend payments at 36 cents per share quarterly. While a modest payout, it’s a bit of icing on top of that year-to-date share appreciation.Wall Street’s top analysts are taking note of MCHP, acknowledging the company’s profitable niche and potential. 5-star Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who in January downgraded the stock, has since revised his stance and set it as a buying prospect. His $100 price target suggests an upside of 15% to the shares. (To watch Gill's track record, click here)Gill is not alone going bullish on Microchip. 5-star analyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt, wrote, “We reiterate our Buy rating for MCHP with a $115 price target…” That price target indicates a 32% upside. And writing from B. 4-star Riley FBR, Craig Ellis said, “Q/Q revenue growth midpoint, coupled with CEO Sanghi’s positive tone, embolden confidence growth is returning for chip suppliers…” Ellis set a bullish $120 price target, suggesting he sees room for a 38% upside potential.Overall, Microchip has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 8 recent ratings including 7 buys and 1 hold. The average price target, $109, suggests an upside of 25% from the current share price of $90. (See MCHP's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks) Broadcom Stock Has 25% Upside, Says Merrill Lynch Broadcom (AVGO) Stock is up 9% so far this year, which underperforms the broader market indexes, but for return-minded investors AVGO’s dividend more than compensates the slower share gains. At 3.74%, the yield is double the S&P 500 average, and the high share price makes the payout $10.60 cents per share annualized.5-star Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya took note of Broadcom’s recent acquisition efforts, specifically the company’s attempt to purchase cybersecurity company Symantec (SYMC). Arya writes, “In July, there were media reports of Broadcom being in talks to buy Symantec as a whole. The latest deal is reportedly for Symantec’s enterprise security business, which is a better fit for Broadcom than acquiring the entire company.” Arya goes on to note that Broadcom has a successful history of M&A, saying “the strategy has proved to be extremely effective in consistently generating free cash flow.” Arya’s approval of AVGO stock is reflected in $345 price target and 27% upside prediction on the stock. (To watch Arya's track record, click here)5-star analyst Mitch Steves, writing from RBC Capital, also takes a bullish stance on AVGO. In initiating coverage with a Buy rating last month, Steves said, “The stock offers potential for multiple expansion given the company's long-term earnings growth well into double digits and a healthy capital allocation.” Steves’ price target for Broadcom, $320, suggests a 18% upside.Broadcom’s analyst consensus rating is a Strong Buy, derived from 23 buy ratings and 7 holds given in the past three months. Shares are selling for $277 and the stock carries an average price target of $313, giving it an upside potential of 15%.

2019-08-15,"Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have traded sideways as of late. Since my last article on the chip maker, NVDA stock has fallen from an open of $165.50 on July 2 to $156.05 share on August 13 then losing another $6 in yesterday's carnage .Source: Shutterstock So, with earnings due out today, is it time to buy NVDA stock?Not so fast! While the company has positive growth catalysts in the pipeline, the shares could be overvalued. NVDA stock trades at a discount to competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). But high expectations continue to be priced into Nvidia stock. With shares continuing to trade at a premium to broad line chip makers, now may not be the best time to buy into this one. Here's why I recommend some patience before making a move.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What's Going on at NVDA?With NVDA stock, several factors come into play. Among them are the U.S.-China trade war and the global chip glut. But the biggest factor is the GPU war with AMD. Last month, Nvidia launched the RTX line to compete with AMD's family of Navi GPUs.Both chip makers are competing for dominance of the gaming market. Part of the battle is based on performance. But price has been the primary factor in the war. AMD may have gotten the better of Nvidia on price. After pushing Nvidia to cut prices, AMD caught them off guard again -- with another price reduction. * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now This price war underscores Nvidia's troubles in the gaming space. But what future catalysts will be a shot in the arm for the Nvidia stock price? Perhaps cloud gaming is the ticket to future growth. Nvidia's GeForce NOW enables PC gamers to stream more than 500 games from anywhere, using Nvidia's GPUs remotely. The service is currently in beta, but a million-plus players have signed up for the wait list. The subscription-based service could be a cash cow for Nvidia. But cloud gaming remains a work in progress. Widespread availability of 5G is required before cloud gaming reaches critical mass.Nvidia's other businesses face headwinds as well. Last quarter, the company projected continued weak sales for the data center segment. The analyst community also believes that the data center business has yet to turnaround. But if the company can beat expectations and provide an improved forecast, investors could see a boost in the Nvidia stock price.Much of this risk could already be factored into the Nvidia stock price. But this does not necessarily mean NVDA is undervalued. With this in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia stock's current valuation. Nvidia Stock is Not CheapNvidia stock continues to trade at a discount to AMD shares. NVDA currently trades at a forward price/earnings (forward P/E) ratio of 38, compared to AMD's 69.5 forward P/E. In terms of enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), NVDA trades at an EV/EBITDA ratio of 28.4, compared to AMD's EV/EBITDA ratio of 69.7.While NVDA trades at a lower valuation than AMD, I continue to believe that Nvidia stock is not cheap. NVDA trades at premium to broad line chip makers such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.5 and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 7. Another broad line chip maker, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), trades at a forward P/E of 50.3, but at a lower EV/EBITDA ratio (14.2) than Nvidia. With the company's growth troubles, it is tough to justify the stock's current premium to the broad line chip names. NVDA may be a strong opportunity down the road, but not at the current price. * Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon agrees. Rasgon recently gave the stock a &quot;market perform&quot; rating, believing the shares' current valuation minimized potential upside. As he wrote in his client note, &quot;We remain somewhat cautious into the print nonetheless, and believe better entry points may exist at later dates.&quot;Rasgon's price target is $150 a share. I believe NVDA stock could go materially lower. If NVDA continues to disappoint, shares could trade closer to the valuations of the broad line chip makers. Bottom Line on NVDA StockInvestors have beaten down NVDA stock but they're not yet at bargain levels. While the company's valuation is below arch rival AMD, Nvidia stock continues to trade at a fairly high valuation. More bad news could hit the price and present a stronger buying opportunity. But it could also be a warning sign to avoid the stock further. Take your time with NVDA. Wait until a better entry point, then make your move.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The U.S. will extend for another 90 days a limited set of exemptions that had protected rural networks and other U.S. customers from a ban on doing business with China’s Huawei Technologies Co., Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday.Some telecom companies in the U.S. are “dependent” on Huawei, and so a 90-day reprieve was deemed appropriate, Ross said in an interview with Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo. Still, the U.S. also added more than 40 Huawei affiliates to a trade blacklist.“We’re giving them a little more time to wean themselves off,” he added. Ross said the next deadline will be around Nov. 19. He added that Commerce decided to place 46 more Huawei subsidiaries on its entity list.The announcement doesn’t address the wider national-security concerns about Huawei and answer the bigger question of whether U.S. chip companies and other major suppliers will be allowed to sell parts to China.Huawei said in a statement that the temporary relief “does not change the fact that Huawei has been treated unjustly. Today’s decision won’t have a substantial impact on Huawei’s business either way.” The move to add more of Huawei’s affiliates to the so-called Entity List “at this particular time, is politically motivated and has nothing to do with national security,” the company said.QuickTake: How Huawei Became a Target for GovernmentsPresident Donald Trump over the weekend indicated the U.S. was “doing very well with China, and talking” but also suggested he wasn’t ready to sign a trade deal.U.S. stocks rallied Monday after the Trump administration signaled progress on trade negotiations and Ross announced the extension. Huawei, China’s largest technology company by sales, has been at the heart of worsening tensions and been called a bargaining chip in thorny trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. Trump had said he anticipated talking with Chinese President Xi Jinping “very soon” and the Huawei move may sweeten the tone of those discussions.Huawei, for its part, has been trying to carry on operations in face of U.S. sanctions on the sale of the vital technology. The company this month announced its in-house HarmonyOS, an open-source operating system that could one day serve as a replacement for Google Inc.’s Android if its access to that software is curtailed.Without Android or the numerous American silicon, technology and consultancy suppliers that Huawei does business with, many of its most promising product lines would either cease their rapid growth or be thwarted entirely.Rural AreasThe U.S. Commerce Department previously granted a three-month temporary license to Huawei’s U.S. customers shortly after the Trump administration blacklisted the Chinese company. That allowed telecom carriers in rural areas to continue using Huawei equipment and Google to provide only key Android security updates to Huawei phones.The latest extension came after Trump met in July with the chief executives of key Huawei suppliers from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Broadcom Inc. to Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. to discuss economic issues including a possible resumption of sales to Huawei. U.S. companies argued that Huawei will turn to non-American suppliers if sanctions persisted, hurting the U.S. in the long run. But trade talks with Beijing ground to a halt and China refused to resume purchases of American agricultural products.National SecurityThe announcement Monday came one day after Trump suggested that Huawei was unlikely to receive another extension, pushing back against news reports about an expected reprieve.“At this moment, it looks much more like we’re not going to do business,” Trump told reporters on Sunday in New Jersey. “I don’t want to do business at all, because it is a national security threat.”The president tied trade negotiations with the ongoing situation in Hong Kong, saying that a deal between the U.S. and China would be harder if there’s a violent conclusion to protests there because of concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers.Earlier this month, the trade war between the two countries intensified as the U.S. announced a next round of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports between Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. China responded with a boycott of American farm products and allowed its currency to weaken, signaling that this can help cushion the tariff blow.(Updates with Huawei reaction in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Gao Yuan and Kasia Klimasinska.To contact the reporters on this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.net;Jordan Fabian in New York at jfabian6@bloomberg.net;Shawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth Wasserman, Sarah McGregorFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","U.S. to Ease Huawei Sanctions for Another 90 Days, Ross Says"

Below, he shows why 5G is central to a global battle America must win. And the economic impact will be huge…The United States and China are locked in a winner-take-all economic struggle.And no, I'm not talking about the ongoing trade negotiations. It's something else.Whoever wins will be the economic powerhouse of the next decade. The stakes are that high.Let me show you what I mean…Hostile TakeoverLast year, we almost saw a merger between technology firms Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Had it gone through, it would have been the largest tech deal to date.Broadcom had been pursuing Qualcomm since November 2017. It initially offered an unsolicited bid of $103 billion to acquire controlling interest of Qualcomm.Qualcomm resisted. So Broadcom took another route.It initiated a hostile takeover of Qualcomm. That's when an acquiring company attempts to bypass its target's board and purchases a controlling interest in the company directly from shareholders. Very often, this means offering to buy shares at a premium.At $117 billion, the new bid for Qualcomm would have represented the largest technology merger in history.But then the White House stepped in… President Trump blocked the merger. The president said that &quot;credible evidence&quot; suggested that the takeover would pose a risk to U.S. national security.The official details are classified. But I believe I know why the White House took this unprecedented step.At the heart of the president's decision to block the merger is fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology.And here's why that's important…The Coming Wave of 5GWhen you connect to the internet on your computer, smartphone, or smart TV, a vast physical communications infrastructure makes that connection possible.And over the years, our wireless networks - and the infrastructure that supports them - have evolved.It all started in the 1980s with first-generation (1G) networks. Compared to what's possible today, 1G didn't allow much. You could only place voice calls - there was no layer for carrying other types of data. And you had to use one of those brick-sized cell phones Gordon Gekko yaps into in the movie Wall Street.But from then on, a new network generation went live roughly every 10 years. Each provided faster download speeds and more applications. The most recent one, 4G, went live around 2011.Now we're shifting to the fifth generation of wireless networks - 5G. And it represents the largest leap in wireless technology to date.A Leap ForwardThe current 4G networks are a disappointment. They're much slower than what the original developers thought the networks would deliver.Worst of all, the U.S. is in 62nd place when it comes to download speeds. That's going by a 2018 OpenSignal report.But with 5G, it's a different story. At peak speed, 5G will be almost 1,000 times faster than the average 4G connection we have today.We'll be going from an average of 16 megabits per second with current LTE connections… to 10 gigabits per second. (One gigabit is 1,000 megabits.)Even if we assume average 5G speeds will be 10% of their potential, we'd be looking at 1,000 megabits per second. That's almost 100 times faster than what we have today.With that kind of speed, you'll be able to download a two-hour movie in 10 seconds. Dropped phone calls and slow-loading web pages will be a thing of the past.Plus, some previously &quot;sci-fi&quot; tech will finally become a reality. Technologies like self-driving cars, virtual reality, and holographic projection will all operate over high-speed 5G connections. The applications are endless.5G is a game-changer because of all the technological innovation it will bring about. It'll be responsible for $12 trillion worth of new goods and services by 2035. That's about 70% of America's total GDP in 2018.And here's why the government considers the completion of 5G a matter of national security…Matter of National SecurityCountries that lead the way in deploying these networks will have a competitive economic advantage over other countries. And the technology companies in these &quot;first-mover&quot; countries will be the first to develop the hardware and software enabling these 5G wireless services.Right now, our government's fear is that China will set the 5G precedent.For context, Chinese company Huawei supplies the infrastructure and support for more than half of the 537 4G networks around the world. Suspicions have abounded for years about the company using its technology to spy on U.S. network traffic. And since 2018, tensions are reaching new highs.This led to Huawei being banned for a time from the U.S. and several other Western markets over spying concerns.The U.S. government sees it as an imperative that U.S. wireless networks are built out quickly - with U.S. and European technology - to ensure that the country's networks are less likely to fall victim to foreign espionage.That's why the Trump administration blocked the Broadcom/Qualcomm merger.While Broadcom recently stated its intention to bring most of its business back to the U.S., the bulk of its business is still based in Singapore. And while Singapore is its own country, it's heavily controlled by Chinese Singaporeans.The concern was that Broadcom would force Qualcomm to cut back on its 5G research and development, letting Huawei fill the void and making U.S. wireless networks vulnerable to cyberspying.This isn't wild speculation, either.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is a government agency that oversees foreign investment in American companies. It officially recommended blocking the Broadcom/Qualcomm merger. And it specifically mentioned the threat Huawei posed in the 5G space.The Trump administration even threatened to take things one step further…Nationalized InfrastructureIn January 2018, leaked White House documents showed that the U.S. government was considering nationalizing the 5G network build-out.In other words, it wanted to seize control of wireless networks from AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and other service providers… and put them in the hands of the government.I had a hunch at the time that this was just a warning… a way to light a fire under the U.S. companies involved in the 5G build-out.The Trump administration was saying, &quot;Get out there and build these 5G networks quickly, or we'll do it for you.&quot;And I was right. Trump has since said he opposes nationalizing the U.S. 5G network.But sending a warning was a very smart move by the administration. And it worked.Verizon and AT&T are already building out 5G networks in dozens of cities around the country. So are T-Mobile and Sprint, which are in the process of merging.The hope is for the U.S. to regain leadership in wireless network deployments. This will stimulate even stronger leadership in wireless network technology.If the U.S. fails, the government fears that America would depend on Chinese 5G technology. That would give China an enormous amount of leverage over the U.S.And remember, 5G is expected to create more than $12 trillion in wealth. Whoever sets the 5G precedent will be the economic powerhouse for the foreseeable future.This is a race the United States must win at all costs.Regards,Jeff Brown  Editor, Exponential Tech InvestorP.S.

A Leap ForwardThe current 4G networks are a disappointment.The developers that built the 4G network thought it would deliver average download speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps). But in reality, many people see much lower speeds.[Megabits per second, or Mbps, is a common measurement for internet connection and download speeds. For example, to stream a high-definition video from Netflix, you need a download speed of at least 5 Mbps.]At the time of writing, the U.S. has an average download speed of about 16 Mbps with LTE connections. According to a 2018 OpenSignal report, we're in 62nd place, behind Romania (at 28 Mbps) and Finland (at 26.6 Mbps). Even Dracula and the reindeers have internet speeds faster than most Americans.But with 5G, the peak speed jumps to 10 gigabits per second (Gbps). One gigabit is 1,000 megabits.

2019-08-22,"At its heart, the argument over Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a battle over how to value a cyclical stock. It's not an easy task. In a matter of quarters, the MU stock price went from being absurdly cheap -- Micron stock traded at less than 4x earnings at points last year -- to questionably expensive. Fiscal 2020 consensus EPS is just $2.53, implying a 17.5x forward P/E that's not all that attractive in the context of the semiconductor sector.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com Even Wall Street can't make up its mind. As Barron's noted last week, analyst targets for the MU stock price range from $28 to $90. It's a company that earned $12+ in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2018, posted a $1 per share loss as recently as FY12, and is expected to see a two-year, approximately 80% decline in EPS in FY20.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More In terms of that argument, I wrote recently that I lean toward the bearish side. The recent rally in Micron stock looks ripe for profit-taking. Earnings may not be set to rebound any time soon. And I thought the Q3 report that sent the MU stock price skyrocketing was much weaker than headlines suggested.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCyclical arguments aside, however, there's a risk to MU shares that might not be fully appreciated at the moment. Micron is exposed to the U.S.-China trade war in a way that goes beyond the standard macro exposure of most semiconductor stocks. News on that front thus is likely to create volatility in Micron stock in the near term. And if the news winds up being as bad as it appears, it could send MU shares back toward recent lows. The Huawei Problem for Micron StockThe Trump Administration has made a clear target of Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei. The White House effectively blacklisted the company earlier this year, citing security concerns. President Donald Trump himself said this week that he wasn't interested in allowing Huawei &quot;to do business at all&quot; with American companies, though the federal government soon after gave Huawei another 90-day extension.Huawei's tenuous status has been an issue for tech stocks, and particularly semiconductor stocks, for some time. Companies like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) all have seen revenue hits from ceasing or moderating sales to the networking giant. Micron's rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) announced in June that it had stopped doing business with the Chinese company altogether.For Micron, Huawei is a key customer. Per its 10-Q, 13% of revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 came from Huawei. And that's with lower-than-expected revenue so far this year to begin with. On its Q3 conference call, the company cited a $200 million impact to revenue in the quarter. Q4 guidance -- which was disappointing relative to expectations -- also took a hit. And the company wrote down $40 million in Huawei-related inventory. Lower Earnings Mean a Lower MU Stock PriceThe problem for Micron is that 13% of revenue doesn't necessarily mean 13% of profits. One only need look at YTD results to see that lower sales have a huge impact on earnings.Through the first three quarters, revenue is down over 15%. Adjusted EPS has declined 32% with a lower share count.Admittedly, lower DRAM and NAND memory pricing is a big factor. But losing 13% of revenue off roughly similar expense bases in R&D and G&A tends to depress margins and lead to amplified reductions in profit.In other words, this is a big risk for Micron stock. How Does This Play Out?To be fair, a permanent Huawei blacklist doesn't necessarily mean Micron's revenue will fall by 13%. As CEO Sanjay Malhotra noted on the Q3 call, Micron supplies Huawei rivals as well (presumably including Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC). Those rivals would take market share ceded by Huawei -- and add to their purchases of memory from Micron.But it's still unclear that European countries, in particular, are going to follow the U.S. lead in banning the Chinese equipment maker. There will be some erosion if the U.S. moves forward in preventing its companies from selling to that company.It's also possible that, at some point, the ban will be lifted. The administration could be using Huawei as a bargaining chip. A broader trade war deal could include accommodation from Huawei, and any sort of resolution likely would move chip stocks, including Micron stock, higher.But such a resolution seems a long way off at this point. In the meantime, Micron earnings are likely to decline, and the MU stock price may well follow suit. Between cyclical risk and political risk, there are plenty of reasons to stay on the sidelines here. Even bulls might want to show some patience and see if geopolitical factors don't present a better entry point.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-08-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor companies and Apple Inc. fell sharply on Friday, as the trade war between the U.S. and China continued to escalate.China’s Ministry of Finance said the country plans to levy retaliatory tariffs on another $75 billion of U.S. goods, pressuring the securities in pre-market trading. Their losses were extended following the open, after President Donald Trump subsequently said that he would announce his response Friday afternoon.Apple fell as much as 3.9%. The iPhone maker is heavily correlated to trade issues because China is both a major part of its supply chain and a notable market for its products. The company derived nearly 20% of its 2018 revenue from China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Chipmakers have been similarly volatile because of the trade war. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.6% on Friday, and every member of the benchmark industry index was in negative territory.Among notable decliners, Qualcomm Inc. lost 3.3% while Nvidia Corp. was off 5% and Micron Technology shed 3.5%. Broadcom Inc. was down 4.9% and ON Semiconductor Corp. lost 5.4%.Technology stocks were the weakest-performing sector on Friday, with the S&P 500 information technology index down 2.4%.

2019-08-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Globalfoundries Inc. sued larger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for using its patented chip technology and requested a U.S. trade agency impose import bans that could roil the market for crucial components of a huge swath of electronics, including the iPhone.The U.S.-headquartered chipmaker, which like TSMC manufactures semiconductors for other companies, on Monday filed patent-infringement complaints at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington, as well as civil lawsuits at federal courts in the U.S. and Germany.The complaints cite TSMC and customers including Apple Inc., Broadcom Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Xilinx Inc., Nvidia Corp. and their device-maker customers including Cisco Systems Inc., Google and Lenovo Group Ltd. TSMC makes chips designed by companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that are then used in devices including Apple iPhones, Lenovo laptops and Cisco routers.The broad-ranging legal assault threatens to disrupt the supply of everything from smartphones to personal computers to vital infrastructure like switches and routers that are the backbone of the internet. It highlights the importance of TSMC as a maker of the components that keep modern electronics running. It also comes at a time when the worldwide supply chain is being disrupted by a trade dispute between China and the U.S.TSMC spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun said her company hasn’t been served with any court papers and it isn’t familiar with the details of the suit.&quot;TSMC has always respected intellectual property and we have developed all our technologies by ourselves,&quot; Sun said.Globalfoundries is positioning the case as U.S. and European inventions being illegally used by an Asian company that has an increasing stranglehold on crucial parts of the technology industry.“Someone had to do something, the world needs a competitive semiconductor industry,” said Sam Azar, senior vice president of corporate development at Globalfoundries. “We’re using courts in the U.S. and Europe that care about protecting manufacturing.”Globalfoundries has factories in upstate New York and Dresden, Germany. Its headquarters is in Silicon Valley. The closely held company is owned by Mubadala, the investment arm of the government of Abu Dhabi.Globalfoundries, like other so-called contract chipmakers, has struggled to keep pace with TSMC whose factories are now rated the best in the industry. The U.S.-based company is seeking &quot;substantial&quot; damages from its Taiwanese rival which it alleges is using Globalfoundries’ technology to help it win tens of billions of dollars of sales, it said in a statement.German courts work quickly, and are known for ordering a halt of imports of products even before litigation is completed to protect patent owners. The ITC in Washington, which protects U.S. markets from unfair trade practices, also has a reputation for speed, with investigations completed in 15 to 18 months. It has the ability to block products entering the world’s largest economy. It has occasionally opted not to do that if it decides a ban would be counter to the public’s best interest. The American civil suits, filed in federal courts in Delaware and Texas, would take longer but could result in large damage awards.Throughout the complaint, Globalfoundries cited products including iPhones, AirPods, Apple TV and iPad models. It also mentioned Cisco’s switch boxes as using infringing chips and Lenovo computers that are based on Nvidia graphics chips.Globalfoundries argued that a ban would not hurt consumers because Samsung Electronics Co. is a licensee and other companies such as Sony Corp., LG Electronics Inc. and Vizio Inc. are not included in the litigation. That means there will be an adequate supply of smartphones and other consumer electronics, it said in the court filings. Samsung and Globalfoundries had a chipmaking technology partnership.The patents Globalfoundries is asserting cover the fundamentals of how semiconductors are manufactured. Some are U.S. patents and others are European covering esoteric but important areas like “structures of and methods and tools for forming in-situ metallic/dialectric caps for interconnects.” They involve the most advanced technique, called 7 nanometer, that TSMC is currently using.Meanwhile, GlobalFoundries announced a year ago that it would halt development of 7-nanometer chips and focus on more mature technology as the company struggles to match TSMC’s annual capital expenditure of some $11 billion.Globalfoundries’ Azar said his company wants TSMC to stop using the patented technology, which will be difficult to work around, or ask for a license and pay for the right to continue using the inventions.Companies like Apple, Cisco and Nvidia are named in the complaints because TSMC doesn’t import the chips or sell them to consumers; the only way to stop the chips from entering the U.S. and Germany is to block the products that use them.Trump Aides Say He Has Power to Force Companies From China (2)Global Foundries filed the complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a tweet on Aug. 23 saying American companies “are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.” His administration claims he has the authority to impose such an order though trade experts disagree.(Updates with Samsung and other companies not included in the litigation in 13th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporters on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.net;Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Globalfoundries Sues TSMC; Seeks Import Ban on IPhone Parts

2019-08-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. said that telecommunications service providers need to jump on new technology coming to Wi-Fi or risk losing the chance to exploit the flood of data being created by their customers.The company is offering new chips that will enable Wi-Fi 6 connections in new wireless networking gear for homes and businesses. The technology allows more connections simultaneously and access to a broader range of radio frequencies, which enables faster data transmission.Mesh networks, groups of small access points that relay signals and increase coverage, are the key to the improved technology, according to Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon. His company is trying to expand its customer list at a time when the electronics industry is arguing there will be an explosion of connected devices on new 5G cellular networks.To underscore its point, the chipmaker notes that the number of connected devices per household has doubled every two years since 2012 and will average 24 by 2020. In addition, there will be 4 billion connected devices in the workplace by 2022.Phone service providers need to embrace the transition if Wi-Fi is to continue as the home and office technology that supports cellular by handling traffic indoors. They’ll also need to shift from providing their customers with only basic modems to investing more in that technology, Amon said.‘’We expect to see a change in the carrier view to Wi-Fi first,” he said Tuesday an event in San Francisco.If service providers don’t offer the latest gear to their subscribers, major cloud companies such as Amazon.com Inc. will step in, offering products to users and taking advantage of their positions as managers of the connected devices and the flood of data they create, Amon said.Qualcomm’s Atheros division competes with Broadcom Inc. to be the major supplier of chips that drive Wi-Fi access points. Qualcomm has won share in consumer devices, but Broadcom has a stronger position in modems that are offered by service providers as part of home and corporate subscriptions.The San Diego, California-based company is one of the biggest providers of Wi-Fi chips in phones. Those chipsets act as the main processors of smartphones and modems connecting the handsets to cellular networks.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Qualcomm Says Carriers Need to Get Serious About Wi-Fi

2019-08-28,"Despite the uncertainty with U.S.-China relations and volatility in global markets, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) stock has been fairly resilient. Keep in mind that the return for this year is about 33%. By comparison, the shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are flat for 2019 and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is up about 10%.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com There are certainly important factors that explain the overall strength in MU stock. For example, the third-quarter report showed that the company knows how to skillfully manage Wall Street expectations, as it beat on both the top and bottom lines. It helps that MU is a highly efficient organization and remains committed to investing wisely in its research and development.There are also powerful secular trends that continue to fuel demand for memory chips. These include artificial intelligence, the internet of things, virtual reality, augmented reality and yes, 5G.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn fact, some investors believe that because of this MU stock is not as cyclical anymore. If so, this would definitely be great news. And the shares actually should have a much higher valuation.So does this mean there is an all-clear to buy MU stock? Well, not necessarily. Note that there remain several countervailing trends that are weighing on the company. The most obvious is the U.S.-China trade war. Note that about 55% of overall sales for MU come from China (this is for fiscal 2018). So even a small change could have a big impact on the company.Another issue is that about 13% of its revenues come from China's Huawei. This company has become a punching bag for President Donald Trump's administration. Recent headlines include the arrest of the founder's daughter in Canada for her alleged violations of sanctions. There is some buzz that Huawei may even collapse.Granted, this may be a worst-case scenario. Yet MU's heavy reliance on the company's sales is a big risk factor. Long-Term Impact From the Trade WarPerhaps the U.S. and China will somehow come to an agreement (although, given the deep issues and mistrust, this does look unlikely in the near term). But this may not matter too much. The reason is that going forward there is likely to be a realignment of the global supply chain. In other words, companies will look for alternatives to companies like MU, say rivals such as Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) or SK Hynix.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income In the meantime, China is investing heavily in its domestic chip sector so as to lesson its dependence on U.S. suppliers. Take a look at Changxin Memory. The company plans to invest a hefty $8 billion in developing its dynamic random-access memory infrastructure.All in all, there could be long-term damage to MU as it will be increasingly shut out of the valuable Chinese market. The Bottom Line On MU StockThe swirling issues regarding trade policies appear to be taking a toll on the global economy. China has been slowing down and it looks like Germany is entering a recession. And yes, there are signs that the U.S. is not immune either, as sectors like real estate and manufacturing have come under pressure. Given all this, it seems reasonable that there will be a reduction in demand for memory chips.To get a sense of what this may mean for MU stock, consider what happened between 2013-2016. The stock plunged $35 to below $10 as the market for memory chips softened.Yet this time around, things may be worse as the level of uncertainty is elevated because of the trade war. So even though MU does have a solid balance sheet and a strong market position, it may not be enough in the months ahead.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-28,"[Editor's note: &quot;10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]It's not terribly easy out there for income investors at the moment. Dividend stocks to buy are tough to find. Equity markets are near all-time highs, meaning valuations are stretched -- and dividend yields are lower. Treasury yields have fallen amid expectations for a Fed rate cut: getting income from bonds is no easy task, either.Many longtime dividend growth stalwarts -- think McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) or Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) -- trade at or near all time highs. Those that aren't seem to be struggling, with the likes of General Electric (NYSE:GE), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), and Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) all cutting their dividends in recent years. Finding the middle ground -- an attractive valuation combined with a solid business -- is exceedingly difficult right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven lower commissions, investors can sell off small parts of their holdings for income -- most of which should have appreciated nicely in this decade-long bull market. But income investors usually are looking for &quot;set it and forget it&quot; dividend stocks to buy, not constant portfolio trading.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income These 10 stocks don't quite qualify as &quot;set it and forget it&quot; plays. All have some degree of risk. But the risks seem worth taking for the potential rewards, which include near-term income, longer-term growth, and potential capital appreciation. As such, investors should take at least a long look at these 10 dividend plays. Broadcom (AVGO)Dividend Yield: 3.85%Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) requires quite a bit of trust in management. The semiconductor giant has been built through acquisitions. As of late, AVGO has started moving away from chips and into software.Last year, the company acquired CA Technologies, an enterprise software play with a big presence in mainframe applications. Broadcom has bought  security play Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC).Investors haven't particularly liked either deal. AVGO stock fell on the news of the CA deal. It  slipped again as reports of the Symantec acquisition leaked. But CEO Hock Tan certainly deserves the benefit of the doubt at this point. And the decline after the CA announcement, in particular, proved a buying opportunity: before the recent pullback, AVGO shares had risen some 50% in roughly a year.AVGO may not provide that type of return over the next year -- but there's still a nice bull case here on another merger-related dip. AVGO yields 3.85%. The Symantec deal will add to the company's significant free cash flow, which keeps that yield secure. Diversification in the existing chip business limits the cyclical impact on earnings -- and AVGO shares. Investors do have to trust Hock Tan at this point -- but history shows they probably should. Kellogg (K)Dividend Yield: 3.7%On its face, Kellogg (NYSE:K) seems like a safe value play for income investors. Shares of the iconic American company trade for just 15x 2020 EPS estimates. Kellogg's dividend yields just under 4%. K historically has been a defensive stock, providing protection if the broader economy stumbles.But K stock is actually dangerous at this point. It's one of many consumer stocks struggling to adapt to a new reality, as I detailed last year. Grocers like Kroger (NYSE:KR) are looking to private-label and own brands to protect their thin margins. Cereal demand is falling. As a result, Kellogg's earnings are heading in the wrong direction.Revenue is guided to increase just 1%-2% this year excluding the impact of currency and the company's divestiture of several smaller brands. Adjusted operating income, on the same basis, is expected to be roughly flat. Guidance suggests overall non-GAAP earnings per share will decline more than 10% year-over-year.In other words, Kellogg isn't a defensive stock at this point. It's a turnaround play. And like with KHC and BUD, that creates downside risk if the turnaround stumbles.For investors who understand the risks, however, K stock is intriguing. As Barron's detailed last month, the company's Morningstar Farms business seems notably undervalued. It's larger by revenue than Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), which has soared to a $10 billion market cap. Kellogg is valued at just $21 billion; a sale or IPO of Morningstar could unlock significant value.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Again, this is not the traditional, low-risk, dividend stock it used to be. But if Kellogg can jumpstart growth and monetize Morningstar, K stock could have enormous upside ahead. Gap (GPS)Dividend Yield: 6.2%The case for Gap (NYSE:GPS), particularly with the stock near a seven-year low, is that investors are missing the real story here. As I wrote back in November, Gap stock isn't about its Gap brand; it's about Old Navy, which likely generates somewhere in the range of three-quarters of operating profit.With Gap planning to spin off Old Navy later this year, that value might be unlocked. In the meantime, GPS stock yields 6.2%, a figure that might rise after the split.There are risks here, to be sure. Luke Lango called GPS stock one of the six worst in the S&P 500 in the first half -- and he's not wrong. GPS shares have plunged.Old Navy's sales performance recently has not been particularly impressive. Sales for the Gap brand continue to decline. In fact, analysts asked repeatedly on the Q1 conference call if the spin-off would still move forward: there's a risk that Gap and Banana Republic might not be enough to support a standalone company, even with growth from athleisure concept Athleta.Even a weaker-than-expected Old Navy still likely supports the entire valuation of GPS stock at the moment. The balance sheet is in good shape, and free cash flow continues to be impressive. Income investors can get yield now -- and if all goes well, by next year own growth at Old Navy and income from the company's other brands. SL Green (SLG)Dividend Yield: 4.4%REITs (real estate investment trusts) like SL Green (NYSE:SLG) long have been income investors favorites. REITs allow for diversified exposure to real estate. They offer tax benefits as well: as long as they pay out 90% of taxable income, they pay no tax at the corporate level.In an environment where 10-year Treasury bonds are yielding less than 1.5%, however, investors looking for dividend stocks to buy have the same difficulty in REITs as in the rest of the market. High-yield REITs generally have some flaws; most notably, even the best retail REITs like Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Macerich (NYSE:MAC) have struggled amid long-term concerns about demand. The more attractive plays, meanwhile, have been bid up as investors look for lower-risk yield.SL Green might be a nice middle ground. The stock has struggled for years now; in fact, it touched a five-year low late last year. Worries about the health of New York City real estate seem to be the culprit. Weakness in the company's suburban assets hasn't helped, either.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income But SL Green largely has exited the suburban business, refocusing on Manhattan. The dividend continues to rise. And longer-term, NYC still seems an attractive real estate market. With a 4.4% dividend, SLG provides attractive income. At 12x FFO (funds from operations, a typical REIT metric), it could provide upside as well if sentiment toward Manhattan real estate improves. Avista (AVA)Dividend Yield: 3.3%Utility stocks like Avista (NYSE:AVA) are another common area of focus for income investors. And like REITs, valuation is a question mark: AVA has risen 12% in three months, a big move for a utility.But AVA looks like one of the more attractive picks in the industry at the moment. The stock plunged late last year after a potential acquisition by Canada's Hydro One (OTCMKTS:HRNNF) was called off. Slowly but surely, however, dip-buyers have entered -- and there could be more buying ahead.Avista provides a solid 3.3% dividend yield. Its markets in Washington State, Idaho, and Montana are seeing strong population growth. Valuation is reasonable, and AVA still sits back at 2016 levels.It's likely the Hydro One deal -- announced in 2017 -- led to some dislocation among Hydro One's investor base. If that's the case, there's an opportunity for AVA to catch up to the rest of its sector as income investors return to the story. International Game Technology (IGT)Dividend Yield: 6.8%The risks facing International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT) are almost self-evident. Gaming stocks traditionally struggle in recessions. Suppliers like IGT generally aren't hit quite as hard, and the company's lottery business should provide support if the economy turns. But there is a decent amount of cyclical risk here.A good chunk of the company's profit comes from Italy, where economic growth has been stagnant and political risk seems high. The U.S. slot business has lost market share to smaller operators like Aristocrat Leisure (OTCMKTS:ARLUF) and PlayAGS (NYSE:AGS). On top of all that, IGT has nearly $8.5 billion in debt. The 6% yield here is attractive -- but on its own not reason enough to buy IGT stock.That said, there are reasons to buy, and in fact I personally own IGT shares. Free cash flow should ramp in the next two years, as the company moves past upfront payments required to maintain its concessions in Italy. The lottery business throws off cash as well. Debt should come down, and the U.S. slot business is showing signs of improvement.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income The rewards here are enormous as well. As I wrote last month, Wall Street sees huge upside for IGT. The average target price near $21 is 56% higher than IGT's current price. If IGT can get the U.S. business back on track and use the cash flow from Italy to pay down debt, its stock could have a big move ahead. State Street (STT)Dividend Yield: 3.8%State Street (NYSE:STT) is a clear &quot;value trap or value play?&quot; argument at the moment. For the last year, investors have made their thoughts clear: STT stock has dropped by roughly 45%.And State Street is fighting headwinds. The company rolled out the first ETF -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) -- but has since been passed by Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in that key business. The same shift to passive investing driving ETF growth has pressured the company's asset management business. In Q1, fee revenue declined 4% year-over-year; earnings per share declined 27%.Cost-cutting simply hasn't done quite enough to protect margins, leading to the recent pressure on STT stock. But at this point, there's a question as to whether the sell-off simply has gone too far. STT stock is quite cheap, at a price-earnings ratio of nine.Meanwhile, a recent dividend hike moves the yield near 4%, and STT will repurchase $2 billion worth of stock as well. State Street has to find a way to manage pressure on its custody and management businesses -- but if it can, there's potential for a big reversal in STT stock. CVS Health (CVS)Dividend Yield: 3.4%Source: Shutterstock CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) has had a rough go of it in recent years. In March, CVS stock touched its lowest level in almost six years, and it has re-tested those lows several times since. The acquisition of Aetna is under review even after it closed. Lower reimbursement rates and reduced savings on generic drugs are pressuring the entire pharmacy sector: rivals Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) are struggling as well.But as I wrote previously,  at least some extent all of those headwinds seem priced in. CVS stock trades at historically low multiples. There are still benefits to come from the company's efforts to change healthcare, and the integration of Aetna with its existing pharmacy business.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income The headwinds are real, and the selloff in CVS stock does make some sense. But this remains an attractive business that is now priced for steady declines going forward. It will take little in the way of an upside surprise for CVS to outperform expectations -- and for CVS stock to claw back at least some of its recent losses. BP (BP)Dividend Yield: 6.7%For BP (NYSE:BP), the case is reasonably simple. BP is the integrated energy company with the best dividend yield, which currently nears 7%. With liabilities relating to the Deepwater Horizon tragedy finally behind the company, cash flow and earnings will improve as BP gets back to &quot;normal.&quot;That's a case I've made for some eighteen months now -- and it still holds. Oil price movements might seem a risk -- but BP's downstream businesses benefit from lower crude prices, which mitigates that effect somewhat. In this market, BP stock might even be considered among the safer plays out there, as counterintuitive as that sounds. For a nearly 7% yield the modest risks here seem worth taking. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Dividend Yield: 3.4%Pharmaceutical companies, too, used to be a safe haven for income investors. They generally offered dividend yields of at least 2% -- and protection from market and economic downturns. That's no longer the case, however -- which highlights the potential risk in Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY).U.S. companies, in particular, have struggled to find blockbusters. As a result, patent expirations on key product lead companies to search for growth however it can be found. For Bristol-Myers Squibb, products like Orencia (which treats rheumatoid arthritis) and blood thinner Eliquis are losing their protection shortly. And so the company went and acquired biotechnology major Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).Unfortunately for BMY stock, investors hated the deal. BMY shares dropped in its wake. They liked it less when Bristol-Myers announced last month that it would divest psoriasis treatment Otezla as required by regulators. BMY once again threatened a six-year low.But at this point, BMY is starting to look attractive. Even if the company overpaid for Celgene, to some extent that's baked into the stock price. The dividend yield now sits at 3.6% -- and could rise once the acquisition is completed. A 10x forward P/E multiple will come down as well.Pharma stocks are riskier than they used to be -- especially for those using debt to drive growth. Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK) is a good example of how pharmaceutical M&A can go terribly wrong. But Bristol-Myers Squibb's diversified base and long history suggest the downside shouldn't be that steep. And as Celgene comes on board and growth returns, investors might again start focusing on the potential rewards.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of Gap Inc. and International Game Technology.

JPMorgan added that the outlook for demand is not as bad as the market had feared, as the industry prepares for a seasonally strong period for PCs, smartphones, gaming and cloud spending, as well as other areas.",Chip stocks rally as JPMorgan sees second-half rebound
2019-09-04,"For August, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) posted a return of about 3%. But of course, this performance masks the extreme volatility. August was actually a period when the AMD stock price chart looked more like a roller coaster!But this should not be a surprise. There were wide swings in the overall market. There were also negative headlines from the U.S.-China trade war, which saw the hiking of tariffs from both sides. Keep in mind that AMD has major ties to China. So any whiff of problems usually means that investors get worried.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut August's performance for Advanced Micro Devices stock does show that the company is still resilient. Actually, for the year so far, the shares are up a sizzling 70%!Then again, there are some important factors that should help keep up the momentum in the business and bolster AMD stock.So let's take a look: Long-Term MegatrendsFor a relatively small company - say compared to chip giants like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)- AMD has been able to effectively leverage its resources.  * 7 of the Best Financial Stocks to Buy Now The result is that the company is targeting three mega-market opportunities. According to AMD's most recent investor presentation, they include PCs ($30 billion), immersive/gaming ($15 billion) and the datacenter ($29 billion).The good news is that the company is making significant headway in all of them. For example, in the gaming market, it is positioned nicely to benefit from the launch of new consoles from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE).As for the data center, AMD has been snagging major customers win, such as with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). Both companies have agreed to adopt the Epyc chips for their servers. Consider that this technology is based on a sophisticated 7nm process that has shown to have higher performance and better energy efficiency compared to Intel chips.According to InvestorPlace.com's Vince Martin: &quot;Still, from a very broad standpoint, the argument is simple: There's a lot of Intel market share that AMD can take. And that means there's a market opportunity worth multiples of the current AMD market capitalization.&quot; LeadershipIn 2014 when Lisa Su took the reigns as CEO of AMD, the company was in terrible shape. There was even buzz of a bankruptcy filing. But Su quickly struck a critical deal with China's Sugon Information Industry Co, which brought in an infusion of much-needed cash.She also outsourced production.  Then once AMD was on a stronger financial footing, Su began to ramp up R&D on building world-class technologies. Because of all this, she was able to pull off one of tech's best turnarounds.Yet there are some concerns about Su. In August rumors started to swirl that she may move over to IBM (NYSE:IBM) to become an executive with the firm. If so, this would certainly be a big-time negative for AMD stock. Although, for now, Su has denied the rumors, tweeting: &quot;Just for the record, zero truth to this rumor. I love AMD and the best is yet to come!&quot; Innovation and AMD StockFor decades AMD's reputation was as a follower in terms of new technologies. But this is no longer the case. Now AMD has been pushing the envelope on innovation. During the past quarter, the company launched high performance CPUs (central processing unit) and GPUs (graphics processing units).There was also the signing of a multi-year agreement with Samsung, which involved the licensing of graphics technologies for mobile applications and smartphones.AMD is also making headway in the category of supercomputers. Note that the company is working with Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY), which is being merged with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), to create the world's fastest computer.It will use EPYC CPUs along with Radeon GPUs. Interestingly enough, this venture is likely to lead to advancements in AI (Artificial Intelligence).Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-09-05,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.It's a quiet week on the earnings calendar next week -- but that might not necessarily be a bad thing. Earnings reports, while strong on their face, haven't done much to lift U.S. equity markets. The S&P 500 still is 2.7% below late July highs despite a solid earnings season.With apparent movement on the trade front this week, a lack of earnings-related news could allow investors to focus on positive external factors. That in turn could lead to a repeat of what happened following first quarter earnings season: U.S. market indices shrugged off strong numbers and then moved to all-time highs in a quieter environment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat said, a quiet week doesn't mean that there is no news or no key earnings reports to keep an eye on. In fact, the earnings calendar on Thursday is quite full -- with several releases in key sectors.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market A major cannabis player will try to regain investor confidence amid plunging stock prices in its industry. A chip giant could determine near-term trading in its choppy space. And a grocery leader will give an update on the health of its business -- and potentially that of its suppliers. All three earnings reports are worth watching even if investor attention might be elsewhere. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, September 12, before market openSupermarket leader Kroger (NYSE:KR) has a big fiscal second-quarter report on Thursday morning. There are clear concerns about the health of the company's business model at the moment. Operating margins continue to see pressure, and KR stock touched a 20-month low in July.Recent earnings haven't impressed investors -- but this one likely has to. Both Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) posted strong earnings reports last month. A disappointing report from Kroger would suggest potentially significant market share losses to those giants. It also likely would lead to a reduction in full-year guidance -- which could bring a recent 19% bounce to a sudden end.Kroger stock, at a little over 10x earnings, is cheap enough that the rally can continue if Q2 earnings can inspire confidence. If they don't, however, a return to another low seems possible, if not probable. Aurora Cannabis (ACB)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, September 12, before market openCannabis stocks like Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) have been plunging for months now. Earnings reports haven't helped. Industry leader Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) announced a disappointing fiscal Q1 last month. A day before, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) seemed to highlight pricing pressure in the industry.The only company in recent months to truly impress with earnings was Aphria (NYSE:APHA). APHA stock gained a whopping 41% after guiding for profitability in fiscal 2020. Other cannabis stocks went along for the ride -- but only briefly, as selling pressure returned almost immediately.It's probably too much ask for Aurora to post an Aphria-like quarter -- or provide similar guidance for positive earnings. Aurora Cannabis has global reach, and higher startup costs than the more focused Aphria.  * Dorian's Impact on the Markets But this is a stock, and a sector, in desperate need of good news. Aurora's outlook for its fiscal 2020 will be closely watched -- and is probably the company's best chance to reverse the continuing decline in its shares. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, September 12, after market closeEarnings from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) on Thursday afternoon are likely to move the entire sector. Investors in the space are betting on a second-half rebound, but earnings reports of late haven't confirmed that rebound is on the way. For instance, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) gave below-consensus revenue guidance after their most recent earnings releases.Broadcom's diversified business gives it exposure to, and information on, a number of end markets. Combined with the respect accorded CEO Hock Tan, the company's outlook is going to be taken seriously.For Broadcom itself, the conference call is likely to focus on the company's pending acquisition of the enterprise business of Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC). Broadcom has surprised investors by moving into software, first with its acquisition of CA Technologies and now with a proposed $11 billion deal with Symantec. Tan seemingly has earned the benefit of the doubt, but not all investors are convinced. Strong earnings and further detail on the logic behind the most recent acquisition could go a long way toward doing so -- and sending AVGO back above $300.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-09-09,"Markets have turned more bullish since the last week in August, with the S&P 500 up 4.6% since bottoming out on August 23. Among the leaders in the market’s shift are, a bit surprisingly, the chip stocks. Semiconductor companies were hard hit by the escalation in tariff tensions between the US and China, but are showing signs now of recovering and turning back up. According to JPMorgan, “Assuming no further major negative developments on the trade front post the tariff increases this weekend, we expect semiconductor stocks to continue to outperform for the remainder of the year.”Three major semiconductor stocks are showing signs, in the past two weeks, that they will indeed gain and hold those gains going forward. Trading volumes were up, and the three major chip makers outperformed the S&P, gaining 7% to 13% in the time since the index bottomed. We’ve looked into TipRanks’ database, to get the analyst perspective on these big semiconductor players. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)Micron hit $31.8 billion in sales for 2018, putting it in fifth place among the chip makers. It may not stay in that spot for long, however, as Micron also showed 33% sales growth from 2017 to 2018, third highest among the top 15 chip companies. In addition, MU’s share price has shown less volatility through the summer, and the company’s share gains in the past two weeks, 13.9%, are triple those of the broader S&P 500.Wall Street’s top analysts also take a positive view of Micron’s prospects. From Mizuho, Vijay Rakesh wrote, &quot;we believe current NAND and DRAM pricing trends are better than expectations entering the SepQ/2H19, with NAND pricing recovering to Mar-Jun levels and DRAM stabilizing.” Rakesh’s price target, $50, is conservative, and only indicates a 2% upside.Sidney Ho, of Deutsche Bank, also sees a path for MU to improve. He comments, “The equity market has historically led business fundamentals by about one quarter, and Micron shares will find support at the current level. We see risks to the upside as business improves.” Ho’s $55 target suggests a potential upside of 12%.Micron has the narrowest upside of the large chip companies, only 0.06%, based on a share price of $48.97 and an average price target of $49. The stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 12 buys, 5 holds, and 2 sells from the past three months. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Broadcom holds the 6 spot among the world’s big semiconductor companies. It hasn’t slipped places, the way Intel has in recent years, but where Intel showed a 14% gain in sales from 2017 to 2018, Broadcom’s gain was only 4%. This is a company with a large and stable niche in a major industry, that is managing to hold its ground against the competition. And in the last two weeks, AVGO shares jumped 7.3%.Share appreciation is only one part of Broadcom’s advantage. The company also pays out a 3.63% dividend, and has been reliable for the last decade in meeting its obligation every quarter. Even better, Broadcom has also adjusted the rates to ensure a steadily increasing payment. At the current rate and share price, AVGO pays out $10.60 per year to shareholders, making it one of the highest dividend payments in the S&P index.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis was careful to note AVGO’s hefty dividend in his recent review of the stock, pointing out especially that the company will be announcing a 30% increase this coming December. The upcoming increase is inline with Broadcom’s ongoing policy of returning half of the free cash flow to shareholders. Lipacis notes that the expected FCF for fiscal year 2019 is $10.9 billion. His $324 price target on AVGO suggests an upside potential of 11%.Broadcom, like the other major semiconductor makers, had a difficult summer, but the company’s clear investor appeal has helped it keep a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. The rating is based on 23 buys and 8 holds given in the last three months. The stock’s $312 average target implies an upside of 7% from the $291 share price. Intel Corporation (INTC)Three years ago, Intel was the top chip maker in the world’s markets. By the end of 2018, it had slipped to second place, with $70.15 billion in sales. The company has faced increasing competition in its core PC market, but has recently released a new series of tenth generation mobile processors that it expects will boost sales in coming months.Investors apparently agreed; INTC shares showed a 13.2% gain in the last week of August and first week of September. It’s an impressive performance for a stock that had difficulty gaining traction through the summer. Three of Wall Street’s 5-star analysts see it as reason for optimism on Intel stock.Writing from Nomura, 5-star analyst David Wong set the initial optimistic tone, with a $65 price target on this stock. He noted, “While we view [the recent] processor introduction as a small incremental addition to Intel’s overall notebook lineup, we think the release of 14nm Comet Lake and Amber Lake Y chips supplements the release of 10nm Ice Lake Core notebook processor offerings at the beginning of this month to help Intel maintain an up-to-date lineup across the entirety of the mobile processor spectrum.” Wong’s target for INTC implies a robust upside of 27%.Baird analyst Tristan Gerra agrees that Intel is at the start of an upward trend. He says, “Aggressive 7nm ramp along with 5nm front-end investments for 2020 are part of Intel's plans to catch up and accelerate its pace of innovation. The first 7nm architecture to launch will be a GPU targeting servers, shortly followed by CPUs.” Gerra also gives the stock a $65 price target.Finally, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial also reiterated his Buy rating on this stock. While he did not set a specific price target – his usual habit – it’s important to note that Feinseth has maintained a Buy rating on INTC since May of 2018, and his average return on the stock has been 9.8%.Overall, Intel’s analyst consensus remains a Hold, based on 9 buys, 10 holds, and 9 sells – the low rating is an artifact of the company’s difficult summer, and the most recent reviewers have given the stock Buy ratings. Intel shares are selling for $50.92, and with an average price target of $53.89, the stock has a 5.8% upside potential, which, while modest, is in line with Broadcom’s and significantly higher than Micron’s.Visit TipRanks’ Trending Stocks page, to find out which other large-cap stocks Wall Street’s top analysts are giving top ratings.",3 Chip Makers with Rising Prospects

2019-09-10,"With interest rates falling, and dragging bond yields down with them, investors are seeking reliable sources of steady income. It’s a move that naturally draws them toward dividend stocks, but historically, the search for dividends has not drawn investors into tech. That has changed in recent years, as the tech giants have been offering better rewards for shareholders.A little history will help. The tech industry feeds on growth, growth, growth – and so developed a habit of quickly reinvesting cash and profits into R&D and acquisitions. In the traditional tech view, paying dividends was a negative signal, that the company did not have an exciting initiative in which to invest. Growth would attract investors.But in the last ten years, there has been a slow shift. Tech companies, especially the giants that lead the industry, have increased dividend payouts by 17%. Last year saw them return $88 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Apple and Microsoft led the way, paying back a combined $27 billion to their investors in 2018. We’ve used TipRanks' Top Stocks page to find out which companies the best analysts are bullish on. Apple, Inc. (AAPL)From its small beginnings in Steve Jobs’ parents’ garage, Apple has grown to be one of the world’s largest companies. Last summer it was the first publicly traded company to break above a $1 trillion market cap, and its popular iPhone series has over 900 million installed users worldwide. The downturn in the final quarter last year, along with the ongoing maturation of the smartphone market replacement cycle, hit the company hard, and its share price fell 38% from its October 2018 peak to its trough on January 3.Apple has rolled with the changing fiscal and product environments by shifting its emphasis to services and user base monetization. The company’s share appreciation this year – it is up 35% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500’s 18% gain – is a sign that investors are confident in its ability to compensate for reduced iPhone revenues going forward.Investors are confident, and Apple is rewarding them. The company resumed dividend payments in 2012, after a 17-year break, and quickly became a favorite with dividend investors. The yield is modest, at just 1.44%, but the high share price puts the current payment at $3.08 annually. And better, from an investor’s perspective, the company has committed to maintaining the dividend and has increased the payment more than 10% over the past five years.Looking forward, Apple is bullish ahead of today’s iPhone 11 launch event. The new smartphone devices are expected to show incremental improvements overall, and to fit in well with the current lineup. The new Apple Watch, however, is expected to show new features, including health monitoring apps, that are expected to put it in the spotlight. This is in line with the company’s shift from the iPhone to its other divisions. Wearables showed a record revenue increase in the last quarterly report.Writing from JPMorgan, analyst Samik Chatterjee says, “The key watch points for tomorrow's event will revolve around 2019 iPhone pricing, and announcements around other hardware products which have more opportunity to surprise relative to expectations.” He gives AAPL a $243 price target, with a 13% upside.5-star analyst Timothy Arcuri, of UBS, agrees that Apple will stick to meeting expectations in today’s event. “We expect Apple to announce three new iPhones and a new Watch. The iPhone models are very similar to current models save for some general performance improvement and a materially better camera with more functionality. Overall, the Watch seems like more of a potential upside surprise given new health features.” Arcuri’s $235 target implies an upside of 10% for the stock.Overall, AAPL keeps a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. This is based on 16 buys, 11 holds, and 1 sell set in the last three months. AAPL shares are selling for $214, with an average price target of $226, giving a potential upside of 5%. The current share price is only 6% lower than the company’s all-time peak of $228, reached in October 2018. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)While Apple was first to reach $1 trillion in market cap, and Amazon (AMZN) was second, Microsoft has been the one to hold its value at that level. The software company first broke the trillion-dollar level in April of this year, and remained above ever since. The company’s current market cap is $1.046 trillion.Building its success on the ubiquitous Windows operating system and its more recent move into cloud-based services, Microsoft offers income-minded investors the best of all worlds. Share price has consistently gained over the past fourteen years, and the company has simultaneously adjusted its dividend to steadily increase over the same time. The 1.34% yield is well below the S&P’s average of 2%, and the $1.84 annual payout won’t turn any heads, but it has developed a reputation for rock-solid reliability.Top market analysts agree that Microsoft has stable upward momentum. From Mizuho Securities, Gregg Moskowitz writes, “MSFT hasn't seen a slowdown in demand, usage trends or pipeline, other than some regional volatility in China. Data center trends continue to be strong, and management remains relatively optimistic about the PC demand environment over the next year or two.” His price target, $152, implies an upside of 10%.KeyBanc’s Brent Bracelin is also bullish on MSFT. He notes especially that the company has just locked down a $7.6 billion contract with the US Department of Defense, to provide Office software for the Pentagon. He says, “We view some of these broader government modernization plans and cloud initiatives as another growth vector for Microsoft’s commercial cloud segment.” Bracelin gives MSFT a price target of $155, for a 12% upside.Microsoft’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 buys, along with 1 hold and 1 sell. MSFT shares sell for $137 and have an average price target of $153, giving the stock an upside potential of 11%. Like Apple, Microsoft shares are up 35% year-to-date. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)By revenue, Broadcom is the sixth-ranked semiconductor company in the world by sales revenues, bringing in $18.46 billion in 2018. The company weathered last year’s Q4 downturn better than most tech companies, along with this past summer’s volatility. At the same time, Broadcom’s sales growth has been slower than some of its competitors – Intel’s growth from 2017 to 2018 was 14%, while Broadcom’s was just 4%.Still, the company has held onto its relative position in its industry, and in recent weeks has seen a 7.3% jump share prices. Shares are closing in on $300, and this brings Broadcom’s biggest investor advantage into sharp relief: the company believes in rewarding shareholders. The dividend is already 3.62%, well above the S&P average, and is scheduled for an increase later this year. Factoring in the high share price, AVGO pays out $10.60 per share per year, giving this stock the one-two combination of high yield and high payout.Mark Lipacis, of Jefferies, notes the company’s plans to increase the dividend, and expects to see a boost of 30% in December. He points out that this is in line with the Broadcom’s general policy of returning half of the annual free cash flow to the shareholders. Calculating from the fiscal year 2019 FCF estimate of $10.9 billion Lipacis expects the dividend to hit $13.72 annualized, which would put the yield at an impressive 4.9%. His dividend expectations make him naturally bullish on the stock, reflected in his $324 price target and 10% upside.Loop Capital’s Cody Acree is also bullish on AVGO, based on the company’s broader prospects. He sets a $310 price target and writes, “We expect the company to maintain its cautious stance regarding its channel and OEM inventory trends along with expressing concern over the direction of end-market demand as a result of the macro-related uncertainties. We see Broadcom returning to sequential and annual growth in Q4…” His target implies an upside of 6%.Broadcom maintains a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, with 22 buy ratings and 8 holds. Shares are selling for $293, and have an average price target of $312.

2019-09-11,"The stock market, incredibly enough, is holding its own after a small stumble last week. Although not in full-blown rally mode, treading water while investors take some time to reassess where things are is a type of win in-and-of itself.Still, some groups have been hit harder than others, and some names within certain groups are lagging their sector-based benchmarks. Tech stocks are among the names that lost the most ground since the market-wide July peak. They've also been less than impressive on the way back up, held back by some names more so than others.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Not all of those laggards are necessarily names not worth owning, though. In fact, their recent weakness has made some of the top tech stocks even bigger and better bargains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's a rundown of the market's top tech stocks to buy while trading at beaten-down prices. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com It has hardly been a disaster, but the 11% setback Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares have suffered since their April peak is decidedly sub-par.Yes, fears about the trade impasse with China were a key part of this weakness, though not just fears of a slowdown. The company warned investors in June that the ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies would ultimately shave $2 billion worth of revenue off of its top line this year. The trade war is also pegged as the reason Broadcom was blocked from acquiring Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) … a deal that would have proven a boon here at the advent of 5G connectivity.Capitalism finds a way. Even if the trade meeting planned between President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping for October isn't progressive, analysts are still modeling slow and steady profit growth for this year and next. Per-share earnings should be up 10% next year. FireEye (FEYE)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com As of December, it looked like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) had finally escaped its funk. Fueled by continued sales growth and a move deeper into operational profitability, at the time, FEYE stock was up nearly 90% from its early 2017 lows.The market changed its mind once again though. Despite the fact that the cybercrime and hacking threat only worsens every year, investors sold off their stakes in the small cybersecurity name. Since December, FireEye shares have fallen 30%. The tepid guidance issued as part of last quarter's earnings report accounted for a sizeable chunk of that weakness.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now The pullback may have created an opportunity to step into a now-undervalued name, however. As Bank of America's Tal Liani opined after FireEye's quarterly report, the phase-out of its third generation product and launch of its fifth-generation product is all but complete, setting the stage for a full recovery of gross margins. Citrix Systems (CTXS)Source: Shutterstock Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) allows enterprises and institutions to get more out of their IT infrastructure. More than just networked computers, Citrix offers tools and apps to let teams collaborate and communicate.The market for such platforms is robust, but so is the competition. Citrix perpetually seems to be a step ahead of the others, securing the best deals. Case in point? Last month, Citrix Systems announced it would be the name to develop a &quot;desktop as a service&quot; solution for software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Partnerships like that are the reason the company has been able to make slow and steady progress. Subscription-based revenue, up 41% a quarter ago, adds more stability to its top and bottom lines.CTXS stock is down 18% since the end of August of last year, but now valued at less than sixteen times next year's projected earnings, the worst may all be in the past. Dell Technologies (DELL)Yes, this is the same Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) that was started by Michael Dell in 1984, only to be taken private in 2013. Through a complicated corporate structure involving VMware (NYSE:VMW), it became a publicly-traded entity again.The backstory seems irrelevant given the weak demand for personal computers right now. Except the environment isn't as weak as it seemed to be as recently as the first quarter of this year … at least not for Dell. Though last quarter's top line was only up 1%, it was up 1% when most of its rivals saw their sales decline. Earnings of $2.15 per share of DELL stock also trounced estimates for a profit of only $1.50.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever As Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold put it, Dell is &quot;a nice house in a tough neighborhood.&quot; II-VI (IIVI)Source: Shutterstock When most investors are looking for tech stocks to buy, II-VI (NASDAQ:IIVI) isn't a name that often comes to mind. Indeed, II-VI likely isn't even a name most investors have even heard of. Aside from the odd moniker, with a market cap of only $2.4 billion, the optoelectronic components company doesn't get much in the way of the media's attention.Don't let its small size fool you. II-VI packs a punch. Last quarter's top line improved to the tune of 13%, and operating profits grew 29%.Disappointing guidance negated those strong quarterly results, allowing a long-standing dry spell for IIVI stock to grow a little longer. Shares are now priced at 25% less than early-2018 peak value. With more of the same kind of earnings and profit growth translating into a forward-looking P/E of 11.65, II-VI looks like a lower-risk, bargain-priced pickup particularly now that it's going to merge with Finisar (NASDAQ:FNSR). Oracle (ORCL)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com All too often, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) appears to be a proverbial punching bag. From being criticized for not offering 'real' cloud-based solutions to being on the wrong side of a legal argument with the Defense Department to downplaying its own MySQL platform if hosted by a competitor, the company can't catch a break.Yet, the stock continues to march forward. It's anything but a straight-line march. After rallying from its late-2018 low near $43 to the July high near $60, ORCL stock fall back to nearly $51 last month. Now it's approaching $55 again.  * 8 Precious Metals Stocks to Mine For If you can stomach the headline-driven volatility, these dips have proven great entry points. That may have something to do with the fact that Oracle rarely fails to grow its top and bottom lines, regardless of alarming headlines. Teladoc Health (TDOC)Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) isn't profitable and probably won't be for a long, long time. Ergo, it's not a holding that's right for everybody's portfolio. If you understand the risks and nuances involved with a young startup though, TDOC stock has earned a spot in a list of stocks to buy for the story, even if not for the results.Teladoc Health, in simplest terms, offers virtual doctor's visits by using the internet to allow patients to make video calls to physicians. The company's doctors can even write prescriptions for users of the service.It's certainly out of the ordinary, or was anyway. It has quickly becoming the norm, so much so that Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has launched an app to help its customers find a telehealth option that's often more convenient than going to a clinic.Further validating the idea is raw growth. Teladoc's top line is on pace to grow 30% this year, and 25% next year. ServiceNow (NOW)Source: Shutterstock Last week, information technology sector research outfit Gartner put software company ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) in its so-called magic quadrant … for the sixth year in a row. The accolade means not only is ServiceNow's core product a game-changer, but the company also delivers IT service management better than any other players in the same sliver of the tech world.Gartner's lofty opinion doesn't inherently make NOW stock a buy. But, in some regards, ServiceNow's results reflect how Gartner feels. This year's revenue is projected to be up nearly 33%, while next year's is forecasted to improve almost 29%. Earnings are growing commensurately with revenue.  * 7 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy as the Sector Lights Up It's also worth noting that, despite the 17% setback since its mid-July peak, analysts still collectively feel NOW stock merits a price target of $317.72. That's 25% better than the stock's present price. HP (HPQ)Source: Shutterstock HP (NYSE:HPQ), the consumer-facing half of 2015's split from the entity that would also spawn Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), has been more than a little roughed up lately. Tepid PC demand has dragged HP stock from its late-2016 peak of $85.76 to a multi-year low of near $36 earlier this month. The bounce back to the current price of $43 only wipes away a tiny portion of that loss.Bernstein analyst A.M. Sacconaghi made an interesting and valid point this week though, suggesting the sentiment surrounding HP stock was so pessimistic that it also serves as something of a floor.It's valuation certainly helps on that front. Although its future is fuzzy, priced at only seven times its trailing profits and a modest 8.5 times next year's expected earnings, investors have more than priced in the most extreme of headwinds. Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH)Source: Shutterstock Finally, add Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) to your list of tech stocks to buy after an unnecessarily severe selloff.As of the latest look, even with the rebound from its May low near $57, CTSH stock's current price around $64 is still 25% less than where shares were trading in March of last year. The selloff has nothing to do with a lack of growth or value though.While the all-purpose IT outfit has never been a high-growth machine, single-digit sales growth has been reliable for years thanks to the company's stature as, in Forrester Research's words, &quot;a strong choice for a broad range of modernization and migration tasks, including accelerated cloud migration.&quot; Top-line growth should perk up again next year as well.The real hook here, however, is the stock's valuation. Priced at less than 15 times next year's expected earnings, there's a reason shares have already stopped falling and started testing the water of higher highs.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in FireEye.

2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. reported modest quarterly sales growth and reiterated a muted forecast for the rest of the fiscal year, indicating the trade war between China and the U.S. is still suppressing demand for semiconductors.Sales in the period ended Aug. 4 rose 9% to $5.52 billion, the San Jose, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Before certain items, profit was $5.16 a share. That compares with average analyst estimates for per-share profit of $5.13 on sales of $5.52 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Broadcom said it still expects revenue in fiscal 2019 to be $22.5 billion, a lowered projection it made in June. The company no longer gives quarterly predictions and instead updates its annual target at the end of each quarter. Shares declined about 1.3% in extended trading.Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan has built a $100 billion company through a spate of acquisitions, including his purchase of part of Symantec Corp. for $10.7 billion in August. While Broadcom has one of the broadest reaches in the technology industry, that diversity hasn’t made it immune to the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China and blacklisting of Huawei Technologies Co., which is hammering Tan’s semiconductor business.“We believe demand has bottomed out but will continue to remain at these levels due to the current uncertain environment,” Tan said in the statement. There’s little visibility due to the trade war and no sense of a “sharp recovery around the corner,” he added on a conference call.About half of the chips Broadcom sells are either used in China or sent through factories there on the way to becoming part of electronic devices sold around the world. Last year, Huawei accounted for about $900 million of Broadcom’s sales, Tan has said.The chipmaker’s position as a major manufacturer of components for Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. means its orders are seen as a gauge of confidence in future demand from some of the world’s largest smartphone makers. It’s also one of the leading suppliers of networking components used by large data-center operators such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud division.Tan said that there is a “seasonal uptick” in demand for phone parts because of the launch of new models from his “large North American customer,” using his typical reference for Apple. Orders at this point are typical of the buildup ahead of a phone release, and sales of the devices will determine demand in the future. Apple’s iPhone 11 goes on sale Sept. 20.Three months ago, Tan pared back his revenue forecast for the year, indicating that sales in each of the remaining quarters would be a billion dollars lighter than previously expected. That has held back Broadcom’s stock, which is up 18% this year, compared with a 39% advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.In the current circumstances, the company will prioritize paying down debt over buying back shares, Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause said on the conference call. Doing so is important to retaining the company’s investment-grade credit rating.Net income in the fiscal third quarter declined to $715 million, or $1.71 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $2.71, a year earlier, Broadcom said. Chip unit sales were about $4.4 billion in the recent period, accounting for 79% of the company’s total revenue. They were down 4.7% from a year earlier.(Updates with comments from executives starting in fifth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Sticks to Lowered 2019 Sales Forecast; Shares Slip

2019-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. paid $1.15 billion to buy the rest of a partnership it had with Japan’s TDK Corp. The deal will help Qualcomm sell more chips for smartphones supporting the latest 5G wireless standard, the U.S. company said.The two firms set up their RF360 Holdings partnership in 2016 to design radio frequency components. Qualcomm contributed cash and TDK spun off its design and manufacturing assets into the endeavor, which was 51% owned by the San Diego-based company.Radio frequency components help convert radio waves into signals that semiconductors can turn into data. They are a crucial part of smartphones, and an important ingredient in a soup of chips and software that Qualcomm is concocting for makers of new 5G handsets.Qualcomm is already the biggest maker of modems for phones and also provides many of the processors that run software in handsets. It’s trying to combine all these elements into a single offering for smartphone makers. Taking control of the RF joint venture will make the company a bigger competitor to Skyworks Solutions Inc., Qorvo Inc., Broadcom Inc. and other industry players.Increasing mobile data speeds partly come from combining more bands of radio frequency. Modern smartphones access more than 50 bands, up from three in early data-capable phones more than a decade ago. That requires more complex RF components.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Qualcomm Spends $1.15 Billion to Buy Joint Venture From TDK

2019-09-18,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has seen a nice bump since August. Shares have popped from a low of $148.77 on Aug. 15 to $180.24 at the close Sept. 17. With positive developments in the U.S.-China trade war and improving fundamentals for the GPU space, Nvidia's fortunes may be turning around.Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com But is there enough left in the tank to send NVDA stock higher? Based on valuation, it seems most catalysts are priced in the stock. Nevertheless, NVDA sells at a discount to GPU rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).So what's the verdict? Let's take a closer look at Nvidia stock, and see why now may not be the time to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Key Developments Driving the Nvidia Stock PriceWeak GPU demand and the U.S.-China trade war. These two factors hammered Nvidia stock. But a turnaround in chip sales and optimism over a trade deal have mitigated these concerns. Improved investor sentiment is driving NVDA stock higher. The question is: Will it last?With regards to GPU demand, Nvidia's sales results for the past quarter show promise. For the quarter ending July 30, revenue rose from $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion quarter-over-quarter. Gaming sales rose 24% from the prior quarter, from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. But sales remain down year-over-year. Overall sales were $3.1 billion in the prior year's quarter, including gaming sales of $1.8 billion. Nvidia has a long ways to go before reaching the high water mark set in the prior year.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars How about the U.S.-China trade war? Investors are optimistic, but corporate America remains bearish. The unpredictability of the trade war could continue to impact Nvidia's business. It could also impact an upcoming acquisition. As InvestorPlace's Tom Taulli wrote on Sept. 12, China could block Nvidia's proposed acquisition of Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX). The Mellanox deal is seen as a positive catalyst for NVDA. The deal would bolster Nvidia's data center business, and help it diversify away from GPUs.But what about artificial intelligence? The rise of AI could be Nvidia's saving grace. On Sept. 13, InvestorPlace's Jamie Johnson pointed out how Nvidia's automotive AI business saw sales grow 30% in the past quarter. AI has yet to reach critical mass, but in the next decade could emerge as a major industry. This would give Nvidia stock a clear pathway to growth.However, as seen below, this growth potential is clearly reflected in the valuation of NVDA stock. Does this mean shares are overvalued? Let's see how Nvidia's valuation compares to peers. NVDA Stock Remains OvervaluedDespite declining sales since 2018, Nvidia stock remains richly priced. The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 25.5. Nvidia's enterprise value/EBITDA is 40. But shares continue to trade at a discount to rival AMD. AMD stock trades at 28.3 times forward earnings, and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 67.Does this mean Nvidia stock is undervalued? Possibly, but it could indicate AMD remains overvalued. Both stocks trade at premiums to broad-line chip makers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Intel's forward P/E is 11.6, and its EV/EBITDA ratio is 7.6. Broadcom trades at a forward P/E of 12.4, and a EV/EBITDA ratio of 14.3.As I have stated before, I do not understand the high premium assigned to GPU makers relative to broad-line chip makers. As seen from the global GPU glut, substantial sales growth is uncertain. Long term, I can easily see both NVDA and AMD trade at valuations similar to INTC and AVGO. Maybe not as cheap as Intel stock, but certainly at similar EV/EBITDA ratios as Broadcom. It's Tough To Predict Nvidia Stock's FutureAll bets are off with Nvidia stock. While the company has seen improvements in its overall business, sales remain down from the prior year. There's light at the end of the tunnel for the trade war, but uncertainty remains. Nvidia next announces results in November. The analyst community sees quarterly sales at around $2.9 billion. China could give their blessing to the Mellanox deal. If so, the deal could close at the end of 2019.So what's the play with Nvidia stock? I have been on the sidelines since July, and shares have traded sideways since. If the company can reach the high water mark set last year, shares should see material improvement. But until then, sideways trading between $150-$200 per share is likely. Continue to stay on the sidelines with Nvidia stock.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities More From InvestorPlace  * 2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid   * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars   * 5 Stocks to Buy With Great Charts   * 5 Goldman Sachs Stocks to Buy with Over 20% Upside Potential The post All Bets Are Off With the Nvidia Stock Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.",All Bets Are Off With the Nvidia Stock Rally

2019-09-26,"As we highlighted recently, the best place to find dividend stocks could the tech sector. Need an example? Just take a look at Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent wins on the shareholder rewards front. MSFT just announced that it plans on increasing its payout by 11% and is conducting a whopping $40 billion buyback program.When you add this huge increase to its payout, Microsoft quickly becomes one of the best dividend stocks ever. In fact, MSFT raises its quarterly dividend every year since it began paying one in 2004. And MSFT isn't alone when it comes to tech-sector dividend stocks.Like Mr. Softy, there are countless others that have become cash flow and profit machines. With service revenues driving the show, margins in the sector have never been higher. This has only filled tech stocks coffers to the brim. With so much cash now overflowing their balance sheets, they can't help but return it. In turn, the sector has become fertile ground for finding dividend stocks. And while initial yields may not be as high as utilities or consumer staples names, the sector can't be beaten when it comes to dividend growth. MSFT's big quarterly jump is a testament to that.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Next-Gen Growth Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains Which tech stocks are rewarding their shareholders just like Microsoft? Here are five dividend stocks to consider in the sector. Microchip Technology (MCHP)Dividend Yield: 1.62%You may not realize it, but your coffee pot and the most complex supercomputer do have something in common with each other. They both are able to operate courtesy of semiconductors. Given that the modern world runs on this important backbone, the semiconductor sector has long been a great place to comb for tech dividend stocks. And one of the best and earliest payers in the sector could be Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP).MCHP produces what are known as analog and microcontroller semiconductors. Truth be told, there's nothing too special about analog chips. But if it wasn't for these boring chips, modern society wouldn't function. But boring is beautiful when it comes to dividends and cash flows.As the world continues to modernize and lean on technology, demand for analog chips of all kinds have grown. That has benefited Microchip's bottom line in a big way. Year-over-year sales clocked in 9.1% higher last quarter and over the longer term, MCHP has seen profitability for 114 consecutive quarters. That's pretty much unheard of in the semiconductor sector which tends to have wild swings in profits and losses.That sort of consistency has made MCHP a dividend stalwart among tech stocks. Since its initial payout in 2002, Microchip has managed to grow its dividend by 1725%.More could be in store for investors as well. Thanks to some smart acquisitions, MCHP has started to pivot into more advanced semiconductors. Chips like automotive power units, battery and green technologies and networking semis all come with bigger margins. These could help boost its 1.62% yield much further. Garmin (GRMN)Dividend Yield: 2.72%A few years ago, Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) was knocking on heaven's door. Not really, but that was the perception. Thanks to the rise of smartphones, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Maps and other GPS applications, GRMN's perceived main bread-and-butter in automotive navigation was dying a quick death. However, the reality is that GRMN is much more than a GPS.The firm makes a host of marine and aviation GPS navigation equipment that is the standard for many end-users. This includes consumers and industrial applications. Meanwhile, its line of wearable devices has also become one of the standard brands for serious athletes and runners. The truth is, Garmin continues to succeed in these other markets -- with the proof in the pudding. With revenues jumping 7% overall and aviation, marine, fitness and outdoor sales growing by 12% last quarter, management at GRMN have been able to raise its annual guidance for fourth consecutive year in a row.The best part is that profits at Garmin continue to jump as these divisions come with higher profit margins. A recent pivot to include more services and reoccurring revenues hasn't hurt either.  * 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Set for Growth This has allowed Garmin to generate plenty of free cash flows. After holding onto that extra cash for a bit in order to reinvest and overcome its auto woes, GRMN is back on the dividend growth front. It never actually cut its payout, it just held it steady for a bit. With a 2.72% yield and new product launches coming down the line, GRMN stock makes a compelling stock for dividend seekers. OpenText (OTEX)Dividend Yield: 1.70%Because it's excluded from many international indexes, most ignore our neighbors in the Great White North. But Canada has long been a great place to find technology firms and dividend stocks. Take OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX), for example.The firm has been around for more than a decade and provides enterprise information management software and solutions. Basically, it's digging into a firm's data and coming up with insights into that information. Companies can use this in a variety of ways to make decisions, design new products, cut costs, etc.The win is that OTEX's platform is able to mine all varieties of data together -- from HR and CRM to security and supply chain metrics. And thanks to the birth of cloud computing, OTEX's services continue to be in hot demand.The firm counts more than 74,000 customers -- both big and small. And those customers continue to drive new revenues into OpenText's coffers. Overall sales jumped by 3.8% last quarter. The real star was cloud computing revenues, gaining 10.2%. OTEX itself has started to offer plenty of cloud solutions for its own products. Because of this and the popularity of its products, in just five years annual recurring revenues have doubled.What all of this has done is make OTEX stock a cash flow and dividend machine. Since in initiating a steady payout in 2015, OpenText has managed to grow its dividend by nearly 150%. This makes the Canadian firm a powerful dividend stock in the tech sector. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Dividend Yield: 3.38%Since it's a real estate investment trust (REIT), having Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) on a list of tech dividend stocks may seem out of place. That is until you realize what kind of REIT DLR is. The firm owns and operates data center locations.It doesn't matter the technology trend -- cloud computing, mobile commerce, big data, etc. -- all require massive computing systems and storage. The problem is that it is awfully cost-prohibitive to buy all the necessary hardware and the specialized buildings this can require. This is where data center specialists like Digital Realty come in. DLR currently owns more than 210 of these locations across the world. Top tech firms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) basically rent space inside its specialized buildings to store their computers and server equipment.It turns out this is a very profitable niche to be in. As tech has grown, so has DLR's cash flows. Since its founding in 2005, Digital Realty has had its core funds from operations (FFO) grow by 13% per year. And as a REIT, that rising FFO number directly translates into higher dividends. DLR has managed to grow its payout every year for the last four years straight.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Under $10 More growth could be on the way. DLR continues to buyout smaller and larger rivals as well as construct new data centers. However, even this isn't enough satiate demand. That means there could many years of dividend increases still to go from this tech stock. Broadcom (AVGO)Dividend Yield: 3.84%Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Talk about a transition. Looking at Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) history of buyouts, spin-offs, and mergers is enough to make your head spin. This continues with its last two major deals: its acquisition of CA Technologies and its recent buyout proposal of security firm Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC).But the focus is the same and that's &quot;connecting everything.&quot; Today, AVGO is a provider of both semiconductors and infrastructure software products. Its collection of products puts it right in the crosshairs of some big trends -- this includes data center networking, home connectivity, smartphones, factory automation, broadband access, you name it. AVGO is able to provide the hardware to connect devices, dig into that connection and manage data with its CA software. If the buyout goes through, it can also protect those connections with SYMC.It's really becoming an all-in-one shop for other tech firms looking to build their own networks and products.The key to all of this comes to down to licensing. While chips drive sales, both CA and SYMC have huge backlogs of steady reoccurring revenues. The integration of CA has helped Broadcom boost its bottom line as well as margins. SYMC should do the same.Because of this and overall strong profit growth, AVGO has continued to share the wealth with shareholders. Since offering an interim dividend in 2010, Broadcom has managed to grow its payout significantly.

2019-10-02,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. prosecutors say Hao Zhang is a professor-spy who conspired with a colleague from the University of Southern California to steal and sell American secrets to the Chinese government and military through a shell company in the Cayman Islands.Zhang’s lawyers will try to show at a trial set for Wednesday that his work at one of China’s most prestigious technical universities to develop radio-filtering technology used in mobile phones has always been about advancing scientific knowledge -- and not for the benefit of the Chinese state.The trial comes amid an aggressive U.S. crackdown on Chinese theft of intellectual property that began under former President Barack Obama -- even before Zhang was arrested in 2015 when he flew to Los Angeles to attend a conference -- and has escalated during the Trump administration’s trade war with China.Zhang could face a lengthy prison term in the U.S. if found guilty of trade-secret theft and an even more serious charge, economic espionage. Such cases rarely go to trial, but Zhang’s is even more unusual because he has elected to defend himself before a judge in federal court in San Jose, California, instead of in front of a jury.The proceeding will last just one or two days, streamlined by the professor’s agreement not to fight evidence weighing against him that a federal prosecutor has described as “overwhelming.”Zhang is mounting what one legal expert calls a “damage control” defense in which he has conceded evidence including emails that the U.S. says contained trade-secret data and admissions he made while being questioned by the FBI.“It’s pretty common to only contest elements that are reasonably defensible, to avoid inflammatory or prejudicial evidence coming in on other elements that you are going to lose anyway, but which could color the rest of the case,” said Paul Chan, a lawyer who defends companies and individuals in trade-secret cases.Read More: U.S. Tour Guide Accused as Spy for China’s Security ServiceThe secrets Zhang allegedly stole came from a former employer, Skyworks Solutions Inc., based in Woburn, Massachusetts, and San Jose-based Avago Technologies Ltd., which acquired Broadcom Inc. in 2015. The technology at issue filters out unwanted signals in mobile phones and other devices, which has become more difficult as wireless products have become ubiquitous.Zhang went to work for Skyworks after earning his doctorate in electrical engineering at the University of Southern California in 2006. At USC he met Wei Pang, who went on to work at Avago and, according to prosecutors, was Zhang’s key co-conspirator. Both men returned to China to teach at Tianjin University, a premier technical school.At TJU, the professors allegedly used stolen information to refine radio-filter technology, apply for patents in the U.S. and China, and sell it through a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.In 2015, prosecutor Matthew Parrella told the court that the U.S. has built an “overwhelming case” against Zhang based on email messages with Pang, in some instances containing proprietary information from Skyworks and Avago.These Are Some of Trump’s Weapons in China Trade Spat: QuickTakeThe government has proof of “overt act after overt act of this defendant emailing around trade secrets that he took, attempts to hide their business dealings, attempts to move the victim companies to China -- it’s extremely clear,” Parrella said.Zhang is the first of six defendants to go to trial -- and probably the only one because the others are in China. U.S. District Judge Edward Davila has yet to rule on whether Zhang’s mentor at USC, Professor Eun Sok Kim, can testify about what Zhang’s lawyers call a practice at the school’s laboratory of promoting a “free and open exchange of ideas.”Zhang “may be seeking to prove that, given the USC lab’s promotion of the ‘free and open exchange of ideas,’ he had no actual intent to benefit a foreign government,” Chan said. Prosecutors must prove the benefit to get enhanced penalties and fines under the economic espionage charge, he said.Prosecutors have objected to the proposed testimony but apparently haven’t objected to Zhang’s request that Kim also serve as a character witness. The professor has testified once before, in 2015 shortly after Zhang was arrested, to vouch for his former student’s release on bail.Kim said Zhang was a “reliable, conscientious person who never showed any sign of a deception.”“He worked with me for four years as he pursued his Ph.D., so I know him quite well, on his personal integrity and his work ethics and his disposition and life objectives -- at least as far as I can tell while he was a student with me,” he said. “So I had a pretty good opinion about him.”China’s Global Times daily newspaper has published numerous stories describing the plight of Chinese scientists, including Zhang, whose careers it says have been destroyed by U.S. prosecutions.“America has a long history of hunting for Chinese scapegoats as part of their efforts to curb China’s scientific and technological development,” the English-language newspaper said in a December article.The case is U.S. v. Hao Zhang, 15-cr-00106, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).To contact the reporter on this story: Joel Rosenblatt in San Francisco at jrosenblatt@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Joe SchneiderFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Chinese Professor Faces Rare U.S. Economic Espionage Trial

2019-10-04,"After a jobs report that was mostly in line with expectations, investors bid up the market in relief. The question now is, can equities continue higher into earnings season? Let's look at a few top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Amazon (AMZN)A look at the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) chart does not inspire much confidence. Remember, it's one of the least impressive FAANG stocks at the moment, as shares continue to struggle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd now we enter the all-important fourth quarter. A glance at the charts shows us the breakdown below uptrend support (blue line), the 200-day moving average and the 61.8% retracement.  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? Luckily, InvestorPlace readers were ready for the decline. What now, though?Shares almost tagged the lows from May, which also come into play near the 50% retracement. That area now becomes the must-hold spot for AMZN stock. Below there and the selling pressure can build.Unfortunately, there's a lot of overhead resistance between $1,750 and $1,800. I would feel better about buying AMZN on a deeper pullback or on a breakout over resistance than here at $1,735 hoping it continues higher. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Lululemon (LULU)Shares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) have enjoyed strong gains through 2019. The stock has put in a series of higher lows along an uptrend support mark (blue line).That rough line held earlier this week, as did the 50-day moving average. We now see LULU stock breaking out of the descending wedge (purple lines) that it has been in since its post-earnings pop to new all-time highs.From here, let's see if LULU stock can continue higher and get back to $200. If it can, new highs over $204.44 are possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and a number of other chip-makers caught a boost on Friday thanks to positive news from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company will increase its iPhone production by roughly 10% thanks to stronger-than-expected demand.That benefits suppliers like Broadcom in obvious ways, and while some may wonder why we're looking at AVGO instead of AAPL, it's because our chart on Apple from Thursday is still in play.As for AVGO, shares are making notable progress by reclaiming the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, as well as uptrend support (blue line). Shares have been trading sideways in a very wide wedge for months now, as investors wait for AVGO to resolve either higher or lower.Near $280 it faces a trifecta of resistance, with the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as the 38.2% retracement all in the same area. The silver lining is that it's already reclaimed notable levels on the day.So what's the play? A move over $280 could send AVGO up to downtrend resistance (black line), while a close over $285 could trigger a run back to $300-plus. Below $270 should concern the bulls. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)You may notice a very similar-looking wedge pattern taking hold in Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), which also had a strong day. On Friday, SWKS reclaimed its 200-day, 50-day and 20-day moving averages, and is now trading just below its 61.8% retracement.Over the 61.8% could send SWKS to downtrend resistance and possibly to last month's high near $84.35. Above that puts $88.24 on the table, the high from July. Below $74 would be cause for concern.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-10-04,"Valuing a cyclical play like Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock is difficult for two reasons. In theory,  valuation should be based on so-called &quot;mid-cycle&quot; earnings, but calculating those earnings isn't easy when it comes to MU.  And volatile earnings like those of MU can lead to volatile trading, which is exactly what we've seen from Micron stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com Indeed, in the last three years, MU stock has moved from under $20 to over $60 to a current price just north of $43. And its earnings have been all over the map. Micron was unprofitable in fiscal 2016 - and earned almost $12 per share on an adjusted basis in fiscal 2018.  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? Its EPS will likely head below $3 in fiscal 2020, based on analysts' average estimate. And so after MU stock looked almost absurdly cheap, at one point trading below four times its non-GAAP EPS, now, at 17 times its forward earnings. it looks reasonably valued at best,InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe issue with Micron stock at the moment is that the two ways of evaluating the stock seem to point in different directions. Fundamentally, I still see MU stock as a buy. Indeed, this summer I called it one of the best S&P 500 stocks to buy.But technically, the selloff following its Q4 earnings makes some sense. Like the Q4 report - which I thought was more concerning than investors seemed to believe - the company's Q1 guidance looked disappointing. Given the results and guidance, there's not enough evidence to believe a bottom in MU stock has been set for good.Some investors may choose to focus on the company's  long-term outlook and ride out any near-term volatility in Micron stock. I wouldn't blame them. But more aggressive investors might want to wait for a better entry point that may well be available in coming months. Is the Bottom in for MU Stock?In theory, the multiple of a cyclical company like MU should  contract at the top of cycles and expand at the bottom. That explains why the multiple of MU stock was so low last year: investors were (correctly) anticipating that MU's earnings would decline. And it also explains why investors are paying over 16 times  earnings for Micron stock even as MU's profits are tumbling.But in practice, the Street's outlook isn't always accurate. Investors and analysts get too optimistic at the top, and they get too pessimistic at the bottom.  Both phenomena have affected Micron stock in recent years.And so one of the tricks to trying to buy a cyclical stock is not just timing the fundamental bottom or top, but trying to time when investors' sentiment will shift. Cyclical stocks usually turn a couple of quarters before their businesses do. That has been the case with MU. But investors don't always correctly price companies' fundamentals into their stocks ahead of time.Those who buy Micron stock above $40 may be overly upbeat about the company's future performance. Its Q4 and Q1 guidance both came in below analysts' average estimates. And some short-term factors boosted the results of both quarters.Per MU's Q4 conference call, its customers in China are building inventory ahead of potential tariffs and political dislocations. Cost declines have been steeper than they will be going forward.The bounce of MU stock since the company's Q3 report suggests that investors are pricing in a cyclical recovery starting as soon as next year. I'm far from convinced that such a recovery is on the way.Given the current valuation of MU stock, the company's earnings and price-earnings multiples may both drop, pushing MU stock back to $30 or lower. The Fundamental Case for Micron StockThat said, I still believe MU stock can rise over the long-term. At this point, estimating its mid-cycle earnings is difficult, given the large changes in its annual profits. But as management said before and reiterated on its  Q4 call, MU  and its industry have improved over the last three years.Its production capacity has been reduced, enabling it to spend less on equipment. For the most part, its rivals like Samsung are also cutting their production.Moreover,the prices of MU's products are reasonably intact. The hope is that the boom and bust nature of its business will moderate, even if it likely never will completely end.Last year's $11.95 of adjusted EPS obviously represents a peak for MU. And given  multiple factors, it may not be a peak to which Micron returns any time soon. But with adjusted EPS still likely to come in above $2 this year, it does seem like mid-cycle EPS conceivably could be $4 or $5.I'd certainly rather own Micron stock than, say, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), given the likely long-term tailwinds for both DRAM and NAND memory that will benefit MU. But on the other hand,  MU doesn't have the linear growth potential of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or the diversification of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). However, MU's earnings still can rise.Assuming MU's mid-cycle EPS is $4+, that suggests the fair value for MU stock still should be above $50. And if supply and demand trends become more favorable than expected, Micron stock can rise still higher.But the question remains: when can that happen? With the market - including chip stocks - weakening, and MU's Q1 results likely to look soft, MU lacks a catalyst. So while I do expect MU stock to climb above its current level, I don't know that I necessarily expect it to rally any time soon.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-10-14,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a tough time in 2019. While shares are up for the year, the stock has under performed its semiconductor peers. With the company losing CPU market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), it's no wonder investors have left INTC in the dust. In addition, the macroeconomic environment has not been friendly to INTC stock. Or to the chip space in general.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com While resumed trade talks have already resulted in &quot;progress&quot;, investors remain skittish whether the U.S.-China trade fracas will lead to further headwinds for the chip space.But looking beyond these variables, Intel remains a solid stock to own. Selling at a low valuation, it offers value in a space dominated by speculative growth names. It pays a solid dividend, and has the cash flow to support it. While you may not see big gains from Intel, it may be a great blue chip opportunity. Let's take a closer look at Intel, and see why the stock may be a buy at today's price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Intel vs. AMDI believe the CPU wars are the most important factor when assessing Intel stock. While the trade war is a big risk, long-term AMD's purported recriminating of CPU market share threatens INTC's economic moat. Intel's dominant market share has given it pricing power and other advantages to ensure the stock remains a cash cow. But with AMD eating more of Intel's lunch, it seems that this gravy train could soon be over.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now But what is the truth behind the hype?It's no joke that AMD's Ryzen processors have been a game-changer. The success of this chip line has helped AMD seize more of Intel's CPU market share since 2017. AMD now has a staggering 30% market share of the CPU market. If this trend continues, AMD could reach market share it hasn't seen since the mid-2000s, when it had over 40% CPU market share.However, could this be but a short-term blip? Intel's market share losses are the result of their chip shortage. Their inability to adapt to 14-nanometre sized processor lead to supply issues. End-users simply switched from Intel to AMD.Perhaps AMD's market-share grab will taper off in the next few quarters. InvestorPlace's Ian Bezek believes so. In his Oct. 9 article, he pointed out how while AMD's market share has grown materially, it cooled off in the last quarter. However, as an aside, Bezek pointed out how Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnering with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) for chips in their Surface tablets highlights market share risk. Mobile chips have not been successful in the past when used in tablets. But with improvements in technology, mobile chip makers like Qualcomm now offer a compelling alternative to Intel's x86 CPUs. Despite Headwinds, INTC Stock Is UndervaluedIntel stock trades at a low valuation relative to most of its peers. INTC trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.6. The stock's enterprise-value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio is 7.7. Here are the respective valuations of INTC's key competitors:AMD: Forward P/E of 27.8, EV/EBITDA of 64.7Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO): Forward P/E of 12, EV/EBITDA of 14Qualcomm: Forward P/E of 18.3, EV/EBITDA of 8.4Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA): Forward P/E of 26, EV/EBITDA of 40Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN): Forward P/E of 5.9, EV/EBITDA of 3.1One thing to keep in mind is Intel's lack of long-term revenue growth. Analyst consensus estimates revenue will only grow from $69.4 billion in 2019 to $70.9 billion in 2020. Clearly, INTC stock is no growth play. But Intel stock more than makes up for in terms of return of capital to shareholders.INTC stock currently pays a 2.42% yield. While not the highest yielding blue-chip, it is otherwise a solid dividend. With a payout ratio of just 35.92%, there's plenty of room to grow this in coming years. The average 5-year growth rate for the dividend has been 5.92%.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 Along with dividends, Intel has bought back a lot of stock. For the first half of 2019, they repurchased $5.6 billion worth of shares alone. These buybacks are accretive to Intel shareholders, as they improve earnings-per-share over the long-term. Bottom Line: Intel Is a Solid Long-Term InvestmentThere's not much of a &quot;play&quot; with INTC stock. The company's main appeal is their cash-generating status and relatively low valuation. Key risks like competition and China may already be priced into shares. But if both of these issues accelerate, it does threaten the bull case for Intel stock.So what's the call? Are you looking for a solid dividend payer? Consider Intel stock. Are you looking for a contrarian chip play? Perhaps look elsewhere. Whether or not INTC maintains its moat, it is unlikely the company will see monumental revenue growth. Other chip names may offer this proposition.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. was ordered to drop allegedly unfair clauses that may compel set-top box makers to use its chips, as European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager deployed a rarely used weapon meant to prevent victims from suffering while probes drag on for years.Broadcom must end &quot;anti-competitive provisions&quot; in contracts within 30 days while the EU continues an investigation into allegations that the U.S. supplier forces six of its main customers to buy its chipsets. While the order announced on Wednesday is set to remain in force for three years or until the EU finishes its probe, Broadcom says it will ask an EU court to overturn it.&quot;The evidence that we have gathered from Broadcom’s behavior is likely to have severe negative effects on competitors before we could reach a final decision,” Vestager told reporters in Brussels. She said the so-called interim measures tool is &quot;now on the table&quot; and &quot;if we find cases where interim measures would actually be the thing to do to prevent irreparable harm to competition then obviously we stand willing to use it.&quot;The EU hasn’t used interim measures in nearly two decades. The Broadcom move comes after criticism that EU probes into Google and Intel Corp. -- where the tool wasn’t used -- took so long that victims of unfair practices were thwarted by the time fines were levied.Court Fight&quot;We intend to appeal the commission’s decision to the European courts and in the meantime comply with the commission’s order,” Broadcom said, adding that it doesn’t believe the contested provisions “have a meaningful effect on whether the customers choose to purchase Broadcom products.&quot;Officials said swift action was necessary because Broadcom’s conduct was likely to affect several upcoming tenders by telecoms providers and the introduction of the WI-Fi 6 standard for models and TV set-top boxes.Broadcom, based in San Jose, California, has also been targeted by U.S. antitrust scrutiny of WI-Fi and switch-chip markets, a probe covering the vast majority of its chip business. Broadcom has described that investigation as immaterial.The EU’s order would be &quot;a landmark moment&quot; for antitrust enforcement, especially if it’s backed by the bloc’s courts, France’s antitrust chief Isabelle de Silva said at a Paris event last week. The EU’s last attempt to use interim measures was halted by a court order in 2001. The regulator had required IMS Health to license data-collecting tools in Germany. The company later partly won a legal challenge that allowed it restrict some licenses.Arris International Plc was among the Broadcom customers to receive a questionnaire from the EU on chips in hardware used by the cable and satellite industry to provide television and internet to consumers, Bloomberg reported in October.(Updates with Broadcom statement in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Aoife White in Brussels at awhite62@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net, Peter Chapman, Amy ThomsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Must Halt Sales Tactic as Vestager Issues EU Order

2019-10-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Blacklisting by the U.S. government, accusations of espionage and the arrest of its chief financial officer haven’t been enough to scare investors away from Huawei Technologies Co. Shares of China’s biggest telecoms equipment and smartphone maker aren’t publicly listed, making its equity largely unavailable to outsiders. Its bonds, however, do trade and have continued their upward trajectory over the past year, impervious to Donald Trump’s best efforts to make Huawei the biggest scalp in his trade war with China. Four different series of U.S. dollar bonds, with maturities in 2022 through 2027, have climbed as much as 5.6% since a low in December. That’s a lot for fixed-income markets. Even a massive drop in May — when the Trump administration moved to ban U.S. companies from selling vital components to Huawei — was shrugged off by debt investors within a month. Each of those securities is now within striking distance of record highs.The concern at that time, and which persists even today, is that shutting off access to American products such as semiconductors and software would hobble the world’s second-biggest smartphone maker. U.S. companies including Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Intel Corp. supply parts used in electronics products that are difficult to substitute, especially given that China lags behind in chip technology. Even a ban on Alphabet Inc.’s Google from supplying bits of its Android operating system to Huawei was considered a major blow, since Android is used on more than two-thirds of smartphones. The prohibition follows the December arrest of CFO Meng Wanzhou, who was detained in Canada at the request of the U.S. over allegations that include lying about the company’s dealings with Iran.Debt investors brushed off these worries, perhaps believing that Huawei’s status as a national hero coupled with its deep technological abilities ensure that the company would be able to pay its debts. Huawei was sitting on $39 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of last year, with just $10.2 billion in total borrowings, according to its latest annual report.That makes Huawei’s $4.5 billion in outstanding bonds a trifle. And in the context of a slowing Chinese economy and concerns about the pileup of debt throughout the nation’s financial system, Huawei looks like one of the safest bets around.Such bullishness was rewarded this week when Huawei announced nine-month sales figures. Rather than get strangled by all those forces working against it, the Shenzhen-based company posted a 25% increase in third-quarter revenue to 209.5 billion yuan ($30 billion), according to my calculations. That’s 5% less than the prior quarter, but not the apocalyptic scenario many had expected. Importantly, it managed to maintain the 8.7% net profit margin it posted in the first half, which is actually higher than the same figure for full-year 2018. All of this goes to show that no matter what the U.S. and the economy throw at it, Huawei will be fine. Or at least its debt holders will.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-10-18,"Over recent years, the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) narrative has been dogged by various pressures and controversies. At first, Singapore-based Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) proposed an aggressive $117 billion takeover bid for QCOM stock. But in a move that had bipartisan support, President Donald Trump axed the hostile takeover, citing national security concerns. That gave Broadcom little choice but to back down.Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com The other pressing issue impacting Qualcomm stock was the underlying technology firm's legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Notably, Apple had major grievances with Qualcomm's patent licensing practices. From its perspective, QCOM charged Apple royalty fees for technologies unrelated to the chipmaker.Famously, Apple CEO Tim Cook once quipped that Qualcomm's business practice was like &quot;buying a sofa&quot; from a company that charges &quot;a different price depending upon the house that it goes into.&quot; On the other hand, Qualcomm accused Apple of using its patented tech free of charge.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEither way, whether you're on team Qualcomm or team Apple, the bottom line was this: The bitter dispute didn't serve the longer-term case for QCOM stock or AAPL shares. While the former has the innovative prowess, the latter has the rabid fan base. This was a classic knife fight in which both sides were not going to get away unscathed.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, with both organizations squaring away their differences. From this new reality, I believe Qualcomm stock has a net positive pathway to steady upside gains.Clearly, the biggest distractions for QCOM stock have been eliminated. As InvestorPlaces's Chris Markoch stated recently, this is probably the beginning of the QCOM narrative. The 5G rollout will spark multiple revenue streams. 5G Opportunities Facilitate a &quot;Slow Burn&quot; for QCOM StockFirst and foremost, the settlement between Qualcomm and Apple creates growth opportunities for at least the next few years. As the leader in 5G modems, QCOM can fill a gap that has previously impeded Apple. Of course, this is a big positive for Qualcomm stock.However, this freshly restored relationship may change over time. In the backdrop of the legal battle, Apple looked to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to provide 5G modems. When that plan failed, Apple bought Intel's 5G modem business unit. It's going to take some time to catch up, but AAPL will eventually go in-house with its smartphone semiconductors.Luckily, the Apple business is just one component of the overall 5G picture for QCOM stock. Recently, Qualcomm revealed that it has partnerships with over 30 original equipment manufacturers to launch 5G fixed wireless access equipment. With a target time frame of next year, investors won't have to wait long to start seeing results.Utilizing Qualcomm's Snapdragon X55 5G Modem-RF System as a reference architecture, this 5G FWA equipment will facilitate home- and enterprise-level 5G internet service. What makes this FWA platform impressive is its modularity. Because it can accept &quot;virtually any combination&quot; of 5G spectrum and modes, telecom firms should be able to incorporate this tech into their existing 5G infrastructure.Granted, this might sound like granular nerd talk. However, the modularity of Qualcomm's FWA is crucial for Qualcomm stock. Contrary to what some might believe, the 5G rollout isn't a light switch. Instead, it's a gradual transition.Telecom firms must migrate the existing spectrum to accommodate 5G over time. During this transition, overlap between old and new tech will occur. That's why the FWA equipment's modularity is critical, which essentially provides a bridge for telecom networks. The Lingering Trade WarDespite Qualcomm's dominant presence in 5G and the opportunities that it presents, not everything is positive for QCOM stock. Most notably, the U.S.-China trade war presents a serious risk, not just to Qualcomm but the broader tech industry.In its most recent quarter, QCOM disappointed Wall Street with sour revenue figures. However, management didn't include licensing revenue with Huawei due to a royalties dispute. Moreover, the transition to 5G means less demand for 4G-related equipment.While the trade war may limit Qualcomm stock in the nearer term, ultimately, I see this situation as longer-term positive. I say this because for this particular circumstance, China needs Qualcomm more than Qualcomm needs China.As China and other emerging markets witness broader rises in consumer strength, they'll want the best. Thus, merely doing 5G as a technicality won't be enough. Clearly, QCOM is the 5G leader, which is why our international adversaries want to steal from it.As such, the trade war has exposed China's shady business practices while presenting American companies as virtuous victims. The drama may impact Qualcomm now, but again, in the long run, even geopolitics could be favorable to QCOM stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Five months after the Trump administration blacklisted China’s Huawei Technologies Co., its business seems alive and well while American firms still don’t know whether they can work with the Chinese company or not.The Department of Commerce in May added Huawei to what’s known as the entity list in an effort to block U.S. companies from selling components to China’s largest technology company, which it accuses of being a threat to America’s national security. Huawei has denied those claims.Despite those actions, Huawei reported last week that its revenue grew 24% in the first ninth months of 2019, boosted by a 26% jump in smartphone shipments. There are also signs that U.S. efforts to block the company from the development of 5G technology have yet to make a big dent: Huawei said it has signed more than 60 5G commercial contracts to date worldwide.LicensesThe entity listing, which requires American firms to obtain a government license in order to sell to blacklisted firms, has caused complications for U.S. companies.Tech leaders and their lawyers have argued for months in closed-door meetings with Trump administration officials that the blacklisting of Huawei, one of their biggest customers, is detrimental to their businesses. Many industry executives are confused about the administration’s end goals and haven’t been able to get clarity on when license approvals will be offered despite those discussions, according to several people familiar with the matter.President Donald Trump said in June after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Osaka that he’d “easily’’ agreed to allow American firms to continue certain exports to Huawei. Weeks later Trump said he’d accelerate the approval process for licenses but none have been granted so far. The president as recently as this month green-lit the approval of licenses in a meeting with advisers, according to people familiar with the matter, but an announcement has yet to be made.The Commerce Department, in a statement, said it has received more than 200 license requests about Huawei and its affiliates. “Given the complexity of the matter, the interagency process is ongoing to ensure we correctly identified which licenses were safe to approve,” according to the statement. “Moreover, the Temporary General License remains in effect and was recently renewed.”Sales ImpactMicron Technology Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said in September that the lack of decision on its license applications could result in a worsening decline in sales over the coming quarters. The company gave a disappointing quarterly profit forecast last month, pointing in part to the Huawei restrictions. Broadcom Inc. in June also slashed its annual forecast, citing the U.S.-China trade war and disruption to its relationship with Huawei.One of the industry’s main arguments for allowing shipments of non-national security sensitive items is that Huawei can buy some of those components from competitors around the world, including South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.“Unless the ban succeeds in ‘killing’ Huawei, the result will be reduced U.S. global market share in a number of technology areas, something that will hurt, not help U.S. tech competitiveness,’’ said Robert Atkinson, president of ITIF, a Washington-based think tank.WorkaroundsSome firms have resumed shipments to Huawei even without a verdict on license requests. After a closer look at the rules since May, they determined they could continue supplying products based on an export control law. The rule doesn’t subject a product or service to the entity listing’s constraints if a company can prove that a piece of technology owes less than 25% of its origins to U.S.-based activities.Micron in June said it had resumed some memory chip shipments to Huawei. Intel Corp., the U.S.’s biggest chipmaker with plants in Oregon, New Mexico and Arizona, has as well. The company also has facilities in Ireland, Israel and China -- enabling it to argue that a chunk of the intellectual property in its chips isn’t created in the U.S.“We know many U.S. companies continue to ship to Huawei but do so using murky workarounds by way of other countries and third parties,’’ said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity fellow at New America, a think tank. “It’s questionable whether the Huawei ban has helped U.S. national security so much as created a messy tangle of new problems.’’James McGregor, chairman of consulting firm APCO Worldwide’s greater China region, said he’s focused on what unintended consequences may result from the White House’s actions.“I’m worried about tech companies decoupling from America over time by removing some of their operations from the U.S.,&quot; McGregor said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Monday. “They have to look out for the long-term disruption of their business.”Atkinson cautioned not to over-interpret Huawei’s sales figures because the company has been stockpiling supplies for a while, in anticipation of the U.S. action. He said fourth quarter sales will be a more accurate indicator of the export ban’s impact, or whether the company has largely circumvented it.Huawei has said it expects U.S. export restrictions to reduce annual revenue at its consumer devices business by about $10 billion, in part because Google can no longer supply Android updates and apps from Gmail to Maps for the Chinese company’s newest handsets.U.S.-China DealTrump has indicated on various occasions that he’d be willing to consider removing the ban on Huawei for better terms in a trade agreement, drawing sharp criticism from China hawks on Capitol Hill.With the U.S. reaching a “phase one’’ deal with China earlier this month, the big question now is whether Trump will consider removing Huawei from the entity list or ease restrictions. When announcing the accord on Oct. 11, the administration said the issue wouldn’t be part of this initial pact but that it could be a part of phase two.(Updates with comments from McGregor.)To contact the reporters on this story: Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Brendan MurrayFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Five Months After Huawei Export Ban, U.S. Companies Are Confused"

2019-10-28,"I wanted to find an ideal list of stocks with high dividend yields. The stocks would have to be cheap as well. And the dividends would have to have a history of growth. Lastly, the company would have to be able to afford the dividends.In earlier articles like this, I found stocks that met two or three of these four criteria about dividend stocks. But this time I wanted to see if there were any stocks with all four of these criteria. I feel that these four criteria help the investor know that the dividend is both relatively safe and reliably consistent. Moreover, the investor would not be paying extra for that safety and stock dividend growth.Keep in mind that the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.9%. The median price-to-earnings ratio is 14.8x and the average payout ratio is 35%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs for dividend growth rates, there are not a lot of studies. One analyst found that over 51 years, the average dividend growth rate was 5.4%. Therefore, I decided to set the minimum rate of growth at better than 5.4% over a five-year period.I also felt that I would not find stocks with better than the average payout ratio. A 35% payout ratio would be too low a hurdle with these high dividend yield stocks. So as long as the payout ratio was not worse than 70%, the stock would be deemed worthy. It would seem that at that rate the company could still afford the dividend.Here are five high yield, fast-growing dividend stocks that meet these criteria.

Earnings have been growing consistently and have beat market expectations.  * 7 AI Stocks to Buy to Profit from the Recent Tech Correction Broadcom stock trades at a low 13 times price-to-earnings ratio and has a 3.7% dividend yield. AVGO pays out about half its earnings in dividends. Broadcom's dividends have been growing consistently at a high rate over the past three years (+74%) and five years (+55%). Look for AVGO stock to follow this consistent trend. Broadcom's earnings should do well over the next telecom cycle as 5G equipment begins to roll out. Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.9%5-Year Dividend Growth: 63.3%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 10.7Payout Ratio: 41.2%Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) stock has a very nice dividend yield and growth history. Goodyear sells its own brand of tires worldwide along with private label brands. The company also has over 1,100 tire and auto-service center outlets that offer repair services and products.Goodyear's basic products are always in demand as tires need constant replacement. But it makes more money when car sales increase. Fears of an economic slowdown have kept Goodyear stock cheap. Nevertheless, given the constant demand for tires, Goodyear has the ability to withstand a slowdown in GDP growth.New car tire sales and international tire sales make up the majority of its revenue. Volumes in new cars have been falling so its original equipment manufacturer sales volume has been dropping. Operating margins have been also hit by two new plants.This is a cyclical stock. The long-term investor will take advantage of this situation and buy GT stock while it is cheap. Hanesbrands (HBI)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.8%5-Year Dividend Growth: 36%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 9.1Payout Ratio: 34.3%Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) stock is too cheap. It sells innerwear and active-wear clothes, including its own fast-growing Champion brand. Analysts put the company's forward earnings at $1.76 and argue that Hanesbrands stock is cheap given its growth. Its active-wear product lines, in particular, are growing over 10% annually.Near $16 per share, Hanesbrands stock is trading at about 9 times earnings. HBI stock has a nice 3.8% dividend yield, which is over twice the market average. Its payout ratio (dividends/earnings) is only 34% of earnings, which is below the market average.  * 7 Top-Notch REITs to Buy for Income Hanesbrands stock has grown its dividend nicely at 36% over the past five years. This looks to be a good long-term holding for investors over the next five years. Hanmi Financial (HAFC)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.3%5-Year Dividend Growth: 47%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 13.1Payout Ratio: 69.2%Hanmi Financial (NASDAQ:HAFC) stock is a relatively cheap Los Angeles-based bank with 39 full-service branches and nine loan offices in a number of states. It has specialized in serving the Korean-American community in the United States.Hanmi Financial's market capitalization is $580.5 million. Dividends have grown very healthily over the past five years.HAFC has been growing earnings consistently since 2014 when it made $50 million in net income. This year analysts expect the bank to make $63 million. As a result, the dividends per share have grown 47% over that period, from 28 cents per share to 96 cents per share this year.At 1 times book value and 13 times earnings, the stock is still reasonably cheap. Given its consistent earnings and dividend growth rates, Hanmi stock looks to be a good long-term holding for patient investors. Heritage Commerce (HTBK)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.2%5-Year Dividend Growth: 49%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 11.5Payout Ratio: 48.2%Heritage Commerce (NASDAQ:HTBK) is a California-based bank with 14 branches in the southern and eastern regions of the San Francisco metropolitan area. HTBK's market cap is $700 million. Heritage has had consistent earnings and dividend growth. It is a commercial bank providing loans mainly to corporations.HTBK stock offers a high 4.2% dividend yield, a low 11.5 P/E and a dividend that has grown 49% in the past five years.Heritage agreed to a merger in May 2019, but it was really an acquisition by Heritage. At the time HTBK acquired Presidio Bank, an underperforming bank. The merger received approvals from regulatory authorities and will close in the fourth quarter.The company was originally formed as a merger. I expect Heritage's management will continue to make acquisitions and mergers to grow its asset and deposit base. Over the long term, Heritage stock should continue to do quite well.As of this writing, Mark Hake did not hold any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-05,"While lacking the momentum seen a week ago, stocks continue to a good job holding up near all-time highs. That led to a somewhat choppy trading environment on Tuesday, as we look at a few top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Shake Shack (SHAK)Man, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) was hammered relentlessly on Tuesday, falling about 20% after a disappointing outlook. Investors could have made a better stand, but the weakness shows that the bears are in control at the moment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHad the bulls seized control, SHAK would have reclaimed then maintained the 200-day moving average. Instead, it gapped below this mark, rallied up to it and pulled back again.  * 7 Earnings Losers That Were Hit Hard This Season What now? Notice how SHAK is sandwiched between the 50% and 38.2% retracements. A break of either could create a &quot;go with&quot; trade in that direction. Meaning a break below the 38.2% retracement could trigger more selling, while a breakout over the 50% retracement could trigger a rally.Keep it simple, although below the 200-day moving average is not bullish. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is finally back in favor, as the stock had been trading in a wedge (blue lines) for several quarters at this point. Investors have been waiting for a move one way or the other, and last month, it looked like that move was going to be lower.AVGO stock is a tough one. It's technically becoming overbought and is running into resistance between $315 and $318.However, the U.S. government will likely allow U.S. companies to start selling to Huawei again, while AVGO has a below-market multiple and strong cash flows. Further, it just embarked on a multi-month breakout!It's difficult to buy into Broadcom at this point given the big rally, looming resistance and potential &quot;sell the news&quot; setup. I am a buyer of AVGO stock on a pullback to the $300 to $305 area, assuming it holds as support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Lyft (LYFT)There are many eyes on Uber (NYSE:UBER) as it makes new 52-week lows after earnings. But what about Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock?The stock does not look healthy. It couldn't reclaim the 50-day moving average or hold up above $44. A break below $41.50 quickly puts $40 on the table. Below that and the $38 lows are possible.If it's anything like Uber, it may not be long before Lyft is making new lows too. Let's keep an eye on this one, because not making new lows on this breakdown would be notable too. However, for bulls to really gain momentum, LYFT needs to clear and hold the 50-day. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Nio (NIO)Nio (NYSE:NIO) exploded higher by more than 30% after its partnership with Mobileye, a unit of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).Even though the percentage gain is impressive, shares could be running into a roadblock. While a short squeeze could continue to push Nio higher, keep in mind that shares are now running into the 50-day moving average and beginning to fill the gap from September.Clearing the $2.40 to $2.60 will likely be difficult too. If it does, Nio can fill the gap up toward $2.75.If resistance holds, see that $1.80 holds on a pullback. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Hertz (HTZ)Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) is feeling some relief, as it rallies on earnings. If shares can clear the 50-week moving average, they can rally up to the 100-week moving average at $17.20. That's also where HTZ will run into downtrend resistance.Should the 50-week moving average hold as resistance, I want to see $14 hold on a pullback. Below that level is bad news for bulls.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AVGO.

2019-11-22,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been on the mend lately, rallying to new 2019 highs. The price action has been mixed since the company reported its earnings on Nov. 14. Initially, it looked like Nvidia stock was going to pull back after the results. It's held up since then, though, and it's got investors wondering what could be next.Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.com Will Nvidia stock push through resistance and move higher now? The charts appear to suggest that NVDA is poised to rally further. The only thing that could seriously derail NVDA is a worsening trade-war situation and/or a stock market decline.As the third quarter of 2018 was coming to a close, Nvidia stock was looking to push through $300. The bulls -- riding a multi-year rally of hundreds of percent -- were looking for even more gains. By the end of Q4, the stock had suffered a peak-to-trough decline in excess of 50%. It was one of the most brutal unwinds I've seen in a high-quality stock in quite some time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCaught up in the crypto mess, Nvidia's revenue, earnings and margins still haven't fully recovered. But analysts' average forward estimates now predict year-over-year growth, not declines. That's got investors feeling bullish, a sentiment that shows on the charts.Let's take a look. Trading Nvidia Stock  Click to EnlargeLast month, amid a resurgence by the semiconductor space, NVDA stock burst through its prior 2019 highs near $193. Since then, it's been consolidating in a tight zone between $205 and $212, riding its 20-day moving average higher.When Nvidia reported its earnings, NVDA stock began to slip lower. It temporarily broke below the 20-day moving average and approached $200. In all honesty, it looked like it would not reach the 20-day. However, Nvidia stock snapped higher and closed above the 20-day, before making new highs the next day.  * 7 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence to Outperform the Market We don't have the green light just yet, as resistance continues to hold NVDA stock in check. But that snap-back action was impressive. For Nvidia stock to move meaningfully higher,  the 20-day moving average has to continue acting as support and move over the current 52-week high, which is now near $215.The rest of the space has been surging to new highs. That includes Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and others. So why isn't Nvidia?As you can see on the chart below, Nvidia stock still has a ways to go before hitting its prior highs.  Click to EnlargeThat nasty gap down in November 2018 took a long time to recover from. After rallying from that point, Nvidia stock looks much healthier. Going forward, let's see if NVDA stock can now fill its October 2018 gap near $228. That's also near where the 38.2% retracement comes into play from the October 2018 high to the December low.If NVDA climbs above $228, $250 is possible.Remember to take it one step at a time. If NVDA's current support fails, look for the former highs between $190 and $193, as well as the 50-day moving average, to support NVDA stock. If it moves above the resistance level, $220-plus is possible. Valuing NVDA StockHere's the bad news for Nvidia: its sales and earnings are still dropping as the crypto overhang has been brutal. It sucked all of the momentum out of NVDA stock, decimating sentiment towards it.On average, analysts are calling for an 8% decline in revenue this year, along with a 16% year-over-year decline in earnings. Oof. That's a tough pill to swallow.But here's the good news: Analysts, on average,  predict a return to robust growth in 2020. The company has already reported its results for the first three quarters of the year, with just one left to go. As readers know, the stock market is a forward-looking mechanism. It prices securities based on what they are expected to do, not based on what they have done.While the average estimates call for NVDA's revenue to grow 19% and its earnings to jump roughly 30% in 2020, the return to growth is more important than the amount of the growth itself, if that makes sense. The fact that NVDA has put the worst behind it matters more than if it grows earnings 24% or 30% in the coming year.Remember, Nvidia will play a big role in non-cyclical tech growth. A year of pain from the crypto fallout won't change that.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-11-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. is seeking buyers for its connected home division, a unit that makes chips used in home internet access gear, according to people familiar with the matter.The chipmaker has hired a financial adviser and is seeking to sell the unit that has annual sales of about $450 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.A representative for the Santa Clara, California-based company declined to comment.Intel Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan has said he’s looking at the company’s operations and will explore options for areas where it isn’t competitive. The company sold its smartphone modem business to Apple Inc. in a $1 billion deal in July. Swan has pointed to the money-losing memory business as an area where he might look for a partnership.The connected home business makes semiconductors that provide wireless connections in home routers and gateways. It offers a range of chips that enable WiFi and manage data traffic for consumers. Competitors include Broadcom Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.Throughout its history, Intel has created units that push new enabling technologies as a way to further its central processor unit business.The connected home initiative is part of an attempt to make sure Intel’s computing chips find their way into the increasing number of smart gadgets being used in households. In its most recent quarter Intel’s Internet of Things group had sales of $1 billion, a gain of 9% from the same period a year earlier.To contact the reporters on this story: Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, ;Daniel Hauck at dhauck1@bloomberg.net, Michael Hytha, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Intel Seeks Buyers for Home Connectivity Chips Unit

2019-11-26,"With 5G right around the corner, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has been a name to watch. Investors have already started to bid up shares, with the stock reaching its 52-week high earlier this month. Thanks to an earnings beat and strong guidance for the fiscal first quarter, investors are confident the company has upside potential.Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com But at the current share price, is QCOM stock a screaming buy? Growth has been a challenge for Qualcomm these past few years. The company generated $26.5 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending September 2014. Sales fell as low as $22.3 billion in FY17, but have since rebounded to $24.3 billion for FY19.The company also has unresolved regulatory risks from the recent Federal Trade Commission decision. Qualcomm appealed the ruling, leaving the destiny of its licensing business in the hands of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A ruling in the FTC's favor could devastate Qualcomm's lucrative licensing business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Qualcomm Stock Beats on EarningsOn Nov. 6, QCOM released results for the year ending Sept. 30, 2019. For the fourth quarter, Qualcomm beat on earnings, reporting adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents, versus consensus of 71 cents. This earnings beat was thanks in part to the company's licensing segment. Licensing revenue went up due to the company winning its legal dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well as a new royalty agreement with Huawei.Total revenue for Q4 was $4.8 billion, in line with guidance. Looking to the next quarter, Qualcomm's guidance calls for similar revenue between $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion, as well as projected earnings between 80 cents and 90 cents a share. Analysts Mixed on 5G Catalyst for QCOM StockCurrent results are not the whole story with Qualcomm stock. The key catalyst for the company is the rollout of 5G anticipated to start in 2020. JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee projects Qualcomm's 5G revenue will accelerate starting next year. Chatterjee estimates 5G chip shipments to be 200 million in 2020, rising to 450 million by 2021. Given the complexities of 5G, these new chips will likely sell at higher prices than 4G chips.But not everyone is bullish on Qualcomm stock. Morgan Stanley's James Faucette recently downgraded the company. He does not dispute the growth opportunities in 5G, but he believes this catalyst is already priced into shares. Faucette believes there is a chance 5G does not win over the public as quickly as anticipated. 5G may be faster than 4G, but it comes at the cost of uneven performance and shorter battery life.If the switch over to 5G is slower than estimated, Qualcomm stock may not see a big boost in 2020. In addition, there are concerns of the viability of Qualcomm's cash cow, its QTL licensing business. Qualcomm makes mobile chips, but earns most of its money charging royalties to manufacturers who utilize its chips in their phones.The FTC has gone after Qualcomm for anti-competitive practices, particularly the company's &quot;no license, no chips&quot; policy. A federal court ruled in favor of the FTC, but Qualcomm has won a reprieve, allowing it to repeal the decision.Luckily for Qualcomm, the company has the Department of Justice, Department of Defense and the Department of Energy on its side. These other federal agencies believe the FTC's ruling could impact America's national security and technological advantages. Hearings for the appeal begin in February, with a ruling expected later in 2020. Risks Impact ValuationThe possible destruction of QTL could devastate Qualcomm's profitability. But despite these risks, QCOM stock does not exactly trade at a bargain-basement valuation. Qualcomm's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 29 and its trailing enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is 10.7.This makes Qualcomm stock cheaper than peers like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom trades at 56.3 times forward earnings and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.5. But Qualcomm trades at higher multiples than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which trades at 13.5 times forward earnings and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.5.What does this mean? Qualcomm stock could see significant multiple expansion if it wins the case. But predicting the outcome of a court decision does not make the best rationale for a buy. In this scenario, it may be best to stay on the sidelines. Bottom Line: Don't Rush into QCOM StockQualcomm stock could win big with 5G. But don't rush out and buy shares today. Until the regulatory threat to the licensing business is resolved, the fate of the company's cash cow is in the Ninth Circuit's court (no pun intended).The revenue growth effects of 5G may take some time. Analysts anticipate the 5G-driven revenue boost will not happen until FY2021. Consensus calls for $22 billion in FY20 revenue, with $27 billion the following year.What does this mean? Take your time, and tread carefully, with QCOM stock.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-10,"We are less than a month away from the end of 2019, and that means we are less than a month away from the end of the 2010s decade.Looking back on it, the 2010s has been a spectacular decade for stocks. The S&P 500 roared 180% higher during the decade, and did so with relatively muted volatility (there were only three drops in the S&P 500 of 15% or more during the decade, and only one drop of 20%, which happened in late 2018). In other words, we were basically in a bull market for the entire decade. That's pretty rare.Also of note, this was the decade where tech stocks became market leaders. Long story short, technology started taking over the world in the early 2010s, and has continued to expand its reach across the global economy into the late 2010s. As this has happened, tech stocks earned the lion's share of revenue and profit growth during the decade, and consequently turned into the market's best performing stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:RYT) rose 315% during the decade -- a 135 point outperformance of the broader market.  * 10 Best-Performing Growth Stocks of the 2010s Perhaps even more impressively, there were five S&P 500 tech stocks that roared higher by 1,000% or more during the decade. Will they keep rising into the 2020s?Let's answer that question, and more, by taking a deep look at the decade's five hottest tech stocks. Top Tech Stocks of the Decade: Netflix (NFLX)Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 31, 2009: $7.87Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 9, 2019: $302.50Percent Return: 3,744%The top tech stock in the S&P 500 in the 2010s was streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). In a nutshell, Netflix pioneered the era of streaming television in the early 2010s. Over the next several years, consumers started to realize both the financial and convenience benefits of streaming TV. As they did, they all subscribed to Netflix, which had become the best platform in the streaming TV world without much competition.Big subscription growth powered big revenue growth. Adding to that revenue growth, Netflix hiked prices throughout the decade without much churn. Those price hikes helped push profit margins higher. Big picture, then, Netflix leveraged secular streaming TV adoption tailwinds to power huge revenue and profit growth in the 2010s, the sum of which drove a near 4,000% gain in NFLX stock.Will the strong gains continue? I think so, but at a more tepid rate. Competition concerns surrounding Netflix are overstated. Netflix's unparalleled size and data gives it an enduring competitive advantage when it comes to producing original content. So long as it maintains that advantage, current subscriptions won't quit, and new subscribers will keep joining. Revenues, margins and profits will march higher. So will NFLX stock. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 31, 2009: $15.34Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 9, 2019: $314.38Percent Return: 1,949%The 2010s comprised a golden era for the semiconductor industry. That golden era ultimately turned one of the semiconductor industry's biggest companies -- Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) -- into one of the market's best performing tech stocks of the decade.Long story short, technology took over the world in 2010. The internet spread everywhere. Smartphones became the norm. Smart devices -- like tablets, smartwatches and smart appliances -- started to gain mainstream traction. Enterprises became increasingly technology-oriented. Shopping went digital. Entertainment consumption went digital. The video game industry boomed.Because of all these trends, the semiconductor market soared throughout the 2010s. This created a rising tide which lifted pretty much every major semiconductor company. The biggest winner of them all? Broadcom. That's because, through a series of acquisitions, Broadcom's reach throughout the semiconductor industry expanded tremendously throughout the 2010s. Importantly, because the whole market was booming, all exposure was good exposure, so the more Broadcom expanded, the higher revenues, profits and the stock price went.  * 7 Energy Stocks That Are Still Worth Buying In 2020 Will this &quot;boom&quot; repeat in the 2020s for AVGO stock? Yes. This whole &quot;technology taking over the world&quot; trend isn't going to slow in the 2020s. It will only accelerate, with self-driving vehicles, automation, artificial intelligence and 5G. Meanwhile, global trade tensions should improve into the 2020s. Broadcom likely won't extend its reach much further into this space, but even without the expansion tailwind, there is enough firepower here to keep AVGO stock on an upward path through the next decade. Amazon (AMZN)Source: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.com Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 31, 2009: $134.52Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 9, 2019: $1,749.51Percent Return: 1,201%The third top tech stock of the 2010s was e-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Early in the decade, Amazon leveraged first-mover's advantage in the secular growth e-commerce market to go from a relative nobody in the retail world, to one of the world's largest retailers. Then, in the second part of the decade, Amazon focused on building out a huge cloud infrastructure business that has become the backbone of the global enterprise cloud. At the same time, Amazon started populating its ecosystem with ads, and has also turned into a huge digital advertising company.In other words, during the 2010s, Amazon became a leader in three very big, very quickly growing markets: e-commerce, cloud and digital ads. In so doing, the company sustained huge revenue growth throughout the decade. Importantly, the cloud and digital ad businesses operate at much higher margins than the e-commerce business. So, as cloud and digital ad revenues grew in the back-half of the 2010s, Amazon's profit margins meaningfully expanded, and that in turn powered huge profit growth. As those profits surged higher, so did AMZN stock.Can all this continue in the 2020s? Sure. But, I'd be careful. Amazon is losing its competitive advantages in the e-commerce and cloud worlds. That is, traditional retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) have caught up to Amazon in e-commerce, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be rapidly chipping away at Amazon's lead in cloud infrastructure. So long as these competitive headwinds remain, Amazon stock may struggle for gains. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)Source: Thomas Pajot / Shutterstock.com Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 31, 2009: $10.05Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 9, 2019: $120.06Percent Return: 1,095%Flying under the radar throughout the decade has been video game publisher Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO). The video game industry grew by leaps and bounds in the 2010s thanks to a few things. First, you had player growth as the market gained international traction. Second, you had engagement growth, as consumers spent more and more of their free time playing video games. Third, you had revenue growth, as video game publishers started to incorporate various in-game transactions. Fourth, you had addressable market expansion, as eSports became a thing and started to grow into its own.Take-Two was at the forefront of all that growth. It owns arguably the video game world's best content portfolio, which comprises some of the most-played video games in the world. At the same time, it has figured out how to seamlessly and efficiently incorporate microtransactions into those widely played video games. And, it has capitalized on the eSports trend by incorporating live competition modes into many of its titles.Consequently, Take-Two's revenues, profits and stock price all soared during the 2010s. The 2020s should be more of the same. Consumer video game engagement is only going up, thanks to global digitization trends. Meanwhile, eSports appears to be only scratching the surface of its long-term potential. Take-Two is at the epicenter of both of those growth markets. At the same time, Take-Two should get a big boost in the early 2020s from the advent of cloud gaming and the release of new-generation PlayStation and Xbox video game consoles.  * 7 Entertainment Stocks to Buy to Escape Holiday Blues The company should sustain big growth over the next decade, and TTWO stock should rally alongside that big growth. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 31, 2009: $17.20Adjusted Closing Price Dec. 9, 2019: $212.17Percent Return: 1,133%During the 2010s, graphics processing unit maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) went from being relative unknown in the tech space to the face of the world's next generation of technology products. That is, Nvidia is the maker of the chips which power various next-gen technologies, including self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, automation, connected devices and data centers. These chips had relatively small demand at the start of the decade. Exiting this decade, however, demand is huge and still growing at a rapid rate.This transition from relatively muted growth to big growth has driven huge gains in Nvidia's financials. Revenues have skyrocketed. Gross margins have improved with booming demand. Expense rates have dropped meaningfully with scale. Profits have roared higher on the back of big revenue growth and margin improvements. As those profits have roared higher, so has NVDA stock.The good news is that all of this will continue in the 2020s. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs isn't going to drop anytime soon. If anything, it'll pick up, as the world becomes more tech-centric and companies pour more money into automation, data and AI investments. Nvidia also has very little competition in this GPU space, so the likelihood that a competitor knocks it off course is very low. Revenues will therefore continue to grow at a steady pace. Profit margins will continue to improve with scale. Profits and NVDA stock will keep rising.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NFLX, WMT and MSFT.

2019-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. has started supplying switch chips to major data-center operators, including Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc., opening up a new avenue to win orders from some of its largest networking-equipment customers.Cisco Silicon 1 is a switch semiconductor that’s already being used by Microsoft and Facebook in crucial networking equipment, the companies said Wednesday at an event in San Francisco. San Jose, California-based Cisco is now offering the chips, which it says are the fastest in the industry, to all of its customers, regardless of whether they buy its networking machinery. Previously Cisco’s chips were only available as components of its machines.The shift toward standalone chip sales is another departure from the business model that made Cisco one of the biggest companies in the technology industry. Cisco’s expensive proprietary combinations of hardware and software make up the backbone of much of the internet and corporate networks, and these products generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. The new initiative has the potential to attract business from customers who want to build their own machines instead of buying whole packages. It also puts Cisco in direct competition with its suppliers, Intel Corp. and Broadcom Inc., which also make switch chips that the networking equipment maker uses in some of its products.“From today -- and this is something that some of you never thought we’d do -- some of our customers will buy our silicon and build their own products if that’s what they choose to do,” Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said at the event. “We really want our customers to consume this technology in any way they want.”As the internet infrastructure business moves away from suppliers who provide all the needs through locked-down combinations of hardware and software, Robbins has been pushing Cisco to adapt by becoming a bigger supplier of networking services and software. On his watch, software has risen to provide about 11% of revenue. Hardware still generates more than half of sales.Cisco shares rose less than 1% to $44.24 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. The stock gained 1.8% this year through Tuesday’s close.The move into selling components is an attempt to win orders from the hyperscalers, such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, a group that has increasingly turned away from Cisco’s offerings and equipped their data centers with computers and networking gear designed in house. Those big cloud-computing vendors contribute as little as 2% of Cisco’s total sales, according to Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold.Switch chips perform the crucial function of deciding where packets of data should go in a network of computers. They are designed to handle that task at great speed, and only a few companies have been successful in the market. Broadcom is the biggest provider of this type of chip as an individual component and has as much as 80% share, Leopold said. Intel took a bigger interest in the market in June when it bought startup Barefoot Networks.Cisco’s new offering will combine the attributes of both switch and routing chips, the company said. It’ll be able to move data very quickly and still be programmable, carrying the ability to have its function changed. Routing, directing traffic among networks, is typically conducted by groups of chips that bring other attributes but are unable to direct data fast enough for modern internet traffic loads. One chip providing all of the functions will simplify the operation of networks by eliminating the need for different layers of software, Cisco executives said.Offering up what was previously guarded as a proprietary advantage shows a flexibility at Cisco that has been increasing as Robbins works to transform the company. Analysts predict the build-it-yourself approach to networking, pioneered by the large cloud-service operators, over time will be copied by companies looking to reduce the cost of their data-center spending. That corporate market is one of Cisco’s biggest sources of revenue.Cisco’s equipment, including its chips, is designed by the company and manufactured by a third party, which it hasn’t identified.The company also announced a new router machine at the event, designed to better serve as the backbone for new fifth generation, or 5G, cellular networks. The Cisco 8000 will be based on the new chip. The company also unveiled plans for products that will support faster data transmission speeds over fiber-optic cables. Like the rest of the networking industry, Cisco is positioning itself to be a main provider of equipment for the predicted surge in internet traffic and data created by the proliferation of mobile systems.(Updates with comment from Cisco CEO in the fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Cisco Enters Chip Market, Supplying Microsoft, Facebook"

2019-12-12,Broadcom expects fiscal 2020 to be a good year for networking and RF chip sales. But it forecasts a major drop in its &quot;mixed-signal custom&quot; wireless chip sales to Apple.,Broadcom's Guidance Is Stronger in Some Spots Than Others
2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. gave an annual sales forecast that signaled optimism that the chip industry has weathered the worst of the China-U.S. trade war, but shares dropped after the company said some units are losing orders, raising concerns about overall growth.Sales in fiscal 2020, which ends next November, will be $25 billion, plus or minus $500 million, the company said Thursday in a statement. That projection includes revenue from its purchase of a Symantec Corp. unit, and was in line with or better than estimates from some analysts who had also factored in that new division’s contribution.On a conference call with analysts, executives said Broadcom lost business from a big smartphone customer in one product area and warned that Wi-Fi chip sales will decline next year. The stock, which had gained on the initial report, slipped more than 2% in extended trading following the detailed outlook.Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan has built the company into one of the biggest in the semiconductor business through a string of acquisitions, and is now expanding into software. That gives Broadcom one of the widest reaches in technology, with clients including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in smartphones and some of the top data-center operators for networking components. The evaporation of some business from one of those big phone makers will hold back revenue gains, and the company will tightly control its investment in wireless and industrial chips, Tan said on the call.Apple is one of Broadcom’s largest customers for smartphone components, and earlier this year the two companies struck a deal to supply Apple’s products with radio frequency, or RF, chips for the next two years. Broadcom has also long supplied Apple with Wi-Fi components. But a wireless-charging component used in Apple’s iPhone for a few years from Broadcom was replaced in newer models by a part from STMicroelectronics NV, according to breakdowns of the handset’s parts by iFixit and others. That may be the lost business Broadcom disclosed.The company is targeting total semiconductor sales of $18 billion in 2020, Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause said on the call. The company’s core business -- chips used in networking, broadband and storage systems -- will grow about 7% to around $12 billion, he said. Wi-Fi chip revenue will decline from a total of $2.2 billion and mixed-signal chip revenue will drop by half to less than $500 million, he projected. The company is predicting enterprise software sales will rise to about $7 billion. Symantec revenue will grow from a base of around $1.8 billion, he said.Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which ended Nov. 3, rose 6.1% to $5.78 billion, the San Jose, California-based company said. Before certain items, profit was $5.39 a share. That compares with average analyst estimates for per-share profit of $5.38 on sales of $5.73 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Broadcom’s market value has swelled to $130 billion following Tan’s spree of deals, including his purchase of Symantec’s enterprise security business for $10.7 billion last month. A big chunk of the company’s products are used in China or sent through factories there on the way to becoming part of electronic devices sold around the world. Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese equipment maker that has been called a security threat and was cut off from U.S. suppliers by the Trump administration, previously spent hundreds of millions of dollars a year on Broadcom chips.Tan, who has been among the most vocal chip-industry leaders in calling out the impact of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, trimmed Broadcom’s revenue forecast earlier this year, shaving $2 billion from his original projections, citing declining orders amid the trade dispute. That’s made Broadcom’s stock a laggard. Its 29% gain this year compares with a 56% advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.(Updates with details of unit performance predictions starting in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Mark Gurman.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Gives Upbeat Forecast; Order Losses Hit Shares

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- After a year in which semiconductor stocks defied conventional wisdom with a seemingly unstoppable rally in the face of gloomy fundamentals, analysts are loathe to go all in.With signs of a rebound in demand still scant, the key question for the new year is where chipmaker shares can go when they’re trading at the highest price to future earnings multiples in nearly a decade. Most analysts expect business to improve in 2020, aided by things like 5G technology and cloud infrastructure spending. But valuations are cause for concern, especially when accounting for lingering tariff uncertainty.“It is challenging to argue that a good amount of the future return potential hasn’t simply been pulled forward on hope,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.At the end of 2018, most of Wall Street saw little to get excited about in the semiconductor industry. Chipmakers had begun axing forecasts as customer orders slowed and inventories swelled as the U.S.-China trade war heated up. Despite all of that, the Philadelphia semiconductor index embarked on a relentless advance, logging just two down months the entire year.The gauge that tracks 30 semiconductor-related stocks has risen 56% so far in 2019, which would be the biggest annual gain in a decade. That eye-popping number was aided by a brutal market sell-off at the end of 2018 that hit technology stocks particularly hard. Chip shares notched new highs Thursday after President Trump said the U.S. and China are “very close” to a “big” trade deal.To keep the rally going, semiconductor companies will need to start posting better-than-expected financial results, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, who was one of the first analysts on Wall Street to get cautious on the group in the second half of 2018. Moore now advocates holding a select group of stocks including Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp., which he expects to benefit from higher cloud spending in 2020.“The period where stocks are going to go up on bad numbers is largely behind us,” he said in an interview. “If the numbers come up, then we can have some good performance. I don’t think there’s room for these multiples to come up too much more.”In that regard, the third quarter was a good start. With results in from all members of the chip benchmark except for Broadcom Inc., more than three-quarters of companies beat profit and revenue estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Still other indicators are worrisome. Inventory levels for many chipmakers remain elevated, according to Moore, and tariffs haven’t been resolved. U.S. goods on some electronics imported from China are set to increase on Dec. 15 if there’s no trade deal.Despite the trade uncertainty, 2020 is “looking decent” from a fundamental standpoint, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anand Srinivasan. He expects cloud spending to improve, 5G spending to kick in, and stability in mobile devices and personal computers.“The growth themes that we have been positing are going to be manifested in 2020, particularly in the second half,” he said. “We think it still could be a bumpy ride from a stock perspective but we feel optimistic about 2020.”See AlsoSoftware Analysts See More Volatility in an Uncertain 2020Airbus Secures Lead Over Boeing as 737 Max Weighs Into 2020After ‘Blood-Spilled’ Year, Pot Firms Brace for Repeat in 2020Small-Caps Set to Retake 2020 Market Lead After Three-Year LagS&P 500 Melt-Up Is So Hot It’s Making Cheerleaders Into Skeptics(Updates shares and Trump comments in fifth paragraph, adds P/E chart.)&#92;--With assistance from Lu Wang.To contact the reporter on this story: Jeran Wittenstein in San Francisco at jwittenstei1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Jennifer Bissell-LinskFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Chip Analysts Struggle to Get Excited About 2020 After Rally

2019-12-20,"(Bloomberg) -- High-growth companies stand poised to continue a rush into convertible and other equity-linked securities, suggesting some strain in the stock market.Broadcom Inc., Akamai Technologies Inc., Snap Inc. and Tesla Inc. all tapped the niche corner of capital-raising in 2019, inking deals over $1 billion in an attempt to secure attractive terms while the market at all-time highs still allowed for it.Equity-linked volume, which include convertible, mandatory and preferred issues, climbed for the second consecutive year, hitting a post-financial crisis record of more than $55 billion. Bankers say the 2020 haul could be just as cushy, though the election could make for an off-kilter year.“We may set another record, but there won’t be a massive uptick in issuance,” said Steven Halperin, Barclays head of Americas equity-linked and hybrid solutions. And that’s assuming rates don’t move and the stock market continues to do what it has, stay at highs or at least near them, as predicted by Barclays Research.High-growth companies with speculative credit profiles in technology, communications and health care have dominated the convertible landscape as investment-grade companies have sought relatively better financing options elsewhere in an era of low interest rates.From 2000 to 2004, investment-grade deals accounted for nearly half of issuance volume, but have since dwindled to just 5% of total volumes between 2015 and 2019, according to JPMorgan.In the past two years, over 80% of convertible issuance came from unrated companies, 12% from junk-rated issuers, and the balance from investment grade, according to Barclays. Halperin sees 2020 activity resembling this year’s, with growth of around 10%.Growth companies appear to have invoked the old adage -- raise money when you can, not when you need. Terms have enticed them, with sub-1% coupons and 35% conversion premiums, the amount the stock needs to climb for an embedded option to come into play.“Many companies didn’t need the money, but wanted to be potential acquirers should rivals falter,” Osterweis Capital Management Portfolio Manager Craig Manchuck said. It’s an attractive deal when stocks are sitting pretty.Companies had motivation, citing “general corporate purposes,” said RBC Capital Markets’ Suvir Thadani. “They’re in effect saying: I have a cash balance, but I don’t know what the future holds, so let me raise more capital.”Like the stock market, price performance has been strong in 2019, with both major convertible indexes on the upswing. The Bloomberg Barclays US Convertible Composite and the ICE BofAML US Convertible index rose 22% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 Growth index’s 28% gain.Glass First-Half FullLooking ahead, election years have not favored convertibles.Equity-linked issuance shrank to post-crisis lows in 2012 and 2016 with $25 billion and $35 billion in volumes, respectively.The momentum behind equity-linked products and the looming election could make for a manic year. Some expect the second half of the year to be turbulent, said Santosh Sreenivasan, JPMorgan’s head of equity-linked products.That fear, and perhaps the urgency to raise capital before a potential drop-off, could result in a first-half surge. Sreenivasan expects recent momentum behind convertibles to continue through the first half at least. Osterweis’ Manchuck echoed Sreenivasan. The companies that want or need the capital are likely going to want to tap the market before investor reticence kicks in, he said.“My hunch is that tech will continue to be active, the way the Nasdaq has been performing. If tech valuations continue to be high that sector will dominate in 2020,” he said. Repeat issuance, which accounted for 58% of deals in 2019 could also drive convertible volumes, Sreenivasan said.Meanwhile, a slight correction won’t necessarily derail convertible activity, Credit Suisse’s head of Americas equity-linked origination Steven Winnert said.“Stocks don’t need to be up another 25% next year. There will be a reasonably active convertible market even if stocks are flat to down,” he said.However, if companies see their stock tank 25%, as some did during the 2018 stock market rout, deals could dry up.For more 2020 stocks outlooks, see:Beyond Meat Investors Should Expect Less Crazy Gains in 2020 Analyst Who Called WeWork Debacle Sees Risks in Direct ListingsBiotech Analysts See Deals, Drug Data Carrying 2020 PerformanceElection Year Once Again Rekindles Hope for Infrastructure PushChip Analysts Struggle to Get Excited About 2020 After RallyEnergy Stock Carnage Sets Up ‘Rinse and Repeat’ Start to 2020Software Analysts See More Volatility in an Uncertain 2020Facebook and Google Face ‘Supercharged’ Regulatory Risk in 2020Airbus Secures Lead Over Boeing as 737 Max Weighs Into 2020Strategists Butt Heads on Materials Stocks as Trade War Drags OnAfter ‘Blood-Spilled’ Year, Pot Firms Brace for Repeat in 2020Small-Caps Set to Retake 2020 Market Lead After Three-Year LagS&P 500 Melt-Up Is So Hot It’s Making Cheerleaders Into SkepticsTo contact the reporter on this story: Crystal Kim in New York at ckim426@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Chris Nagi, Jennifer Bissell-LinskFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Convertibles to Ride Market Highs With Half an Eye on Politics

From downloading 4K movies on our smartphones in seconds, to remote surgery aided by VR headsets, to cars being able to talk to each other - all will reap the benefits of 5G networks.As with any new technology, it can be hard at first to imagine the changes it will bring. Market incentives are sure to play their part in accelerating adoption and driving innovations that most aren’t able to fathom yet. Therefore, well positioned companies are set to make the most of the opportunity the new technology affords.With the information about the lightning fast technology in hand, then, we opened TipRanks’ Stock Screener to get the scoop on 3 companies ready for the oncoming 5G onslaught. Coincidentally, right now, all 3 have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street. Let’s take a closer look.Broadcom (AVGO)As a developer and designer of semiconductor products, Broadcom is ideally positioned to benefit from the roll out of 5G networks. Apart from a core business which includes serving data centers, wired infrastructure and enterprise storage systems, Broadcom’s smartphone clients include Apple and Samsung. With Apple expected to launch a 5G-enabled phone in 2020, naturally, the semiconductor manufacturer stands to benefit.As one of the decade’s best market performers, Broadcom’s 2019 has landed just shy of the S&P 500’s performance, adding over 25% to its share price. The company’s latest earnings report was in line with Street expectations, too. Strong quarter-over-quarter growth in its wireless sector and year-over-year growth in other segments both contributed to solid revenues of $5.78 billion, alongside EPS of $5.39.RBC’s Mitch Steves thinks Broadcom is “an attractive asset.” The 5-star analyst highlights the company’s “potential for multiple expansion” and believes long-term EPS can easily grow into double digits.“We see M&A integration, stock buybacks, and margin expansion driving EPS growth. We see the Symantec integration and margin expansion driving EPS upside in 2020/2021. On an annual basis, we see stable to slightly positive revenue trajectories for AVGO’s key businesses,” Steves said.To this end, the 5-star analyst reiterated a Outperform on AVGO, alongside a price target of $360, indicating upside potential of 13%. (To watch Steves’ track record, click here)A flurry of analysts have recently been reiterating Buy ratings on this tech giant. Put together, the rest of the Street appears to be reading from the same hymn sheet as Steves. A Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 16 Buys and 4 Holds. The average price target almost matches Steves’ to a T, coming in at $359.29, and implying 12% upside. (See Broadcom stock analysis on TipRanks) T-Mobile US (TMUS)One of the companies already benefitting from 5G technology is communications giant T Mobile. The wireless network operator recently launched a nationwide 5G network that according to the company, already provides coverage to 200 million people in 5,000 cities and across rural areas. The large swathes of coverage can be enabled due to the network’s low-band spectrum, which isn’t as fast as other 5G millimeter wave-based networks. Nevertheless, the newly launched network also works indoors, a feat not possible so far, to a meaningful extent, with millimeter wave-based 5G counterparts.A problem still facing 5G networks is the relative lack of 5G smartphones. Of course, this is all set to change as the new decade kicks into gear, and T-Mobile stands to benefit from the technology’s widespread adoption.RBC’s Jonathan Atkin thinks so, too. The 5-star analyst expects T-Mobile to “outperform its peers based on favorable risk/reward characteristics” and believes “uncarrier initiatives have positioned T-Mobile as the ‘customer-friendly carrier’, attracting millennials.” Atkin also notes that, “Faster-than-anticipated postpaid growth could lead to greater out-year cash flow growth.”“We expect continued subscriber momentum and churn improvement on the back of greater enterprise/SMB/public-sector penetration, network improvement, and retail expansion,” the analyst concluded.The 5G rollout has the analyst betting on T-Mobile. Atkin reiterated an Outperform rating on the telecom leader, while also bumping up the price target from $87 to $94. If attained, investors could be lining their pockets with gains of 21% in the new year. (To watch Atkin’s track record, click here)And where does the Street’s coverage of T-Mobile extend to? As it happens, to a Strong Buy consensus rating, formed of 9 Buys and 2 Holds. An average price target of $92.90 indicates upside potential of 20% over the next 12 months. (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks) Keysight Technologies (KEYS)As the name implies, Keysight unlocks &quot;critical or key insights”. The electronic measurement leader has outrun the market in 2019 and is up by over 67% year-to-date. The company has consistently outperformed financial targets, including core revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin. In the last three quarters, Keysight’s reported EPS has left estimates in the dust.Among the company’s arsenal of software and tools are 5G solutions. With 5G rollout in its initial phase, Keysight is already benefiting, with the company’s software order book increasing 19% year-over-year in 2019 to reach $853 million.Deutsche Bank’s Brian Yun thinks the company’s software is what separates Keysight from other test and measurement peers, due to the “depth of the software portfolio, design wins, industry partnerships.”The analyst said, “KEYS continues to execute in the midst of an uncertain macro backdrop and a dynamic competitive environment. We highlight ongoing robust long-term demand trends across KEYS' test and measurement end markets: 5G, 400G, IOT, connected cars, military modernization, etc. The company continues to win new customers and projects, which is driven by KEYS' competitively differentiated portfolio in these secular growth themes and operational excellence across product and end market segments.”Yun, therefore, kept his Buy rating on KEYS and raised his price target from $115 to $125, implying upside potential of 21%. (To watch Yun’s track record, click here)It looks like Yun’s upbeat take on the measurement solutions wiz is backed by the rest of the Street. With 6 Buys and a single Hold from the analysts over the last three months, the consensus is that Keysight is a Strong Buy. The average price target comes in a touch below Yun’s, at $122, indicating an increase of 18%, should the target be reached over the coming year.

2019-12-27,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) could again give investors a reason to pay attention to the networking giant. Cisco stock has not received as much attention by investors over the last few years amid the focus on cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and more trendy tech applications.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Now, investors may have a reason to take a second look at CSCO stock. As the internet makes the transition to 5G, CSCO could become again a more prominent name in tech as it returns to a leadership role in the industry. Will CSCO Return to Dot-Com-Era Prominence?About twenty years ago, Cisco stock helped to lead the dot-com boom. A run-up in the late 1990s led to the company briefly achieving the world's largest market cap in 2000, taking it to an all-time high of $82 per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, after the dot-com boom gave way to a bust, Cisco stock went on to lose more than 90% of its value and gained little traction after that drop. CSCO fell out of favor and out of the headlines as it transitioned from a growth stock to a more conservative investment. In 2011, it began a move from just above the $13 per share range to about $48 per share today.  * 10 Best Stocks to Beat the Market in 2020 Still, this bull trend has suffered some hiccups. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) entry into the networking business, as well as lower guidance caused the stock to slide in August. As its current price of about $47 per share, it trades at about 17% below its 52-week high.However, CSCO has still risen by about 14% for the year. Moreover, I think the new Cisco stock should draw more attention from more risk-averse investors. Despite competitive fears from Amazon and others, the company offers some advantages. It derives only about 3% of its revenue from China. Furthermore, it has heavier exposure to other emerging Asian markets such as India, which has not become a major target of tariffs. &quot;Internet of the Future&quot; Could Take CSCO Stock HigherFurthermore, CSCO stock could see a return to prominence due to 5G. Cisco has bet heavily on the internet of the future. Consequently, it just released its next-generation networking internet platform called Silicon One. How this competes against the likes of Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) or Broadcom (NYSE:AVGO) is not yet known. Still, it can support 5G, an essential attribute as many believe that increased 5G traffic could overwhelm current networks.Cisco stock also reflects the attributes of an equity that will attract risk-averse and income-oriented investors. This is a far cry from its heyday when Cisco scoffed at the idea of paying dividends. Today, it not only introduced a payout in 2011, but it also increased the dividend every year since. This year's annual payout of $1.40 per share takes the yield to just over 2.9%.Also, the company, once known for its elevated multiple, now trades at a forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of about 14.1. Earnings growth levels of 4.5% this year and 4.9% the next will probably not excite investors. However, analysts predict that profit increases will average 6.99% per year over the next five years. If this forecast holds or moves higher, it could take Cisco stock higher with it. The Bottom Line on Cisco StockCisco may return to a more prominent leadership role in the tech industry. The company has spent most of the last 20 years transitioning to a more conservative investment. As few paid attention, it spent most of the 2010s in a steady growth mode. Despite this move higher, it trades at only about 14.1-times forward earnings. Now, it could play a critical role in the coming years as its customers upgrade their networks to handle 5G-level traffic.Cisco stock does not come without risk. It fell during the late summer as Amazon entered the networking business. Moreover, it will still have to compete with Juniper, Broadcom, and other networking firms.However, 5G still presents an opportunity for more rapid growth. Also, investors can receive a payout at 2.9% and rising while they wait for the recovery. Although I do not expect the growth levels of the 1990s, today's Cisco stock looks more like a reasonably priced income and growth play.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2020-01-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Xerox Holdings Corp. has arranged a $24 billion loan with a group of banks as it continues a pursuit of HP Inc.It’s the largest-ever bridge loan in the technology sector, surpassing International Business Machines Corp.’s $20 billion facility in 2018 for its acquisition of Red Hat Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rankings exclude the $51.2 billion bridge loan, which was part of a larger $100 billion debt financing for the failed Broadcom Inc. takeover of Qualcomm Inc. The deal was blocked by President Donald Trump.The Xerox bridge is also the first jumbo acquisition financing to emerge in the investment-grade loan market this year, which will be welcome news to banks hoping for more merger activity in 2020 after the pipeline dwindled last year.Read more: U.S. investment grade loans set for strong 2020 despite slow M&ACitigroup Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have provided the debt commitment. It’s comprised of a $19.5 billion 364-day facility, which is expected to be syndicated, and a $4.5 billion 60-day facility intended to be replaced by cash on HP’s balance sheet, according to a filing.Companies typically replace bridge loans with bonds before a deal is completed.The debt pledge is intended “to remove any doubt” about Xerox’s ability to raise financing, according to a public letter sent on Monday from Xerox Chief Executive Officer John Visentin to HP’s board of directors.The letter referenced conversations with HP’s largest shareholders that revealed HP, based in Palo Alto, California, and its advisers had questioned Xerox’s ability to raise the money needed to finance the acquisition.A representative for Xerox declined to comment.Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox initially lined up financing from Citigroup in November, Bloomberg reported. But HP rejected the initial offer saying the price was too low. The computer company also declined Xerox’s request to open its financial books and questioned whether the smaller suitor could raise the funding.The $4.5 billion facility offers an initial margin of the London interbank offered rate plus 1.25%, while the opening pricing for the $19.5 billion facility is Libor plus 1.375%. Existing ratings are BB+ from S&P Global Ratings and Ba1 from Moody’s Investors Service.Xerox, known for making copier machines, became a fallen angel in 2018 after both S&P and Moody’s downgraded the company to high-yield amid challenges in the sector and falling revenue. Personal computer maker HP is rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB by S&P.Xerox last raised a $2.5 billion bridge loan in 2018 for its purchase of Japan’s Fujifilm with a margin of Libor plus 1.375%. It carried higher ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from S&P at the time.“Though Xerox’s assertion that the combined company is expected to have an investment grade credit rating may remain in question, funding should no longer be a concern following $24 billion in binding financing commitments,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Schiffman wrote on Monday.&#92;--With assistance from Lara Wieczezynski and Deana Kjuka.To contact the reporters on this story: Paula Seligson in New York at pseligson@bloomberg.net;Jacqueline Poh in London at jpoh39@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Natalie Harrison at nharrison73@bloomberg.net, Boris KorbyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Xerox Lines Up $24 Billion M&A Loan in Pursuit of Deal with HP

2020-01-08,"Dividends are a wonderful thing for investors. These profit-sharing payments from companies to stock owners provide a steady income stream which can be reinvested in the shares, diverted to other endeavors, or even just pocketed. Payments are usually small – sometimes just a few cents per share, and provide an incentive for investors to buy up more blocks of stock.Dividend stocks are even more attractive in today’s climate of low interest rate. The US Federal Reserve dropped its key rate three times in 2019, brining it down to just 1.75%. Bond yields are consequently low, in the neighborhood of 1.5% to 2.25%. For stock dividends, however, there is no set ceiling, and yields can grow as far as the paying company’s profits will allow.Swiss banking titan UBS is getting into the January stock recommendations with three interesting dividend picks -- each with a dividend yield exceeding 4%. Considering the average yield among S&P-listed companies is just about 2%, these picks will bring in more than double that return.&quot;We have used our quantitative models to find stocks which are high quality compared to their peers, which pay a dividend and are unlikely to cut it. We have chosen names to be representative of different regions and sectors. Finally, we asked our UBS sector analysts to further scrutinize each name,&quot; UBS noted.Running each equity through the Stock Screener tool at TipRanks, we’ve confirmed that UBS is in the majority on Wall Street in recommending these shares. Here’s what you need to know about them.Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Broadcom is a major player in the semiconductor industry. It was the world’s sixth largest chip maker in 2018, by sales, with revenues of $18.46 billion. The stock gained a solid 28% last year, matching the S&P 500’s gains, despite volatility during the year.The company reported fiscal Q4 earnings in December, and continued its strong performance. Revenues and EPS both beat the expectations. Revenues were also up year-over-year; at the top line, the $5.78 billion reported was well ahead of last year’s $5.44 billion and was up $260 million sequentially. EPS, at $5.39, was a half-percent ahead of the forecast.The key point for this article, however, is the dividend. AVGO raised its payment in December to $3.25 quarterly, or $13 per year. The yield, at 4.16%, is well ahead of the market average. Broadcom has a long history of reliable dividend payments, and in recent years has increased the payout substantially. In the last three years, the AVGO dividend has risen to its current rate from $1.02.Timothy Arcuri, 5-star analyst, wrote up UBS’ review of AVGO shares. He stated, “[With] hyperscaler demand coming back, we view AVGO's decision to invest in the higher margin data center bizz favourably… Ultimately we think the stock will re-rate higher on 5G, margin accretion from software exposure & higher dividends w/ the raise serving as another milestone on the path to ~$15 in dividends (2021), meaning even at our PT of $360, this works out to be &gt;4% yield.”Note that Arcuri sees AVGO’s dividend remaining at its current high-yield level. His stated price target, $360, indicates an upside for the stock of 15%. (To watch Arcuri’s track record, click here)Overall, Broadcom holds a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The rating is based on an impressive split of 16 Buys versus 5 Holds. Shares are not cheap, at $312, and they are likely to get even more expensive. The average price target, $359, suggests an upside of 14%. (See Broadcom’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Molson Coors Beverage (TAP)This giant of the brewing industry controls several household names familiar to beer drinkers everywhere – Coors and Molson, of course, but also Miller, Keystone, and, beloved of college students everywhere, Milwaukee’s Best. The company has a market cap of $11.8 billion, and saw total revenues of $10.77 billion in fiscal year 2018.While TAP stands on firm ground, and remains profitable, 2019 was a difficult year for the company. TAP is taking proactive moves toward reversing that trend, including partnering with Canadian cannabis producer HEXO to create marijuana-infused beverages. Combining an established beverage marketing and distribution network with a large cannabis grower offers a reasonable path for expansion.A sweetener for investors, however, is the company’s 12-year history of reliable dividend payments. After holding the quarterly payment steady for years, at 41 cents, TAP made a special payment in August 2019 of 57 cents. The annualized payout, $2.28, indicates that this may be the new normal for TAP dividends. And at the current share price, that puts the yield at a strong 4.35%.Writing from UBS, Sean King sees TAP as well positioned for gains in the coming year. He writes, “We acknowledge that the ongoing production improvements are intended to support greater portfolio complexity, we believe that this flexibility is targeted for growth brands of the future rather than the legacy tail brands… We see a challenging road ahead for TAP but we remain constructive on the favorable event-path and our confidence in the dividend / de-leverage commitments at deeply discounted valuation.”King places a $66 price target on the stock to support his Buy rating, indicating confidence in a 21% upside potential. (To watch King’s track record, click here)All in all, Molson Coors’ Moderate Buy consensus is based on 4 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell, reflecting the tough market conditions the company has faced in recent years. Shares are priced moderately, at $54.49, and the average price target of $56.30 suggests an upside of 3.32% – not large, but still considerable when combined with the high dividend yield and robust product portfolio. (See Molson Coors’ stock analysis at TipRanks)Oneok, Inc. (OKE)Oneok is a natural gas midstreaming company, owning and controlling the pipelines that transport gas and gas products from production sites to refiners to storage and finally to the customers. The company operates in the Permian, Mid-Continent, and Rocky Mountain regions of the American West. Oneok saw $12.6 billion in revenues and a net income exceeding $300 million in 2018.2019 numbers are not in yet for the company, but the Q3 numbers show reasons for optimism. While revenues missed the forecast by 4%, coming in at $2.26 billion, the 74 cent EPS was in line with expectations. And, despite a 12% drop in cash flow, the company reported a 19% increase in total assets, to $21.336 billion.All of that supports the company’s regular dividend payments. OKE has been steadily increasing the payment since 2011. The current quarterly payment, 91.5 cents, annualizes to $3.66 per share – a strong payout. The yield is handsome, at 4.99%. Combined with a 46% share appreciation in 2019, it’s clear why OKE is an attractive stock.4-star analyst Shneur Gershuni wrote up UBS’ stance on OKE. He put a Buy rating on the stock, and in his comments backed it up: “OKE reported an inline quarter; however, with this earnings season we expect the focus to be on capex. Since 1Q reporting season, OKE has been guiding the street to the upper end of the range despite an extremely wide range outlined in Feb... Overall OKE reaffirmed &gt;20% earnings growth over ‘19 midpoint guide which is what investors were also probably looking for as well.”Gershuni set his $80 price target on OKE at the end of October – the stock has since gained value and approached that target, leaving room for just 1.5% additional upside. (To watch Gershuni’s track record, click here)OKE is another Moderate Buy stock, with the consensus rating based on 6 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. As mentioned, the stock has gained recently, so the current share price of $76.89 is within a half percent of the $76.89 average price target.

2020-01-09,"Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been working on its recovery over the past six months as it climbs from its August lows. Despite rallying more than 15% from those lows, Pfizer stock is still down more than 13% from its fourth quarter 2018 highs. Is it time to bet on Pfizer stock or throw in the towel?Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com With a name like Pfizer, &quot;throwing in the towel&quot; makes it sound worse than it is. Because ultimately, Pfizer is a good company with a solid dividend and a long history. But I'm sorry to say that momentum is not on its side.  * 8 of the Strangest Stocks Worth Your Time Some investors may read that as a technical takeaway. It's not -- at least, not entirely. While PFE stock has waning momentum on the charts, it's losing momentum in its business, too. With a stock market near its highs, why buy Pfizer stock?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Valuing Pfizer StockIf you're looking for a cheap stock with a hefty dividend, Pfizer stock has attractive qualities. Likewise, income-oriented investors who have held PFE stock for years and years may feel compelled to stick with it as well. That's fine.Here are the headline numbers: Pfizer stock trades at 13.1 times 2019 earnings expectations and pays out a 3.9% dividend yield. For all intents and purposes, it is a bond-equivalent stock.But those numbers mask some of the trouble under the hood. 2019 earnings are forecast to fall a nickel per share from 2018's full-year results, and are further forecast to fall in 2020, down to $2.86 per share. Revenue is forecast to fall 3.7% this year to $51.66 billion. Worse, in 2020, sales are expected to drop another 4.5%.Pfizer's 2019 fiscal year ended on Dec. 31, although the company has yet to report its final quarterly results for the year. Should estimates for the coming 12 months of business be even semi-accurate though, it shows a company that has clearly lost momentum.On the plus side, both gross and operating margins have been churning higher. On the downside, free cash flow has been in decline over the last 12 months.Yield-chasing isn't a crime in the investment world, but it's not worth sacrificing everything for. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been aggressively raising its dividend -- a 22.6% hike last month and 51% in December 2018 -- and now pays a 4.15% yield. It's got solid estimates for earnings and revenue this year and next year, with growth across the board.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) pays a smaller yield, at 2.8%. But if we can get this name on a dip, that yield will be closer to 3%, while the company has accelerating double-digit revenue and earnings growth.My point? Pfizer stock isn't a bad company, but it doesn't have any momentum. Its yield is nice, but it's not the only dividend stock in the world. Trading PFE StockSource: Chart courtesy of <a href=""//stockcharts.com"">StockCharts.com</a>While the business lacks momentum, the charts were looking better. However, the Pfizer stock price is taking a turn for the worst.Shares had formed a rising wedge pattern (blue lines). That means that the stock is putting in a series of higher highs and higher lows -- which is good -- but that the range between these highs and lows is narrowing. When a stock breaks from this pattern, it may very well continue in the direction of the break.For PFE stock, the break happened to the downside, as wedge support gave way. Shares are roughly in the middle of its 15-month range, and while the break of wedge support is not necessarily the nail in the coffin, it's not exactly good news either.The $38.50 level has had mild significance over the past month. However, below that mark will mean that the Pfizer stock price also failed to hold the 20-day and 200-day moving averages. Below the 50-day moving average at $38.13 and shares can really start to flounder.You can see where this is going. Losing these marks continues to add checkmarks in the bearish column, technically speaking. It's another sign that momentum has waned and that PFE stock may be set for mediocre returns in the intermediate term.Of course, bulls can rectify the situation by holding the $38.50 level and 200-day moving average, and eventually reclaiming wedge support. But without the fundamental catalysts in place, it may be hard for the stock to find traction.In any regard, keep any eye on the stock price. Over former wedge support and the stock is OK.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AVGO.

2020-01-14,"Shoppers everywhere like to find the best value; that’s a given. And investors? Well, investors are just a special case of shoppers – in this case, shopping for stocks. So, how can we define a good value when it comes to stocks? In short, we’re looking for high upside and high dividend yields.TipRanks, a platform that tracks and measures the performance of analysts, offers a set of tools to search the raw data collected from 5,700 Wall Street financial experts and 6,500 publicly traded companies. The basic tool, the Stock Screener, gives investors a set of filters to screen the data and find the stocks that fit the desired profile.Setting the filters to show us stocks with a price target upside above 10% and a dividend yield above 2.5% brings the list down to a manageable 46 companies – that will offer investors a true value for their stock purchase. Let’s look at three of them that have a top spot in the S&P 500.Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)We’ll start with Broadcom, a stand-by of the semiconductor chip industry. Broadcom’s 2019 sales numbers are not in yet, but it finished 2018 as the sixth largest chip maker by revenues, bringing in $18.46 billion. Riding high from that sales figure, Broadcom stock gained 28% in 2019, matching the broader stock market figures.In December’s fiscal Q4 earnings report, AVGO showed revenue and earnings both above the forecasts. The top-line sales figure was $5.78 billion, up 6.25% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially from Q3. Earnings showed a less impressive gain, but the annual EPS of $5.39 beat the expectation by a half-percent.AVGO shares are well positioned for price appreciation; they are also one of the market’s true dividend champions. The company raised the December dividend payment, to $3.25 per quarter, making the annual payment $13 and the yield 4.34%. That yield is well above the 2% average among S&P-listed companies, and the December increase caps a three-year run of consistent dividend increases.Top analysts see AVGO as a healthy investment. Writing from Morgan Stanley, 5-star analyst Craig Hettenbach says, “We think the stock is poised to outperform after meaningfully lagging the past 2 years… If Broadcom is able to execute in software it would add to what we view as a very compelling franchise in semis (66% weighted market share across 60% of revenue in duopoly structures), creating a diversified and highly profitable and cash generative business.”Hettenbach accordingly rates the stock a Buy, and puts a price target of $367 on the shares, indicating an upside potential of 23%. (To watch Hettenbach’s track record, click here)Mark Lipacis, the eighth-ranked analyst overall in the TipRanks database, agrees that AVGO is poised for gains. Noting that the “company's dividend policy is to return 50% of previous year's FCF to shareholders in the form of a dividend,” he goes on to add, “AVGO expects 6-8% growth in Core Semiconductor business over the next few years. Software business is becoming more predictable and expected to be $7bn in F2020.”In line with his optimism and Buy rating, Lipacis bumped his price target here up by 8%, to $350, implying a 17%. (To watch Lipacis’ track record, click here)Broadcom’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 analyst reviews, including 16 Buys and 5 Holds. Shares are not cheap, at $299.22, but the average price target suggests room for a 18% upside growth potential this year. (See Broadcom stock analysis at TipRanks)Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron, one of the world’s largest oil producers, with a market cap of $220 billion, is facing rough market conditions. Prices in the oil markets are low – 2H19 saw market bottoms near $52 for WTI – while overhead costs remain high. The combination pushed revenue down from ~$14 billion in 2018 to ~$12 billion in 2019.In CVX’s most recent earnings report, for Q3 2019, the company showed a 6% miss on EPS, with the bottom-line number at $1.36 for the quarter. Revenues were down by 4%, at $36.12 billion. During the quarter, the price of crude oil and natural gas liquids fell 24%, from $62 one year ago to $47 per barrel equivalent. A 3% increase in total production helped mitigate the losses.Even though revenues and EPS are down, CVX has been able to maintain its high dividend payout. Oil is an essential commodity, so there will always be a market for it, and cash flow for the oil companies. CVX uses those facts to back up a 4.09% dividend yield, with an annualized payment of $4.76. This yield is approximately double the S&P’s average dividend yield, and well over double the yield of the 2-year and 10-year US Treasury bonds.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees the bottom line on CVX supporting a Buy rating. He writes, “Despite the well-telegraphed headwinds, we continue to see CVX’s peer-leading portfolio breakeven and attractive FCF outlook as supporting leading growth in dividends/shareholder returns amongst its peers.”Todd’s $143 price target on CVX shares implies room for a 23% upside. (To watch Todd’s track record, click here.)Roger Read, reviewing CVX for Well Fargo, lays out an upbeat track for the company in 2020: “Driven by its unconventional plays, deepwater assets and LNG projects, [we see CVX bringing in] modest, returns-focused production growth expectations, expanding margins from high-grading and cost controls, dividend growth, potential share repurchases and solid balance sheet.”Read gives CVX a Buy rating with a $142 price target, showing his confidence in 22% forward growth. (To watch Read’s track record, click here)The difficulties of the oil market can be seen in Chevron’s analyst consensus, a Moderate Buy rating based on 6 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average price target of $137 implies an upside of 18% from the $116 current trading price. (See Chevron’s stock analysis at TipRanks)International Business Machines (IBM)The last stock on our list is an old-name blue-chip standard of the markets, and a long-time component of the Dow Jones index, IBM. It’s a name that everyone knows – IBM got its start in business tech when that meant gear-driven mechanical calculators and card-punch time clocks. After WWII, IBM was at the forefront of the electronic computer revolution, evolving from punch card machines to magnetic tape drives to the early floppy disks. The ubiquitous PC got its start with an IBM operating system. Today, business tech is moving toward the cloud, and IBM acquired cloud innovator Red Hat last year, to get a foothold in the cloud market. With a market cap of $121 billion and annual revenues in the neighborhood of $80 billion, IBM has plenty of resources to change direction.Staying at the top isn’t cheap, though. IBM had to spend $34 billion on the Red Had acquisition, and saw a major bookkeeping loss in its most recent reported quarter, Q3 of 2019. The quarterly revenue hit was heavy – the top line was down $190 million to, to $18.03 billion. On the positive side, Red Hat, in its first quarter as a subsidiary, saw revenues rise 20%, and EPS was in line with the forecasts, at $2.68.While closing the Red Hat deal, IBM management announced that it would freeze the dividend at current levels for at least the next year. While this forestalls growth, the actual payment remains high - $1.62 per quarter. Annually, this translates to $6.48 and a yield of 4.74%. IBM has, since 2011, committed to maintaining the dividend payment, as a boon to investors.Matthew Cabral, 4-star analyst with Credit Suisse, is upbeat on IBM. He notes the “solid start” of Red Hat as part of the IBM parent company, and then adds, “[W]e think that inflection starts in 4Q, with an early boost from mainframe before passing the baton to Red Hat and the related pull-through of “core” IBM in CY20. Indeed, early progress on Red Hat is encouraging and we continue to believe the acquisition significantly improves IBM’s standing in the rapid push toward hybrid cloud.”Cabral backs his outlook with a Buy rating and a $173 price target. His target suggests room for 26% share appreciation in 2020. (To watch Cabral’s track record, click here)IBM’s Moderate Buy consensus rating reflects the company’s recent mixed results on revenues, and debt from the Red Hat purchase. The stock has an even split – 4 Buy ratings and 4 Holds. Shares sell for $136, and the average price target of $162.67 implies an upside potential of 19%.

2020-01-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor makers Qorvo Inc. and Skyworks Solutions Inc. are weighing bids for Broadcom Inc.’s wireless-chip business, which could fetch about $10 billion in a sale, according to people familiar with the matter.Other potential buyers could be interested, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. The unit makes radio-frequency, or RF, chips.A final decision hasn’t been made and Qorvo and Skyworks may opt not to proceed with offers, they said.A representative for Broadcom declined to comment. Representatives for Qorvo and Skyworks didn’t respond to requests for comment.Broadcom on Thursday disclosed new agreements to provide components for Apple Inc. devices for several years. The disclosure lets potential acquirers of the radio frequency unit know that they’re buying into a substantial business relationship with Cupertino, California-based Apple.The potential sale comes as Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan -- fresh off a $10.7 billion takeover of Symantec Corp.’s security software unit -- seeks to focus on businesses with strong share in profitable markets that don’t require excessive investment. He’s jettisoning components that don’t fit that plan. Broadcom agreed to sell a cybersecurity services business this month to Accenture Plc.The RF unit’s chips are used to filter and amplify radio frequency signals. Its filters also let wireless communications systems support a large number of subscribers at the same time by ensuring that voice and data streams don’t interfere with each other.The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Broadcom was seeking a buyer for the division.To contact the reporters on this story: Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.net;Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, ;Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Michael HythaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Qorvo and Skyworks Weigh Bids for Broadcom’s RF Chip Unit

Broadcom said that the two new deals as well as the rest of the previously disclosed contract would lead to, in aggregate, $15 billion in revenue for the company.

2020-01-24,"After a strong open and a push to new highs for many stocks, equities turned lower in Friday's session on renewed coronavirus fears. Let's look at a few top stock trades for next week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: BroadcomSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAfter announcing a multi-year, multi-billion dollar deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares were in rally mode, hitting new 52-weeks highs. However, the selling pressure in the overall market rained on AVGO's parade.What now?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI would love to see AVGO hold up over the $315 to $318 area, which was stubborn resistance on the way up. If it can do that, it leaves $330-plus on the table, if the market is able to keep its footing.  * 7 'A'-Rated Dividend Stocks That Provide Inflation-Beating Income If it doesn't and AVGO loses its 50-day moving average, another test of $300 is possible. Below puts the 200-day moving average in play. DisneySource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comDisney (NYSE:DIS) hasn't looked too pretty. While the market has spent most of December and January rallying, Disney shares have been putting in a series of lower highs.In fact, the charts have a descending triangle pattern in play, a bearish technical setup. That occurs when downtrend resistance (blue line) squeezes the stock price lower against a static level of support (black line). It leaves investors looking for a breakdown below support.That's exactly what's playing out in Disney. Given that the market is starting to wobble a bit, investors may be nervous buying DIS. First, let's see if the 200-day moving average steps in as support, just as it did in October. Below puts gap-up support near $136 in play.On a rally, bulls need to see Disney stock reclaim $143, as well as downtrend resistance. FordSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comWhile Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has scorched higher in 2020, Ford (NYSE:F) has done the opposite. Now, it's really breaking down.Shares cracked violently below uptrend support and the 50-day moving average, as the stock is now below all of its major moving averages on both a daily and weekly basis.Let's see if Ford stock declines to the $8.50 to $8.60 range and if so, if it finds support there. On a rebound, F needs to reclaim the 50-day moving average. American AirlinesSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAmerican Airlines (NYSE:AAL) has a similar chart to Ford. After a very strong reversal on Thursday (despite worse-than-expected earnings), shares are again showing signs of weakness.The stock is losing uptrend support and if it loses the $26.85 level, the post-earnings low near $26 is on the table. On a rally, AAL needs to reclaim uptrend support, but it's a no-touch for me on the long side with the market's current state.Investors should be looking at stocks holding support or near support, not at stocks that are losing it. IQiyiSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comIQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) couldn't push through the $25 mark and is embarking on a deep retreat on Friday, falling about 10%. The move sent shares right through the 20-day moving average, as sellers hammer the stock.Now, the $20 to $21 area is in sight, with uptrend support near the former and the 50-day moving average near the latter. That may be a worthy buy-the-dip zone if we see a bit more weakness early next week. Below $20 puts the 200-day moving average on the table.In any regard, look to see if IQ can reclaim the 20-day moving average on a rally.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Stocks have been on a steady ascent, and at this point, even an 8% to 10% correction from the highs would still leave the technicals in pretty good shape.The coronavirus has a few memory sensors tingling back to late-Q3 early-Q4 2014, when the Ebola scare sent the market lower by almost 10%. And remember, that was mainly out of Africa. There are a lot more people in China doing a lot more traveling and working in a much larger economy.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comSo if the headlines continue to worsen, perhaps we'll continue to see some air leave the market. Movers in the Stock Market TodayBoeing (NYSE:BA) was one of the wildest movers today. Shares sank on reports that the company is mulling a production cut for its 787 Dreamliner jet. So how did the stock surge from the lows and end higher by 1.7%?Reports from the FAA now suggest that the 737 MAX may be reinstated before mid-year. Earlier this week, BA shares sold off on reports of a software issue and a possible delay of the 737 MAX until June or July. Friday's news also sent Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) from negative to positive territory, and helped alleviate some of the losses in American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL).  * 7 'A'-Rated Dividend Stocks That Provide Inflation-Beating Income Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially jumped over 3% to new 52-week highs, although most of those gains evaporated on the back of market-wide selling. In any regard, shares were on the rise after the company agreed to two multi-year deals to supply wireless components to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The agreement could be worth up to $15 billion in revenue for AVGO. AppleSpeaking of Apple, the company has reportedly garnered more than 33 million U.S. subscribers for its Apple TV+ service. That's behind Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) 61.3 million subscribers and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) 42.2 million Prime Video subs, but ahead of Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ subscribers of 23.2 million.Honestly though, the figures for both Disney+ and Apple TV+ are impressive given that both platforms just launched a few months ago. It may make competition even harder for Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) coming Peacock service.Lastly for Apple, the stock received yet another price target hike from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Ives has been bullish on Apple for a while now, but took his price target from $350 to $400 on more 5G optimism.That wasn't the only call regarding Apple and 5G, although the sentiment is not shared. Rosenblatt analysts argued that &quot;the market has become too enthusiastic about the upcoming 5G cycle. We expect the cycle to be similar to a regular smartphone upgrade cycle (or even slower than a regular upgrade cycle) due to consumers waiting for 5G networks to get better and 5G phone prices to drop.&quot;While the analyst raised their price target by $100, it was only up from $150 to $250, which doesn't exactly come across as bullish as Apple recently hit a high of $323. Heard on the StreetDisney Shanghai will be closed on Saturday, as to not aid in the spread of the coronavirus. That's even as the Chinese New Year gets underway. That didn't stop Morgan Stanley analysts from feeling bullish on the stock though. They upped their price target to $170.That's also despite the breakdown on the chart.Keybanc analysts are feeling bullish on big tech. In particular, they like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), raising their price target to $263 and $1,749, respectively. Higher valuations, strong growth and free cash flow should drive the stocks higher, they say.Finally, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock tacked on 8.1% after better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. In fact, INTC smoked earnings and revenue estimates and provided robust guidance.However, that didn't stop Loop Capital from downgrading the stock from &quot;hold&quot; to &quot;sell.&quot; Although they did raise their price target from $50 to $59.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

In a case filed in federal court in Los Angeles in 2016, the Pasadena, California-based research university alleged that Broadcom wi-fi chips used in hundreds of millions of Apple iPhones infringed patents relating to data transmission technology.

2020-01-30,"(Bloomberg) -- If any company knows how to get rid of a billion-dollar patent-infringement verdict, it’s Apple Inc.Apple pledged to appeal Wednesday’s $1.1 billion verdict won by California Institute of Technology, in which it was told to pay $838 million and its chip supplier Broadcom Inc. was hit with $270 million in royalties by a federal jury in Los Angeles. Apple is counting on its past history challenging such verdicts to mean good odds for the future.In the past decade, the iPhone maker has evaded a $533 million verdict over controlling digital content, a $506 million judgment over microprocessor technology and a $625.5 million verdict for a way to display documents. In cases Apple hasn’t won, the company keeps fighting -- it’s been embroiled in a decade-long fight to avoid paying as much as $1 billion over secure communications to VirnetX Holding Corp.“They are certainly one of the most targeted entities out there, so it makes sense for them to aggressively defend themselves when they don’t see a path to settlement,” said Jonathan Stroud, chief intellectual property counsel for Unified Patents LLC, which challenges patents used in litigation against its members, including Apple. “Otherwise they’ll be seen as an ATM and continue to be targeted regardless.”Led by Chief Litigation Counsel Noreen Krall, Apple’s strategy has been geared to maintaining the company’s high-profit margin. That means waging a years-long battle with Samsung Electronics Co. when Apple thought the Korean electronics maker had copied iPhone designs and a no-holds-barred fight with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. to lower royalties it pays on critical telecommunications technology.The cases don’t always end in complete victories. Apple continued to lose market share to Samsung, and its battle with Qualcomm ended in a settlement where it paid the chipmaker billions of dollars and agreed to start using its chips again.“This is just the starting point,” said Bridget Smith, a lawyer with Lowenstein & Weatherwax in Los Angeles, of Wednesday’s verdict. “They’re still going to have to win on appeal.”Apple also has been accused of being a bully when it comes to using other companies’ inventions. Medical device maker Masimo Corp. claims Apple stole health monitoring technology, and a Florida company that makes “virtual iPhones” to test for flaws has accused Apple of trying to control security research.The big-dollar verdicts against Apple are in part because of its size. The $838 million won by CalTech is less than two days’ worth of sales for Apple and is equal to less than 2% of the company’s $55.3 billion net income in fiscal 2019.Broadcom’s share of the verdict could mean a bigger rap to its bottom line. The San Jose-based chipmaker reported $22.6 billion in sales in the fiscal year ended Nov. 3, and net income of $2.7 billion. Broadcom fell as much as 2.8% Thursday on the news.CalTech said it was “committed to protecting its intellectual property in furtherance of its mission to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education.”District Court Judge George Wu, who presided over the trial, has ordered a telephone conference Feb. 6 to determine the next steps in the case. The verdict is the sixth-largest for a patent-infringement case in U.S. history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. No $1 billion-plus patent verdict has ever stood -- they are tossed on appeal or settle for a lower amount.“Less than a hundred million, there’s not a lot of attention,” said Bernard Chao, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. “But when you get in excess of nine figures, I think you start raising eyebrows and drawing attention.”The biggest decision won by a university was a $1.17 billion verdict won by Carnegie Mellon University against Marvell Technology Group Ltd. in 2013. An appeals court later ordered that damages be recalculated and the case settled for $750 million.“When you have a number that big, the courts scrutinize the verdict and say ‘Is this legit?’” said Patrick McElhinny of K&L Gates in Pittsburgh, who represented Carnegie Mellon. “They typically are. As long as they are grounded in the record, they are perfectly appropriate.”Apple and other Silicon Valley companies have been trying to lower how much patent owners can collect in damages for years. They have argued too often juries are awarding big awards when the invention is for a tiny component in a complex device.The concern, said Timothy Holbrook, a professor at Emory Law in Atlanta, is “giving too much weight to the value of this technology as it relates to a broader product.”Working to limit damages is at the heart of a Supreme Court petition Apple has filed seeking to overturn a $439 million judgment won by VirnetX. In a second case involving the same patents but newer products, a federal appeals court ordered a recalculation of a $503 million verdict.“There is no doubt that they’ll spend a large amount of money to fight to the bitter end even long after it’s become crystal clear they should take responsibility via a license,” said Brad Caldwell of Caldwell Cassady Curry in Dallas, who has represented VirnetX for the past decade.Even as tech companies want to avoid paying high royalties, universities are trying to collect more money from their research, with recent lawsuits filed by the University of California against Abbott Laboratories over an infant formula and lighting companies and retailers over LED bulbs, along with a cross-country battle among research institutes over who will get royalties on ground-breaking gene-editing technology.Universities are seen as the incubators for new ideas and have to rely on a sometimes fickle federal government for funding, said Peter Corless, a patent lawyer with Mintz Levin in Boston who often represents universities.“Everyone is so under pressure to come up with funds to be more competitive and put together better packages for incoming professors,” Corless said. The universities nonetheless have been asking themselves “If we start asserting some of our patents against blue chip corporate America is that appropriate for us and who we are?”While many legal experts predict the damages award will be cut, if Apple doesn’t get an outright victory, Corless said CalTech won’t give up without a fight.“It’s a big deal,” he said. “It would change an institution if they get the money.”(Adds comment from VirnetX lawyer in 19th paragraph. An earlier version corrected the verdict amount in first deck headline.)&#92;--With assistance from Malathi Nayak and Edvard Pettersson.To contact the reporters on this story: Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.net;Ian Lopez in Arlington at ilopez32@bloomberg.net;Matthew Bultman in Arlington at mbultman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, ;Keith Perine at kperine2@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth Wasserman, Rebecca BakerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple’s Success Reversing Patent Cases May Dim CalTech’s Win

2020-02-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. tamped down expectations for sales growth next quarter, saying the payoff from the introduction of smartphones capable of using new high-speed wireless networks will take longer than anticipated.The chipmaker, which has tied its success to the roll out of fifth-generation, or 5G, networks, gave a sales forecast for the second fiscal quarter that topped analysts’ estimates. But revenue will be little changed in the following three-month period ending in June, Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said Wednesday on a conference call after earnings were reported.Analysts had predicted Qualcomm’s revenue would increase quarter over quarter through the year. Shares, which had initially gained in extended trading, fell about 2% on the remarks.Consumers have been hanging on to handsets longer as technology advances slow. Qualcomm and the rest of the industry are arguing that 5G will reverse that trend. While 5G networks are beginning to roll out, much of that demand won’t come until the introduction of new smartphones in the September quarter, Palkhiwala said.“We expect the next inflection point with the launch of additional 5G flagship handsets to be in the fourth quarter and extend into fiscal 2021,” Palkhiwala said on the call. “We expect our third fiscal quarter performance to be in line with our second fiscal quarter.”Revenue will be $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ends in March, the San Diego-based company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $5.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fiscal first-quarter sales and profit also beat estimates.The company has factored in the possible disruption of the coronavirus in China, the biggest market for smartphones, on consumer demand, Palkhiwala said.Qualcomm shares declined to a low of $86.68 in extended trading after closing at $90.91 in New York. The stock has gained 79% in the past 12 months.In the first quarter, net income fell to $925 million, or 80 cents a share, from $1.07 billion, or 87 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, profit was 99 cents a share, compared with an average estimate of 85 cents.Revenue rose 4.9% to $5.08 billion in the period, which ended Dec. 29. Analysts on average had predicted $4.83 billion in sales. It was the first year-over-year sales growth in six quarters.The chipmaker is the largest provider of technology underpinning modern phone networks, making its results a key indicator of industry demand. Qualcomm predicted that as many as 1.85 billion phones will be sold in 2020, a return to growth after a decline last year.The company gets the bulk of its profit from licensing patents that it says cover the fundamentals of modern phone systems. Qualcomm charges a percentage of the selling price of each handset, payable by phone makers regardless of whether they use its chips. The company’s modems and processors provide it with the majority of revenue.Technology licensing revenue jumped 38% to $1.4 billion in the fiscal first quarter, but the company projected a decline to $1 billion to $1.2 billion in the current period. The chip division generated $3.6 billion, falling 3.2% from a year earlier. Qualcomm predicted sales will reach as much as $4.5 billion this quarter.The company is emerging from years of legal disputes and regulatory proceedings that threatened its licensing model. It still has to reach an agreement in a patent-fee standoff with China’s Huawei Technologies Co. and overturn a sweeping U.S. antitrust decision through an appeal that is due to start next week.Qualcomm settled a broad-ranging legal dispute with Apple Inc. and the iPhone maker agreed to resume using Qualcomm chips. But a Federal Trade Commission case alleged unfair business practices and Qualcomm has been ordered to renegotiate patent licenses. The company has won a stay on that decision. Other branches of the U.S. government have said they support Qualcomm’s position against the FTC and the lower court, sparking optimism it will succeed.Separately, Qualcomm disclosed in a filing that it received a request for information on Dec. 3 from the European Commission, which is investigating whether the company engaged in anti-competitive behavior by exploiting its market position in baseband processors to help it in the 5G radio-frequency chip market. Qualcomm said it’s in the process of responding.The company has increased its efforts in RF chips, which help convert radio waves into data that can be processed by other parts of a phone. It competes in the market with Broadcom Inc., Qorvo Inc. and Skyworks Solutions Inc. While Qualcomm has touted its success in RF in new handset models, 5G phones are still a fraction of the total smartphones sold.(Updates with EU investigation in the final two paragraphs)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Jillian WardFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Qualcomm Projects Uneven Sales Growth on Pickup of 5G

As a result, these five super-fast-growing dividend stocks have become cheap.In putting this article together, I wanted to focus only on stocks whose dividends have grown 20% or faster in the past three to five years. That's because when the market returns to normal, these kinds of stocks tend to jump back up quickly.Moreover, the underlying reason their dividends are growing so fast is that the companies' earnings and/or free cash flow are rising at a fast pace. In other words, the payout ratios tend to stay flat, and the dividends are rising because the underlying earnings or cash flow are growing fast.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Last Week These stocks also tend to be fairly liquid, feature large market caps and have earnings which cover the dividends. Fast-Growing Dividend Stocks: Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 4.6%3-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 39.3%5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 51.3%Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor device and software solutions company. It is the world's second-largest fabless semiconductor company.AVGO stock has a $112 billion market capitalization and is also very cheap. It sells for about a 12x price-earnings ratio.Moreover, its dividend yield is very high at 4.6%. Broadcom's $13 dividend is well covered by its forward expected earnings of $23.27, according to Seeking Alpha.As the chart above shows, dividends have grown on average 39.3% over the past three years and 51.3% over five years. .The company has been growing through acquisitions. Broadcom tried to buy Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) three years ago. It was prevented by the President Donald Trump Administration, since Chinese interests had majority control of Broadcom.Broadcom also acquired CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in 2018. It also recently closed on the $10.7 billion purchase of the enterprise security business from Symantec.Analysts are generally positive on AVGO and expect higher revenue and earnings for the year ending October. This should continue to lead to high dividend growth over the next several years. VISA (V)Source: Mark R.

But most do not know that it is not a bank.  It makes its money from transaction fees and licensing fees.Visa stock is not necessarily cheap at 30 times earnings, but its earnings and dividends have been growing very fast. Moreover, its expected earnings per share of $6.14 this year cover the dividend per share of $1.20.Visa had very strong results for 2019. In its most recent earnings report, transaction volumes were up 11% year-over-year, revenues rose 10% and EPS was up 12%.Moreover, analysts expect 2020 earnings per share for the year ending September will be 15.4% higher at $6.14 per share. For 2021 they expect an additional 17% spike in EPS growth to $7.18 per share.So the $1.20 annual dividend per share, which represents just 20% of the expected fiscal year 2020 earnings, has plenty of room to grow.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Watch for good things to happen to the stock as the dividend is hiked.

Just like Visa, it has superb earnings and dividends growth, as it is essentially in the same business.Also like Visa, Mastercard is not particularly cheap, but its dividends are growing quickly. MA stock trades for 33 times forward earnings. But the earnings are highly priced for their growth.For example, MA's earnings per share will grow over 12.5% this year, according to analysts polled by Seeking Alpha. This is after earning rose 42% in the year ending December 2019.Moreover, 2021 expected earnings growth is 20%. Therefore, the $1.60 dividend is well covered by this year's expected $7.94 EPS. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 5.3%3-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 22.8%5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 18.5%AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a roughly $130 billion market cap drug stock which is very cheap. It has a 5.2% dividend yield and a forward price-earnings ratio of just 9 times.Moreover, its $4.72 annual dividend per share is well covered by the prospective earnings of $9.88 according to Seeking Alpha. This is important since the dividends have been growing very fast over the past three to five years. As the table shows above, dividends have grown on average 22.8% over the past three years and 18.5% over five years.AbbVie's purchase of Allergan, expected to close shortly, will boost earnings and dividends and push ABBV stock higher.

Earnings have been turning around this year as demand for chips has picked up, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors.TXN stock is cheap at 22.9 times this year's expected earnings, according to Seeking Alpha.Analysts expect earnings this year to be $5.19 per share. This more than covers the dividend per share payment of $3.60.Moreover, Texas Instruments has had a long history of paying dividends. Its dividends have risen for 16 years in a row, which is quite a feat. Expect this to continue with the company's recent turnaround in earnings expectations.In fact, TXN has already paid out two quarters of dividends at the $3.60 annual rate. You can expect another dividend hike announcement in mid-July. This is likely to boost TXN stock further. Summary - Super Fast-Growing Dividend StocksThese five stocks have grown their dividend on an accelerated basis, compared to most other companies.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA For example, the table above shows these dividend stocks have an average dividend growth rate for the past three years of 25%. And over the past five years, the dividends have risen 26% on average.Moreover, the average dividend yield is a healthy 2.8%, which is close to the market average. In effect, you get super-fast dividend growth without having to sacrifice dividend yield by buying this group of dividend stocks.That seems like a pretty good bargain, which is not likely to last long.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese technology giant barred from doing business with U.S. suppliers, is finding a way around the strict limits imposed by the Trump administration.The Commerce Department, citing national security concerns, has largely forbidden American companies from selling Huawei the computer chips it needs to make a piece of equipment integral to newly introduced high-speed wireless networks. In response, China’s largest technology company ramped up its own capabilities to manufacture the gear, which is known as a base station.In a sign that the self-reliance is working, Huawei in the fourth quarter sold more than 50,000 of these next-generation base stations that were free of U.S. technology, according to Tim Danks, the U.S.-based Huawei executive responsible for partner relations. That’s only about 8% of the total base stations that Huawei’s sold as of February, but the company is quickly ramping up at its secretive HiSilicon division to make more of these American component-free devices, Danks said.“It’s still our intention to return to using U.S. technology,” he said. The longer Huawei goes without access to U.S. suppliers, the more unlikely it is to be able to return to using them, Danks added.A base station is a typically suitcase-sized piece of machinery that’s used to help connect wireless phones to fixed-line networks carrying internet traffic, and it’s an essential ingredient in the next, or fifth, generation of mobile networks. Popular among telecommunications providers, Huawei’s base stations are widely considered among the most reliable for the price.Read about how Trump’s blacklisting of Huawei is failing to halt its growth.U.S. officials accuse Huawei of stealing valuable intellectual property and violating a trade embargo with Iran. The Trump administration blacklisted the company last year, saying there’s a risk Huawei could give Beijing access to sensitive data coursing through telecommunications networks that employ its gear. Huawei has denied the allegations. Critics also said the U.S. government imposed the sanctions to hobble China’s leadership in key aspects of 5G technology.As of early February, Huawei had shipped about 600,000 5G base stations to mobile phone companies racing to upgrade networks to the new standard, which is designed to deliver data at faster speeds to a broad range of wirelessly connected devices -- not just mobile handsets. Most of these base stations were made using stockpiled chips bought before the ban.While Huawei doesn’t disclose its suppliers, base stations typically rely on a kind of processor called a field programmable gate array that’s made by Intel Corp., a chipmaking colossus based in Santa Clara, California, and Xilinx Inc., in neighboring San Jose. Those chips provide flexibility that makes it easier to update machines as new standards and features are added. Huawei’s chips are application-specific, meaning they’re tailored to particular functions and it takes more time and money to replace them. That’s a disadvantage at a time when new technology, such as 5G, is in its infancy and still subject to big changes.Read more: Huawei Engineers Go to 24-Hour Days to Beat Trump BlacklistThe U.S. initially clamped down on all shipments of U.S. supplies to Huawei, which had spent more than $10 billion a year on U.S. products, but later began making some exceptions. Xilinx and fellow chipmakers Micron Technology Inc. and Broadcom Inc. have all reported falling earnings on reduced or eliminated sales to Huawei.Attempts by the U.S. to persuade European and other allied countries to ban Huawei equipment have fallen short, and chipmakers in Asia and Europe continue to supply it.For their part, American chipmakers have argued that banning the supply of parts that Huawei can get elsewhere is counterproductive, saying that the lost revenue crimps research and development budgets and the ability to produce the best chips in the future. Huawei’s HiSilicon chip unit designs semiconductors and has them manufactured by industry-leading plants owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. But Washington is even now said to be looking into ways to curb the world’s largest contract chipmaker on grounds of national security, and deprive Huawei of its largest semiconductor manufacturing partner.The Chinese company led the market for base stations with a 28% share last year, according to New Street Research. The investment company predicts demand for that equipment will rise this year with the 5G network buildout.

2020-03-06,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump ordered the Chinese acquisition of a hotel property management software company reversed on national security grounds.Trump ordered Beijing Shiji Information Technology Co. to unwind its 2018 acquisition of StayNTouch Inc., the White House said in a statement on Friday.Trump said there was “credible evidence” the Chinese company “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.”The order marked the third time Trump has blocked a foreign takeover of a U.S. company on national security grounds, and just the sixth time a U.S. president has done so in three decades.The Trump administration has ramped up scrutiny of Chinese acquisitions of American businesses over risks to national security. The panel that reviews foreign investments in U.S. firms, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., has thwarted a number of Chinese deals, especially for technology companies.CFIUS has raised security concerns about Infineon Technologies AG’s proposed acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor Corp., and has recommended the Trump block it, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.The Trump administration previously blocked a Chinese deal for Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Broadcom Inc.’s hostile bid for Qualcomm Inc. Although Broadcom was based in Singapore at the time, the administration cited fears that the deal would harm innovation by Qualcomm and give China an edge in developing wireless technology.Beijing Shiji provides software for the hospitality, food service, retail and entertainment industries.

2020-03-06,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. national security officials are recommending that President Donald Trump block Infineon Technologies AG’s proposed acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.The officials are concerned that Infineon’s $8.7 billion deal for the American chipmaker poses a risk to national security, said three people familiar with the matter. Infineon, a German semiconductor maker with substantial Chinese revenue, has tried to negotiate an agreement with the government that would let the takeover proceed, but hasn’t been able to reach a deal, one of the people said. All of the people asked not to be named discussing a national security matter.It wasn’t clear why officials with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews foreign takeovers of U.S. businesses, see a national security risk from the deal. The panel, however, is particularly sensitive to any transaction that could allow Chinese buyers to get their hands on advanced American technology.Read more: About CFIUS, Trump’s Watchdog on China Deals: QuickTakeCypress shares fell as much as 21% earlier before closing down 17.4 percent at $19.18. The shares dropped an additional 10% in extended trading on Thursday. Infineon fell as much as 5% in trading in Frankfurt on Friday.Cfius, which is led by the Treasury Department, can recommend the president block deals to protect national security. Congress gave the panel enhanced powers in 2018 to scrutinize foreign investment in U.S. companies.The Cypress deal would catapult Infineon into the top 10 of global chipmakers based on sales. Infineon derives a third of its sales from China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The White House’s National Security Council and Cypress declined to comment. Infineon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Cfius as a policy never comments on its reviews.Infineon told investors on an earnings call last month that it was negotiating a potential settlement for the deal.“We have a very good understanding about the requirements of U.S. government, what they expect and we are working together with them in order to resolve that,” Infineon Chief Executive Officer Reinhard Ploss said. “Our expectation is that we find a setup, which is supporting our revenue synergies.”Cypress, based in San Jose, sells components to the defense industry, although its products are not considered particularly sensitive. The company’s website highlights several offerings that are either suitable or designed for aerospace and defense customers, including “defense grade memory” parts that can “withstand military operating temperature ranges.”The Trump administration has toughened its review of foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses, particularly technology companies. Trump has blocked two takeovers on national security grounds, Broadcom Inc.’s hostile takeover of Qualcomm Inc. and Lattice Semiconductor Corp.’s sale to a Chinese-backed investor.In 2017, Infineon tried to buy Wolfspeed, a semiconductor unit of U.S.-based Cree Inc., but the the deal was blocked by Cfius.

Semiconductor makers said earlier this year that they’d keep supplying Huawei after after a Trump’s administration order in May demanding U.S.-based companies stop. At the time a spokesman for Infineon said the majority of products it delivers to Huawei were not subject to U.S. restrictions.In recent months European lawmakers have pushed back against Trump’s calls to cut Huawei out of European telecom infrastructure. The U.K., France, and Germany are all looking to keep the door open to the Chinese telecom giant in some way, nubbing the U.S. view that Huawei could be a security risk. Italy, Croatia, Hungary and Switzerland have signed partnerships with Huawei.Huawei is Infineon’s sixth-largest customer accounting for about 2.4% of sales, according to supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg. Other Chinese buyers of Infineon products include iPhone-assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.“Obviously national security considerations are very important,” said Keily Blair, Partner at law firm Orrick. “It would be good to see an evidence-based approach in the U.S., similar to what we have seen in the U.K. with Huawei.”In 2017, Cfius blocked Infineon’s proposed deal for Wolfspeed, a semiconductor unit of U.S.-based Cree Inc. Aixtron SE’s planned sale to a Chinese-backed company collapsed in 2016 after U.S. opposition. Trump has also blocked Broadcom Inc.’s hostile takeover of Qualcomm Inc.“We have always been less sure about the regulatory approvals than Infineon management,” said Citigroup Inc. analyst Amit Harchandani, “given the number of recent cross-border deals failing to clear the regulatory hurdle.”The U.S. is also trying to dictate who European firms do business with. Dutch chip gear-maker ASML Holding NV has had difficulty renewing an export license to China following U.S. political pressure. The company wants to sell equipment to China that would help the company produce its own next-generation chips and help it wean itself off foreign imports.In January, U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad that ASML’s technology “doesn’t belong in certain places,” suggesting China. The Chinese ambassador, Xu Hong, had warned days earlier in the same paper that the relationship between the Netherlands and China was at risk if the government blocks EUV machine exports.Other European tech deals are now in focus. British chip designer Dialog Semiconductor is another key figure in the European tech supply chain with Chinese customers and American acquisition targets. In February, it said it’d agreed to buy Santa Clara, California-based Adesto Technologies Corp. for about $380 million.Dialog’s biggest customer is Apple Inc., but Huawei is its third-largest with an exposure of about 2.1%. Dialog CEO Jalal Bagherli declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg on Friday.Although Cypress’s share price has collapsed following the report that Cfius is interested in the deal, some analysts believe all is not lost. “We believe mitigation conditions might still be an option and it would be premature to assume the deal is off,” said Citi’s Harchandani.“We believe worst-case we have a delay until the closing,” Vijay Rakesh, analyst at Mizuho Sescurites, said. A “potential delay or divestiture would be par for the course, but we see deal as mostly consummated.”&#92;--With assistance from Nate Lanxon.To contact the reporters on this story: Giles Turner in London at gturner35@bloomberg.net;Sarah Syed in London at ssyed35@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Nate Lanxon, Amy ThomsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Infineon Deal Scrutiny Raises Trade Threat to Europe Tech Firms

2020-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chipmaker that supplies Apple Inc. and other large electronics companies, withdrew its annual sales forecast and gave weak near-term guidance, demonstrating how deeply the coronavirus pandemic is poised to hurt demand. The stock slumped 10%.“The fundamental semiconductor backdrop has been improving, and we did not see any material impact on our businesses due to COVID-19 in our first quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in a statement. “However, visibility in our global markets is lacking and demand uncertainty is intensifying. As a result, we believe it prudent to withdraw our annual guidance until visibility returns to pre COVID-19 levels.”Sales in the current period will be $5.7 billion, plus or minus $150 million, the company said late Thursday. That missed Wall Street expectations. Tan said during a conference call with analysts that the quarterly target is largely in line with normal seasonal trends.While Broadcom’s supply chain is unscathed by the virus so far, the CEO said it’s impossible to assess yet how much consumer demand for electronics will decline.Broadcom’s stock dropped 10% in extended trading. The shares closed at $218.78 earlier in New York, leaving them down 30% so far this year.Broadcom is one of the largest technology companies so far to describe how its business is performing in the midst of the coronavirus health scare. Rising infections shut factories in China for weeks, disrupting trade and global supply chains, while curbing demand for hardware and software.The San Jose, California-based company makes chips for iPhones. Earlier this year, Apple scrapped its revenue guidance for the March quarter because of slowdowns in production and declining demand for its products after stores were closed in China.The fallout from Covid-19 comes as Broadcom, and other chipmakers, were already suffering from a trade dispute between China and the U.S. The company has been a major supplier to Huawei Technologies Co., but the Trump administration has forbidden U.S. companies from selling to the Chinese company. About a third of Broadcom’s products go into devices that are either bought in China or exported from China around the world.CEO Tan has built Broadcom into one of the biggest semiconductor makers through a string of deals. With customers including Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., Broadcom results are closely watched by investors.The company decided to keep investing in its wireless unit, ending speculation about a potential spinoff or sale. In January, Broadcom reported new long-term supply agreements with Apple. Tan said he changed his mind because of the certainty provided by a new customer commitment, not because of how the wireless unit was valued by possible acquirors.Sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, which ended Feb 2., rose 1 to $5.86 billion, the San Jose, California-based company said. Before certain items, profit was $5.25 a share. That compares with average analyst estimates for per-share profit of $5.34 on sales of $6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates with CEO comments in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Pulls Annual Sales Forecast on Virus Uncertainty

2020-03-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. kept its business rolling through the coronavirus pandemic this week by launching a new iPad Pro and two new Macs. But that doesn’t mean its supply chain is in the clear.Deliveries of the new products will begin arriving on doorsteps next week. However, production of those devices likely started in early January, before the worst effects of China’s virus lockdown in February, according to people familiar with Apple’s supply chain.With a fresh round of supplier factory closures enforced by Malaysia, and the virus disrupting operations in much of the rest of the world, the iPhone maker’s supply chain has not fully recovered yet.Apple’s next flagship iPhones, with 5G wireless capabilities, are still on schedule to launch in the fall, although that’s partly because mass production isn’t due to begin until May, said the people. They asked not to be identified discussing private supply chain issues.“Even as China comes back on line, we are beginning to wonder if Covid-19 will impact other supply oriented geographies,” Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a recent note to investors. “While China is improving, the supply chain for the electronics industry may yet see substantial disruptions.”An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, the architect of the company’s China-focused supply chain, said Feb. 28 that production issues would be a “temporary condition.”Apple’s assembly factories in China, run mainly by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., were in low gear for much of February. The manufacturing giant, also known as Foxconn, hopes to begin operating normally by the end of March.The February slowdown led to iPhone and AirPods supply constraints, but those have begun to subside. This week, Apple has been limiting iPhone purchases to two per customer on its online store in several countries. In early March, the company warned retail employees about shortages of replacement iPhones.One new product unveiled this week suggests there’s strain on Apple’s supply chain, but also shows the company can still mass produce gadgets given enough time. The keyboard accessory for the iPad Pro was announced Wednesday but goes on sale in May, an unusual delay.Read more: Supply Shock Is Wiping Out Hopes of Smartphone Sales GrowthMass assembly is only one part of Apple’s supply chain. The company and its many partners spend months or years sourcing individual components that are assembled into final products. Any disruptions in this complex network could slow the introduction of future devices.One person who works in Apple’s supply chain said not all operations are moving at normal speed because the flow of components to assemble is still slow. It will take another month or more to get parts moving steadily through the system, the person added.Jabil Inc., which makes iPhone casings, recently said its factories in China were “near normal,” while plants in other parts of the world were running 5% to 10% below capacity.“Most of that is due to supply chain issues. In some odd way, as we sit today, I think China is the least of our concerns,” CEO Mark Mondello told analysts during a March 13 conference call. “We’re able to accommodate all of the demand that’s in front of us as long as we can get parts.”A two-week lockdown in Malaysia is affecting several key suppliers that have operations in the country. Murata Manufacturing Co., Renesas Electronics Corp. and Ibiden Co., which make chips and circuit boards for Apple, have halted production there.Micron Technology Inc., which makes memory chips for Apple devices, is also impacted, but said an exemption allows “limited semiconductor operations to continue.” Texas Instruments Inc. and On Semiconductor Corp. have facilities in Malaysia, too.Apple has suppliers and operations in other countries that have been hammered by the virus, including Italy, Germany, the U.K. and South Korea.Samsung Display and LG Display Co. make iPhone screens in South Korea, while many Apple engineers working on cellular modems are based in Munich, Germany. Apple also operates former Dialog Semiconductor Plc facilities that work on power-management chips in Livorno, Italy, Nabern and Neuaubing, Germany, and Swindon, U.K.Apple has several hundred research and development engineers for future processors and underlying technologies in Israel, which is only letting citizens leave their homes for essential reasons, like buying food and medicine.Read more: Israel’s Netanyahu Orders Near Total LockdownIn the U.S., Apple has suppliers such as Corning Inc. for glass, and Qorvo Inc., Skyworks Solutions Inc. and Broadcom Inc. for wireless chips. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said recently that the virus “is going to have an impact on our semiconductor business, in particular in the second half of the fiscal year.”Chips take months to make and test, and companies build up months of inventory. That means Apple and other device makers may not have seen the worst of the disruptions yet.The virus is likely challenging Apple’s ability to design and test early versions of future products in Silicon Valley, which is grappling with a shelter-in-place mandate. The company has instated a remote work order, save for some mission-critical employees, for all its offices outside of China.San Francisco’s Shelter-in-Place Order Shows U.S. What’s to ComeThese struggles have yet to severely derail the 5G iPhone launch in the fall. During China’s factory shutdown in February, Apple was able to build a limited number of test versions of the new models, one of the people familiar with the company’s supply chain said.Apple finalizes the majority of design features for new iPhones between November and December of the year prior to launch, the people said. It begins mass-producing new casings around April and then starts a late manufacturing stage called Final Assembly, Test and Pack in about May.Should Apple be unable to send full teams of engineers to China factories to finalize designs and resolve issues, this typical timeline could still slip, another person familiar with the company’s supply chain said.(Updates with Jabil comments in 12th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple’s Supply Chain Woes Linger Even as China Recovers
2020-03-20,"The coronavirus pandemic has forced economic shutdowns around the world, as nations and governments try to cope with the ill and prevent or slow the further spread of the disease. Stock markets have crashed in recent weeks; the Dow Jones is down 32% from its most recent peak, and the S&P 500 has lost 29%. With the advent of a true bear market cycle, economists are growing more certain in their warnings of a recession this year.But despite the near-certainty that an epidemic-related recession is on the way (or already here), there is considerable doubt that it will be long-lasting in its effects. Economic conditions were reasonably strong before the coronavirus hit, and both the January and February jobs reports showed better than expected gains in employment and increases in wages. So, it may be no surprise that investment bank Morgan Stanley sees current conditions as an opportunity for traders.Expanding on that, the bank’s CIO of Wealth Management, Lisa Shalett, describes the main indexes as “close to a bottom.” She adds, “Now we see some very good opportunities to dollar-cost average back into a market that’s likely to bump around this bottom,” and says that investors should expect another three to six months on market weakness. Her colleague Mike Wilson gives a concurring analysis, pointing out that by now the markets are “pricing in” recession conditions, and that, with prices this close to bottom, now is the time to get back into stocks.In the mid-term, Morgan Stanley’s investment team sees a mild recession in the offing, with a shallow unemployment cycle. The bank’s analysts see earnings rebounding next year, and recommends moving into US-based large-cap stocks, as that is where the growth potential resides.Morgan Stanley didn’t just leave its forecast to the realm of general conditions. The firm’s analysts have also released reports on specific equities which they believe will lead the turnaround when markets improve. We’ve used TipRanks database to pull up the data on three of those stocks – each shows a Buy consensus rating, and greater than 10% upside potential. Let’s dig a little deeper.Chegg, Inc. (CHGG)Since everyone is home, and many school districts are closed, we’ll start with a company particularly well-suited to benefit from home schooling. Chegg is a tech company specializing in online textbook rental, flash cards, study guides, writing guides, and tutors – in short, all of the web-based services you’ll need for effective home schooling, whether short- or long-term. The company has expanded aggressively in the past two years, clearing its field by acquiring competitors.The value of Chegg’s niche is clear from a look at its earnings reports. The company has beaten the EPS forecasts in each of the last five quarters, and until the market collapse of the last few weeks it had been matching the S&P’s overall gains. The Q4 earnings capped this trend with a 17% EPS beat (35 cents per share reported) and a 34% year-over-year revenue gain, with the top line reported at $125.5 million.Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer sums up Chegg’s performance in clear, unmistakable terms: “Near-term, Chegg's value proposition becomes stronger as universities shift to virtual classes and students require more tools to supplement education. Long-term, a prolonged COVID-19 impact and potential recession in [our] bear case could result in higher student enrollment.”Baer reiterates his Buy rating on CHGG stock, and his price target, $49, predicts 63% upside growth, showing his confidence in the stock. (To watch Baer’s track record, click here)Chegg shares are rated a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, as 7 out of 8 recent reviewers came down on the Buy-side. The lone holdout rated the stock a Hold. The average price target of $44.75 suggests a premium of nearly 50% from the current share price of $31. (See Chegg stock analysis on TipRanks)Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Next up on our list is one of the largest players in the semiconductor chip industry. Broadcom was the sixth largest chip maker, by revenues, last year, and saw $22.6 billion in sales for the 2019 fiscal year. In Q4, the company brought in $5.8 billion revenues, and saw that improve sequentially to $5.9 billion in Q1 fiscal 2020. Earnings for Q1 were reported at $5.25, edging above the estimates but slipping 5.4% year-over-year.From an investor’s perspective, Broadcom’s value is enhanced by its reputation as a dividend champion. The current quarterly payment , $3.25, annualizes to $13, and gives an impressive yield of 6.8%, almost 3.5x the average among the company’s S&P peers, and far higher than Treasure bonds are yielding. Broadcom has been paying out dividends reliably for the last nine years, and has raised the payment three times in the last three years.5-star analyst Craig Hettenbach, writing on the stock for Morgan Stanley, rates AVGO shares a Buy. His $340 price target suggests an upside of 74%, strong by any standard.In his comments on the stock, Hettenbach says, “We … think the stock is poised to outperform after meaningfully lagging the past 2 years... This creates a low bar, and we think AVGO will be able to execute on synergies... If AVGO is able to execute in software it would add to what we view as a very compelling franchise in semis, creating a diversiﬁed, highly proﬁtable and cash generative business.” (To watch Hettenbach’s track record, click here)The analyst consensus on AVGO shares is a Strong Buy, based on no fewer than 16 Buy-side reviews against just 2 Holds. It’s not a cheap stock, selling for $191.20, but the $306.12 average price target implies an upside of 50% growth in the coming 12 months. (See Broadcom stock analysis on TipRanks)Adobe, Inc. (ADBE)We’ll wrap up with Adobe, a long-time staple of the markets. The company, first founded in 1982, has long been a leader in tech, invented the PDF format, and offers the popular Photoshop and Illustrator graphic editing software packages. The company’s strength is clear from its $11.2 billion in fiscal 2019 revenues.ADBE shares rose steadily for five months, from October last year until the current market drop began this past February 19. Unlike many companies, Adobe’s rise was high enough that it still shows a net gain for this period (up 17.6% from its most recent trough on October 23 last year). The company’s quarterly reports have reflected the share gains; Adobe has beaten the estimates in seven of the last eight quarters. In Q4 2019, ADBE showed $2.08 billion in revenue and $1.74 in EPS, which increased to $3.09 billion and $2.27 EPS in Q1 fiscal 2020.A solid financial base and popular, well-known products put Adobe in a sound position to hold its own during a market downturn, especially its software products are cloud-based and amenable to work-from-home conditions. According to Morgan Stanley, Adobe ‘carries momentum’ into the current viral epidemic crisis.The firm’s 5-star analyst Keith Weiss describes Adobe as a ‘steady ship in stormy seas,’ and writes of the stock, “In volatile environments, we favor owning the most durable EPS stories – where the business model, end-markets and management commitment to sustaining operating margins could enable profitability to better weather a difficult spending environment. In Q1 results, Adobe showed why they are included in our list of high-quality software franchises to own through the current volatility.”Weiss puts a $366 price target on ADBE shares, indicating room for potential growth of 19%, and supporting his Buy rating. (To watch Weiss’s track record, click here)Weiss is not alone is rating ADBE shares a Buy. The company has received another 13 Buy-side reviews in recent weeks, and taken with the 5 Holds the stock has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. Adobe does not pay a dividend, and the stock is expensive at $307, so investors are looking for gains in share appreciation. The average price target of $344.50 suggests that there is room for 12% upside growth in the coming year. (See Adobe stock analysis on TipRanks)",Morgan Stanley: 3 Stocks to Snap up Now

2020-03-26,"Another solid pop in the stock market has the Dow Jones Industrial Average 25% off its highs and up 18% from its lows. Something's got to give. That said, let's look at a few top stock trades for Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Broadcom (AVGO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comWe've seen a huge rebound in the market over the past few days and that goes for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock as well. Shares fell more than 50% from $320 in mid-February to sub-$160 in March.However, after rebounding $80 per share to $240, the stock is starting to look a bit tired. $240 appears notable on the chart here, while downtrend resistance (blue line) could be playing a role as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem From here, let's see if AVGO can hurdle and close above $240. Above it puts $260, then $275 on the table. If it can't clear $240, though, then the $200 to $210 area is on the table, and potentially lower. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Livongo Health (LVGO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comLivongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) stock has actually traded pretty well despite the surging in volatility. Now, the current setup is looking rather bullish.This setup is -- thankfully -- very simple. Rising uptrend support (blue line) is squeezing LVGO stock up into static resistance at $24. This is known as an ascending triangle, a bullish technical signal with traders looking for an upside breakout over resistance.The setup fails should uptrend support give way. Above $24, and $26 is possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Tesla (TSLA)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThe volatility has been running rampant in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, not that that's surprising to most investors. Shares are running into downtrend resistance (blue line), while trying to hold above the 100-day moving average.There are cleaner setups than TSLA out there at the moment. However, right in the middle of the range, investors will have their eye on this one. If it loses the 100-day moving average, a move back down to $450 is possible. Below that, and the 200-day moving average is in play.  * 5 Bank Stocks to Buy Now Because This Isn't 2008 Again Above $550 (downtrend resistance), however, and $600 is possible. This level has been notable amid the selloff. Over it puts the 50-day moving average in play near $650. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Micron (MU)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMicron (NASDAQ:MU) was in focus on Thursday after the company reported earnings. The stock is running right into the 50-week and 100-week moving averages, as well as the 2019 breakout level.I need to see MU reclaim and hold $46, putting $50 on the table. Below the $46 mark and a retest of the 200-day moving average is possible. Below that and long-term range support near $32.50 is possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Short S&P 500 ETF (SPXU)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAfter a strong rally in the S&P 500, some investors may be getting nervous about a potential pullback. One way to short or hedge a portfolio is via small sizes in inverted ETFs.I should note that the ProShares Ultra Short S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPXU) is not for everyone. It's a levered inverse ETF, and is risky business. However, after falling from $44 to $25 in just a few days -- highlighting the possible risk here -- this ETF is hitting the 200-day moving average and short-term uptrend support (blue line).If markets start to rollover or if we get a sell-the-news reaction to the stimulus bill, the SPXU might be good for a move north of $30. I can't stress enough the volatility with these types of ETFs. You've been warned.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-03-31,"The stock market is searching for direction after a robust multi-session rebound. That said, here are a few top stock trades to watch for Wednesday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to trade very well, up more than 50% from the recent lows to Tuesday's high. However, many are beginning to wonder if the market is starting to roll back over, as bulls begin to lose momentum. If that's the case, we may seem NVDA come under pressure too. If the stock can't push through $280 resistance, we need to see where support comes into play. My first downside level is $230. Below that and investors should keep an eye on the $200 mark. That's where the 50-week and 100-week moving averages come into play. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor long-term investors, that would be an excellent buying opportunity. Below $200 puts the recent low near $180 in play. On the upside, a move north of $280 puts $300 on the table.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Broadcom (AVGO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAnother semi stock that opened strong but struggled in the afternoon is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Shares thrust higher over $240, but fizzled out near $252. If the stock can push through $240 and reclaim Tuesday's high, it puts $260 on the table, followed by a test of some of its key moving averages up above.On the downside, use caution if AVGO loses its 200-week moving average (drawn on the chart near $227). Below that puts $200 on the table. Remember, this stock was sub-$160 not that long ago. Investors have to use caution, as the VIX remains elevated and there's no clear market direction at the moment.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Bank of America (BAC)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBank stocks continue to take it on the chin and that includes Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Above is a five-year weekly chart that shows the nearly 50% peak-to-trough decline investors have suffered through over the past few weeks.After dipping down to $18, we've seen a quick rebound in BAC. However, the stock has not been able to sustain momentum above $24, which keeps a retest of the 200-week moving average off the table.Over the last three weeks, BofA shares have been met by sellers near $23. That makes it hard to be a buyer, even if the valuation is low and dividend is attractive. A move below $21 could accelerate the selling pressure, putting $20 or lower on the table. Below $20 and a retest of the $18 low is possible.I don't know that we'll get the chance, but from a technical perspective, Bank of America stock would look more attractive in the $16.50 to $17 area. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: iQiyi (IQ)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comiQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) was enjoying plenty of upside in mid-February, but it too got caught up in the selloff despite being a streaming video play. After breaking out over $20 in December, IQ stock lost this mark in early March. This level and the 200-day moving average are now acting as resistance (blue circle), as shares now recoil lower. Fortunately, that gives us our levels. On the upside, bulls need to reclaim the $20 mark and the 200-day moving average to have a sustained rally. On the downside, see if IQ can avoid taking out the March lows. A higher low is not necessarily ideal because it means the stock will decline, but it's at least constructive. Below the March low is not constructive, and puts the 2019 lows in play near $15. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-04-06,"Broadcom’s (AVGO) group-high dividend yield is safe from coronavirus-related pressures, says Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer after speaking to Broadcom CFO Tom Krause.“Balance sheet remains robust ($6.4B cash) and dividend is safe (5.8% yield) . . . even under our “grey sky” scenario” commented the analyst. Right now, the company pays out a dividend of about $1.4 billion per quarter.He also points out that management noted a recovery in China demand. CFO Krause sees domestic demand in China recovering toward normal trends, with strong hyperscaler and telco spend. On the supply side, China manufacturing has rebounded to 80%-plus capacity.However, risks to consumer demand remain, with Schafer predicting “demand push outs coupled with likely demand destruction beginning in 2Q (June).” Schafer also sees a downward bias to handset units at Apple, Samsung, and with China OEMs.On the plus, AVGO strength is led by robust hyperscaler DC/ Cloud spend. And longer term, the analyst believes structural growth drivers (e.g., RF content increase in smartphones, DC/Cloud spend, etc.) provide tailwinds.Net-net the analyst concludes “We like AVGO’s impressive margin/FCF profile and group-high dividend yield. We reiterate Outperform and $350 target.” From current levels his $350 price target indicates significant upside potential of almost 50%.In fact, AVGO shows a bullish Strong Buy analyst consensus according to TipRanks.

2020-04-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. warned customers they’ll need to place orders for parts at least six months ahead of time, a surprisingly long lead time that points to wider than anticipated disruptions to the tech industry’s global supply chain.Lockdowns in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines are “closing or severely restricting business operations,” according to a letter to customers from Nilesh Mistry, Broadcom’s vice president of sales, dated April 13 and seen by Bloomberg News. He urged clients to put in their orders at least 26 weeks ahead of delivery -- meaning anything ordered now will get shipped right around the crucial holiday season. The typical lead time for deliveries is about two to three months.The missive from Broadcom -- which makes crucial components for Apple Inc.’s iPhone -- drives home concerns that Covid-19 is disrupting the tech supply chain well beyond China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged to impact global production lines. While China’s recovering its footing, lockdowns and quarantine orders in crucial regions such as Southeast Asia are exerting a still-unknown impact on the supply of everything from Nintendo Switches to smartphones.“Air and sea transport options have become unreliable and become more expensive and have increased delays,” Mistry wrote. His letter to customers didn’t specify which products are experiencing delayed shipments and what Broadcom’s normal lead time is between orders and delivery. “We hope that as the global community finds better methods to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the conditions will abate and we will be able to resume our normal operations.”The San Jose, California-based company declined to comment.Not Made in China Is Global Tech’s Next Big Trend: Supply LinesTerry Gou, whose Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. makes many of the world’s most recognizable consumer electronics including the iPhone, said in March China’s production restart had proven faster than expected. But he was worried that disruptions outside of China could become an issue as the coronavirus spreads globally.Broadcom is part of the same supply chain that most of the world’s chipmakers use to outsource production, testing and packaging of their products. It’s a critical link for products from mobile phones to data-center hardware. Any delays in the delivery of its semiconductors could spread throughout that supply network, potentially leading to missed launches of some of the world’s most high-profile and widely used electronic devices.Intel Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. will report earnings next week, when they’re certain to face questions from investors about their ability to keep their factories running and fill customer orders. Products from companies such as Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are built mostly by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., then tested and packaged by other companies in China and Southeast Asia. Some companies perform elements of the process in-house, and a shrinking group are capable of doing all the steps themselves.Wireless customers include Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., which use Broadcom chips to add Wi-Fi and other connectivity to some of the world’s best-selling smartphones. In networking, Broadcom’s switch chips are the market leaders, going into machinery that’s used by all of the biggest equipment makers, including Cisco Systems Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., and companies such as Amazon.com Inc. that build their own gear.Read more: Nintendo Is Likely to Suffer Global Switch Shortages From VirusOn March 12, Broadcom withdrew its annual sales forecast and gave weak near-term guidance, citing the impact of the pandemic. Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan told investors that, while fundamental demand was still strong and he hadn’t see any negative impact in the first quarter of the year, “visibility was lacking.”As part of a bond offering last week, Broadcom warned investors it was experiencing some disruption to parts of its global supply chain. In the “related risks” section of a regulatory filing, the company highlighted that a main warehouse and a number of assembly and test subcontractors are in Malaysia, which has shut down all non-essential businesses. The warehouse is fully operational, but “many of the facilities of our suppliers and service providers are not,” the company said at the time.“An extended closure of these facilities may require us to move assembly and test services to providers in other countries, and may, eventually, lead to a shortage of some components needed for our products,” Broadcom said. “In the event restrictive measures in Malaysia are intensified and our warehouse is shut down or required to operate at a reduced capacity, our ability to deliver product to our customers would be severely limited.”The test and assembly of chips includes coating them in protective plastic, adding electrical contacts that let them communicate with the rest of the device, and making sure they function. Such work is less expensive and easier to conduct than the processing of silicon wafers that make up the fundamental circuits of the chips. Much of the packaging work was shifted to countries with lower labor costs decades ago.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Sounds Alarm on Unforeseen Tech Industry Disruptions

Big stock charts can help us to see the big picture and make sense of seemingly senseless markets.Stocks that move sideways or show choppy price action are sometimes worth watching. If you look for the signs, you might find a stock that's ready to trend in one direction or the other.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Asian Stocks to Buy for a Post-Coronavirus Recovery And so, today we're going to check three big stock charts for Friday that look indecisive but might just be coiled for a serious move in the near future. Let's end the week on a high note and bring out the charts! AT&T (T)Source: Provided by Finviz Some folks consider AT&T (NYSE:T) stock to be a safety investment. It's the type of stock that your father and your grandfather might buy and hold for decades. Thus, it's not always the most volatile stock in the world, and Thursday's price action confirmed this. But maybe the future will bring some excitement for AT&T shareholders.  * Thursday's candlestick for T stock has a small body, indicating that the stock's opening and closing prices are not very far apart. On the other hand, the lower wick and the small body form a hammer candle. That's typically considered a bullish candlestick formation.  * T stock is still for below the 200- and 50-day moving averages. However, the stock has managed to stay above the 20-day moving average. The bulls really need for the price to hold above that moving average.  * Support is at the $26 level. That could be a buy zone if there's a bounce there, but if T stock breaks below it, that would be quite bearish. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Provided by Finviz Semiconductor standout Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is sometimes volatile, sometimes not. On Thursday AVGO stock chopped up, down, and sideways. Ultimately, there just wasn't much meat on the bone here for momentum or directional traders. Still, this stock has made some sizable moves in the past and you never know what's right around the corner.  * Although AVGO stock barely went anywhere on Thursday, at least the overall trend is still upwards. Still, the bulls will want to see higher prices in order to maintain that trend.  * The megaphone chart pattern has become extremely wide. This suggests broadening price moves in both directions, so caution is definitely advised.  * Momentum traders seeking to ride the uptrend should observe that AVGO still needs to break through the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Plus, there's some resistance at the $320 level. Charles Schwab (SCHW)Source: Provided by Finviz Some banks and brokers are thought of as American institutions. The third of our big stock charts, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), would probably fall into that category. It's an older company that's highly respected, but SCHW stock isn't always a lightning rod in terms of price action.In fact, on Thursday the stock fluctuated within a range, much to the chagrin of action-seeking traders. Nevertheless, it's a perfectly tradable stock that could have strong profit potential for nimble market participants.  * There wasn't a whole lot of action in SCHW stock on Thursday. The market is evidently still deciding whether the $35 level is going to provide support or resistance.  * SCHW stock is sitting right on the 20-day moving average. Hopefully for the bulls, the stock won't break below that important line.  * Volume has been dwindling, so that's another sign that the market hasn't made a firm decision on this stock yet. It's perfectly okay to sit on the sidelines and wait until the market is more decisive.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-04-21,"COVID-19 has upset the earnings momentum of S&P companies, which were experiencing strong profit growth until the pandemic struck. Even in this bleak scenario, there are certain stocks that offer enhanced buying opportunities, according to BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya.Semis Could Fill The Void A large group of companies cutting across industries are buckling under the financial strain engendered by the COVID-19 crisis and are either  eliminating or reducing dividend payouts,  Arya said in a Monday note.The semiconductor stocks could fill the void due to their strong balance sheets and exposure to &quot;more resilient parts of the global economy&quot; such as PC, cloud computing and broadband infrastructure, the analyst said.See Also:  Nvidia, Marvell, Monolithic Are Oppenheimer's Top Picks Ahead Of Semiconductor Earnings Broadcom, Intel Compelling Candidates Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), which are currently underweighted in income funds, are compelling candidates for these funds, Arya said.Income funds are those which focus on generating regular income for investors by investing in high-dividend stocks and debt instruments that fetch interest income.Both Broadcom and Intel  possess above-SPX dividend yields, solid FCF, low PE multiples and a record of consistent dividend growth, the analyst said. Notwithstanding investor concerns about Broadcom's large debt pile, history of large M&A deals and controversial foray into infrastructure software, the analyst said he likes Broadcom due to its &quot;best-in-class&quot; 71%-plus gross margin.Intel, though plagued by concerns surrounding its market share loss to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), is also an ideal candidate due to its strong incumbency, breadth of portfolio and the expanding size of the compute market, he said. Other Interesting Candidates BofA sees Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ: SWKS), Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) as other candidates that offer attractive but slightly lower dividend yields, solid FCF and low PE multiples.&quot;The upcoming earnings season is likely to be extremely volatile (weak Q2 outlooks) and could provide enhanced Buy opportunities in our view,&quot; Arya said. Semis Traditionally Underweighted The weighting of S&P 500 semi/semiconductor equipment stocks in income funds is relatively low compared to the rest of sector holdings, Arya said.Within the S&P 500 semiconductor stocks, Maxim Integrated Products Inc. (NASDAQ: MXIM), KLA Corp (NASDAQ: KLAC) Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN) and Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI) have the highest weighting in income funds, the analyst said. Among semiconductor companies with at least a 2% dividend yield, Intel and Broadcom have the lowest weighting, he said.BofA's Ratings, Price Targets   * Intel: Buy/$70  * Broadcom: Buy/$305  * AMD: Buy  * Skyworks: Buy/$110  * Applied Materials: Buy/$60  * Lam Research: Buy/$325  * Maxim Integrated: Underperform/$53  * KLA Corp: Buy/$185  * Texas Instruments: Buy/$120  * Analog Devices: Buy/$108Latest Ratings for INTC  DateFirmActionFromTo  Apr 2020B of A SecuritiesMaintainsBuy  Apr 2020Raymond JamesUpgradesUnderperformMarket Perform  Mar 2020Northland Capital MarketsMaintainsMarket Perform    View More Analyst Ratings for INTC   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Webcam, Computer Accessory Demand Booms As Workers Telecommute During Coronavirus Pandemic  * Intel Gains Market Share Over AMD In March: Survey(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-05-29,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Once again, U.S. stocks are rallying, with the S&P 500 up over 2% in this shortened week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining almost twice as much. And once again, corporate earnings reports don't seem to be much of a driver.As has been the case for most of this earnings season, investor reaction to earnings reports themselves has been rather muted. There were a couple of exceptions. StoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE) soared 27% on Wednesday after a blowout Q1 report. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) fell 12% the following day on soft guidance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut among major names, investors mostly shrugged. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) posted same-store sales growth over 20% and its stock still dropped over 1%.Investors seem to be looking past near-term earnings. That may change next week, as a number of companies with short-term pandemic tailwinds take center stage.After all, the market rally off March lows has come as the market looks forward to better days. For many of these companies, however, the good times should have arrived already. And that could set up some potential declines if results fall short of expectations -- or even if investors take the opportunity to sell the news.Here are the seven key earnings reports to watch in what should be an interesting week:  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure   * Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM)  * CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)  * Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB)  * Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)  * DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU)  * MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB)  * Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Zoom VideoSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 2, after market closeOne of the market's biggest ""pandemic plays"" gets its first big test on Tuesday afternoon. Among large-cap stocks, Zoom Video has been the third-best performer so far in 2020, rising 140%. Only DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and vaccine developer Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) have done better.But ZM stock has pulled back a bit in recent sessions, part of a broader rotation out of short-term winners. And that sets up an interesting fiscal first quarter release.After all, expectations are going to be sky-high. Zoom already has disclosed that its usage soared from 10 million daily participants in December to over 300 million in March.The questions are: How many of those users are paying? And how many will stick around as normalcy returns? With ZM trading at a staggering 74x trailing twelve-month revenue, Zoom needs to offer impressive answers on Tuesday. CrowdStrikeSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 2, after market closeCrowdStrike stock is another 2020 winner, gaining 59% year-to-date. As with Zoom, the pandemic is seen as a positive catalyst, as enterprises look to manage the security risks created by employees working from home.Unlike Zoom stock, however, CRWD still sits below all-time highs reached last year. Valuation certainly is stretched, at 34x revenue. But a potentially transformative company in the growing cybersecurity space could see that valuation expand if optimism continues to grow.A big report on Tuesday along with strong guidance, would seem to be a step in that direction. But it's worth considering the trading in fellow cybersecurity play Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) on Thursday afternoon.  * 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy With Great Potential That company handily beat analyst estimates and gave an above-consensus outlook. Shares dropped 1.6% in the after-hours session. It may take a monster quarter from CrowdStrike to extend the rally. As OKTA shows, even that might not be enough. Campbell SoupSource: HeinzTeh / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, June 3, before market openBefore the pandemic hit, Campbell Soup stock had traded sideways for about five months, trading mostly between $46 and $48. The last three months have seen enhanced volatility, but after all that movement, CPB still sits at $49 ahead of earnings next week.Clearly, there's still a ""wait and see"" approach from the market as Campbell executes a pivot into faster-growing categories like snacks and organic foods. But Wednesday morning's fiscal third quarter release might finally break the range.After all, consumer stocking and shuttered restaurants drove higher grocery sales in the quarter. Kroger (NYSE:KR) posted same-store sales growth of 30% in March. Campbell needs to show that it was able to capture some of that growth. Investors may not get a better quarter with which to judge the success of Campbell's transformation.With fellow packaged food play J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) reporting on Thursday morning, it's an interesting week for the sector as well. We haven't seen too many key reports from the industry since late April. Will investors still buy these defensive names in a more aggressive market that's looking to a more normal economy? BroadcomSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeSemiconductor stocks have held up reasonably well so far in 2020. Widely-held names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sit not far from their highs. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down just 2% year-to-date.Broadcom hasn't fared quite as well, with a 10% YTD decline. A strong fiscal Q2 report on Thursday could inspire confidence and allow AVGO to join peers in challenging past highs.But it's also a big report for the sector. Chief executive officer Hock Tan is widely respected, and his commentary on demand can move other chip names. For instance, chip stocks began rallying in early October, just weeks after Tan called a bottom in the business after his company's Q3 report.Meanwhile, Broadcom's reach is, well, broader than that of many other large-cap names. Its results could signal wider trends in tech as enterprises respond to the pandemic.  * 25 Stocks to Buy for the Reopening Rally Broadcom earnings often don't get the headlines accorded other chip giants. But its reports should be required reading for investors in any environment, particularly this one. MongoDBSource: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeYet another enterprise software provider with a sky-high valuation reports next week, as MongoDB releases first quarter results. Shares of the database platform operator aren't quite as expensive as ZM or CRWD, but at 28x sales are hardly cheap. A 64% gain YTD raises concerns about expectations.But MDB is a more 'under the radar' play than those larger software plays. And the tailwinds behind the company aren't quite as clear, or perhaps as stiff, as those benefiting CrowdStrike and Zoom. As a test for broader worries about valuation in software, MDB might be more useful than the better-known companies reporting earlier in the week. Slack TechnologiesSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeTwo more pandemic plays report on Thursday afternoon. For Slack, the fiscal Q1 report seems like a huge opportunity.'Work from home' should be a tailwind for Slack as much as Zoom. Both companies are useful in connecting remote employees, and should benefit from what increasingly looks like a secular trend.  * 7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks for 2020 Yet while WORK has doubled from March lows, the stock is up 'only' 44% so far this year, and sits about even to August levels. A big report could continue the rally and lead WORK to the kind of breakout to new highs that ZM and CRWD have seen. DocuSignSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeDocuSign is yet another software play reporting next week with a huge valuation and a secular tailwind. Adoption no doubt has picked up amid closed offices and shut-in consumers. Presumably, once users move to e-signatures from paper copies, they don't return.But DocuSign may have less room for error than other software plays, even if a 24x revenue multiple makes valuation more reasonable (at least in context). The company faces a tough competitor in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), who can leverage its existing user base for its Adobe Sign. And DocuSign still needs to prove it can drive the incremental margins for which investors are paying so dearly at the moment.As with so many earnings reports next week, this seems like a crucial test for DocuSign itself. The sheer number of high-multiple, high-growth companies releasing earnings reports makes the week a crucial test for a market trying to claw back to past levels.

2020-06-01,"(Bloomberg) -- In his quest to expand U.S. mobile broadband capacity, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai hasn’t been afraid to anger colleagues in government.He’s taken on the Pentagon, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as well as the departments of Transportation and Energy. Those agencies have warned that his plans to reallocate spectrum could endanger national security, harm weather forecasts, loosen control of the electrical grid and degrade vehicle safety.So far, Pai has prevailed.“Pai is willing to get himself on the hot seat,” said Doug Brake, telecom policy director for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based policy group that works to accelerate innovation.The fights are worth billions of dollars as industries jockey for rights to airwaves, riding a boom in usage for such things as online shopping, streaming television and social media. Appetite for gadgets and the airwaves on which to run them is only growing: the U.S. will have 1.2 billion mobile connected devices by 2023, up from 560 million in 2018, according to a forecast by Cisco Systems Inc.Pai’s independence may be tested in coming months as President Donald Trump has ordered the FCC to draw up regulations to keep social media companies such as Twitter Inc. from censoring political speech.“This debate is an important one,” Pai said in a statement. “The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce.”Pai, whose office didn’t reply to requests for comment, has an insiders’ profile that doesn’t suggest a penchant for inter-agency skirmishing. He is a former FCC commissioner, agency staff lawyer and U.S. Senate aide, and before that an attorney for Verizon Communications Inc. President Donald Trump elevated him three years ago to chairman of the commission, which was created in 1934 to keep radio signals straight and now doing the same with wireless broadband.Pai, 47, presents a whimsical public face for an agency steeped in arcane technical policy making. He spices his remarks with pop-culture references, citing the TV sitcom “The Office” and the film “The Big Lebowski.” His Twitter feed branches from telecom policy into philosophy, architecture and sports teams from Kansas City, not far from his childhood home in Parsons, Kansas.As chairman, he has made priorities of pruning regulations and pushing for more mobile broadband to feed the nation’s insatiable appetite. With backing from the agency’s Republican majority, he’s compiled a series of victories for the wireless industry -- and at times setbacks for older uses of airwaves.NOAA, for example, said the FCC’s push to reallocate some spectrum would set back satellite-assisted weather forecasting decades. The Transportation Department warned about road safety when a patch of airwaves set aside for driverless cars was reassigned. The Energy Department opposed taking spectrum used by the power companies.Perhaps most memorably, the Defense Department raised alarms about the FCC’s April 20 approval of a mobile broadband network, saying the service will interfere with military and civilian GPS.Wins and losses are closely linked in airwaves policy because of the nature of spectrum -- the invisible electromagnetic waves that carry communications. Each slice of airwaves can carry one use; a second use on the same frequencies threatens interference, just as a shouted conversation in a room can drown out a quiet chat.To avoid conflicts, regulators including the FCC put different services on separate airwaves. Antennas listen for the chatter on their assigned channels, and don’t pick up signals at higher and lower frequencies, which in turn are left to other users.Assignments, including some set decades ago, have come under question as the mobile broadband revolution deepens, bringing fresh demand for airwaves to handle booming wireless traffic. Old services are being forced to move to different airwaves or share their frequencies with new arrivals.Pai’s FCC has worked to set up frequencies for more Wi-Fi and the high-speed gadgetry that will combine to form the 5G revolution of fast, ubiquitous wireless connections -- a priority for the White House and big tech and telephone companies. The changeover promises such wonders as remote surgery, autonomous cars, rich virtual reality video feeds, and factories humming with connected equipment.Pai takes credit for rearranging a dozen swaths of spectrum. The amount of airwaves affected is more those used by all U.S. mobile broadband providers, Pai said in a video posted on the agency website last year.Friction is inevitable as broadband and other wireless technologies vie for space in the crowded tableau of airwaves swaths, known as bands.“Finding new bands or new opportunities to reallocate for new purposes is more difficult than ever before,” said FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly, a Republican. “There’s no greenfields to pick from. And so finding new spectrum for a new purpose means reallocating someone who already exists there.”To others, the FCC’s airwaves fights show lax management by the Trump administration, leaving cabinet officers to push their own airwaves priorities.“This is a result of running the administration as if it were an episode of ‘The Apprentice,’” said Harold Feld, senior vice president with the policy group Public Knowledge. “The federal agencies have just stopped cooperating.”Space Force Commander General John Raymond said in a May 6 congressional hearing that Ligado Networks LLC’s plans for a mobile broadband network would interfere with GPS receivers, which rely on faint signals from satellites, and harm training.The FCC shot back that it wouldn’t be moved by “baseless fear mongering.”In a May 26 letter to Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Pai defended the Ligado decision, saying it “included strict conditions to ensure that GPS operations continue to be protected from harmful interference.”In a teleconference with lawmakers on May 19, Pai said “America needs to lead in 5G and that requires us to think creatively about a variety of different spectrum bands.”Changes keep coming. The FCC in April voted to allow Wi-Fi on the 6 gigahertz airwaves, despite an expression of concern from the Energy Department. Utilities said the change risks interference to electric, water, and gas transmission and distribution systems. Chipmaker Broadcom Inc. called the action “momentous” and “a definitive moment in U.S. wireless history.”Airwaves AuctionMobile providers will get more opportunities in an auction slated to begin in July. Another, potentially larger airwaves sale is to begin Dec. 8 as the FCC offers a wide swath of prime airwaves now used by satellite providers such as Intelsat SA and SES SA. The satellite providers will move aside, keeping enough frequencies to serve current customers; new users will offer mobile broadband.Bidders may include largest U.S. providers Verizon, AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., who all snapped up airwaves in earlier FCC auctions.“It isn’t easy to get the government to move quickly on anything,” Meredith Attwell Baker, president of CTIA, a wireless industry trade group with members including AT&T and Verizon, said in an email. Pai “deserves tremendous credit for making sure wireless providers have the spectrum they need to meet our nation’s 5G ambitions.”Not easy, and not without turmoil. The debate with NOAA concerned power levels for an airwaves swath that Verizon won in an FCC auction. The disagreement persisted for much of 2019 before agencies, working with the State Department, arrived at a unified position. The result was a lower power level than the FCC wanted, and more than NOAA preferred.Bipartisan leaders of both the House Science Committee and the Commerce Committee have asked the Government Accountability Office to probe how the NTIA and other federal agencies interact to resolve spectrum disputes.“‪Under the Trump administration, spectrum coordination efforts have repeatedly failed,” Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, the Commerce Committee chairman, said in an email.Representative Greg Walden, of Oregon, the Commerce Committee’s top Republican, in an email said that “not everyone will be satisfied all of the time” as spectrum allocations are made.Others see confusion.“In this administration, instead of having everyone pull in the same direction, we have disputes that are pulling us apart,” said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, the agency’s senior Democrat.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","FCC Chief Takes On the Pentagon...and DOT, and NOAA, and Energy"

2020-06-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chipmaker that supplies Apple Inc. and other large electronics makers, gave a lackluster forecast, as weak demand for smartphone parts overshadowed rising orders from data center owners.Revenue in the three months ended in July will be $5.75 billion, plus or minus $150 million. That compares with an average analyst prediction of $5.77 billion, according to data compiled earlier on Thursday by Bloomberg.The San Jose, California-based company makes chips that filter radio signals and provide WiFi connections in iPhones and other smartphones. With much of the world’s population confined to their homes, handset demand has dropped. Broadcom is also a key supplier of switch chips, the complex semiconductors that manage data traffic in networking equipment, an area where demand is surging.Read more: Smartphone Shipments Projected to Fall a Record 12% in 2020“Looking ahead, our third-quarter guidance for semiconductors reflects a surge in demand from cloud, telecom and enterprise customers, offset by supply chain constraints and an expected substantial reset in wireless,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in a statement.Tan explained that his “large North American smartphone customer” -- typically how he refers to Apple -- is undergoing a “product cycle delay.” That means the usual improvement in wireless-related orders that comes in the company’s fiscal third quarter, which runs through July, will now be seen in the following three-month period. This implies the debut of the next iPhone will come later than its usual September release. Phone makers typically order chips months in advance of building the devices.Balancing that weakness in smartphones, orders for chips used in data center gear have strengthened into the current period, Tan said. Bookings remain “extremely strong” he said. A bright spot for the industry has been the rush to buy equipment by the large cloud-computing providers, who are spending to increase their capacity in an effort to meet a flood of extra traffic caused by the boom in remote work.Three months ago, Broadcom withdrew its annual sales forecast and gave weak near-term guidance, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Tan said in March that the supply chain hadn’t been hurt by the lockdown. Then in April, the company told customers to place orders at least six months ahead of time because of shelter-in-place rules in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. That supply chain is now on the mend, he said.Read more: Broadcom Sounds Alarm on Unforeseen Tech Industry DisruptionsBroadcom, one of the latest to report earnings in the tech sector, is giving an up-to-date view on demand as the economy crumbles in the midst of the pandemic.

2020-06-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a major Apple Inc. supplier, suggested the latest iPhones will be launched later than usual this year.Hock Tan, chief executive officer of Broadcom, discussed a “major product cycle delay” at a “large North American mobile phone” customer, during an earnings conference call with analysts on Thursday.Tan often refers to Apple this way. This time, the executive said the delay will mean the bump in wireless revenue experienced by Broadcom will happen one quarter later than usual this year.“We are in,” Hock said, referring Broadcom components in the iPhone. “The question is timing.”“This year, we do not expect to see this uptick in revenue until our fourth fiscal quarter,” the CEO added. “So accordingly, we expect, our wireless revenue in Q3 will be down sequentially.”Apple is planning to release its next iPhone line multiple weeks later than usual, Bloomberg News previously reported. The company typically unveils its new iPhones in the second half of September, but has occasionally, like in the case of the iPhone X in 2017, launched major new models later in the year.Phone makers usually order components months ahead of product launches. Apple typically releases new versions of the iPhone in September. If it followed that time line, Broadcom would receive orders in the current quarter, which runs through July. The chipmaker said that’s not happening this year. “Because of product cycle delays the trough for our fiscal year will be Q3. This coming quarter,” Tan said. “Nothing has changed in terms of designs, nothing has changed in terms of the content,” including more 5G components, the CEO added. The delay to the new iPhone release is due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has slowed Apple engineer travel to China to finalize the devices and required employees to mostly work from home in the early months of 2020.Broadcom’s Tan also warned about “supply constraints and an expected substantial reset in wireless” when the company’s results came out on Thursday.

2020-06-05,Broadcom's (AVGO) fiscal second-quarter 2020 results reflect strength in infrastructure software segment.,Broadcom (AVGO) Q2 Earnings & Revenues Surpass Estimates
2020-06-05,"Broadcom (AVGO) has reported an in-line April quarter, and guided to an in-line July quarter at $5.75B (consensus $5.8B). Shares in AVGO gained 1% in Thursday’s after-hours trading following the earnings release.Specifically, Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $5.14 was in-line with consensus expectations, while GAAP EPS of $1.17 beat by $0.21. Revenue of $5.74B climbed 4% from the previous year, and topped Street estimates by $50M. Meanwhile Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $3.2B, again, coming in slightly higher than the $3.11B consensus.Semiconductor Solutions reported revenue of $4,027M (-1% y/y) but Infrastructure software revenue came in strong at $1,715M (+21% y/y).“Second quarter results were in-line with our expectations, and saw limited impact from the effects of COVID-19,” commented Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom Inc. “Looking ahead, our third quarter guidance for semiconductors reflects a surge in demand from cloud, telecom and enterprise customers, offset by supply chain constraints and an expected substantial reset in wireless.”At the same time the company declared a $3.25/share quarterly dividend, in line with previous payouts, for a forward yield of 4.2%.“We generated record quarterly free cash flow of over $3 billion and reinforced our balance sheet, ending the quarter with over $9 billion of cash,” explained Tom Krause, CFO of Broadcom Inc. As a result, AVGO “remain[s] committed to maintaining our dividend while we navigate these unprecedented times.”Following the report Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated his AVGO buy rating while ramping up his price target from $315 to $325 (5% upside potential).“We continue to see AVGO as well positioned, driven by 5G networking and wireless, software M&A, strong FCF, and dividends, with near-term COVID-19 headwinds subsiding” Rakesh told investors, adding that the company is currently trading at an attractive ~13.1x F21E (Oct) P/E.Likewise RBC Capital’s Mitch Steves boosted his price target from $300 to $340 noting that AVGO is seeing much more demand than it can currently supply for Q3. “AVGO is seeing strong uplift in demand from the ramp of next-generation deep learning inference chips” the analyst wrote, while demand from enterprise customers for data protection controllers has recovered and is showing strength.Overall, AVGO scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus, with 19 buy ratings offset by 2 hold ratings. However, the average analyst price target stands at $303, indicating downside potential of 2%. Shares in AVGO are trading down 2% year-to-date. (See AVGO stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Slack Plunges 15% Post-Print Despite Multi-Year Amazon Deal  Ebay Lifts Quarterly Sales and Profit Forecast; Shares Jump To All-Time High  Microsoft Buys Metaswitch For Cloud-Based Telecoms Move, 5G Expansion More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Amazon Now Also Under Investigation By Washington State – Report   * Blackstone To Invest $337 Million In Medtronic’s Diabetes Programs   * Merck’s Gardasil Receives FDA Nod For Expanded Cancer Indications   * Match Group and Bumble Put To Bed All Litigation Claims","Broadcom Reports Solid Results, Dividend As Analysts Boost PTs"

2020-06-23,"The late, great, Neil Peart wrote, in Tom Sawyer, “He knows changes aren’t permanent, but change is.” His words are an apt description of our modern world, an ever-changing landscape of pending tech. Right now, the shiny new change is 5G.Even the coronavirus couldn’t fully derail the coming build-out of the new 5G networks. It only delayed it. China and Korea are leading the world right now in bringing 5G networks online, with the US expanding its own new systems and Europe lagging behind. In the US, most urban areas have at least partial 5G connectivity online, and the major service providers are working to connect those centers.For investors, the key here will be finding companies that are primed to gain as 5G expands. It’s tempting to invest directly in the service providers; AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile/Sprint, the three largest wireless providers, are all heavily invested in 5G networks. But they face certain headwinds that make them less than ideal as 5G investments – for the present. They are absorbing the costs of the new networks, but without bringing in the new service fees to cover those costs. From a consumer perspective, the new service is more expensive, but hasn’t surpassed existing 4G in convenience – yet.This leaves investors seeking the right place to put their money, to benefit from 5G rollouts. Two segments come to mind, both deeply involved in different ways. The first is semiconductor chips; the second, surprisingly, are real estate investment trusts. These companies, inhabiting such different niches, find themselves well-positioned to profit – for different reasons – as 5G networks expand. Those different reasons are interesting to explore, as we open the TipRanks database to see what makes semiconductors and REITs compelling investments for 5G. Let's take a closer look. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)First up is a long-running major market player, a large-cap stock and a perennial champion for dividend investors. Broadcom is also one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip makers, ranked the sixth biggest by annual revenue in 2019, and reporting $5.25 billion in earnings in the first quarter of 2020.Broadcom has been making waves in 5G throughout 1H20. In February, the company announced completion of a 5G switching portfolio, designed for high-capacity switches and offering the feature set needed to meet new 5G tech standards. In March, Broadcom was noted by Forbes as one of the leaders in 5G wireless infrastructure; the company is deeply invested in providing chips that power the new devices. And earlier this month, handset maker Nokia, which has been having trouble in recent months sourcing 5G chips in sufficient quantity to meet demand, signed Broadcom on a supplier of 5G chips for Nokia’s ReefShark line.With all of this good news for the company, it’s no wonder that AVGO shares have climbed 85% since hitting bottom on March 18, dramatically outperforming the broader markets. Q2 saw revenue grow to $5.74 billion, up 9% sequentially. And, despite the ongoing pandemic, the company has maintained its generous dividend, declaring $3.25 per share on June 4. The current dividend annualizes to $13 and gives an impressive yield of 4.3%.Writing on AVGO for Deutsche Bank is 5-star analyst Ross Seymore, rated 26 overall in the TipRanks analyst database. Seymore notes the Nokia arrangement, and points out that it plays to Broadcom’s strengths in addressing the 5G needs of OEM customers: “We view [the Nokia] announcement as evidence that the co's investments and engagement with infrastructure OEMs on solutions within the base station which AVGO referenced in December, are bearing fruit. Broadcom's strength in custom ASICs and in routing and switching have enabled the co to leverage its Ethernet technology in bringing the network to the Edge (base stations).”To this end, Seymore rates AVGO a Buy alongside a $360 price target, indicating a potential 16% upside for the stock this year. (To watch Seymore’s track record, click here)All in all, Broadcom has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, with 24 reviews breaking down to 21 Buys and only 3 Holds. Shares are priced at $311.30, and the average price target of $350.18 suggests an upside potential of 13%. (See AVGO stock analysis on TipRanks)SBA Communications (SBAC)The next stock on our list operates as a REIT, focused on cellular infrastructure sites. Specifically, SBA Communications owns small cells, distributed antenna systems, and traditional cell sites throughout the Americas and South Africa. SBA both leases and develops the properties in its portfolio – a business that perfectly positions the company to profit as telecom carriers and providers increase and densify their networks to accommodate 5G technology. This process naturally requires new cell towers, antenna placements, and small cells – and that is SBA’s core business.Standing as it does at the center of the 5G expansion, SBA is already showing gains. The company’s stock is up 4.6% since February, having fully recovered from the market collapse in February/March and survived several weeks of price volatility that followed. It’s not just share price that has gained despite coronavirus-inspired recessionary pressures. SBA has reported modest sequential gains in quarterly earnings since the beginning of 2019, a trend that continued in Q1 2020. Credit Suisse analyst Sami Badri is confident in this company’s business model and solid balance sheet. He writes, “We believe the evidence points to an initial majority mid-band spectrum buildout. Mid-band spectrum will mainly be utilized on macro towers, given its solid propagation characteristics, therefore the initial 5G wave should favor macro tower focused SBAC… With SBAC capable of raising debt at such modest rates (3.875% May 19th) while maintaining its broader tower asset ROIC of 10%, we are comfortable and constructive with its current leverage profile.”Badri rates SBAC an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $361 price target indicates his belief in a 23% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Badri’s track record, click here)Overall, the analyst consensus rating on SBAC, a Strong Buy is based on a 9-to-1 split between Buy and Hold reviews. The average price target, $328, implies an upside of 12% from the current trading price of $293.78. (See SBAC stock analysis on TipRanks)American Tower (AMT)Last up is American Tower, the Boston-based REIT with a global portfolio containing more than 180,000 cellular broadcast tower and wireless communication sites. The core of the portfolio is in the US, but the company has been expanding internationally, both to supplement the core holdings and to take advantage of the global nature of wireless com systems. AMT currently holds more than 40,000 US cellular sites, along with 75,000 Asia and 37,000 in Latin America.As wireless providers expand their networks to introduce 5G connections, AMT is a logical beneficiary. Due to the shorter range of 5G systems, a denser tower network will be required; AMT, which owns and leases such sites, is ramping up acquisitions to take advantage. AMT derives most of its customer base – on the order of 88% – AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint/T-Mobile. These companies are not going anywhere, and lend a sense of permanence to AMT’s holdings.In addition, due to the long-term nature of cellular leases, AMT features a high proportion of recurring revenue in its portfolio – a feature that has insulated the company from the impact of COVID-19. AMT reported sequential gains in earnings for Q1, the coronavirus quarter, and share prices have shown a net gain during the last few months of market volatility.Analyst Sami Badri covers AMT shares as well, and he writes of the stock: “We expect Massive MIMO antennas to place more weight on towers, while taking up the same amount of physical vertical space or more on the structure. This will result in more revenue from tower leasing activity for AMT, which we expect to appear primarily as amendment revenues.”Badri is bullish on AMT, giving the stock a Buy rating with a $300 price target. His target implies an upside of 13% in the coming 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. AMT’s rating is based on 14 reviews, including 12 Buys and just 2 Holds. Shares are selling for $265.60, and the $269.42 suggests a modest upside this year.

2020-06-29,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China are moving beyond bellicose trade threats to exchanging regulatory punches that threaten a wide range of industries including technology, energy and air travel.The two countries have blacklisted each other’s companies, barred flights and expelled journalists. The unfolding skirmish is starting to make companies nervous the trading landscape could shift out from under them.“There are many industries where U.S. companies have made long-term bets on China’s future because the market is so promising and so big,” said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s head of international affairs. Now, they’re “recognizing the risk.”China will look to avoid measures that could backfire, said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to the nation’s cabinet and a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. Any sanctions on U.S. companies would be a “last resort” because China “is in desperate need of foreign investment from rich countries for both economic and political reasons.”Nevertheless, pressure is only expected to intensify ahead of the U.S. elections in November, as President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden joust over who will take a tougher line on China.Trump has blamed China for covering up the coronavirus pandemic he has mocked as “Kung Flu,” accused Beijing of “illicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets” and threatened the U.S. could pursue a “complete decoupling” from the country. Biden, likewise, has described President Xi Jinping as a thug, labeled mass detention of Uighur Muslims as unconscionable and accused China of predatory trade practices.And on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats have found rare unity in their opposition to China, with lawmakers eager to take action against Beijing for its handling of Covid-19, forced technology transfers, human rights abuses and its tightening grip on Hong Kong.“China is going to be a punching bag in the campaign,” said Capital Alpha Partners’ Byron Callan. “But China is a punching bag that can punch back.”China has repeatedly rejected U.S. accusations over its handling of the pandemic, Uighurs, Hong Kong and trade, and it has fired back at the Trump administration for undermining global cooperation and seeking to start a “new cold war.” Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month said China had no interest in replacing the U.S. as a hegemonic power, while adding that the U.S. should give up its “wishful thinking” of changing the country.Both sides have already taken a series of regulatory moves aimed at protecting market share.The U.S. is citing security concerns in blocking China Mobile Ltd., the world’s largest mobile operator, from entering the U.S. market. It’s culling Chinese-made drones from government fleets and discouraging the deployment of Chinese transformers on the power grid. The Trump administration has also tried to constrain the global reach of China’s Huawei Technologies Co., the world’s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer.Meanwhile, China prevented U.S. airline flights into the country for more than two months and, after the U.S. imposed visa restrictions on Chinese journalists, it expelled American journalists. It has stepped up its scrutiny of U.S. companies, with China’s state news agency casting one probe as a warning to the White House. China also has long made it difficult for U.S. telecommunications companies to enter its market, requiring overseas operators to co-invest with local firms and requiring authorization by the central government.One of the most combustible flash points has been the Trump administration’s campaign to contain Huawei by seeking to limit the company’s business in the U.S. and push allies to shun its gear in their networks.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission moved to block devices made by Huawei and ZTE Corp. from being used in U.S. networks. And the Commerce Department has placed Huawei on blacklists aimed at preventing the Chinese company from using U.S. technology for the chips that power its network gear, including tech from suppliers Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc.After suppliers found work-arounds, Commerce in May tightened rules to bar any chipmaker using American equipment from selling to Huawei without U.S. approval. The step could constrain virtually the entire contract chipmaking industry, which uses equipment from U.S. vendors such as Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. in wafer fabrication plants.The curbs also threaten to cripple Huawei. Although the company can buy off-the-shelf or commodity mobile chips from a third party such as Samsung Electronics Co. or MediaTek Inc., going that route would force it to make costly compromises on performance in basic products.Huawei was on a list the Pentagon unveiled last week of companies it says are owned or controlled by China’s military, opening them to increased scrutiny. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing accused the Trump administration of “violating the very market economy principle the U.S. champions.”“We are strongly opposed to this,” the foreign ministry said Sunday of the Pentagon’s designation. “China urges the U.S. to stop suppressing Chinese companies without reason and provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies to operate normally in the U.S.”After the new restrictions, the editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper tweeted that China would retaliate using an “unreliable entities list” that it first threatened at the height of the trade war last year. Although China didn’t identify companies on the list, the Global Times has cited a source close to the Chinese government as saying U.S. bellwethers such as Apple Inc. and Qualcomm could be targeted.The fallout could extend to companies heavily reliant on Chinese supply chains, as well consumer-facing brands eager to expand sales in Asia. Boeing Co., which recorded $5.7 billion of revenue from China in 2019, and Tesla Inc., the biggest U.S. carmaker operating independently in China, are among companies most exposed if relations sour further.“We’re playing in a much wider field now,” said Jim Lucier, managing director of research firm Capital Alpha Partners. “We’re not simply talking about ‘you tariff me’ and ‘I tariff you.’ The playing field is virtually unlimited.”Planes and AutomobilesU.S. automakers have also been singed. In June, China fined Ford Motor Co.’s main joint venture in the country for antitrust violations, saying Changan Ford Automobile Co. had restricted retailers’ sale prices since 2013.Aviation has been another source of tension, as both countries squabble over access to their skies. China’s decision to limit U.S. airlines operations to those services scheduled as of March 12 hurt carriers such as United Airlines Holdings Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc, and American Airlines Group Inc. that had suspended passenger flights to and from China because of the coronavirus pandemic.The U.S. responded earlier this month by initially threatening to ban all flights from China, then relenting to allow two flights weekly once Chinese officials eased their restrictions. Now, in what appears to be a staged de-escalation, China gave U.S. passenger carriers permission to operate four weekly flights to the country and earlier this month, the Trump administration matched the move by also authorizing four flights from Chinese airlines.It’s happening outside of aviation too. Consider the U.S. government’s decision to seize a half-ton, Chinese-made electrical transformer when it arrived at an American port last year and divert the gear to a national lab instead of the Colorado substation where it was supposed to be deployed. That move -- and a May executive order from Trump authorizing the blockade of electric grid gear supplied by “foreign adversaries” of the U.S. in the name of national security -- have already sent shock waves through the power sector.The effect has been to dissuade American utilities from buying Chinese equipment to replace aging components in the nation’s electrical grid, said Jim Cai, the U.S. representative for Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Co., the company whose delivery was seized. Although Cai said the firm has supplied parts to private utilities and government-run grid operators in the U.S. for nearly 15 years without security complaints, at least one American utility has since canceled a transformer award to the company, Cai said.Trump’s directive is tied to a broader effort to bring more manufacturing to the U.S. from China. “This is a part of the administration’s efforts to impair China’s supply chains into the United States,” said former White House adviser Mike McKenna.Escalating tensions could jeopardize the U.S. economic recovery as well as China’s trade commitment to buy $200 billion in American goods and services over the next two years. The country’s purchase of U.S. goods increased last month as the economy continued its recovery from the coronavirus shutdowns, but imports are still far behind the pace needed to meet the terms of the phase one trade deal, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from China’s Customs Administration.U.S.-China struggles also may factor into the November presidential election. Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton alleges in a new book that Trump asked Xi to help him win re-election by buying more farm products -- a claim the White House has dismissed as untrue.“I don’t expect one single blow to send this relationship in a tailspin,” the chamber’s Brilliant said. “Each side will calibrate their reactions in a way that will not tip the scales too far.”Take the recent spat over media access. After the U.S. designated five Chinese media companies as “foreign missions,” China revoked press credentials for three Wall Street Journal staff members over an article with a headline describing China as the “real sick man of Asia.”Then the Trump administration ordered Chinese state-owned news outlets to slash staff working in the U.S. Beijing responded in March by effectively expelling more than a dozen U.S. journalists working in China.Both the U.S. and China have ample opportunities to ratchet up regulatory pressure. A bill passed by the Senate last month could prompt the delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges if American officials aren’t allowed to review their financial audits.And last week, as the U.S. State Department imposed visa bans on Chinese Communist Party officials accused of infringing the freedom of Hong Kong citizens, a senior official made clear the move was just an opening salvo in a campaign to force Beijing to back off new restrictions on the city.China, similarly, can slow licensing decisions and regulatory approvals, launch investigations under its anti-monopoly law and squeeze financial firms that want to do business in the country. For instance, the country could rescind pledges to let U.S. financial firms take controlling stakes in Chinese investment banking joint ventures, according to a Cowen analyst.“China will not make any significant compromise and will retaliate whenever and wherever possible,” said Shi, the Renmin University professor.Companies are still lured to China and its massive local market -- and tensions with the U.S. don’t overcome the Asian superpower’s appeal. Just one-fifth of companies surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce in China late last year said they had moved or were considering moving some operations outside of the country, part of a three-year downward trend.But the coronavirus pandemic has subsequently pushed more companies to reckon with the risks of relying too heavily on any single country for their supply chains, amid existing concerns about forced technology transfers, cost and rising tensions that could damp investment in China.China is no longer the lowest-cost manufacturer, and companies are more reluctant to invest there, said James Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“Everyone would like to be in the China market -- everyone wants it to be like 2010 -- but things are changing.”(Updates with trade data in 28th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S.-China Feud Gets Nasty With Red Tape as Stealth Weapon

2020-07-08,"Synaptics Inc (SYNA) has now signed definitive agreements to acquire certain assets and manufacturing rights for Broadcom’s (AVGO) wireless IoT business for about $250 million in an all-cash transaction. The deal is expected to close in Synaptics’ first quarter of fiscal year 2021.Under the terms of the agreements, Synaptics will acquire certain rights to Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market as well as future roadmap devices designed in advanced process nodes.According to Synaptics, the deal strengthens and accelerates its position in the fast-growing consumer IoT market. It expects the transaction to add $65 million in current annualized sales and provide significant revenue growth potential.“Expanding our offering in the high growth IoT market has been one of the major focus areas for Synaptics and the addition of best-in-class wireless connectivity technology to our portfolio significantly enhances our overall position,” said Michael Hurlston, CEO of Synaptics.“This acquisition complements Synaptics’ ability to sell into a broad range of devices such as IP cameras, smart displays, speakers, home automation, and gaming consoles – all of which require cutting-edge technologies including Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, Bluetooth 5.2 and GPS L5.”The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Synaptics’ non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP earnings post-close, and the company plans to finance the transaction from existing on-hand cash balance.Following the news, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy upgraded Synaptics from hold to buy with a price target of $73 (22% upside potential).He called Broadcom’s wireless connectivity products ‘best-in-class’ and told investors: “We are upgrading SYNA to Buy from Neutral based on our estimated $0.45 – $0.55 accretion to our FY21 non-GAAP EPS estimates that the Broadcom wireless IoT connectivity business can provide. We believe that with Synaptics management’s focus on IoT, the acquired $65mn/year revenue can grow roughly 5% – 10% annually.”Plus Cassidy believes that the deal helps lower the company’s dependence on the mobile display business, which faces low competitive barriers.Shares in SYNA rose 2% in Tuesday’s trading, taking the stock’s year-to-date loss to 9%.

It was founded in 1997 by Bob Parsons and is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. As of April, it was handling over 18.5 million customers and employs over 7,000 employees worldwide.Over the past month, GDDY stock shed 8.8% of its value. The company witnessed a 9% drop on June 24, when it announced that it would be implementing a restructuring program impacting 814 employees. The restructuring comes in the wake of the challenges the company faces in its outbound sales.According to the company, outbound sales have not been effective during the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, 814 employees would have to be relocated, laid off or transitioned to a different position within the company.GoDaddy will have to incur approximately $15 million in pre-tax charges from restructuring, which consist of severance payments and related costs. It will also have to recognize impairment expenses related to specific lease assets valued at $58 million. These measures have negatively impacted GDDY stock, and the company needs to ensure that the cost savings are re-invested to generate higher sales soon.

2020-07-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nvidia Corp. has the money and motive to buy British chip designer Arm Ltd. But as much as Arm’s parent SoftBank Group Corp. may be open to a transaction, this particular combination may not be its first choice.Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, a leading maker of graphics processing units, has in recent weeks approached SoftBank about a deal for Arm, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. A takeover would be the biggest ever of a semiconductor company, even after a five-year, $270 billion spree of industry consolidation.Strategically, a deal would make sense for Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, making the company a one-stop shop for his customers. Every graphics processor chip Nvidia currently sells requires another general processor chip, the technology in which Arm specializes. And Huang has often spoken bullishly about prospects for the so-called internet of things, where small networked sensors and devices become pervasive. Arm-based chips are power-efficient and small, matching his vision.What’s more, Nvidia can afford it. New Street Research analysts estimate that Arm might be valued at $44 billion in a year’s time, when an IPO is mooted. Even after completing the $6.3 billion acquisition of Israel’s Mellanox Technologies Ltd. in April, Nvidia has a net cash position and plenty of capacity to raise new debt. But Huang may not even need to touch his cash pile: Nvidia’s stock is a valuable currency after a 77% surge this year that values the firm at $256 billion.SoftBank has been exploring a sale or stock listing of Arm, which it acquired for $32 billion in 2016. But the nature of Arm’s business makes any outright acquisition by a chipmaker a difficult proposition, as Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anand Srinivasan has pointed out. The Cambridge, England-based firm licenses its designs for central processing units to many of the world’s chipmakers to adapt. These include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Broadcom Inc., and plenty more besides. Arm-based CPUs are the brains for most of the world’s smartphones.That also means that an acquisition by a chipmaker poses a significant regulatory challenge, because of the power it gives the new owner over its own competitors. That’s no different for Nvidia. Even though its core business is in graphics processing units, rather than CPUs, it competes with many of the firms that use Arm designs.SoftBank is under pressure from the activist investor Elliott Management Corp. to reduce the gap between the value of its holdings, which include a $172 billion stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and its own enterprise value. It may therefore want to avoid a deal that would attract drawn-out regulatory scrutiny, with no guarantee of success.An easier proposition for regulators might be a combination with Cadence Design Systems Inc. It, too, specializes in the intellectual property behind semiconductors, but Cadence doesn’t compete with Arm or its customers. Perhaps coincidentally, its CEO Lip-Bu Tan joined the SoftBank board just last month. An all-stock merger with Cadence would likely see SoftBank retain a majority stake in a new publicly traded entity. Nvidia might want a deal, but SoftBank may have better alternatives.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-07-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just 10 days ago, I noted that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s earnings and outlook served as proof that it’s truly the global king of chips. Since then, the company has grown even stronger, but more good news also increases the burden and will likely draw far more attention than it’s comfortable with.Being bigger and more indispensable sounds like a great position to be in. Yet that could also irk competition regulators, clients and governments that, amid a tech cold war, worry that one company may have become too powerful.The way that TSMC brushed off the pending loss of orders from Huawei Technologies Co. to raise its spending plan for the year is what had recently impressed me. Then last week, Intel Corp. revealed that its next, most-advanced chips would again be delayed, sending the American company’s stock down 16%. As colleague Tae Kim noted, investors have seen this movie before. Intel has slipped up too many times in recent years, allowing rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to take market share, and spurring Apple Inc. to drop Intel processors in favor of designing its own.Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan’s statement that manufacturing the chips could be outsourced made it worse. Once the global leader in both design and production, Intel would be eliminating its biggest competitive advantage against AMD — whose chips are made by TSMC — in their tussle over processors used in laptops, PCs and servers. The power shift was confirmed Monday morning. TSMC jumped by its 10% daily limit in Taiwan to a record high after the Taipei-based Commercial Times newspaper reported that Intel has placed an order for its 6 nanometer chips for next year. Not only would this be an unprecedented development for both client and supplier, the reported size of the contract — 180,000 wafers — is almost as large as that for long-time client AMD (200,000 wafers), which raised its own order. As a result, according to the newspaper, the manufacturer’s leading-edge capacity is fully booked for the first half of next year. A report in Taipei’s Economic Daily News meanwhile says that Apple will set up a display R&D plant within TSMC. Recent advances are starting to merge flat-screen display and semiconductor technologies, and the chipmaker finds itself at the center of the action.These new developments are where the responsibilities of TSMC’s crown will begin to weigh. It has a long list of clients whose needs must be met. Beyond Apple and Intel, global leaders including Nvidia Corp., Qualcomm Inc., MediaTek Inc. and Broadcom Inc. all rely on TSMC to churn out chips for the planet’s electronics devices. Great, except that expanding takes years and billions of dollars. Overbuild and you’re left with idle capacity that’s quickly depreciating and burning a hole in your income statement.Another thing to keep in mind is that for all of Intel’s woes, TSMC isn’t perfect, either.In 2012, Qualcomm struggled to supply a new line of chips to its own clients, smartphone brands, because the Taiwanese company was having trouble delivering on time. That spurred a search for alternative suppliers. Two years ago, a malware attack and a separate incident involving poor chemical quality at TSMC both caused delays. By all accounts, clients forgave, but probably won’t forget.Then there are regulators. The company told investors in 2017 that it was under preliminary investigation by the European Commission “concerning alleged anti-competitive practices… in relation to semiconductor sales.” The implication was that TSMC — holding more than 50% of the global contract-manufacturing market — is too big and powerful, with reports at the time suggesting that the U.S. Fair Trade Commission was also taking a look. While it seems both probes are on hold, there’s every chance that either could be dusted off and restarted should concerns increase.The company has only grown bigger since, and become an unwilling player in the U.S.-China tech cold war. It has sought to ease concerns that so much American semiconductor prowess and supply sits offshore by announcing that it will build a factory in Arizona. Former Intel executive Peter Cleveland and U.S. Chamber of Commerce policy director Nicholas Montella have been hired to beef up its U.S. lobbying team. After decades behind the scenes, TSMC is taking an ever-bigger share of the spotlight as one of the most famous and powerful technology companies in the world. So far, it’s managed to outsmart competitors, skirt antitrust regulators, and survive early rounds of the Washington-Beijing chill. This may make it a hero to investors and the ruler of its sector, but also creates a huge target. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks sellers didn’t show much discretion Thursday as the major indexes tumbled. But the outsize chipmaker rout may have had its origin in a move by China.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 5.7% Thursday, its worst session since mid-June, following news that China is planning a sweeping set of new government policies to develop its domestic semiconductor industry and counter recent Trump administration restrictions. The decline shaved off about $100 billion in value for the gauge.Major chipmakers posted one of their worst days in months. Shares of Nvidia Corp. tumbled 9.3%, the most since March 16. Broadcom Inc. fell 6.1%, Qualcomm Inc. dropped 5.5% and Intel Corp. declined 3.6%.“If you were to ask me right now what my biggest fear had been for most of the month of August, it was the growing tensions between the U.S. and China,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. “It’s not around the alleged phase-one trade talks and China buying more of our agricultural products, but it’s much more around what we’re actually doing in real life -- we’re starting a technologic cold war.”Semiconductors are key to Beijing’s technology objectives. So the government is preparing broad support to develop so-called third-generation semiconductors for the five years through 2025, Bloomberg News reported. The move comes as the Trump administration threatens to cut off China’s supplies from abroad.The U.S. government has blacklisted dozens of China’s tech firms to prevent them from buying American parts. It has also instituted bans on ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and has sanctioned Huawei Technologies Co.Following these restrictions, China’s reaction is no surprise, Hogan said.When the two largest economies in the world go head-to-head, he said, “it’s hard to rationalize what good comes from this.”(Updates with day’s declines in second and third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China Semiconductor Threat Sparked a $100 Billion Chip Rout

2020-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chipmaker that has branched out into enterprise software, gave a bullish forecast helped by spending on data centers and a predicted rebound in shipments of smartphone components.Revenue in the three months ending Nov. 1 will be $6.4 billion, plus or minus $150 million, the San Jose, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst prediction of $6.19 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Broadcom has a wide variety of products spanning components for servers, smartphones, cars, security software, home broadband and software that runs the biggest mainframe computers. Some elements of the global lockdown due to the Covid-19 virus have boosted demand while others, such as lower spending on smartphones and government infrastructure, have hurt.“Our outlook for the fourth quarter reflects a strong anticipated ramp in wireless, as well as the continuing surge in demand for networking from cloud and telecom customers, more than offsetting expected softness in enterprise” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in the statement.Broadcom makes chips that filter radio signals and provide WiFi connections in iPhones and other smartphones. Analysts estimate it gets as much as a quarter of revenue from Apple Inc. Three months ago the chipmaker indicated that the new iPhone will debut later than it usually does in the year, confirming reporting by Bloomberg.The company also is a key supplier of switch chips, the complex semiconductors that manage data traffic in networking equipment, an area where demand is surging, helped by the increase in demand for cloud computing to support remote learning and work.The stock gained about 2% in extended trading following the report. The shares closed at $352.09 earlier in New York and have gained 11% this year.Tan assembled Broadcom in a string of acquisitions, giving its products a role in everything from powerful data center networking gear to smartphones. The company, one of the world’s largest chipmakers, has expanded into mainframe computer and security software.Net revenue in the fiscal third quarter rose 5.5% to $5.82 billion, the company said. Profit, excluding certain items, was $5.40 a share.

The Broadcom Analysts:  BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom shares and upped the  price target  from $400 to $450.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri maintained a Buy rating and hiked the price target from $335 to $425. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy rating and increased the price target from $370 to $430.Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach maintained an Overweight rating and lifted the price target from $358 to $415.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating and increased the price target from $360 to $410.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer reiterated an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $400 to $420.BofA Sees Q4 Inflection In Core Semi Growth:  Broadcom's fiscal-year third-quarter sales of $5.82 billion represented 6% year-over-year growth and a 1% quarter-over-quarter increase and came in ahead of the consensus estimate of $5.77 billion. Pro forma EPS was 19 cents ahead of consensus at $5.40, BofA's Arya said in a note.The free cash flow margin of 53% is an industry best, the analyst said. The fourth-quarter sales guidance of $6.4 billion is also $200 million ahead of the consensus and incorporated a 50% quarter-over-quarter increase in wireless, he said.The fourth quarter should mark an inflection in core semi sales, and wireless and core semis all are expected to grow again in the first quarter, Arya said. The company also said it has baked into the guidance the effects of any China customer restrictions, the analyst said. BofA raised its EPS estimates for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.The firm said it likes Broadcom's multipronged growth, leading margins and dividend growth.See also:  BofA's Stock Picks For Income Funds In 'Extremely Volatile' Earnings Season Broadcom Delivered On All Fronts, UBS Says:  Broadcom delivered on all fronts, while also offering visibility into the wireless segment for the fourth quarter, UBS analyst Arcuri said.View more earnings on AVGOAlong with strong iPhone 5G procurement by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), the company is also the beneficiary of other strong product cycles, especially in cloud and networking, the analyst said. The software business has seen recurring revenues cushioning cyclicality in the downturn, and the CA business remains on track for mid-single digit year-over-year growth, he said. Although Broadcom is levered, Arcuri said the company is aggressively paying down debt.With the company likely paying out a $14 or so per share dividend for 2021, UBS said the stock is an attractive source of income given its solid growth profile.Rosenblatt Sees Scope For Higher Broadcom Margins:  Broadcom is seeing particularly good visibility in networking -- both cloud and telecom -- driven by a significant networking switch cycle, said Rosenblatt's Mosesmann. The Apple ramp, though delayed by a quarter, is unfolding nicely now, driven mainly by the 35%-plus dollar content position in the new models, the analyst said.&quot;Management is focused on maintaining its franchise presence in key segments while increasing either silicon content and/or ASPs, which we think has secular repercussions to get to the next level of 60% EBITDA margins from the current 57%.&quot; Morgan Stanley Positive On New Product Cycles: Broadcom has exposure to new product cycles in wireless, with the 5G smartphones, and networking through Tomahawk and Trident 3, Morgan Stanley's Hettenbach said.Although the company's leadership in merchant silicon for the cloud is a main focal point, commentary about adoption at telecom service providers is a positive development, the analyst said.The new product cycles are a clear plus, but there will be concerns surrounding the cloud given mixed data points in the space and Broadcom's extended lead times, he said. How Apple Delay Positions Broadcom For Strong Q4:  Strength in the quarter was led by better-than-expected demand for the iPhone SE and iPad due to 5G and Wi-Fi 6 content growth, KeyBanc's Vinh said.The delayed iPhone 5G phone launch should drive over 50% sequential wireless growth in the fourth quarter, the analyst said. Cloud and broadband strength contributed to the strong results, offsetting weak enterprise, he said.Infrastructure software results were in line and remain stable, according to KeyBanc. AVGO Price Action:  Broadcom shares were trading 3.46% higher at $364.28 ahead of the close Friday.

2020-09-04,"Shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) moved higher by 10.68% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Broadcom has.Broadcom's Debt According to the Broadcom's most recent financial statement as reported on June 12, 2020, total debt is at $45.86 billion, with $45.04 billion in long-term debt and $819.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $9.21 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $36.66 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Broadcom has $81.55 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.56. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Broadcom: Q3 Earnings Insights  * Earnings Scheduled For September 3, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-04,"Anyone who follows tech stocks knows that when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sneezes, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) stock catches cold.Source: Shutterstock But it's no longer the case that when Apple runs a marathon, Skyworks gets a t-shirt.In 2020 Apple has achieved lift-off, rising 82% to more than $2.2 trillion. Skyworks has done OK, too, but is up just 27%. It opened for trade Sept. 3 at about $153 per share. That's a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.5, a market cap of $25.6 billion. It should have $3.2 billion of sales when the fiscal year ends this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why the Decoupling?There are two reasons for the decoupling.One is that Apple is moving to produce its own semiconductors. There may be some who believe that could include the kind of RF chips Skyworks produces. Losing Apple as a customer would mean losing half the company's sales, which may be impossible to get back.The other is that Apple has become overvalued. The Federal Reserve's funny money has turned momentum investing into a rage. Money piles into what obviously works, sometimes ignoring what merely works. Skyworks merely works. Its sales are still close to their 2016 level, with profits a little lower.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks Ideal for Any Investor In contrast to Apple, you buy Skyworks stock for yield. The dividend has nearly doubled over the last five years. The annual capital gain is under 10%. But if you bought in 2015 you are getting a respectable 2.2% yield on that $78 investment, from the $2 per share annual dividend. Cash in the ChipsSkyworks is an RF (radio frequency) chip company. Its chips handle radio waves at cell towers, in user devices and in WiFi systems. They come in a variety of price points. It's most often compared with Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) although Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are big, too. Without Apple, Skyworks might be in a world of hurt. With it, it's in a comfortable place.Skyworks would like to diversify its customer list. There's always talk about automobiles and what I call the Machine Internet. These markets are like the Dallas Cowboys, a lot of potential but not a lot of championships. Still, it's one more reason to buy the stock. Buy SWKS Stock?Apple did indeed seem to sneeze early in the pandemic. Skyworks kept making chips. It cut its forecast but seems to be coming through just fine.Analysts like Skyworks right now because of 5G. Apple's ramp-up to supply the new communications technology in all its products should benefit the Irvine, California company, the thinking goes.But there's another speculation no one is making. As Apple continues its moves into controlling its own silicon, it might buy Skyworks. A price of $30 billion would be nothing next to Apple's market capitalization, and if you're making your microprocessors, modems, and graphics chips why not? Skyworks might also help Apple explore those Machine Internet markets.It's important to note that this is unfounded speculation. There is no indication Apple is interested in buying Skyworks. But the interdependency, and Apple's own move into chip design, could make it inevitable down the road. Bottom Line on Skyworks StockBased on its fundamentals, I wouldn't buy Skyworks stock here. The dividend yield at its current price is just 1.3%. There's no apparent growth. Apple is a better stock.But the current market fever will break at some point. All recent analyst reports on Skyworks scream buy. This despite an average price target that's lower than the current price. To me that's a sign of an overheated market.Let Skyworks come to you. When the yield looks good, buy and hold. Don't chase it.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-09-04,"Shares in Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 2.26% post-print in Thursday’s extended trading session, despite an in-line July quarter and guiding to a good October quarter at $6.4B (vs consensus at $6.2B).Specifically, FQ3 Non-GAAP EPS of $5.40 beat Street estimates by $0.16, while GAAP EPS of $1.45 also topped consensus forecasts by $0.33. That’s with revenue surging 5.4% year-over-year and, at $5.82B, beating Street estimates by $60M. Free cash flow came in at $3.07B vs consensus of $2.23B. GMs came in at 74% (better than consensus 72.5%), and ~55% OM.“We delivered third quarter revenue results in-line with our expectations, driven by healthy demand from cloud and telecom customers, which more than offset the expected reset in wireless,” said Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom.“Our outlook for the fourth quarter reflects a strong anticipated ramp in wireless, as well as the continuing surge in demand for networking from cloud and telecom customers, more than offsetting expected softness in enterprise” he continued.For the next quarter, AVGO is now guiding for revenue of $6.25B-$6.55B ( vs consensus of $6.2B) and EBITDA of $3.74B plus or minus $75M, or 58.5% of revenue at the midpoint.The company also approved a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $3.25 per share, payable on September 30, 2020 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on September 22, 2020.“AVGO noted JulQ strength from networking and broadband with healthy demand at cloud and telco customers driven by 5G/WFH/Wifi6 trends, and OctQ upside with continued strength driven by wireless up 50% q/q as key customer launches iPhone and networking up ~7% q/q” cheered Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh post-print.He has a buy rating on the stock and boosted his price target from $350 to $390, adding: “AVGO noted plans to pay $3B in debt in the OctQ, but a strong FCF should drive a renewed focus on continued Software M&A to drive shareholder returns.”The analyst also highlighted that AVGO noted it is ‘NOT’ seeing weakness in its cloud or telco customers, contrary to peer network equipment commentary.Overall, Broadcom scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus with 22 recent buy ratings vs just 3 hold ratings.

2020-09-04,"In the current session, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is trading at $358.80, after a 1.91% increase. Over the past month, the stock increased by 10.08%, and in the past year, by 22.62%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 5.32%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on AVGODepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 44.25 in the Semiconductors industry, Broadcom Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 63.21.

2020-09-09,"Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $350.54.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $270.00  * Volume: 334  * Open Interest: 721Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * P/E Ratio Insights for Broadcom  * Broadcom's Debt Overview  * Broadcom: Q3 Earnings Insights(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-10,"2020 has been good so far for the semiconductor sector. The SOX (PHLX Semiconductor Index) - the industry’s overall barometer - is up by 18%, way in front of the S&P 500’s 5% uptick. One chipmaker that has gotten attention lately is Broadcom (AVGO). A strong showing in the company’s latest quarterly statement has just received widespread approval from Street analysts.Count Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann among those impressed. Following the earnings report, the 5-star analyst reiterated a Buy rating and raised his price target from $370 to $430. The implication for investors? Upside of 19% from current levels. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here)Mosesmann said, “Broadcom delivered a nice beat and raise in an investor environment that has suddenly become skittish on macro, Covid-19, inventories, enterprise, etc. Broadcom is seeing particularly good visibility (including the January quarter) in Networking (cloud and telecom) driven by a significant networking switch cycle (Tomahawk3) that is pulling in adjacent Broadcom network and storage silicon.”Let’s take a look at the numbers behind the positive assessment. Quarterly revenue hit $5.82 billion, beating consensus by $60 million and exhibiting year-over-year growth of 5.4%.FQ3 Non-GAAP EPS came in at $5.40, ahead of the Street’s forecast by $0.16. Additionally, free cash flow grew by 33% to a record $3.07 billion, far beyond the $2.23 billion consensus estimate.Even so, management have said that the company “continues to feel some constraints on wafers and substrates, while lead times remain extended.”“If not for such tight constraints,” Mosesmann said, “Broadcom would have been able to ship more products in F3Q,”Looking ahead, the company expects another strong quarter, forecasting FQ4 revenue to come in between $6.25 billion to $6.55 billion, above the Street’s call for $6.2 billion. The growth on account of “a surge in demand for Networking and the expected ramp of 5G phones in Wireless,” although these are expected to be offset by “weakness in Storage, Broadband, and Industrial.”All in all, the current Street ratings display a lot of confidence in the Broadcom story. 23 Buys and 3 Holds coalesce to a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $405.48, the average price target could provide investors with nearly 13% of upside over the coming months.

<p>One chipmaker that has gotten attention lately is Broadcom (<a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/avgo/forecast""><strong>AVGO</strong></a>). A strong showing in the company’s latest quarterly statement has just received widespread approval from Street analysts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Count Rosenblatt analyst <a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/hans-mosesmann"">Hans Mosesmann</a> among those impressed. Following the earnings report, the 5-star analyst reiterated a Buy rating and raised his price target from $370 to $430. The implication for investors? Upside of 19% from current levels. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, <a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/hans-mosesmann""><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mosesmann said, “Broadcom delivered a nice beat and raise in an investor environment that has suddenly become skittish on macro, Covid-19, inventories, enterprise, etc. Broadcom is seeing particularly good visibility (including the January quarter) in Networking (cloud and telecom) driven by a significant networking switch cycle (Tomahawk3) that is pulling in adjacent Broadcom network and storage silicon.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a look at the numbers behind the positive assessment. Quarterly revenue hit $5.82 billion, beating consensus by $60 million and exhibiting year-over-year growth of 5.4%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>FQ3 Non-GAAP EPS came in at $5.40, ahead of the Street’s forecast by $0.16. Additionally, free cash flow grew by 33% to a record $3.07 billion, far beyond the $2.23 billion consensus estimate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even so, management have said that the company “continues to feel some constraints on wafers and substrates, while lead times remain extended.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If not for such tight constraints,” Mosesmann said, “Broadcom would have been able to ship more products in F3Q,”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking ahead, the company expects another strong quarter, forecasting FQ4 revenue to come in between $6.25 billion to $6.55 billion, above the Street’s call for $6.2 billion. The growth on account of “a surge in demand for Networking and the expected ramp of 5G phones in Wireless,” although these are expected to be offset by “weakness in Storage, Broadband, and Industrial.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All in all, the current Street ratings display a lot of confidence in the Broadcom story. 23 Buys and 3 Holds coalesce to a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $405.48, the average price target could provide investors with nearly 13% of upside over the coming months.

2020-09-10,"New 7nm Jericho2c+ Delivers a 3X Routing Performance Increase Over Predecessor In Less Than Two YearsSAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) today announced the highest performing router in the industry— Jericho2c+. An industry first, the Jericho2c+ chip provides 14.4 terabits per second of advanced routing capabilities and the best power efficiency in the market. A global technology leader, Broadcom continues to innovate on its high-end switching and routing silicon portfolio with this new 7nm router chip, integrating security at line rate on all network ports.  Purpose built to minimize the power per terabit of bandwidth in modular chassis and disaggregated distributed system, Jerciho2c+ enables a 36 Port 400GbE line-card with integrated security with only two chips. This innovative new solution significantly reduces footprint, complexity, power and costs compared to alternative solutions that require a far larger number of devices.“Broadcom’s field proven Jericho, Tomahawk and Trident family of products are setting the pace for the industry in scalability, port density and power efficiency,” said Ram Velaga, senior vice president and general manager, Core Switching Group, Broadcom. “We are excited to be working with major O.E.M. and software partners to deliver Data Center Interconnect, edge routing and core routing systems, scaling to well over 200 terabits per second, for deployments in mega scale data centers and service provider networks.”Core and edge routing solutions rely on flexible packet processing and feature concurrency. The Jericho2c+ programmable pipe, large-scale forwarding databases and future-proofing matrix of programmable elements, provide a set of capabilities that addresses the most challenging routing requirements. Featuring a high integration level, Jericho2c+ improves port density, increases subscribers scale, reduces power per bit, and reduces the total cost of ownership— thus making it the building block of choice for future routing networks.A growing requirement of hyperscalers is to secure all off-premise connectivity, which requires dedicated Media Access Control security (MACSec) components. When combining security with the ongoing migration to 400GE links, the hyperscalers face the tough challenge of increased power consumption. Jericho2c+ addresses this challenge with integrated line-rate MACSec on all network interfaces, making it the ideal solution for data center interconnect, metro and core switches.“In the past, router vendors had to choose between a flexible pipe with feature concurrency versus power efficient high-bandwidth devices,” said Bob Wheeler, principal analyst, The Linley Group. “Jericho2 disrupted the routing market by providing full routing capabilities without compromising performance. Jericho2c+ takes bandwidth, integration, and power efficiency to the next level, while adding line-rate security.”Broadcom is committed to supporting a broad software ecosystem on top of Jericho2c+, including OEM’s and key Open Source initiatives.

2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. agreed to buy SoftBank Group Corp.’s chip division Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, taking control of some of the most widely used electronics technology in the semiconductor industry’s largest-ever deal.Nvidia will pay $21.5 billion in stock and $12 billion in cash for the U.K.-based chip designer, including a $2 billion payment at signing. SoftBank may receive an additional $5 billion in cash or stock if Arm’s performance meets certain targets, the companies said Sunday in a statement. An additional $1.5 billion will be paid to Arm employees in Nvidia stock.SoftBank shares surged about 9% on Monday on news of the deal and renewed talks for the company going private. Shares of Nvidia were up 5% at 2:39 p.m. in New York.Read more: SoftBank Soars After Arm Deal, Renewed Talks to Go PrivateArm’s importance far outweighs its revenue, which comes from licensing chip fundamentals and selling processor designs. Its technology is at the heart of the more than 1 billion smartphones sold annually. Chips that use its code and its layouts are in everything from factory equipment to home electronics.“It’s a company with reach that’s just unlike any company in the history of technology,” Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in an interview. “We’re uniting Nvidia’s leading AI computing with Arm’s vast ecosystem.”The acquisition is fueled by the drive to bring artificial intelligence to everything that has an on-switch, the CEO said. Having succeeded in selling Nvidia’s graphics chips to owners of data centers to speed up image recognition and language processing, Huang is looking to make sure his technology helps spread that to everything from self-driving vehicles to smart meters.​​The initial payment from Nvidia marks a small premium over the $31.4 billion that SoftBank paid to acquire Arm in 2016, previously the semiconductor industry’s biggest deal. The Japanese company is expected to own less than 10% of Nvidia following the transaction, according to the statement.Regulatory approvals may well prove challenging. The companies said sign-offs are needed from China, U.K., European Union and U.S. authorities and may take as long as 18 months. China’s approval may be particularly difficult given rising tensions with the U.S.​“Now Arm will become a U.S. firm, and the conflict over semiconductors between the U.S. and China is becoming fierce as China still controls Arm China,” said Koji Hirai, head of M&A advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo.In comments after the deal announcement, Huang said his team “fully expect to spend time with the regulatory bodies in China,” but have every confidence in getting approval for the takeover.Another major concern is whether the acquisition will upset Arm’s relationships with customers like Apple Inc. and Intel Corp. The chip designer has been able to work with a broad range of partners in part because it didn’t compete with them.“We would imagine the bulk of Arm’s current licensees will be (no pun intended) up in arms,” Sanford C. Bernstein analysts including Stacy Rasgon wrote in reaction to the news.Huang said he will preserve Arm’s neutrality and wants to expand its client list. He argued Nvidia is spending a lot of money for the acquisition and has no incentive to do anything that would cause clients to walk away.Nvidia said the U.K. company will “continue to operate its open-licensing model while maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its success.” Nvidia will add its technology to the offerings licensed by Arm, the Santa Clara, California-based company said.Arm CEO Simon Segars told reporters on a call early Monday that he’d “had dialog with many of our customers as the various rumors swirled around.” He said it was important that ARM is able to maintain its current business model “to continue to serve the licensees who’ve been so loyal to us over the years.”Under Huang, Nvidia has risen rapidly up the ranks of technology companies in market value and influence. Already the dominant force in graphics chips that make video games more realistic, Nvidia has carved out a slice of the market for data center chips and is moving into self-driving vehicles.Cambridge, U.K.-based Arm has created a successful niche for itself by being independent. Fierce rivals such as Apple, Intel, Samsung Electronics Co., Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. are all licensees. They either use Arm’s designs as the basis of their own chips or license its instruction set, the fundamental code used by processors to communicate with software, for proprietary efforts.Read more: Nvidia-Arm $40 Billion Deal Will Upend Chip Industry: Tae KimThe acquisition by Nvidia, also a licensee, is a challenge to that neutrality. SoftBank’s purchase four years ago went ahead largely uncontested because the Japanese company wasn’t a competitor to any of Arm’s customers.One client that will be directly challenged is Intel. Huang said a priority will be investing in Arm’s efforts to design chips for data-center computing. While he’s carved out a $3 billion niche in the business of supplying Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. with graphics processors that help with their artificial intelligence workloads, Huang said he wants to speed up the adoption of Arm-based central processors, or CPUs. That’s a lucrative market dominated by Intel, which has about 90% share.Nvidia announced it will keep Arm’s headquarters in the U.K. and will invest in a new facility there to push forward AI research, educate customers and provide a place for experimentation in robotics and automation. Huang said that commitment demonstrates how the acquisition will add to the U.K.’s technology footprint rather than detracting from it.SoftBank’s sale of Arm unwinds another strategic investment in favor of boosting liquidity and enabling founder Masayoshi Son to focus on the more tactical investing he has said he wants to pursue.Nvidia’s Huang runs a company that’s captured the attention of investors like few others in the past decade. Like Son, he’s a charismatic leader espousing a long-term vision of where technology is headed. The Taiwan-born entrepreneur is more engineering-focused than his Japanese counterpart, though, and often publicly delves into the minutiae of semiconductor and computer science.His latest successful recasting of Nvidia’s technology involves the processing of AI work done in data centers. The company’s chips are among the best at breaking up the manipulation of data into small pieces and then executing that in parallel at high speed.Huang will also get a large footprint in the mobile industry and smartphones. A previous attempt by Nvidia to break Qualcomm’s dominance of that business failed. The biggest rival to Qualcomm in smartphone processors is Apple’s internal effort. Those two companies are among Arm’s biggest customers.Even without a presence in mobile, Nvidia’s value has soared in the past decade. It has a market value of just over $300 billion, almost $100 billion more than Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker with seven times the revenue of Nvidia.A spokesperson for SoftBank said the company was advised by Zaoui & Co., Raine Group and Morrison & Foerster. Morgan Stanley and Latham & Watkins advised Nvidia, a filing showed.(Updates shares starting in the third paragraph, add advisers starting in the final paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Nvidia Buys SoftBank’s Arm in Record $40 Billion Chip Deal

2020-09-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. is nearing a settlement that could end a European Union probe into contracts compelling set-top box makers to use its chips, according to a person familiar with the matter.The deal with the EU removes a threat of potential fines and is based on Broadcom’s five-year offer to change contracts with customers, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process isn’t public. The EU is set to accept the U.S. chipmaker’s pledge within weeks, formalizing an offer made in April with only minor changes, the person said.Broadcom and the European Commission both declined to comment. Broadcom shares were down 1.1% at 10:15 a.m. in New York Friday.Last year, European regulators issued an unusual order in the middle of their investigation, stopping Broadcom temporarily from using contracts that prevented customers from buying chipsets from other suppliers.In response, Broadcom promised in April it would no longer require original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, to source more than half of their so-called systems-on-a-chip for TV set-top boxes, xDSL modems, fiber modems or cable modems from the company. The offer covered the world outside China. Broadcom had also pledged to avoid some inducements for European sales of systems-on-a-chip.Broadcom, based in San Jose, California, has a wide variety of products spanning components for servers, smartphones, cars, security software, home broadband and software that runs the biggest mainframe computers. Some elements of the global lockdown due to the Covid-19 virus have boosted demand while others, such as lower spending on smartphones and government infrastructure, have hurt.The settlement allows the company to escape the fate of Qualcomm Inc., once a Broadcom takeover target. Qualcomm is now challenging two EU antitrust fines and has a fresh antitrust probe to tackle.The EU can drop probes without fines if companies make binding pledges that solve its concerns.

2020-10-01,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",5 Stocks the Insiders are Buying
2020-10-02,"As far as both COVID-19 and the recession are concerned, we're not out of the woods yet. But even though there's no sign of the stock market volatility going away as we approach the final quarter of 2020, there are a few tech names you should have your eye on heading into the end of the year. These stocks are Impinj Inc (NASDAQ: PI), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO). Small-Cap Innovators That Could Deliver Explosive Returns As the world has become more digital than ever, there were many non-electronic items left outside the network. Having access to data is vital to business success, and Impinj is helping businesses overcome this barrier. It is a maker of radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and sensors that act as a much more advanced version of the barcode system that improves the efficiency of supply chains, manufacturing, and service quality. Although its biggest market has been retail, it has great potential in healthcare, hospitality, and similar service-based industries. It achieved a 45% YoY sales growth in the first quarter before COVID-19 put an end to its sales-growth streak, causing its sales to plummet about 31% compared to the prior-year period. But as the majority of physical stores have now reopened and consumer spending is slowly rebounding, forward-looking and patient investors can see an attractive opportunity.Tech Titan At A Discount The tech wreck has broken the common myth that tech needs to be a high-risk endeavor. Microsoft is the creme a la creme of tech, but its stock price is now down roughly 12% from its highs of the year, creating a great buy opportunity. Microsoft Office is powering offices around the globe, while Teams is reaching record engagement during the pandemic and Azure is the top cloud platform outside of Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS. If you add in LinkedIn, Microsoft has its toes dipped in all aspects of the professional market.Getting A Cheap Entry Ticket To 5G Broadcom is one of the world's largest chipmakers, but it also ventured into software two years ago by acquiring Symantec's enterprise software unit and CA Technologies. October could be a game-changing month with the move in the evolution of 5G that would help the company rebound. In its last reported quarter, software revenue increased approximately 41% on a YoY basis. Although semiconductor solutions sales fell by 4%, this outlook is bound to benefit from 5G-compatible iPhones from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) that should debut in October. Apple already accounted for about 20% of Broadcom's revenue last year, and there is significant growth potential ahead. Moreover, Broadcom has increased its dividend every year since it was introduced in FY 2011.Outlook The conclusion is simple. The software business is expected to prosper long after the pandemic ends. Just look at Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) which delivered record results during its latest quarter. Revenue had been increasing long before the COVID-19 turmoil, and the pandemic appears to have boosted its growth. For the above companies, COVID-19 has enhanced their future prospects as it speeded up the digital revolution while allowing investors to buy them at a discount.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-10-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. has been in the spotlight lately, between antitrust scrutiny of its mobile operating system and the legal battle it’s waging with Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. over its App Store. Those developments pale, however, in comparison to the company’s main event next week: the unveiling of its latest iPhones.For all the talk about Apple’s shift to services and subscriptions, the tech giant’s business is still dependent on its core hardware products, so Tuesday’s presentation will be a must-see for investors. There could be a problem this year, though. The lineup’s most vaunted feature — fifth-generation wireless capability — may not be ready for prime time. The Cupertino, California-based company is expected to unveil four new iPhone models with 5G capabilities as well as a different physical design and a wider choice of screen sizes, Bloomberg News reported last month. Apple is already touting the new technology’s attributes: Earlier this week, it sent the news media an invitation to Tuesday’s event with the cheeky pun “Hi, Speed” as the subject line, referencing the fast new 5G networks.Investors are betting the iPhones will be a blockbuster success and spur consumers to upgrade. Shares of Apple have risen more than 50% this year and now trade at roughly 31 times the next four quarters’ earnings, nearly double its historical five-year average of 16. And those earnings estimates also have high embedded assumptions. To take one example, Morgan Stanley forecasts Apple’s iPhone sales will grow by 28% in its fiscal year ending in September 2021. That would mark a dramatic turnaround from the 14% sales drop in fiscal 2019 and the estimated 7% decline for 2020.An elevated valuation would be fine if the new iPhones sell well, but the lackluster reality surrounding the current state of 5G networks could lead to underwhelming demand. PC Mag found the new wireless technology was often slower than 4G after it recently conducted tests in 26 U.S. cities, adding “5G results were disappointing all around on every carrier.” The Washington Post had similar conclusions and found no speed improvement for 5G phones and in many cases slower numbers. There are several technical reasons for the weak results, ranging from the more prevalent use of the slower “mid-band” 5G spectrum to the anemic coverage buildout of the faster 5G millimeter wave service. Bottom line, the 5G experience for U.S. wireless carriers in most circumstances isn’t better than 4G right now. It will take time, so why shell out hundreds of dollars for an upgrade now?Key industry figures are already lowering expectations. A few weeks ago, AT&T Inc. CEO John Stankey said demand for the 5G iPhone may not be as strong as anticipated owing to the economic uncertainty from the pandemic and the less dramatic wireless speed improvements. Before that, Hock Tan — CEO of iPhone chipmaker Broadcom Inc. — answered a question on near-term trends for 5G on a call with the investors by saying, “To be honest about this, we don’t know how fast the ramp on 5G will occur.” It’s pretty telling when the leader of one of Apple’s largest wireless chip suppliers seems hesitant to extol the promise of his industry’s most-talked-about growth driver.Even if 5G network coverage was amazing, there is another problem. Almost all the most-used mobile apps, including TikTok, Instagram and FaceTime, work fine on 4G networks. There simply isn’t a need for 5G right now. Yes, there will be new killer apps someday that will require faster speeds, but they haven’t arrived yet.Amid the anticipation and excitement going into Tuesday’s product event, Apple investors may want to reassess their risks.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been lobbying the U.S. government on tax breaks to support domestic chip production, suggesting the iPhone maker is keen to move more of its supply chain to the U.S.In second- and third-quarter disclosure reports, the company said it lobbied officials from the Treasury Department, Congress and the White House on tax topics including “issues related to tax credits for domestic semiconductor production.”Since releasing its first custom processor in 2010, chips have become a major performance differentiator for Apple. The company designs some of these components in house, but outsources production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Many other parts for Apple devices are made in China. That has exposed the company to import tariffs and other risks from a trade war between the U.S. and China. Taiwan, where TSMC operates, has also become an increasing focus of geopolitical tension between China and the U.S.Apple’s recent lobbying coincides with a push by the company and its partners to move some production away from China and even back to the U.S. in a few cases. There’s also a broader effort by the U.S. semiconductor industry to get government support for increased domestic production.Apple’s U.S. lobbying efforts are now mostly led by company veteran Tim Powderly, who was promoted around the time Cynthia Hogan, Apple’s prior top U.S. lobbyist, left to join former vice president Joe Biden’s campaign. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Read more: Chip Industry Wants $50 Billion to Keep Manufacturing in U.SEarlier this year, TSMC said it would build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona, and the company has been lobbying officials there for tax breaks.In 2013, Apple started making a low-volume Mac Pro computer in the U.S. Last year, it started using the same plant in Texas to conduct final assembly for a new version. That decision came after the company was granted breaks on tariffs.Apple also sources components from several chipmakers that build some of their products in the U.S., including Broadcom Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. Apple also has started using Qualcomm Inc. again for iPhone modems, and the San Diego, California-based chipmaker builds some products domestically via production partner Global Foundries.Intel Corp., the current maker of the Mac’s main processors, builds some of its chips in the U.S. However, when Apple moves to its own Mac chips next month, that will mean shifting production of that component to Taiwan.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Lobbies for Lower Taxes to Boost U.S. Chip Production

2020-11-12,"With the Nasdaq hovering near all-time highs, many tech stocks can't be considered cheap.  Most high-growth tech companies also don't pay dividends, since they usually reinvest their cash into their expanding businesses.  Let's take a closer look at two companies that fit that description: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and IBM (NYSE: IBM).",2 Cheap Dividend Stocks You Can Buy Right Now
2020-11-13,"Not all tech IPOs have done well this year. Just take a look at McAfee (NASDAQ:MCFE). This cybersecurity company went public in late October. But MCFE stock has fallen over 12% since then.
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com

	
Now, McAfee is certainly a trusted brand. The company got its start back in 1987, when computer engineer John McAfee founded the operation. While antivirus software was already available, his innovation was to leverage online networks for distribution. The result was staggering growth.
The company went public in the early 1990s and then merged with Network General. And by 2011, McAfee was sold to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). But being part of a larger organization probably stunted the growth because it was not really strategic to the chip business.  Thus, in 2017, Intel sold a 51% interest to private equity giant, TPG Capital. Thoma Bravo was a minority investor in the transaction.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
OK so, what now? Might there be an opportunity for MCFE stock? Or should investors be cautious?


					7 Solar Stocks to Buy for Biden's Green Wave				

Well, let’s take a look.
Background of MCFE Stock
McAfee develops security software systems for consumers, small businesses, large enterprises and governments. The technology foundation relies on an extensive sensor network that monitors endpoints, gateways and clouds in IT systems. The McAfee system processes huge amounts of real-time data to detect anomalies and outliers. There is also use of sophisticated technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
In terms of the consumer business, McAfee’s software protects more than 600 million devices. And as for the enterprise segment, the company has about 78% of the Fortune 500 as customers.
But since TPG Capital and Thoma Bravo made the acquisition, there have been some major changes to McAfee. There has been ramping of investments to bolster the partnerships for the consumer business and a restructuring of the enterprise portfolio. For example, there was the exit of the businesses for network firewalls, email security and vulnerability management. Instead, McAfee has been focused on a device-to-cloud strategy that is based on the MVISION platform. This is a comprehensive system for threat defense, management, automation and orchestration across devices, networks, clouds and even on-premise environments.

A key for MCFE stock, of course, is the market opportunity. And it is enormous. There are a myriad of trends that are driving growth. Just some include: the transition to remote work that has been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic; the continued rise of cybersecurity risks; the growth in digitization, such as with the adoption of sophisticated smartphones; and the move toward cloud computing. According to McAfee’s own estimates, the addressable market is roughly $30.4 billion this year and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 8% through 2024.
“The cybersecurity industry is known for its resiliency, so it is no wonder it is one of the few relatively untouched by the wrath of COVID-19,” said Trevor Daughney, who is the VP of product marketing at Exabeam. “With the shift to remote-first working, companies have found it increasingly difficult to identify and mitigate threats on individual employees’ computers. The increase in phishing scams, insider threats, credential-stuffing attacks and ransomware in the wake of the pandemic has forced organizations to rely on security solutions and partners to stay protected.”
The Bottom Line
The market for security software is intensely competitive. There are large players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Trend Micro and Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) Symantec. There are also fast-growing earlier-stage companies, such as Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS).
Another issue is that the consumer market is highly commoditized. The result is that margins have remained fairly low.
But despite all this, MCFE stock still looks attractive. The company’s development of its MVISION Cloud looks spot on and there will likely be acquisitions to bolster the company’s offerings.
The valuation on MCFE stock is also attractive, with the shares trading at about 2.6 times revenues. Then there is the strong cash flow generation. For fiscal 2019, the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Debt and Amortization) came to nearly $800 million. So all things considered, MCFE stock does look like an interesting play on the growing cybersecurity market.

He thinks the semiconductor sector is a bit extended, but he is not worried because Broadcom has underperformed the semiconductor sector recently. The company is expanding to higher-margin software businesses, explained Zhang. He also thinks the stock is trading at a reasonable P/E multiple of 18.The options market is implying a move of 5.8% in either direction for earnings, while the stock has moved 4.2% over the last eight quarters.

Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Broadcom analysts model for earnings of $6.24 per share on sales of $6.43 billion. In the same quarter last year, Broadcom reported earnings per share of $5.39 on revenue of $5.77 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter.

2020-12-10,"Over the past three months, shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) increased by 13.49%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Broadcom has.Broadcom's Debt According to the Broadcom's most recent financial statement as reported on September 11, 2020, total debt is at $44.02 billion, with $43.20 billion in long-term debt and $822.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $8.86 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $35.17 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Broadcom has $79.30 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.56. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-12-10,"In the current market session, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is trading at $413.68, after a 0.61% decrease. However, over the past month, the stock spiked by 11.74%, and in the past year, by 31.15%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 3.05%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

Broadcom Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 77.89 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 69.25 of the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. Ideally, one might believe that Broadcom Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio.

2020-12-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chipmaker that supplies Apple Inc. and other large electronics makers, warned about soft demand from corporate customers. The shares slipped more than 2% in extended trading. “We concluded the year with strong fourth quarter results driven by continued demand for networking from cloud and for broadband from service providers as well as the significant ramp in wireless, even as enterprise demand remained soft,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in a statement.Revenue in the three months ending January will be about $6.6 billion. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $6.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The company also reshuffled its leadership. Tom Krause, the chief financial officer, is becoming head of a new Infrastructure Software Group. He’s being replaced by Kirsten Spears, who’s currently the corporate controller. Broadcom’s head of sales, Charlie Kawwas, is being promoted to chief operating officer.Broadcom is a major provider of semiconductors that filter radio signals and provide Wi-Fi connections in smartphones, including the iPhone. Its projections give investors clues on future demand from companies such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. It also dominates the market for switches, machines that direct traffic between server computers in data centers. That position provides a window into the spending plans of the largest cloud-computing providers, including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Broadcom stock declined 2.5% in extended trading. The shares earlier closed at $410.04 earlier in New York leaving them up 30% this year.In recent years, the company has branched out into mainframe computer software and cybersecurity, the result of an acquisition spree that has given its products a role in everything from data center networking gear to smartphones.Net revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter rose 12% to $6.47 billion, the company said.

2020-12-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. shares fell after news emerged about the surprise resignation of a top executive who spearheaded the rapid technological ascent of China’s largest chipmaker.SMIC is trying to reach co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song after online media circulated a resignation letter they said originated with the industry veteran. Liang quit after SMIC appointed a vice chairman without consulting him, according to the reports. The company is attempting to clarify his intentions, it said in an exchange filing without elaborating. Liang couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.Shanghai’s stock exchange issued the company a “supervision letter,” SMIC said in a separate filing Wednesday evening. The letters typically mean the exchange has noticed a problem with the company and serve as a warning to resolve it.SMIC’s shares slid at least 4.9% at the close in Shanghai and Hong Kong, underscoring the executive’s pivotal role within a state-backed national champion trying to navigate a volatile U.S.-Chinese relationship. Liang handed in his resignation after learning about the appointment of Chiang Shang-yi -- a former senior executive at larger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. -- to the board, media including Digitimes reported. Liang, a fellow TSMC alumnus, was considered integral to SMIC’s efforts to become a major player in the business of fabricating wafers for global giants. The corporation has long relied on a cohort of Taiwanese executives including Liang to narrow the gap with TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co.“SMIC’s recent technology progress was directly attributable to Liang,” Bernstein analysts including Mark Li wrote. “Though the addition of Chiang is a positive, as the vice chairman his role is advisory. Liang, however, has been personally leading SMIC’s technology development and his contribution directly resulted in the mass production of 14nm, for example. Considering them both, we believe Liang’s departure will have a bigger effect, and SMIC’s future technology progress may see a setback.”Read more: China Said to Plan Broad Chip Sector Support to Fight TrumpLiang was instrumental in leading a 2,000-strong engineering team and helping SMIC migrate to cutting-edge 7nm process technology, slated to go into production in April. It’s unclear if his exit was directly linked to the appointment of Chiang, who left SMIC’s board in 2019 to take charge of another signature Chinese project, memory chipmaker Wuhan Hongxin. That company has since been taken over by the local Hubei government after encountering funding shortages.SMIC in contrast has roughly doubled its market value in 2020 despite the risk of U.S. sanctions, aided by a mega sale of stock in Shanghai and, more broadly, ballooning demand for chips as China’s economy emerges from Covid-19. The Shanghai-based firm, a supplier to Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc., lies at the heart of Beijing’s intention to build a world-class semiconductor industry and wean itself off a reliance on American technology.But it’s now also among a plethora of Chinese corporations Washington has labeled a national security threat, a designation that threatens to cripple its longer-term ambitions by denying it access to crucial gear and circuitry. Companies including Huawei Technologies Co. have been caught in the middle of worsening tensions between the world’s two largest economies, which have clashed on issues from trade to the pandemic.In response to the widening U.S. crackdown, China is planning to provide broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors in its next five-year plan to increase domestic self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing, people with knowledge of the matter have said. SMIC, backed by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund as well as Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC Pte and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is expected to play a central role in that overall effort.“Being a national champion with huge governmental investments, SMIC inevitably has some considerations that professional managers may not share,” Bernstein wrote. “Building a team that collaborates together toward a common goal is essential, but is something that money alone can’t buy.”(Updates with prices in second paragraph and letter from Shanghai exchange in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s Top Chipmaker Slides After Co-CEO Abruptly Quits

2020-12-18,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Commerce Department announced it’s blacklisting Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co. and more than 60 other Chinese companies “to protect U.S. national security.”“This action stems from China’s military-civil fusion doctrine and evidence of activities between SMIC and entities of concern in the Chinese military industrial complex,” the Commerce Department said in a statement.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross confirmed the move in a Friday morning interview with Fox Business. It was reported first by Reuters overnight. Shares in SMIC, China’s top chipmaker, slid 5.2% Friday in Hong Kong on the news.Other affected Chinese entities include those “that enable human rights abuses, entities that supported the militarization and unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea, entities that acquired U.S.-origin items in support of the People’s Liberation Army’s programs, and entities and persons that engaged in the theft of U.S. trade secrets,” according to the U.S. government statement.“There’s plenty in the open press about how DJI has been part of the surveillance state and overall suppression within China,” a senior Commerce official said.The majority of the newly banned companies are Chinese and will join the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. on a list that denies them access to U.S. technology from software to circuitry.Companies including Huawei and SMIC have been caught in the middle of worsening tensions between the world’s two largest economies, which have clashed on issues from trade to the pandemic.President Donald Trump had been widely expected to level more sanctions against China’s national champions before Joe Biden formally took office.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the U.S.’s expansive use of sanctions against Chinese companies “unacceptable” in a video address to the Asia Society on Friday. He urged the U.S. to stop “over stretching the notion of national security,” and “the arbitrary suppression of Chinese companies.”Shanghai-based SMIC, a supplier to Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc., lies at the heart of Beijing’s intention to build a world-class semiconductor industry and wean itself from reliance on American technology. Washington in turn views China’s ascendancy and its ambitions to dominate spheres of technology as a potential geopolitical threat. A blacklisting threatens to cripple SMIC’s longer-term ambitions by depriving it of crucial gear.For U.S. companies exporting items to SMIC for making 10-nanometer or more advanced chips, their applications for a license will face “presumption of denial,” while items for producing chips more mature than 10-nanometer will be reviewed on a case by case basis, according to a senior Commerce official.Companies exporting parts made outside of the U.S. to SMIC will face certain restrictions depending on how much of their technologies are U.S.-origin, and Washington is talking to “like-minded governments” about forming a unified approach to the Chinese chipmaker, senior Commerce officials said. They declined to give details on which governments the U.S. is talking to and potential implications on non-U.S. companies like ASMl Holding NV and Tokyo Electron Ltd. that also supply equipment for making advanced chips.In response to the widening U.S. crackdown, China is planning to provide broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors in its next five-year plan to increase domestic self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing, people with knowledge of the matter have said. SMIC, backed by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund as well as Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC Pte and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is expected to play a central role in that overall effort.SMIC representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment. The company had already been laboring under similar, less severe curbs after the Commerce Department in September placed it on a separate export restrictions list, accusing SMIC of supplying the military. Those sanctions took a toll on shares of the company, whose co-CEO Liang Mong Song this week unexpectedly resigned, triggering another selloff.Read more: China’s Top Chipmaker Slides After Co-CEO Abruptly Quits(Updates with DJI ban in lede and comments from Commerce officials from fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","U.S. Blacklists More Than 60 Chinese Firms, Including SMIC"

2020-12-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China’s largest chipmaker, saw its shares fall as much as 4.8% in Hong Kong Monday after warning that its inclusion in a U.S. blacklist will have “major adverse impact” on the development of advanced technology.Research and development of 10-nanometer chips and more sophisticated technologies will be affected, though the blacklist won’t have significant impact on SMIC’s operations and finances in the short term, the company said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.SMIC will keep communicating with the U.S. government to seek a solution and minimize the impact on the company, according to the exchange filing.Read more: U.S. Blacklists More Than 60 Chinese Firms, Including SMIC (1)The U.S. Commerce Department on Friday blacklisted more than 60 Chinese companies including SMIC, citing national security and human rights violations as reasons.

2020-12-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s latest headline-grabbing action against China is aimed at negating the Asian power’s push toward self-sufficiency in the $400 billion semiconductor industry. But its effectiveness is being questioned almost before the ink is dry, according to a growing chorus of voices in Washington and interviews with Chinese technology executives.The U.S. is blacklisting Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. along with more than 60 of its peers deemed a threat to national security, depriving them of the American inputs from software to chemicals required to make their products. The key provision of the action against China’s largest chipmaker is a restriction on selling equipment and other items used to fabricate advanced chips, an area U.S. suppliers dominate.But in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Tuesday, Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Michael McCaul warned the action was “utterly ineffective” and fell short of crippling Beijing’s drive into next-generation semiconductors.The pair echo the concerns of industry executives and government officials who argue the White House should do more to hamstring SMIC, one of several companies instrumental to Beijing’s ambitions of supplanting American dominance in a plethora of spheres including semiconductors. Arguably one of the world’s most important industries, the ability to manufacture semiconductors is crucial for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars, smartphones, and advanced weapons systems. SMIC’s shares rose as much as 1.3% in Hong Kong Wednesday.Stockpiling materialsIn his bid to halt China’s semiconductor ambitions, Trump is turning to some of the same tools deployed against Huawei Technologies Co. Those measures succeeded in stunting Huawei’s growth, but failed to decisively undermine its lead in 5G networking or kill its giant smartphone division. Like its larger compatriot, SMIC anticipated the U.S. action, stockpiling as much as 18 months’ worth of chemicals and other raw materials to keep its machines humming, people close to the company said. And it hiked its capital spending budget twice this year to $6.7 billion before taking it back citing U.S. regulatory uncertainty.“We are deeply concerned that the rules pursuant to the Entity Listing for the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Company (SMIC) will be utterly ineffective in addressing this growing national security threat,” Rubio and McCaul wrote. “We are deeply concerned that SMIC’s placement on the Entity List by the Bureau of Industry and Security was done for show.”Read more: U.S. Blacklists More Than 60 Chinese Firms, Including SMICBeijing has long worried a concerted White House campaign to contain the nation’s tech ascendancy -- which has already shaken up the supply chain for everything from iPhones to laptops -- will kneecap its rapidly developing chip industry. Washington had already targeted Huawei’s secretive HiSilicon division, while SMIC was grappling with rules introduced earlier this year designed to cut off supply to China’s military. In response, Beijing is said to be preparing broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors and conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability.Advanced ChipsWhite House officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the U.S. measures were too narrow.A representative for SMIC, which has repeatedly denied supplying the People’s Liberation Army, declined to comment beyond a statement this week warning of “major adverse impact” on its plans.Within the company, engineers are scrambling to assess the fallout and figure out workarounds to secure the equipment it needs, much like Huawei did two years prior, another person familiar with the matter said. At issue is the administration’s focus on drawing a line at 10-nanometer technology, banning the sale of equipment intended for use in more advanced processes. SMIC could conceivably repurpose 80% of older-generation gear to crank out more advanced chips, but that tactic won’t sustain production for the longer term and much depends on how far President-elect Joe Biden decides to take the rules, a third person close to the situation said, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.“The company has already got critical equipment and materials needed to continue production,” said Xiang Ligang, Beijing-based director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance. “In the past, China wasn’t too sensitive about the technological bottlenecks it has. But now, Beijing is fully aware of the potential damage and is determined to solve these issues.”Chinese government-backed SMIC, a manufacturer of chips for global names from Qualcomm Inc. to Broadcom Inc., relies on U.S. gear for its longer-term technology road map. While its engineers may be able to sustain research and output in the short run, the latest sanctions basically freeze its capabilities while the industry advances. If a Biden White House takes it to the max, SMIC could be blocked from 7nm or more advanced technology while overseas rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. dominate the market. The heightened scrutiny may also discourage clients leery of dealing with the uncertainty.Entity ListBut while that rule seems hard and fast, it misses the point that much of the equipment needed for 10nm or better is already in use for less advanced production, meaning SMIC may already have the gear it needs to keep its plants ticking over for a while. McCaul and Rubio argue SMIC can re-purpose as much as nearly 95% of available, older-generation tools.“Without question SMIC deserves to be on the Entity List, but the lawyerly language of the tool rule undermines the intent of the designation,” said James Mulvenon, director for intelligence integration at SOS International and the author of a book on forced technology transfers to China.Read more: Huawei Outhustles Trump by Hoarding Chips Vital for China 5GThe debate highlights the difficulty for U.S. policy makers of choosing such a globalized and technical industry to project geopolitical aims. That follows a series of assaults against some of China’s most recognizable names, with varying levels of success: ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat have tied up Executive Order bans in court, while video surveillance giant Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. is up 37% this year despite joining Huawei on the Entity List.Largest marketChina is by far the largest market for semiconductors and heavily reliant on imports. Gear suppliers such as Applied Materials Inc. and KLA Corp. with production facilities in Asia could argue that machines made there aren’t subject to U.S. jurisdiction, though Commerce officials have said companies exporting parts made outside of the U.S. to SMIC will still face restrictions depending on how much of their technologies are of American origin.The legality of that seeming loophole remains unclear, particularly as U.S. officials pressure allies to cut off Chinese clients.Another concern is the fundamental complexity of the industry, which means that Washington decision-makers must rely on the companies themselves to explain the intricacies of their products. That’s partly why the process of applying to the Commerce Department for export licenses has dragged on.Entegris Inc. Chief Executive Officer Bertrand Loy, who is also chairman of the industry’s largest trade group, SEMI, said no one quite knows yet how the latest sanctions will play out. “Which products exactly are targeted is not entirely clear,” he told Bloomberg News this week.(Updates with shares in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",How Chinese Chip Giant SMIC Can Evade Trump’s Newest Crackdown

2021-01-14,"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra delivers unprecedented multi-gigabit, low-latency Wi-Fi leveraging the 6 GHz bandSAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced that the BCM4389 chip enables the world’s first Wi-Fi 6E phone, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. The BCM4389 combines the benefits of the sixth generation of Wi-Fi with the pristine 6 GHz band to power the Galaxy S21 Ultra with Wi-Fi speeds over 2 Gbps. The chip also has a unique multi-radio Bluetooth 5 architecture that supports a premium audio experience with Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, and Tri-Band Simultaneous (TBS) connectivity that improves Wi-Fi and Bluetooth performance and battery utilization.    Wi-Fi 6E, the latest generation of Wi-Fi, delivers multi-gigabit speeds and millisecond latencies by operating in the 6 GHz band. Countries, including the United States and South Korea, have tripled the available Wi-Fi spectrum by opening up 1.2 GHz of spectrum in the 6 GHz band for unlicensed use. This expansion creates seven additional 160 MHz channels for the BCM4389, unlocking the value of Wi-Fi 6E for remote work, education, telemedicine, and gaming. For more information on Wi-Fi 6E, please visit https://www.broadcom.com/info/wifi6e.The Broadcom® BCM4389 and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra bring additional benefits to consumers worldwide. The chip delivers multi-gigabit Wi-Fi 6 performance in the existing 5 GHz band with 160 MHz capabilities. It also builds on the success of Broadcom’s Wi-Fi 6 solutions, and instantly benefits from the ecosystem of 400 million Wi-Fi 6 Broadcom-enabled phones, PC, tablets, routers, enterprise access points, and carrier gateways around the world. The BCM4389 was the world’s first Wi-Fi chip authorized by the FCC to operate in the 6 GHz band. It is also in the first wave of devices certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance for Wi-Fi 6E operation. In addition to Wi-Fi 6E, Broadcom BCM4389’s TBS connectivity architecture brings better Wi-Fi QoS, more precise indoor location accuracy and five times better battery utilization compared to current flagship connectivity solutions. Its multi-radio Bluetooth 5 architecture creates robust links to audio headsets even in heavily congested locations like subway stations. “We are truly excited about this partnership with Broadcom in bringing a seamless and secure connected experience to our Galaxy users,” said JM Choi, VP & Head of Convergence Development Group, Mobile Communications Business at Samsung Electronics. “Our joint dedication to a market-leading technology has evolved to now include Wi-Fi 6E on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, and enables an unrivalled connectivity experience for Galaxy users to share and consume content with confidence.”“We are honored to have collaborated with Samsung to enable the world’s first Wi-Fi 6E phone,” said Vijay Nagarajan, vice president of marketing for the Wireless Communications and Connectivity Division at Broadcom. “Back in 2019, our partnership in launching Wi-Fi 6 in Samsung Galaxy S10 kick-started a technology transition that has resulted in around half-a-billion Wi-Fi 6 devices in the world today. Today, this partnership has made the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra a showcase for the immersive possibilities with Wi-Fi 6E, and a harbinger for the technological disruptions that await us with Wi-Fi in the 6 GHz band.”“As the 6 GHz band continues to open up in countries across the world and as the 5 GHz band becomes increasingly crowded in many areas, the time to include Wi-Fi 6E in devices is now,” said Phil Solis, research director at IDC. “Smartphones are both high data-rate and relatively ubiquitous devices that generally rely on Wi-Fi connectivity indoors, and their shift to using the 6 GHz band will have substantial impact on the performance of those devices and the networks they are on.”“Wi-Fi Alliance members have mobilized around Wi-Fi 6E in ways we’ve never seen, recognizing the tremendous latency and performance benefits devices can deliver to Wi-Fi users,” said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. “Broadcom’s chipset, among the first Wi-Fi 6E certified devices in our interoperability test bed, that powers Samsung’s Wi-Fi 6E smartphone demonstrates the industry’s rapid momentum to deliver Wi-Fi 6E benefits securely and reliably to Wi-Fi users.”PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTSThe BCM4389 is a smartphone Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5 combo chip. Key features include:  * Seven Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios  * Support for 2 streams of Wi-Fi 6E  * Multi-Radio Bluetooth 5 with antenna beamforming  * Tri-Band Simultaneous (TBS) architecture including a dedicated background scan radio for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth  * Simultaneous dual-band operation  * 2.63 Gbps PHY rate  * Operation in 2.4 GHz and 5.1-7.125 GHz unlicensed bands  * 160 MHz channel bandwidth  * 1024-QAM modulation  * OFDMA  * MU-MIMO  For more information on Broadcom BCM4389, please visit https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/wireless-lan-bluetooth/bcm4389About Broadcom  Broadcom Inc.

2021-03-02,"(Bloomberg) -- The sudden shortage of semiconductors is disrupting automotive production and limiting revenue growth for Apple Inc. It’s created a stock market boon, however, for the makers of chip production equipment.Those companies have emerged as the biggest winners from the supply crunch as chipmakers rush to add more factory capacity. Applied Materials Inc., the world’s biggest equipment maker, has seen its shares advance 36% this year, making it the best performer in a semiconductor index. Brooks Automation Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. are each up more than 19%, nearly twice the gain in the Philadelphia semiconductor index. The stocks fell on Tuesday amid a broad technology slump following a two-day rally.Expanding equipment budgets by major chipmakers and governments concerned about foreign dominance of production facilities are giving Wall Street increasing confidence that the rally has staying power.“Over the next three to five years, this is definitely very bullish for semicap equipment in terms of overall tightness and focus on domestic supply,” said Krish Sankar, an analyst with Cowen & Co.The shortfall is a problem that seemed unthinkable a year ago when a rapidly spreading Covid-19 virus sent economic activity plummeting as companies began efforts to reduce production in anticipation of ebbing sales. Instead, after an initial shock, sales in many industries surged and companies scrambled to boost inventories. Many chipmakers are now producing at maximum capacity and governments are suddenly looking at a dearth of homegrown plants as a national security risk.Supply CrunchU.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order last week to review the country’s supply chains for semiconductors and other products. While there aren’t expected to be any quick fixes, industry watchers say the long-term trend is clear: more equipment will be needed.“The semiconductor industry is running on all cylinders, and you’re seeing companies that might in the past have been reluctant to commit to capex (capital expenditures) now all of a sudden trying to ramp up as quickly as they can,” said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager with Synovus Trust Co., which owns shares of Applied Materials.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which produces chips for Apple and Broadcom Inc., plans to spend $12 billion to construct a plant in Arizona. Some of the costs for that facility were included in the company’s capital spending plans for 2021 that sparked a rally in chip related stocks around the world in January. Broadcom’s capital outlays could total as much as $28 billion, up from $17 billion in 2020.Huge manufacturers like Taiwan Semi building smaller plants in new regions creates particularly attractive opportunities for Applied Materials, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said on the Santa Clara, California-based company’s earnings call last month.“You have to look at the scale of the factories they’re building and at least what’s been announced is smaller scale,” he said. “That somewhat less efficient factory size is a positive for Applied.”In addition to Applied Materials, top picks for Cowen’s Sankar include Lam Research and MKS Instruments Inc.“You have an environment where demand is very strong, supply is constrained and then you add to it domestic supply build out,” the analyst said in an interview. “At some point these things will normalize, but it won’t be any time soon.”(Updates chart and closes shares in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Chip Machinery Makers Emerge as Big Winners in Supply Crunch

2021-03-03,"On Thursday, March 04, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will report its last quarter's earnings. Here is Benzinga's preview of the company's release. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Broadcom EPS is expected to be around $6.55, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $6.61 billion. Broadcom EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $5.25. Sales were $5.86 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on AVGO If the company were to match the consensus estimate, earnings would be up 24.76%. Revenue would be up 12.84% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 6.25 5.24 5.14 5.34 EPS Actual 6.35 5.40 5.14 5.25 Revenue Estimate 6.43 B 5.76 B 5.69 B 6.00 B Revenue Actual 6.47 B 5.82 B 5.74 B 5.86 B Stock Performance For a full 12 months, the return has risen by 73.38%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

2021-03-03,"Investors who have owned stocks since 2016 generally have experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 114%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Broadcom’s Big Run: One company that has been a great investment in the past five years is semiconductor giant Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO). Broadcom's last five years were as controversial as they were successful. The company’s huge growth was defined by major acquisitions and near acquisitions. Avago Technologies went public in 2009, trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker AVGO. In a blockbuster tech deal, Avago acquired Broadcom Corporation for $37 billion in May 2015. The combined company would maintain the AVGO ticker but would assume the name Broadcom. In 2017, Broadcom made a massive $130 billion buyout bid for semiconductor company QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM). After negotiations with the Qualcomm board of directors, U.S. President Donald Trump ultimately blocked the deal via executive order, citing national security concerns. In the wake of the failed Qualcomm merger, Broadcom acquired software company CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in 2018. Broadcom’s expansion into software was initially met by mostly negative reactions from analysts and investors. In 2019, Broadcom’s buying spree continued with a $10.7 billion acquisition of the enterprise security business of Symantec, which has since changed its name to NortonLifeLock Inc (NASDAQ: NLOK). At the beginning of 2016, Broadcom shares were trading at around $142. Broadcom dropped as low as $114.25 soon after during a broad market sell-off due to concerns about slowing growth in China. Fortunately, that level would mark the stock’s low point of the past five years as Broadcom consistently put up impressive growth numbers. The stock broke $200 for the first time in early 2017 and $300 in early 2019. Broadcom peaked at $331.58 in early 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic scare. Related Link: Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Dollar Tree Stock 5 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today Broadcom In 2021, Beyond: Broadcom shares dropped as low as $155.67 when the market bottomed in March 2020. However, a rise in remote work during the crisis ended up being a bullish catalyst for Broadcom’s business. The stock was back at new all-time highs by mid-2020 and ultimately peaked at $495.14 before pulling back to around $473. Broadcom investors who bought five years ago and held on have generated an impressive return on their investment. In fact, $1,000 in Broadcom stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $4,073 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting Broadcom shares to take a breather in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 29 analysts covering the stock is $480, suggesting just 1.4% upside from current levels.

2021-03-07,"Broadcom delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results and marked significant year-over-year improvements in sales and profitability. Shares of the semiconductor company closed 1.5% higher on Friday. Broadcom’s (AVGO) 1Q adjusted earnings of $6.61 per share beat consensus estimates of $6.57 per share and grew 25.9% year-over-year. Revenues rose about 14% year-over-year to $6.66 billion and topped the Street’s estimates of $6.62 billion. Broadcom’s CEO, Hock Tan, said that “This growth reflects the critical role our technology franchises play in this environment of accelerated digital transformation.” (See Broadcom stock analysis on TipRanks). For the second quarter, the company expects to generate revenues of approximately $6.5 billion, which is higher than the consensus estimates of $6.33 billion. It forecasts adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 59% of 2Q revenues. Following its earnings release, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore raised the stock’s price target to $500 (11% upside potential) from $475 and reiterated a Buy rating. In a note to investors, Seymore stated that the company reported better-than-expected 1Q results mainly driven by broad-based strength across its semiconductor and software segments. Overall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 18 Buys and 4 Holds. Following the past year’s 64.3% rally, the average analyst price target of $516.68 implies further upside potential of about 15% to current levels.

2021-03-08,"On CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report,"" Stephanie Link said she bought more Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO) on Monday because she thought the quarter was outstanding and she couldn't believe the reaction to the shares. It should have been up 5%, said Link. The company reported 14% organic growth, 23% operating profit growth, 35% free cash flow growth and it guided higher on all of the metrics, said Link. Broadcom is in the data center cloud and 5G, which are technologies she wants to be in. Apple is a 20% customer and the company does a lot of M&A. Link would buy any weakness in Broadcom. Karen Firestone bought more shares of Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD), S&P Global Inc. (NYSE: SPGI) and Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (NYSE: BAH). She explained Home Depot is trading at the lowest multiple relative to itself in the last decade and there is no reason it is not going to have decent numbers this year.

2021-03-12,"Seasoned investors realize dividend investing is a time-tested strategy that might be appropriate for most buy-and-hold retail portfolios. They are not interested in timing highly volatile momentum. Instead their investment strategy is, at least in part, to buy shares in high quality dividend-paying companies and then reinvest those dividends over a long period of time, such as until retirement years. Then they begin collecting this passive income stream. Today’s article, therefore, introduces seven of the best tech dividend stocks. When companies are profitable, they make a decision as to whether to distribute the profits as dividends or keep as retained earnings. Management usually never wants to decrease or axe the dividend. Such a cut would potentially signal financial stress, reducing confidence in the firms. Most investors regard dividend distribution as a positive signal regarding future income (or cash flows). Shares of dividend-paying businesses tend to keep their most of their value even in market declines. Investors, especially those who rely on that passive income, often never sell their shares. After all, regardless of any short-term volatility in the stock market that might affect share prices, the dividend is a definite return on investment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In investing, the aim is achieving an acceptable total return that is consistent with an investor’s objectives. Tech stocks are mostly regarded as growth shares. In other words, individuals may not necessarily associate them with dividends. However, there are a number of tech darlings of Wall Street that also pay dividends. They tend to be more mature technology businesses with predictable revenues and cash flows. Thus they might be offering investors the best of both worlds with potential share price growth as well as passive income. Recent research led by Greg Filbeck of the Black School of Business at Penn State Behrend in Erie, PA highlights, “Dividend-yield strategies generate investor interest because they have historically offered better risk-adjusted performance.” Put another way, the case for investing in dividend-paying companies remains strong, and over time, buy-and-hold investors are likely to be well rewarded. 7 OTC Stocks That Could Still Run with the Big Boys Most investors like to include technology shares in their portfolios. With that information, here are seven tech dividend stocks for long-term portfolios: AT&T (NYSE:T) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Corning (NYSE:GLW) Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSEARCA:FIVG) International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA:VGT) Dividend Stocks: AT&T (T) Source: Shutterstock 52-Week Range: $26.08 – $34.611-Year Price Change: Down about 15%Dividend Yield: 6.94% Our first stock for today might appeal to contrarian and value investors. Over the past year, the Street has regarded Texas-based AT&T with significant pessimism. The group operates in telecommunications, media and technology. Its segments include AT&T Communications, WarnerMedia and AT&T Latin America. In late January, the company announced fourth-quarter financial results. Revenue was $45.7 billion, a decline of 2.3% year-over-year (YoY). Adjusted earnings-per-share for the quarter was 75 cents, down 15.7% YoY. However, free cash flow stood at $7.7 billion, a figure that pleased analysts. CEO John Stankey said, “We ended the year with strong momentum in our market focus areas of broadband connectivity and software-based entertainment. […] And the release of Wonder Woman 1984 helped drive our domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers to more than 41 million, a full two years faster than our initial forecast.” Forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are 9.35 and 1.24, respectively. The Street blames the high debt levels for the recent poor performance of T shares. However, others believe it is manageable. At current prices, I find the valuation level enticing. With a dividend yield of over 7%, AT&T deserves your interest. Broadcom (AVGO) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $155.67 – $495.141-year price change: Up about 94%Dividend yield: 3.17% Chip group Broadcom has been a tech darling for many years. It offers semiconductor infrastructure software solutions. In 2020, AVGO stocks reported solid gains, and the median target of analysts’ price estimates currently stands at $500. Broadcom released Q1 2021 financials in early March. The top line grew by 14% YoY to $6.6 billion. Non-GAAP net earnings came at $2.97 billion in Q1 2021. A year ago, they had been $2.37 billion. Diluted EPS inched up $1.36 to hit $6.61 in Q1 2021. Free cash flow was shy of $3 billion. For Q2 2021, management’s revenue guidance is approximately $6.5 billion. “This quarter highlights the strength of our financial model with 14% year over year revenue growth translating to an increase in operating profit of 23%,” said CFO Kirsten Spears. “We continue to deliver strong free cash flow, approximately $3 billion in the quarter, representing 35% growth on a year on year basis.” 7 Stocks to Buy That Are Cheering for March Madness AVGO stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 16.86 and 7.94, respectively. In the past decade, management grew the top line both by making several impressive acquisitions as well as by achieving organic growth. The coming years are likely to see further shareholder growth. Corning (GLW) Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $17.44 – 40.241-year price change: Up about 75%Dividend yield: 2.4% Electronics component manufacturer Corning is our next dividend stock. It produces specialty glass, ceramics and technologies for the telecommunications and electronics industry. Its fiber optic equipment is used in electronics, life sciences and the automotive industries. For instance, we find Corning’s electronics components in mobile phones, automobiles, data centers, and scientific test kits and products. In recent months, Corning has been getting significant attention due to its 5G prospects. It supplies indoor networks that are 5G ready. The group also provides glass and ceramic shields for Apple’s iPhone 12. Therefore, Corning will benefit from increased iPhone sales and 5G rollout. Going forward, analysts expect 5G to increase revenue in the optical communications segment. In late January, it released robust Q4 and full-year metrics. Core sales of $3.3 billion was up 11% sequentially and 17% YoY. Core EPS came at 52 cents, up 21% sequentially and 13% YoY. Free cash flow was $464 million. Investors were pleased with strong metrics across all segments. Chief Financial Officer Tony Tripeny cited, “We expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter of 2021. We expect core sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion – compared with $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year – and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year’s first-quarter EPS at the low end of the range. ” GLW stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios stand at 19.08 and 2.56. A potential decline toward the $35 level would improve the margin of safety. With a market capitalization (cap) of almost $30 billion, Corning is likely to register further growth. Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $18.66 – $37.091-year price change: Up about 51%Dividend yield: 1%Expense ratio: 0.3%, or $30 per $10,000 invested annually Our next choice is an exchange-traded fund (ETF), namely the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity fund. The fund focuses on the 5G revolution that is upon us. The “fifth generation” technology is the most recent standard for cellular networks. It provides exposure to businesses that are behind the growth of 5G technologies. Leading chip names, cloud businesses, telecoms and satellite-based communications groups are among the companies represented. The fund started trading in March 2019 and net assets stand at $1.1 billion. FIVG, which has 77 holdings, tracks the returns of the BlueStar Global 5G Communications Index. The components of the index are reviewed semi-annually. NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), LM Ericsson Telefon (NASDAQ:ERIC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) are among the top names in the roster. 7 Internet of Things Stocks to Buy for Our Interconnected World In the past 12 months, the fund has had a spectacular return and hit a record high in February. But so far in 2021, FIVG has only returned about 1%. Before long, a large number of gadgets used in personal and professional lives will rely on 5G technology. This ETF could be appropriate for many retail investors as it offers diversification across many stocks. International Business Machines (IBM) Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $90.56 – $135.881-year price change: Up about 18%Dividend yield: 5.1% Armonk, New York-headquartered tech giant International Business Machines has a long history as a dividend stock. However, over the past decade, amidst the global technological transformation, IBM has seen revenues shrink. In other words, the company has been playing catch up. The iconic industrial giant offers software, information technology (IT) services and hardware. 97% of the world’s largest banks are IBM’s clients. Its mainframes handle 90% of all credit card transactions globally. Management is working hard to make the group a dominant fintech and blockchain player. The company reported Q4 and full year results on Jan. 21. Quarterly net revenue was $20.4 billion, a decline of 6% YoY. Yet, analysts were pleased to see that total cloud revenue came at $7.5 billion, up 10% YoY. The company has been focusing on increased cloud-based software solutions. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were $1.9 billion and $2.07, respectively, both down 56% YoY. IBM’s free cash flow was $6.1 billion during the quarter. “We made progress in 2020 growing our hybrid cloud platform as the foundation for our clients’ digital transformations while dealing with the broader uncertainty of the macro environment.” said Arvind Krishna, IBM CEO. “The actions we are taking to focus on hybrid cloud and AI will take hold, giving us confidence we can achieve revenue growth in 2021.” IBM stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios stand at 11.52 and 1.55. Management’s objective is to make IBM a leaner operation with cloud based recurring revenue streams. Since its acquisition of Red Hat, IBM’s focus has moved to artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud operations. If you believe its shares are likely to shine again, then now might be a good time to buy this dividend stock. Texas Instruments (TXN) Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $93.09 – $181.801-year price change: Up about 65%Dividend yield: 2.33% Diversified semiconductor bellwether Texas Instruments designs, manufactures, and sells analog and embedded processing chips. The end markets include industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment and enterprise systems. It has 14 manufacturing sites worldwide. In late January, Texas Instruments announced Q4 metrics. Revenue was $4.08 billion, an increase of 22% YoY. Net income came at $1.69 billion, up 58% YoY. Similarly EPS of $1.80 meant an increase of 61% YoY. Finally, free cash flow in Q4 was $1.9 billion. CEO Rich Templeton commented, “Together, our dividends and stock repurchases reflect our continued commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. TI’s first quarter outlook is for revenue in the range of $3.79 billion to $4.11 billion and earnings per share between $1.44 and $1.66.” We have to note that 90% of sales are from outside the U.S. As a result of the recent weakness in the value of the greenback, Texas Instruments will likely to see higher revenues in the coming quarters. 7 of the Top Transportation Stocks to Buy Right Now TXN stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 25.58 and 10.84, respectively. In the past year, investors have priced in a V-shaped recovery in semiconductor demand, especially in cars and industrials. And TI shares have returned over 60%. Therefore, potential short-term profit-taking is likely. And decline toward the $160 level would improve the margin of safety. Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares (VGT) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $179.45 – $382.731-year price change: Up about 64%Dividend yield:0.82%Expense ratio: 0.1% Our final discussion centers around another tech ETF. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF gives access to diversified tech businesses. The fund started trading in January 2004, and net assets stand close to $47 billion. VGT, which tracks the returns of the MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50 index, holds 345 companies. Over 57% of the assets are in the top 10 names. Thus, substantial price moves in these names affect the value of the fund. In terms of sectors, technology hardware, storage and peripheral leads with 23.2%. Next in line are systems software (20.1%), semiconductors (15.9%), and application software (13.3%). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are among top the names in the roster. In recent years, these firms have been tech darlings and growth leaders. Given the recent up in the share price of many of these companies, there could soon be profit-taking in the fund. However, the new decade is likely to be shaped by technological innovations. Therefore, the fund deserves to be on your radar. On the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil is long T stock.

2021-03-22,"It may seem like a bizarre observation in the context of 14% year-over-year revenue growth and 63% booking growth in the last quarter, but Broadcom (AVGO) really isn’t that well-suited to this bullish growth cycle in chip stocks. Broadcom management certainly cares about and nurtures growth opportunities, but this name was among the first chip companies to really appreciate that margins drive long-term value, and that margin focus usually serves Broadcom better in periods of weaker sentiment. Be that as it may, Broadcom is looking at major growth opportunities in 2021, including the next generation of Apple (AAPL) 5G iPhones, 400G networking with data center customers (including hyperscale customers), custom ASIC with AI and wireless infrastructure opportunities, and a Wi-Fi 6 upgrade cycle. With those drivers in place, Broadcom could generate a mid-teens near-term return and high single-digit long-term annualized returns. A Strong Quarter, But Maybe Not Strong Enough Supply pressures are a well-understood challenge across the semiconductor industry right now, but Broadcom nevertheless delivered 14% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter, with a 17% year-over-year gain in the Semiconductor business and 5% increase in the Infrastructure business (largely software). While that’s not a bad result, it was less than 1% better than expected during a quarter in which many Broadcom peers and rivals exceeded expectations by larger amounts. It should be noted that even a small miss in the semiconductor business doesn’t look good, and the guide for the fiscal second quarter was only about 2% higher than expected. Performance relative to expectations certainly matters, but there were several points of strength in this last quarter. Within the semiconductor business, Wireless grew 52% on strong iPhone volumes and content growth, while Networking rose 15%. Broadband grew 8% as service providers continue to upgrade PON, DOCSIS, and Wi-Fi 6 routers due to ongoing work-from-home demand. Storage was weak, down 22%, but not unexpectedly so given a period of “digestion” for data center investments. Multiple Attractive Drivers To Push The Stock Broadcom isn’t lacking growth drivers in the remainder of 2021, and with the company 90% booked for the fiscal year, downside risk is limited. While double-ordering is an issue/risk across the sector, the combination of Broadcom’s no-cancellation policy and close working relationship with customers on custom products significantly reduces that risk. In Wireless, Broadcom is leveraged to ongoing growth in 5G handset volumes (which are still significantly underpenetrated) and the higher filter and front-end content those phones contain. There are also widespread rumors that Broadcom has won wireless charging and new touch controller content on the next generation of iPhones, further leveraging that expected handset volume growth. Networking orders were up 80% year-over-year in the quarter, and Broadcom will likely see strong demand for its Trident 4 (enterprise switching), Tomahawk 3 (hyperscale switching), and Jericho 2 (service provider routing) chips as 2021 rolls on and enterprise/hyperscale data center customers move forward on 200G/400G installations and service providers resume metro installations to support network traffic growth. In addition to these products, ongoing growth in the custom ASIC business is likely as customers like Google (GOOGL) continue to scale up their AI/machine learning efforts. Longer-term, the company’s efforts in silicon photonics, particularly the effort to integrate optical transceiver functionality with/onto switching chips (the first product being the Thebit 800GB DR8 integrated transceiver), reflects an opportunity to significantly reduce power demands while driving better performance. Wi-Fi 6 isn’t going to be as big of a deal as those other drivers, but Broadcom’s Broadband business is a highly profitable segment that often doesn’t get its due. The Outlook Rivals like Marvell (MRVL) are stepping up their efforts in custom silicon, but the competition here isn’t that much of a concern. Rather, datacenter interconnect competition, where Inphi (IPHI) has staked out a big lead in PAM4, could pose a threat. The bigger risk to Broadcom, though, is sentiment, and particularly where capital allocation is concerned. Broadcom has been highly acquisitive, and management has made its desire to do more deals known, but the Street hasn’t loved the forays into software (even though bookings are growing and gross margins are around 90%) and likely doesn’t want to see more. The modeling assumptions for Broadcom support a long-term revenue growth rate in the mid-single-digits (5% to 6%), and ongoing margin leverage is expected. In the short-term, operating margin is estimated to improve from around 54% in FY’20 (non-GAAP) to 57% in FY’21 and 57.75% in FY’23, with long-term free cash flow (FCF) growth closer to 7% as expanded operating margins and reduced capex needs to support revenue growth (an advantage of software businesses) drive wider FCF margins. Analysts Weigh In AVGO has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys and 3 Holds issued in the last three months. Given the $519.86 average analyst price target, 10% upside potential could be in the cards. (See Broadcom stock analysis on TipRanks) The Bottom Line While long-term discounted FCF supports a long-term total annual return expectation on the low end of the high single-digits, the company’s near-term gross and operating margins support a fair value around $550. Over the long-term, margins do drive revenue and EBITDA multiples, but revenue growth can be a more powerful driver in up-cycles, which is why Broadcom isn’t necessarily ideally positioned today. Even so, this is a very high-quality chip company that gives investors good leverage to multiple growth markets, as well as a larger-than-average yield for the sector.

2021-04-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadband providers are seeing delays of more than a year when ordering internet routers, becoming yet another victim of chip shortages choking global supply chains and adding challenges for millions still working from home.Carriers have been quoted order times as long as 60 weeks, more than doubling previous waits, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.Running out of the right router would prevent a carrier from being able to add new subscribers to its network, risking lost sales in the ever-competitive broadband market. Their supply chains have become a headache because sharp coronavirus manufacturing shutdowns a year ago were exacerbated by a prolonged surge in demand for better home broadband equipment, said Karsten Gewecke, head of European regional business for Zyxel Communications Corp, a Taiwan-based router-maker.Since January, it’s asked customers to order products a year in advance, he said, because the lead time for components like chips from Broadcom Inc. doubled to a year or more since then. Zyxel is a major supplier of routers, with customers including Norway’s Telenor ASA and Britain’s Zen Internet.Adtran, a U.S. network equipment maker picking up market share from China’s Huawei Technologies Co. in Europe, has also warned customers of supply chain risks and lead-time extensions in recent months. It’s expanded its warehouse facilities in the U.K., more than doubling its inventory and logistics capacity to avoid problems, a spokesman said by email.No carrier has run out of routers completely yet, but the supply chain looks strained for the next six months, so it’s possible, according to Gewecke. “We have been very close several times,” he said in a video call. “It could still happen.”Even shipments already en route can’t escape global trade ructions: last week, Zyxel routers were on and behind the Evergreen ship which blocked the Suez Canal, according to Gewecke.Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Some 90% of its 2021 supply has already been ordered, CEO Hock Tan said last month.Zyxel’s problems started more than a year ago when manufacturing in its Wuxi, China factory shut down for a month due to Covid-19. Since it reopened, supplies have been spotty and shipping costs have spiked as much as ten times their previous levels as exporters raced to catch up, even vying for space with outbound medical and personal protective equipment.Strong demand for networking products has helped Zyxel’s parent company Unizyx Holding Corp. Its shares have soared more than 181% in the last twelve months.Since Chinese factories restarted, chipsets have become a global bottleneck, choked by shortages of parts like silicon wafers as well as supply-demand mismatches. Components for other systems like memory and power management are also affected, Gewecke said.“It’s a snowball effect that we’re pushing in front of us, and the situation since then has just become worse and worse and worse,” said Gewecke. “When I talk to some of the chipset vendors, some of them tell me that they have something like overbooking of 300% of their capacity.”With semiconductor foundries struggling to allocate scarce capacity, less profitable work gets pushed to the back of the line. Routers command lower margins than smartphones and computers, and then within the world of routers, those destined for less affluent markets like eastern Europe use less sophisticated, lower-margin parts. In a similar vein, smaller telecom operators have been worst hit, while global enterprises have clinched supplies with their buying power.Some carriers have stockpiled to avoid shortfalls, and some were further insulated by ordering months’ worth of equipment ahead of potential Brexit trade disruptions.(Updates with Zyxel parent’s stock performance in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Sixty-Week Delay on Router Orders Shows Scale of Chip Crisis
