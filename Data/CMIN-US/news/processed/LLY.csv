2018-01-16,"Big pharmaceutical stocks are moving in disparate directions on Tuesday, with Merck (MRK) rising on good news while Eli Lilly (LLY) was falling after a downgrade.  Merck is higher after late-stage trial data showed that Keytruda, when used with two chemotherapy drugs, was successful as a first-line treatment for lung cancer.  While the blockbuster drug is already approved for use for cancer treatment, including lung cancer, the results were good news, as Merck and other Big Pharma companies are racing to bring new lung-cancer treatment options to market.  As for Eli Lilly, Goldman Sachs' Jami Rubin and her team downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral, writing that while they are still bullish on the company's long term, they're concerned that the bull thesis is well understood and already reflected in the stock's valuation. Moreover, Rubin argues, the risk to Lilly's diabetes franchise, particularly Trulicity--the company's biggest and fastest growth driver--isn't fully appreciated by the market, and that could cause downside to consensus estimates.","Big Pharma: Merck Zooms, Eli Lilly Lags"

That sounds like great news all around, but it actually creates a problem for income investors: Where can they find dividend stocks poised for outperformance that still sport decent yields? The idea, after all, is to buy stocks when they&apos;re low, not hitting new highs. Furthermore, the market&apos;s relentless rise is depressing yields on dividend stocks. Don&apos;t forget: The yield on a dividend stock falls as its price goes up. A year ago, the dividend-paying stocks in the Standard & Poor&apos;s 500-stock index had a trailing yield of 2%, according to Birinyi Associates. After gaining roughly 13% over the past 52 weeks, the yield on the S&P 500 is down to 1.8%. Quality buy-rated dividend stocks with better-than-average yields are hard to find, but we&apos;re here to help. First, we scoured the S&P 500 for dividend stocks with yields of at least 2%. From that pool, we focused on stocks with an average broker recommendation of &quot;Buy&quot; or better from Zacks Investment Research. Lastly, we dug into research and analysts&apos; estimates on the top-scoring names. That led us to these 25 great dividend stocks that have the highest analyst ratings.

2018-09-17,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  shares surged nearly 7% in Monday premarket trade after the company&apos;s migraine therapy, intended to prevent chronic attacks of head pain along with other severe, disabling symptoms, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The therapy, Ajovy, is administered as an injection, using a prefilled syringe, and can be dosed on a quarterly or monthly basis. The monthly dose will cost $575 per dose and the quarterly dose will cost $1,725, Teva said, meaning the product&apos;s total yearly cost will be about $6,900 per year irrespective of dose. The pricing figures released by Teva refer to the therapy&apos;s wholesale acquisition cost, or the price a drugmaker offers wholesalers, from which discounts are typically taken. About 38 million Americans, or 12% of the population, experience migraines, and though the treatment landscape has been sparse so far, it is poised to become increasingly competitive. Another preventative therapy, from Amgen Inc.  and Novartis AG [S: nvs] was approved by the FDA in May, and the companies cited the same price tag, or $6,900. A FDA decision for another drug in this class, from Eli Lilly & Co. , is expected in the near future as well. For the beleaguered Teva, the new approval is a &quot;clear positive,&quot; said J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott, though he noted &quot;the highly competitive dynamics in the space with Amgen, Teva and Lilly all launching within six months of each other and with relatively limited differentiation among agents.&quot; Schott expects Teva&apos;s migraine therapy could sell about $150 million next year and as much as $600 million by 2022; even so, he sees &quot;few growth drivers or pipeline assets beyond Ajovy&quot; given generic competition for the company&apos;s flagship multiple sclerosis medication and challenging conditions for generic drugs. Shares of the U.S.-listed Teva have surged 20.6% year-to-date, while the S&P 500  has risen 8.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lifted 5.8%.",Teva stock surges 7% after FDA approves migraine medication

## Three healthcare stocks

The broader market is trading in the green territory today but largely on a mixed note compared to the volatility in the previous couple of sessions. At 11:40 AM ET, the S&P 500 Index (SPY), NASDAQ Composite Index (QQQ), and Dow Jones Industrial Average were trading with 0.8%, 1.1%, and 0.6% gains. However, some healthcare stocks (XLV)(VHT)(IBB) were making huge moves today. Let’s take a look.

## Loxo Oncology

Today before the market opened, the American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) announced the acquisition of Loxo Oncology (LOXO). According to the agreement between the two companies, Eli Lilly will acquire Loxo for $235.00 per share in cash, which translates into approximately $8.0 billion. After the news came out, Loxo stock surged nearly 66.0% to $232.12.

## Sage Therapeutics

The biopharmaceutical firm Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) revealed positive results of the Phase 3 ROBIN Study today. The outcome of the study suggested a “significant improvement” in women with postpartum depression (or PPD) who were treated with its SAGE-217 drug for two weeks. This news boosted investors’ confidence, and SAGE stock surged 62.1% to a day high of $158.09.

## Exact Sciences

The molecular diagnostics firm Exact Sciences (EXAS) said today that it expects its fourth quarter of 2018 revenue between $142.5 million and $143.5 million, which reflected about a 64% rise in its revenue from the fourth quarter of the previous year. In a press release, the company said that it “completed approximately 292,000 Cologuard tests during the fourth quarter of 2018,” up about 66% year-over-year. Plus, Exact Sciences noted, “Nearly 15,000 health care providers ordered Cologuard for the first time during the fourth quarter of 2018.” These positive developments drove EXAS stock to rally today to post a day high of $72.78, up 11.0% from its previous session’s closing price.

2019-01-07,"Pfizer or Eli Lilly: Which Is the Better Bet in 2019?

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Revenue guidance 

On its third-quarter earnings conference call, Pfizer (PFE) narrowed its 2018 revenue guidance range from $53.0 billion–$55.0 billion to $53.0 billion–$53.7 billion due to the weaker-than-expected performance of its Essential Health segment. Ongoing product shortages from its legacy Hospira sterile injectables business and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations continued to drag on the company’s revenue performance in 2018.

In a press release issued on December 19, 2018, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) reiterated its 2018 revenue guidance of $24.3 billion–$24.5 billion. Eli Lilly expects its 2019 revenue to be in the range of $25.3 billion–$25.8 billion.

According to its investor presentation, Eli Lilly is expected to report mid-single-digit YoY (year-over-year) revenue growth in 2019 (considering the midpoint of its revenue guidance projections for 2018 and 2019) despite an anticipated negative impact of 150 basis points due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. The company has also revised its minimum revenue growth outlook upward from its previously projected CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5% to a CAGR of 6% for the period ranging from 2015 to 2020. Eli Lilly expects its human pharmaceutical business to report a CAGR of 7% for its revenue from 2015 to 2020.

## Wall Street estimates

Wall Street analysts expect Pfizer’s revenues to be $53.59 billion, $54.50 billion, and $55.18 billion, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. These estimates imply YoY revenue growth rates of 1.99%, 1.70%, and 1.25%, respectively, for 2018, 2019, and 2020.

On the other hand, Wall Street analysts expect Eli Lilly’s revenues to be $24.43 billion, $25.41 billion, and $26.64 billion, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. These estimates imply YoY revenue growth rates of 6.80%, 4.04%, and 4.81%, respectively, for 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Eli Lilly is thus expected to witness a better revenue growth trajectory than Pfizer in the coming years.

In the next article, we’ll compare the earnings growth prospects of Pfizer and Eli Lilly in greater detail.

## Expense guidance

On its third-quarter earnings conference call, Pfizer (PFE) said it expected its cost of sales as a percentage of its revenue to fall in the range of 20.8%–21.3%. The company expects its selling, informational, and administrative expenses to be ~$14.0 billion–$14.5 billion and its R&D (research and development) expenses to be close to $7.7 billion–$8.1 billion. The company also expects its effective tax rate to be 16% for 2018, while its adjusted other income is expected to be close to $1.3 billion.

At its 2019 guidance and investment community meeting, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) forecast marketing, selling, and administrative expenses in the range of $6.3 billion–$6.5 billion and R&D expenses in the range of $5.2 billion–$5.4 billion for 2018. The company said that it expected its other income to be $75 million–$200 million in the year. Eli Lilly also expects its GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP tax rates to be close to 23.0% and 16.0%, respectively.

## Expense expectations 

Wall Street analysts have forecast Pfizer’s SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) expenses as a percentage of its revenues to be 26.76%, 26.28%, and 25.87%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. On the other hand, Eli Lilly is expected to report SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue of 26.41%, 25.66%, and 25.31%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. While both companies are expected to gradually reduce the percentages of their revenue that are associated with marketing and commercial activities from 2018 to 2020, Eli Lilly is expected to be slightly more cost efficient in its SG&A activities than Pfizer.

Wall Street analysts expect Pfizer’s R&D expenses as a percentage of its revenues to be 14.66%, 14.79%, and 14.84%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. On the other hand, Eli Lilly is expected to report R&D expenses as a percentage of its revenues of 21.81%, 21.89%, and 21.67%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Eli Lilly is thus investing a higher percentage of its total revenue in supporting its research pipeline.

## Acquisition announcement

On January 7, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) issued a press release announcing that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Loxo Oncology (LOXO) for a total consideration of ~$8.0 billion. The deal follows close on the heels of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY) announcement of its acquisition of Celgene (CELG), and it marks the second major pharmaceutical M&A (mergers and acquisitions) transaction in 2019.

According to Eli Lilly’s investor presentation, the company is paying cash of $235 per Loxo Oncology share in a tender offer, representing a premium of 68% to Loxo’s closing price on January 4.

According to Eli Lilly’s investor presentation, the company has planned to fund the acquisition using a combination of cash and debt. The company also aims to maintain its current credit rating and financial flexibility to pursue attractive M&A and licensing opportunities in 2019, but due to this transaction, it may have to limit its share repurchases to ~$3.5 billion in the first half of the year.

## Investor reaction

On January 7, Loxo Oncology closed at $232.65, 66.33% higher than its previous closing price. Eli Lilly stock closed at $115.28 on January 7, 0.54% higher than its previous closing price. The rise in the company’s share price highlights the overall positive sentiment for the transaction among both companies’ investors.

Based on its closing price on January 7, Eli Lilly had reported returns of 0.95% in the last week, -1.06% in the last month, and 2.03% in the last quarter. The company had also reported returns of 31.91% in the last half year, 34.80% in the last year, and -0.38% YTD (year-to-date).

Based on its closing price on January 7, Loxo Oncology had reported returns of 73.28% in the last week, 74.33% in the last month, and 43.08% in the last quarter. The company had also reported returns of 22.47% in the last half year, 174.09% in the last year, and 66.10% YTD.

## Pricing changes for Pfizer and Eli Lilly

In November 2018, Pfizer (PFE) issued a press release announcing a hike in the list prices of 10% (or 41) of the medicines in its drug portfolio starting on January 15, 2019.

According to the press release, Pfizer expects no revenue impact from these prices increases in 2019 due to an increase in rebates to be paid to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers. According to the release, the company has projected the net impact of price hikes on its revenue growth to be -1% in the US market in 2018 compared to 2017.

According to its 2019 guidance and investment community meeting, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) expects its 2019 revenue to be driven mainly by an increase in sales volumes and not by price hikes. The company has projected a single-digit decline in net prices in the US market in 2019, but it plans to determine its list prices in 2019 on a product-by-product basis.

## Margin expectations 

Wall Street analysts expect Pfizer’s gross margins to be 79.20%, 79.14%, and 79.09%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. On the other hand, Eli Lilly is expected to report gross margins of 76.01%, 76.51%, and 76.97%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Analysts expect Pfizer’s adjusted net income margins to be 33.51%, 32.92%, and 33.09%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. On the other hand, Eli Lilly is expected to report adjusted net income margins of 23.61%, 23.39%, and 25.12%, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Pfizer is thus expected to report higher profit margins than Eli Lilly from 2018 to 2020. However, while Pfizer is expected to report a slight contraction in its profit margin from 2018 to 2020, Eli Lilly is expected to report a modest expansion in its margin in the same timeframe.

In the next article, we’ll compare the cost structures of Pfizer and Eli Lilly in greater detail.

## Earnings guidance

On its third-quarter earnings conference call, Pfizer (PFE) said that it expected its 2018 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.98–$3.02, narrower than its previously projected guidance of $2.95–$3.05. However, the midpoint of its updated EPS guidance is the same as the midpoint of its previous guidance range and implies 13% YoY (year-over-year) growth.

In a press release issued on December 19, 2018, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) revised its 2018 GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS guidance from its previously projected range of $3.04–$3.09 to $2.80–$2.85. The company, however, reiterated its 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.55–$5.60, which implied a YoY rise of 30%–31%.

In the release, Eli Lilly also forecast 2019 GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS guidances of $5.52–$5.62 and $5.90–$6.00, respectively. According to the press release, these forecasts didn’t include the company’s $0.08 per share noncontrolling interest in Elanco Animal Health.

## Wall Street estimates

Wall Street analysts expect Pfizer’s non-GAAP EPS to be $3.00, $3.07, and $3.18, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020, implying YoY growth rates of 13.31%, 2.40%, and 3.47%, respectively, for the years.

On the other hand, analysts expect Eli Lilly’s non-GAAP EPS to be $5.58, $5.95, and $6.79, respectively, in 2018, 2019, and 2020, implying YoY growth rates of 30.46%, 6.55%, and 14.18%, respectively, for the years.

Eli Lilly has a lower revenue base than Pfizer, but it continues to report higher absolute non-GAAP EPS figures. Eli Lilly is also expected to report higher YoY EPS growth rates than Pfizer from 2018 to 2020.

In the next article, we’ll compare Pfizer’s and Eli Lilly’s margins in greater detail.

##

Additionally, according to Eli Lilly’s M&A (mergers and acquisitions) conference call, LOXO-195 was granted an orphan drug designation by the FDA in October 2018. The company is expected to announce data from its Phase 1 trial in the first half of 2019.

The markets -- down 6%-plus for the full year -- fell into a turmoil and it looked as if the bulls were finally rolling over into a big bear market. Stocks, commodities and other risk assets tanked as global growth worries moved to the forefront of many investors' minds.

At the time of writing, the S&P 500 is now roughly 12% below its recent September highs, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 14% from its recent peaks. But just as it looked like the markets' woes could spill over into the New Year, the market got its Santa Claus rally after all. From Dec. 24 to Dec. 31, the S&P jumped 6.6% while the Nasdaq gained 7%. Year-to-date so far, the S&P is up another 3%. The Nasdaq, 4.4%.

That doesn't mean that the bear market is over. Far from it. This is a great time to strengthen your portfolio's diversity, introducing a number of defensive stocks to batten down the hatches in case more dark clouds roll over the horizon.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Luckily, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make shifting portfolio strategy a breeze.

By using ETFs, investors can add a dose of safety to their portfolios and potentially save themselves some losses as the bear takes over. Moreover, they can do it quickly with one ticker access. There's no major selling or buying with ETFs. That makes using them the perfect way to hedge a portfolio.

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



With that, here are three defensive ETFs to buy right now to limit a potentially elongated bear market's growl.

Source: Shutterstock 

### Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF)

Expense Ratio: 0.60%, or $60 per $10,000 invested

One of the oldest and most successful ETFs providing safety to portfolios is the $165 million Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:DEF). Heck, it even has &quot;defense&quot; as part of its name. The key to that defense comes down t its underlying construction.

DEF tracks the Invesco Defensive Equity Index. That benchmark combs through the universe of large-cap stocks and finds those superior risk-return profiles during periods of stock market weakness as well as offer gains during bear markets. The basic underlying idea is to create a portfolio of stocks that should hold up- or at least fall a lot less than the broader market- when things get dicey.

The ETF currently holds 100 different stocks- with its top holdings reading like a who's who of America's &quot;bedrock&quot; stocks, including drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) and consumer products firm Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL). Stocks in the ETF are equally weighted so that investors can gain the most from each holding's defensive nature. Healthcare stocks make up around 20% of the portfolio, while industrials and tech make much around 15% of assets each.

As far as performance goes, DEF has been one of the better defensive ETFs around. During market troubles, the fund has managed to hold its own. Considering 2018's performance, DEF has managed to beat the S&P 500. That outperformance should continue next year as the market drifts lower.

### Defensive ETFs To Buy Today: iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY)

Expense Ratio: 0.39%

Investors often forget one of the best ways to score some great defense is through firms that pay hefty dividends. After all, making a few percentage points in yield can mean the difference between a loss and gain at the end of the day during drifting and sinking markets. More importantly, reinvested dividends can propel an overall position that much higher as prices rebound. Dividend ETFs such as the iShares Select Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:DVY) make it easy to add a dose of dividends to a portfolio.

DVY can be seen as a &quot;catch-all&quot; fund when it comes to dividend ETFs. The ETFs underlying index -- Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index -- looks at U.S. stocks that have long histories of paying dividends as well as high yields. This allows investors to score a high yield today as well as one that will last the test of time. That's perfect for today's low return environment. The more pennies you can pick-up today, the better.

And while the idea of &quot;high yield&quot; may sound scary, investors shouldn't fret. DVY's top holdings are not fly-by-night names. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and utility Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) are some of the stalwarts dotting its top-holdings. Those stalwarts and its remaining holdings help produce a tasty 3.51% yield.

All in all, dividends can help boost a portfolios defense and DVY could be one of the best ETFs to get that exposure.

### SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)

Expense Ratio: 0.40%

When the going gets tough, investor's flock to gold. That relationship has been tested time and time again. And lately, the various gold ETFs are continuing the trend. Gold prices have spiked in recent weeks as the market has sputtered and finished December at six-month highs. And if you remember, six months ago was the last time the market had a slight meltdown. Because of this, gold ETFs could be one of the best ways to kind of hedge the upcoming storm in the year ahead.

And you can't get much better than the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD).

The $33.5 billion GLD is one of the largest ETFs in the world and is the behemoth among the gold ETFs. The fund doesn't use futures to get its gold exposure but owns physical bullion stored in a vault on behalf of investors. That keeps GLD's share price closely mirroring what is happening in the gold market. Each share of the ETF represents a 10th of an ounce of gold. So, buy 10 shares and you have an ounce of physical gold in your portfolio. This makes the GLD one of the easiest ways to add exposure to the asset class.

There's no need to pay exorbitant fees to own gold and gain from its hedging abilities. In fact, GLD costs a cheap 0.40% in expenses. Given the markets current state, adding a touch of gold could be one of the best defenses around.

At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have an exposure to any ETF or stock listed.

2019-01-11,"Given the meltdown we've seen across the entire market over the past 16 weeks, many investors may be overlooking company-specific and industry-specific news. One of those pieces of news? That a swath of pharmaceutical stocks are raising their prices in the new year.

Pharmaceutical stocks and biotech companies are interesting plays in any market, partly due to their secular business nature. Meaning that, recession or boom, consumers need treatment. Whether it's as large as open heart surgery or small as a Tylenol, we pay for healthcare when we need it. For as secular as the group can be though, it has been under tremendous volatility lately.

With that in mind, almost 40 companies started of 2019 with a series of prices hikes. The average raise was roughly 6.3%. So who were these companies and how do we trade their stocks?

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * InvestorPlace Roundup: The Hottest Stocks in the Market Today 



Let's look at a few of those pharmaceutical stocks.

### Allergan (AGN)

Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is known for its vast drug and treatment portfolio. However, at the turn of the year, Allergan raised prices on 51 of its products. That's just over half of its portfolio. Of those 51 products, 27 of them saw an increase of 9.5%. The rest were bumped by 4.9%.

All that said, Allergan makes the case that it's not a money-hungry cash grab. Rather, the company says it should not see any net gains as a result of the price hikes because it's providing higher rebates and discounts to its distributors.

Allergan may say that, but investors sure wish it would help. Analysts expect sales to fall 1.7% this year and another 1.6% next year. On the earnings front, expectations call for a 90-basis-point gain this fiscal year before a 0.7% decline in 2019. Essentially, estimates call for flat earnings growth overall from fiscal 2017 through 2019.

That's likely one factor for why the stock has gone from $195 in October to roughly $125 at its December lows. As AGN approaches the $145 to $150 level now, look to see if and where resistance comes into play. There's downtrend resistance at play, as well as the gap-fill up near $145. It would be encouraging to see the $140-ish level hold as support, but that doesn't leave much wiggle room for Allergan.

### Bristol-Myers (BMY)

No one is talking about recent dividend payout from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), nor are they talking about its recent price increases. The company raised prices on its cancer drugs Opdivo and Yervoy by 1.5%, while lifting prices by 6% on its chemotherapy treatment Sprycel and its autoimmune disease drug Orencia.

However, most investors are talking about the company's $74 billion cash and stock acquisition of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).

BMY was hammered on the news at first, but rebounded by about 4% on Friday once investors were able to digest the news. Management expects the deal to close in the third quarter of 2019. Creating over $2 billion in synergies and boosting growth, BMY management is hoping the acquisition makes its stock more attractive to investors.

At just 12 times forward earnings with 8.5% sales growth and 28% earnings growth this year, BMY already looks reasonable. Throw in its 3.5% dividend yield and its even more attractive.

On the charts, it's clear that dips down to the upper $40s have been viewed as buying opportunities by investors over the last four years.

### Eli Lilly (LLY)

Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) isn't exempt when it comes to drug price increases, as it raises prices for Jardiance, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, by 6%. Unlike some of its peers, Eli Lilly has been on absolute fire. Shares are up 35% year-over-year and about 60% from its February lows.

Despite the rally, LLY still pays out a 2.2% dividend yield and trades at a somewhat reasonable 20.6 times this year's earnings. Despite the big breakout rally in July, LLY has modest growth expectations. Analysts expect 6.8% and 4% sales growth this year and next year, respectively. Further, estimates call for 30.4% earnings growth this year and 6.5% growth in 2019.

Fueling the breakout during the summer? A strong second-quarter result and potential IPO for one of its businesses. However, some may feel that LLY stock has rallied too far, too fast and that it's no longer a worthy buy. According to the charts, that may be the case if LLY is unable to push higher and take out its recent highs near $120.

If it can break that level, the rally can continue. If not, look to see if uptrend support holds (blue line). Should it fail, LLY could be heading for a retest of its 200-day moving average.

### Pfizer (PFE)

Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) delayed various price hikes in 2018, but pushed through its increases at the start of the year. Not many companies have been as open as Allergan about confirming its specific price hikes, but Pfizer may need them to keep pace in 2019.

That is to say, PFE was one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow Jones last year. After consolidating between $30 and $36 for most of the last five years, shares finally broke out around the same time Eli Lilly did.

In fact, their charts look quite similar too.

After a big breakout six months ago, PFE is having trouble pushing higher. Should it fail to get through the 50-day and short-term uptrend support (blue line) gives way, a test of the 200-day moving average could be in the cards. Should it fail as support, a test of $38 is likely in store. Above the 50-day and a rally to $46 is possible.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



Investors not worried about the charts will key in on Pfizer's 3.4% dividend yield and its valuation of 14 times this year's earnings. Although remember that 2018's 13.2% earnings growth is expected to slow to just 2.7% in 2019.

### Biogen (BIIB)

Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) was also on the list of price increases for 2019. The company increased prices on its multiple sclerosis medications Tecfidera by 6%, Plegridy by 2% and Tysabri by 3.5%.

Like other biotech stocks, Biogen has been volatile and struggling. Nowhere is this more evident than on the charts. Shares went from $370 in February to $250 in a matter of months, then hit nearly $400 per share in late July. Now near $330, BIIB bulls are near a make-or-break point.

The stock has put in a series of lower highs (blue circles) since that big rally in July. Currently, both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages rest at about $313. Investors who believe BIIB is attractive -- trading at about 12 times forward earnings with expectations to grow sales and earnings 2.5% and 8.5% in 2019, respectively -- will want to see it hold above these two marks.

Should it fail, Biogen could quickly head to the bottom of its recent channel, somewhere in the $270 range. On the plus side though, if shares push higher and can close above $340, BIIB may be starting a new uptrend.

### Teva (TEVA)

While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B, NYSE:BRK.A) holds a $750 million stake in Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:TEVA), it's far from his largest holding. Big or small, the Oracle has to be disappointed with the stock's recent action, falling from $24 in November to less than $15 at its lows last month.

Now up over $17, bulls are hoping Teva stock can continue higher. Will it?

Like the others on this list, Teva also raised prices on some of its drugs this year, although the specifics are not well known. So far the name has done well this year, though granted, were just a few sessions into 2019.

In any regard, Teva is bumping into the backside of prior downtrend support (blue line). Should this level act as resistance, bulls will want $16.75 to act as support. If not, the recent lows are in play. Over resistance and the $19 to $20 level is on the table.

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



While the stock trades at less than 7 times this year's earnings, keep in mind that growth has been tough. Sales are forecast to fall 15.8% this year, while analysts expect earnings to contract by 27%. In 2019, the slowdown decelerates, but analysts are still calling for a 4.8% reduction in revenue and a 3% fall in earnings.

### Insys Therapeutics (INSY)

Though it is much smaller than most of the names on this list, Insys Therapeutics (NASDAQ:INSY) is joining them in raising prices -- in this case, on its pain-relief medication Subsys. INSY has a market cap of just $350 million.

The move is probably necessary, given that sales are forecast to fall about 40.5% this year and another 5% in 2019. It doesn't help that INSY doesn't turn a profit, although its lack of debt is encouraging.

Given the selloff we've seen in the stock market since the start of Q4 2018, it's no surprise that investors have cut INSY very little slack. Shares came into Q4 near $10, but are now clinging to the $4.25 level. To say it's been a rough ride would be an understatement.

However, INSY is holding up over the $4 level and is right at downtrend resistance. A push higher to $5 would be encouraging, even if this level acts as resistance on its first attempt. But a break below $4 -- especially in the near-term -- would be worrisome and puts the lows back on the table.

2019-01-11,"So far, 2019 is starting off with a bang in the pharmaceutical industry. Last week, we learned that Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is buying out beleaguered Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) in a behemoth $74 billion takeover. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) followed that up with a large deal of its own, announcing an $8 billion offer for Loxo Oncology (NASDAQ:LOXO). Whether the purchase helps Eli Lilly stock in the long term is another question altogether.

While it may seem small compared to the blockbuster Celgene deal, $8 billion is still a major announcement. Don't forget Gilead Science's (NASDAQ:GILD) deal to buy the revolutionary Hep-C cure company Pharmasset for $11 billion in 2011. Within a couple years, GILD stock quintupled as the Pharmasset drugs lifted Gilead's profitability to the stratosphere.

Needless to say, Loxo, if it delivers in similar fashion, could fundamentally reshape Eli Lilly's future for many years to come. That's especially as Eli Lilly has some patent expirations of its own to consider and really could use a big new product launch or two.

### Loxo: A Steep Price Could Hamper Eli Lilly Stock

It's no secret that biotech stocks got crushed in the 2018 correction. The SPDR Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI) dropped as much as 35% within three months. That meant that companies with strong balance sheets had the ability to go discount shopping. Bristol-Myers was first to take a big swing with the Celgene deal.

However, Eli Lilly's move will also be a game-changer. Not only did Eli Lilly pay $8 billion for Loxo, they also paid a huge premium. LOXO stock previously traded as high as $188/share. Due to the biotech correction it was trading around $140 prior to Eli Lilly's offer.

As such, you'd think something like $200/share (above Loxo's all-time high) would be enough to close the deal. Instead, Eli Lilly offered a whopping $235/share.

Now, to be fair to Eli Lilly, Loxo did enjoy a positive development in that interim period; they managed to get FDA approval for their leading pipeline drug candidate. Though, that approval was widely expected. Regardless, Eli Lilly is paying heavily for a company that is just at the beginning of the commercialization process for their drug candidates.

### Loxo and Eli Lilly Stock

Loxo has taken a different path from most companies in oncology. Instead of targeting its drugs for specific types of cancer, such as lung or prostate, Loxo targets genetic mutations. These genetic mutations appear to lead to cancers across a variety of different body parts.

Loxo's first approved drug targets NTRK gene fusions. This is a rare condition which occurs in roughly 0.2% of the population. Loxo estimates that there are a few thousand eligible patients with NTRK fusions in the U.S. at this time. Thus, with a nearly $400,000/year price tag for the drug, it may take longer than expected for Loxo's product to become a huge commercial seller.

The Chief Business Officer for Loxo, Jake Naarden, stated last year that:

&quot;We expect the initial launch to be challenging, though we remain optimistic about the longer-term trajectory. One of the truisms you often hear about new drug launches is that the first few quarters determine the commercial fate of the drug. Given the penetration of tumor genomic testing today, we do not believe that the first few quarters of this launch will inform very much.&quot;

He makes an important point. Most oncology patients are not prescribed genomic testing today. Additionally, some genomic tests do not include the NTRK fusion. As a result, many potentially eligible patients may not know that Loxo has a beneficial therapy for their condition.

This, however, highlights one big advantage to the Eli Lilly purchase. Eli Lilly has far more connections and influence within the medical community. It has the budget and reach to ensure that more cancer patients test their genomes and are aware of potential novel solutions.

It's likely that Eli Lilly's purchase will bring Loxo's first drug far more attention and quicker clinical uptake. Loxo also brings its promising Loxo-292 therapy which is still in clinical trails.

### Eli Lilly Stock Takeaway

One point in favor of the deal is that Eli Lilly has a strong balance sheet and can pay for Loxo with cash. Heading into the deal, Eli Lilly had $9 billion in cash against $13 billion in total debt. The Loxo purchase will consume almost all of the company's existing cash reserves, but still leave it in a reasonably sound fiscal position.

After adjusting for one-time expenses, Eli Lilly will earn in the ballpark of $4.5 billion dollars for 2018. That means that it's net debt load is not especially problematic. On a debt/EBITDA basis, it comes in around 1.5x, which is quite conservative. From an earnings basis, the Loxo deal will consume just under two full years of Eli Lilly's ongoing net income.

Given the limited size of Loxo's market, at least at first, Eli Lilly won't earn back its $8 billion purchase price in the near-term. But the potential is still great. Eli Lilly is buying a drug platform with a rather novel approach to treating cancer.

If the company is able to commercialize other Loxo drugs that are earlier along in clinical trials, the deal could end up being a big win for Eli Lilly stock.

At this point, Eli Lilly stock may be a bit overvalued. It's still trading at 20x forward earnings. That's quite aggressive for a pharma company, as patent expirations tend to keep PE ratios rather low.

And Eli Lilly stock is up 35% over the past year which is a stark contrast to struggles elsewhere in the health care space. As for the Loxo deal in particular, it could pay off big, but for now, a wait and see approach seems most prudent.

2019-01-18,"In the latest Eli Lilly news (NYSE:LLY), the company's latest sarcoma study was unsuccessful in meeting its goals, which sent LLY stock tumbling during regular trading hours on Friday.

The pharmaceutical company said that its late-stage trial of a treatment designed to help sarcoma patients was unable to meet its main goals. The treatment was a phase 3 trial for the drug Lartruvo, which it combined with doxorubicin in patients who have advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) did not meet its primary endpoint of helping patients achieve overall survival.

The Eli Lilly treatment had reportedly previously provided an overall survival benefit in a phase 2 trial that involved 133 patients. The previous trial helped lead to an accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as the European Medicines Agency.

The company added that it &quot;was surprised and disappointed that LARTRUVO did not improve survival for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma in this study,&quot; according to Anne White, the president a Lilly Oncology, who said so in a statement. Eli Lilly is reportedly in talks with global regulators to see where it proceeds from here.

Until then, the company is planning on booking a charge of $70 million to $90 million, or 10 cents per share in its first quarter. For its full year of its fiscal 2019, the company plans on reducing about 17 cents off its earnings per share.

LLY stock is down more than 2.5% on Friday following the news.

2019-02-04,"It's debatable whether the stock market, as a whole, had a bear market or just a stiff correction to end 2018. There is, however, no such question about biotech stocks. The sector got clobbered last fall. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI) dropped 35% from its September peak. It was a bear market, no doubt about it.

However, pharma and biotech stocks have gotten off to a better start in 2019. Deal-making brought the sector back to life. For starters, Bristol-Meyers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) made one of the biggest deals in pharma history with its purchase of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG). Shortly after that, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) made a huge deal of its own, taking out oncology player Loxo (NASDAQ:LOXO). These big moves have investors focused again on the biotech sector.

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



With that in mind, here are five more biotech stocks to buy that could be winners in 2019.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Gilead Sciences (GILD)

Eli Lilly's deal to buy Celgene reignited the animal spirits in the biotech industry. Everyone is curious what big deal will happen next. For long-suffering biotech major Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), it gets its turn in the spotlight now that Celgene is out of the picture.

Gilead has looked cheap for a while now with its price-to-earnings ratio often below 10 in recent years. Its P/E ratio is still around 10 now. Unlike in the past, however, Gilead's Hep C franchise has just about stabilized in terms of revenues, and as such, earnings are set to rebound as well. Analysts see earnings-per-share rising from $5.40 last year to more than $6 this year and up to something in the $9 range in the year 2021.

It's unlikely GILD stock will still sell under $70 once it is earning $9/share annually with EPS continuing to rise. On top of that, Gilead is very friendly to its shareholders. It has been buying back loads of its own stock in addition to its generous 3.3% dividend yield.

### Novo Nordisk (NVO)

Investors usually don't think of biotech stocks as either conservative or as good sources of dividend income. And, usually, they aren't -- we'll get to a couple more volatile high-risk, high-reward biotech names here in a minute. But for now, let's talk about Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), which is the clear leader in diabetes treatment worldwide. It, like Gilead, is highly profitable and pays a strong 2.6% dividend.

Novo is one of those so-called inevitable investments, in that demographics make it a very likely winner in the coming years. The rate of diabetes cases continues to explode throughout the world. Make no mistake about it: The diabetes epidemic isn't just a U.S. problem. Increasingly, even in emerging markets such as India and Mexico, diabetes-related health care costs are soaring.

  * 10 Cold Weather Stocks to Heat Up Your Returns 



Novo, which controls roughly 25% of the global market in that indication, is the logical winner from this epidemic. NVO stock plunged from its highs a couple years back on insulin pricing concerns. The stock has recovered from its worst levels but is still well short of all-time highs and sells for just 18x earnings. That's a pretty great valuation for a company whose product portfolio and addressable market continues to show serious expansion. While Novo is a very large company on its own, with a $90 billion market cap, the Celgene deal showed us that these sorts of bigger independent biotech firms can potentially be in play as well.

### Puma Biotechnology (PBYI)

Usually, biotech stocks crater after their drug fails to win Food and Drug Administration approval. Sometimes, however, a drug gets FDA approval and then the stock still plummets anyway. Meet Puma Biotechnology (NASDAQ:PBYI). Puma is a victim of the biotech disease known as the slow new drug launch.

Puma started earning commercial revenues off its Nerlynx breast cancer adjutant in 2017. PBYI stock soared to as high as $120 as excitement around the drug launch mounted. Unfortunately, sales didn't pick up as quickly as expected. From Q3 2017 through Q3 2018, Nerlynx sales grew about $15 million per quarter compared to the prior quarter. That is solid growth, though not exponential. However, Q4 showed just a $1.8 million uptick in revenue, falling far below trend.

The near absence of revenue growth combined with other concerns such as potential competition has sent investors into a state of panic. PBYI stock has plunged from as high as $83 just last spring to as low as $17 this past November. It's worth taking another look at PBYI stock now, however. At the end of the day, this is just a $1 billion market cap company doing nearly $250 million a year in revenues with a promising new cancer drug that has tests underway for other conditions beyond its initial breast cancer label. On top of that, Puma should be able to start launching its product in other markets, such as Europe, in addition to its domestic sales. Finally, if the price stays this low, Puma Biotechnology looks like a possible buyout target.

### Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT)

Aimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AIMT) offers investors an interesting catalyst trade. The company recently posted excellent results from its Phase III trial for its treatment to aid with peanut allergies.

It is widely expected that Aimmune will commercially launch its product in 2019. In fact, the company already secured a $170 million loan package from KKR (NYSE:KKR) to get its peanut allergy medication commercially launched. That funding will also help fund trials of the therapy for egg allergies. Unfortunately, due to the recent government shutdown, the FDA delayed various paperwork, including Aimmune's marketing approval. With the government open again, that should come through soon, however, allowing AIMT stockholders to start focusing on the upside again.

  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy 



Ultimately, once the therapy is up and running, it should be a commercial success. The company estimates that there are 1.7 million children in the U.S. with peanut allergies, not to mention the global market. On top of that, the company is running tests for other food allergies such as eggs. At a market cap of just $1.3 billion, there's still upside for Aimmune as its product starts generating meaningful revenues.

### Viking Therapeutics (VKTX)

Finally, we have arguably the most controversial pick of the bunch, Viking Therapuetics (NASDAQ:VKTX). Make no mistake, this is among the riskier of the biotech names, and could have substantial downside if the bears are right. On the other hand, the stock could easily double or triple if events go well.

What's the buzz around Viking? Last spring, VKTX stock spiked from $5 to $10 following positive clinical results from competitor Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MDGL). Madrigal and Viking's drug candidates for non-alcoholic liver disease use the same mechanism of action, thus suggesting that Viking's drug would be effective as well. Later that fall, Viking stock doubled again, hitting $20 following positive results of its own.

Since then, VKTX stock has given back nearly all its gains, falling back to just $9. That is in large part due to a recent short report from Citron Research. Citron went after Ligand Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:LGND), causing a 22% decline in Ligand's share price. Ligand is a major backer of Viking, and Citron took some shots at Viking's prospects as well. Perhaps as a result, short sellers have pounded Viking, putting its short interest up to 37%. That could be a risky bet though, as Viking has a promising Phase 2 drug and $300 million (half the market cap) in net cash to keep doing research.

At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned GILD and NVO stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-02-08,"There's no doubt we've been in a growth-driven market for some time now. Fortunately, the transition from growth-driven to income-driven is a bit gentler than it was when the tech crash happened in 2000. Back then, people were saying things like &quot;growth is the new income.&quot;At the time, most long-term investors were in solid total return plays, getting some decent long-term growth with a bit of income. When the dot-com boom hit, investors were being sold a whole need breed of company with completely different valuations and expectations.Fortunately, we're no longer in those innocent days when a triple-digit price-earnings (P/E) was a good sign for a company. And now, after the extended bull market, smart investors are once again seeing the value of having some solid stocks that will be there for them over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio Following are seven fundamentally sound dividend stocks to buy for now and hang onto for years to come: General Motors (GM)Dividend Yield: 3.94%  Fundamental Score:AGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) hasn't figured into many of my 'Top' lists in recent years. But this nearly 111-year-old company continues to find its way through the challenges of a rapidly changing automotive industry.It's also interesting to note that that automotive giant only has a $54 billion market cap. That's about the same size as Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a matter of fact, all of the U.S.' &quot;Big Three&quot; carmakers have lower market caps than Tesla. That means either GM is wildly discounted or Tesla is wildly overvalued.GM is trading at a current P/E just a hair below 7X. Since Tesla has negative earnings, it doesn't even have a P/E. What's more, GM is delivering a 3.9% dividend. It may be boring, but it will be making cars for a long time to come. Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO)Dividend Yield: 2.81%  Fundamental Score:BCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a networking pioneer and one of the biggest players in the game today. Starting in 1984, when network servers were really just for major corporations, governments and institutions that could afford to buy and maintain them, CSCO was aggressively growing the market for its products.When the dotcom boom hit, it opened up an entirely new world of possibilities. The great challenge was, numerous competitors also entered the market and CSCO needed to adapt to challenges and grow simultaneously.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months While that has been a bumpy road, it has endured in very dynamic industry. And it now also delivers a respectable 2.8% dividend on top of its solid annual returns. Eli Lilly & Co (LLY)Dividend Yield: 2.41%  Fundamental Score: BEli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) is one of the oldest (founded in 1876) and biggest U.S. drug makers.From introducing the world's first commercially available insulin in 1923, to the first pharma to produce and distribute the polio vaccine in 1955, to its introduction of Prozac in 1986, LLY has been on forefront of discovery. And that tradition of innovation continues.This month has seen LLY cut a few drugs from its oncology pipeline and also announce the final divestment from its Elanco animal pharmaceutical wing. And, while 2019 may not be as big a year as last year (LLY stock is up 58% year to date), it will still keep chugging along, delivering a rock-solid 2.1% dividend on top of its capital gains.  Progressive (PGR)Dividend Yield: 3.71%  Fundamental Score: BProgressive Corp (NYSE:PGR) is one of top property and casualty (P&C) insurers in the US. It started in 1965 in the auto insurance business and continues to be a very skilled player in that sector.Having grown more than 50% in the past 3 years, PGR recently announced that it was going to add 10,000 more people to its staff in 2019. Centers all around the country will be getting more staff, with the focus on its IT and customer service departments. The latter will be focused on Spanish-speaking customer service support.PGR has always had a reputation as a tech innovator in the sector and this news shows that its dedication to finding ways to grow its margins and expand its customer base continues.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond Rising rates also help insurers, since they hold a lot of premium cash in US Treasuries. Up nearly 30% year to date and still delivering a nice 3.7% dividend, PGR has what it takes to keep on growing. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Dividend Yield: 3.38%  Fundamental Score: BArcher Daniels Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) is one of the largest agricultural commodity businesses in the world. It stores, processes and ships everything from seed oils to cocoa.While Q3 came in ahead of expectations, ADM recently released Q4 numbers, which were off by a hefty margin. However, the markets haven't punished ADM too much for the divergences. It's likely that analysts know the China trade war has put a temporary kink in revenue and earnings, and the fortunes of the stock are held hostage by those negotiations.But the reality is, ADM has the national infrastructure to manage the movement and the processing of massive amounts of agricultural goods, so these short-term challenges pale in comparison to the long-term power ADM holds on the global food supply.For now, its 3.4% dividend buys investors some patience. ConocoPhillips (COP)Dividend Yield: 1.81%  Fundamental Score: BConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of my favorite stocks of the moment. It has shown up in a number of these 'top stock' articles. And for good reason.It is a rock-solid, balanced play on the expanding global demand for energy products. Whether it's oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) or bitumen (the natural form of asphalt), COP is one of the leading exploration and production (E&P) companies in the world.Given the fact that its 1.8% dividend isn't exactly mouth-watering, I usually talk about its strength as a growth stock. However, this is long-term growth stock and given that view, the power of compounding makes that 1.8% kicker very welcome over the years.Its continued expansion into natural gas opportunities in North America will also become good investments as exporting natural gas and NGLs around the world opens up in the coming years.  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio Most countries pay significantly more for natural gas than we do in the US, which means margins will grow substantially. Extra Space Storage (EXR)Dividend Yield: 3.45%  Fundamental Score:BExtra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR) is the only real estate investment trust (REIT) that made the cut.REITs differ from your typical stock because of the way they're structured. Because it's set up as a trust, shareholders are considered owners and that means they get a distribution of the net profits from the REIT. As in this case (and most cases) those distributions are in the form of dividends.Storage REITs have been one of the strongest sectors for years now, as new generations of Americans are more than willing to look for growth opportunities around the country.While this trend started when the economy was weak, now that it's strengthening, the same trend is only expanding with job opportunities and higher wages.EXR is up 24% in the past 12 months and is still delivering a respectable 3.4% dividend to go along with it. As with most total return plays, the real payoff is for the long-term investor.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-02-14,"U.S. stock futures are trading higher again this morning, continuing this relief rally. In premarket action, the futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.46% and S&P 500 are higher by 0.39%. Nasdaq-100 have added 0.52% to yesterday's gains.In the options pits, call buyers were busier than bears yesterday. Markets meandered higher while waiting for some geo-economic news. We still need President Donald Trump to actually sign the agreement to avert a U.S. government shutdown. This rally could disappear quickly if news on that front disappoints. Meanwhile, Wall Street still has one foot out the door. Investors will sell first and ask questions later. Regardless, the action was bullish since we had 18.9 million calls and 15.2 million puts during the session.Markets seem on edge, even when in the green. This is the byproduct of being in headline trading mode while we await news from the tariff talks between the U.S. and China. Nevertheless, the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio remain stable 0.57 versus the the 10-day moving average of 0.62. Sentiment remains positive in spite of the caution.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions activity was bullish on Wednesday. This is normal as fear levels abate. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was in the news and spiked 4% and the action was also bullish in the options. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) had an even bigger rally, up almost 7% yesterday. The appetite for options was voracious, suggesting more potential to come. Finally, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) wasn't as exciting on the Wednesday scoreboard, but its options action made up for it.Let's take a closer look: Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly stock might be ready to make a big move. This week the options have been active and the calls have overwhelmed the puts. Yesterday LLY options traded 727 times its daily average volume. While the split favors the bears slightly, it's even enough to leave the bias neutral.  * 9 U.S. Stocks That Are Coming to Life Again Usually when options get to be this active, it means that there is an imminent move in the stock. This much action in it above the normal levels is unusual. Such a tense situation will resolve itself soon, but unfortunately we don't know the direction of the breakout.So we rely on the charts and the levels to tell us when to go long or short. Eli Lilly stock is at all time highs so clearly it's having a great year. Shorter term, it is stuck between $120.30 and $118.10 per share. A breach of either side of this range will carry momentum in that direction. The secondary targets from those edges are $121.40 versus $117.05. Those, too, are potential catalyst levels. It is best to trade the triggers rather than anticipate the moves. Twitter (TWTR)Twitter reported earnings recently, and the stock collapsed more than 10% on the headline. This was a shame, since TWTR stock was in the middle of a breakout from $34 per share. Luckily for bulls, on Wednesday it spiked sharply on the 13-F news that Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has a new 5.6% stake in the stock. Investors chased the stock up but closed off the highs.So it is no surprise to see Twitter stock options trade 138 times their daily average. Moreover, 70% of the Wednesday options were calls to only 30% puts. It is clear that traders now expect a rebound from the earnings rout.Before chasing, it is important that it maintains the short-term higher-lows trend. So losing $30.30 would cause a deflation in the immediate rally. Conversely, a breach above $31.82 would trigger a buy signal to fill the earnings gap and target $34 per share. It would be a tall order to expect much more of it here. Freeport McMoRan (FCX)FCX reported earnings in January and the stock fell more than 15% on its heels. Since then, it completely recovered from it. But there might be even more good news and the options markets know it.On Wednesday, FCX options traded 204 times their daily average. More to the point, the mix was 76% calls to only 24% puts and this suggests a very bullish bias. The technicals point to much more upside off the breach of $12.10 per share.If the bulls can continue past $12.30 it could continue on its way to $13 or higher. There are resistance areas in between but this breakout has momentum. The concern from here that this stock moves fast but in both directions. And this fast recovery from earnings left a big gap below that beacons.Tight stops are a must when trading FCX stock. Those who are in it for an investment should trade it according to their fundamental opinions of it. I recently wrote a bullish article about the upside potential in FCX.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-01,"It was another day of tug-of-war between the bulls and the bears, and this time the bears won the match. The S&P 500 fell 0.26% on Thursday, leaving behind the third straight day of lower highs. The real test is coming up, but it's not quite here yet.HP (NYSE:HPQ) did most of the damage, losing nearly 17% of its value after falling short of last quarter's revenue estimate. Box (NYSE:BOX) technically lost more ground though, falling 18.7% in response to Q1 revenue guidance that fell well short of estimates. Traders were tacitly expecting guidance in excess of analysts' consensus estimates.Horizon Pharma (NASDAQ:HZNP) did what it could, jumping nearly 33% after releasing some encouraging efficacy data for its thyroid eye disease drug teprotumumab. There just weren't enough bigger names making similar moves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeaded into the weekend, it's the stock charts of Centene (NYSE:CNC), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) that are of the most interest as trading prospects. Here's why. Eli Lilly (LLY)At first glance, Eli Lilly looks like it's a rocket, up 20% just since late November, adding another 0.5% to the score on Thursday.  * The 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism There's a massive number of red flags now waving after yesterday's action, however, that suggest the end of the red-hot runup looms, if it's not here already. We still need to see that first decided dip to say a pullback is in motion, but once it starts, there's little that will be able to stop it.  Click to Enlarge • The past two months have essentially been the exact opposite of a capitulation. This meltup has become self-sustaining, but the volume peak seen for the past couple of days says the last of the buyers have been flushed out.• The shape of yesterday's bar is also a concern. The open at the low and the close well off the high suggests some traders are already beginning to scale out.• Panning out to the weekly chart of LLY puts things in perspective. Shares never really unwound from the overbought condition they were on as of the third quarter of last year, and have only exacerbated that risk. Centene (CNC)There's no single &quot;smoking gun&quot; that says Centene shares are in undeniable trouble. Rather, it's a preponderance of evidence that collectively says CNC is likely to see more downside in the foreseeable future before recovering.Perhaps worse, there's a lot of downside to give up after heroic (and uninterrupted) gains made in 2017 and 2018.  Click to Enlarge • The shape of the chart itself is the first big clue. After making a triple-top around $74, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts, we've since made a lower low and lower high.• The stock's best shot at a recovery was just squandered. That's the recent simultaneous test of the gray 100-day and white 200-day moving average lines. A few bumps into them ultimately sent shares back to lower lows.• Confirming that the weakness has turned into a full-blow trend is the fact that the purple 50-day moving average line as well as the 100-day average have both now broken below the 200-day line. LKQ Corporation (LKQ)The 1.6% gain LKQ Corporation logged yesterday is certainly impressive, though hardly earth-shattering. It's not the advance that's so noteworthy though. It's the circumstances in which it took shape. The bears made a respectable attempt to up-end the budding rally, but the bulls pushed back even harder when push came to shove.With the loud and clear message sent, the march forward should be much easier from here.  Click to Enlarge • Thursday was an &quot;outside day,&quot; where the day's open and close completely engulfs the previous day's low-to-high range and is pointed in the opposite direction. This sudden change of heart speaks volumes about the swing in the market's sentiment.• Thursday's low was also in the ideal spot. All it took was a brush of the purple 50-day moving average line to prompt all the would-be buyers waiting on the sidelines into the stock.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of LKQ tells us just how much more upside remains to reclaim. We've only just popped out of the oversold condition.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-12,"Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) announced March 4 that it was introducing a half-price generic version of Humalog, the company's insulin injection medication. Not surprisingly, LLY stock barely budged on the news, losing 1.4% on the day.Source: Paul Sableman via Flickr I don't own LLY stock. I've never contemplated holding it, and this latest move by the company ensures that I will never own Eli Lilly stock. Here's why. A Purely Financial ReasonIn 2018, Humalog generated $3.0 billion for Eli Lilly, 5% higher than a year earlier. Assuming Humalog's gross margin is 73.8% (I'm using the company's overall gross margin; it's likely higher), Eli Lilly had $2.2 billion in gross profits from this single drug.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary Except for Trulicity, the company's bestselling diabetes drug, Humalog is the company's second-largest revenue and profit generator. In 2016, the Washington Post found that Eli Lilly increased the price of Humalog from $21 a bottle in 1996, to $255 two decades later, a 700% increase adjusting for inflation.I wish I could get a 700% increase in my annual earnings over the next 20 years, but that's unlikely to happen. Why would the company introduce a half-price version of a drug when it's a cash cow?&quot;While this change is a step in the right direction, all of us in the health care community must do more to fix the problem of high out-of-pocket costs for Americans living with chronic conditions,&quot; CEO David Ricks said in the company's press release. &quot;We hope our announcement is a catalyst for positive change across the U.S. health care system.&quot; That's the Official ExplanationThe truth is far murkier.&quot;By offering a generic version, it allows Lilly to fend off the criticisms,&quot; said Andrew Ching, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's Carey Business School. &quot;By keeping the branded version, it allows them to keep charging a high price to the segment of consumers who are willing to pay more.&quot;Why on god's green earth would you pay more if you didn't have to? On the surface, it's good news for patients. &quot;Lilly isn't the first drug maker to cut list prices on a best-seller, but it is the first to do so for a product as widely used as Humalog, and the move could have ramifications for the entire market,&quot; stated Max Nisen of the Peoria Star. &quot;For patients, it's good news.&quot;But is it? Eli Lilly Falls Way Short of the TargetExcellent news would be the company ending full-priced Humalog sales, replaced permanently by Insulin Lispro, the name of the new generic version, but that's not going to happen. The company is going to continue to herd as many people as possible into the more expensive version, which is good news if you own LLY stock, but terrible news if you're hoping this is the start of healthcare reckoning day.It's not. The price of a vial of Humalog is close to $300. Cut that in half, and we're still talking about pulling one Benjamin Franklin and five Alexander Hamilton's out of your pocket. Here's a tweet from Senator Dick Durbin:&quot;Eli Lilly is trying to save face by lowering prices for some to $140 for a vial of insulin that's available in Canada for as little as $38. It's time for Big Pharma to stop the PharmaFleece.&quot;If Durbin's tweet doesn't highlight just how broken America's healthcare system is, I don't know what will.  The Bottom Line on LLY StockThis move by Eli Lilly is an act of desperation to save its gravy train. Do not for one minute think this is anything more than a PR stunt meant to appease the federal government so it won't introduce legislation forcing lower drug prices.&quot;If drug companies want to be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem, they should lead the way in simplifying our healthcare system so that patients can obtain affordable medicine that still provides manufacturers with a reasonable return on their investment,&quot; wrote Los Angeles Times columnist and Humalog user, David Lazarus.As someone who lives in Canada, I am so thankful that I don't have to negotiate my way through the American healthcare system. I'm not saying the Canadian system is perfect, far from it, but this move by Eli Lilly reeks of a payoff. The system is broken. And now, so is LLY stock.As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Recently, both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) have been in the news for price-related issues. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing the industry's bellyaching. It's a big reason I'm not a fan of Pfizer stock or most pharmaceutical companies for that matter.   * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs If you've owned Pfizer stock over the past ten years, you've done OK, achieving an annualized total return of 15%. Eli Lilly's stock over the same period has an annualized total return of 17.42%. PFE stock underperformed the S&P 500 by 188 basis point on an annual basis, while LLY stock was 56 basis points higher than the indexAny time a stock delivers a double-digit return over a long period, you've done well. Good for you.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Lilly's Olive BranchThis week, Eli Lilly announced that it would introduce a generic version of its Humalog insulin injection medication at half the cost of the branded product. Same stuff. Lower price. What's not to like?That's how they want you to feel. The benevolent dictator. The problem is that it doesn't fix a fatally flawed healthcare system. It merely seeks to persuade healthcare reformists to tamp down their rhetoric so drug companies can continue to reap billions off the backs of hardworking Americans. You can fear socialism all you want, but when capitalism bankrupts people due to the high cost of drugs, you're backing the second-worst horse in a race that's likely not winnable. Senator Dick Durbin said it best when he tweeted that a half-price version of Humalog was still 73% cheaper in Canada. That's not an endorsement of Canada's healthcare system, which has its issues, but rather a severe condemnation of company's like Eli Lilly, who believe a half-priced version is part of the healthcare solution. That's like going to a retail store that's selling a product at 50% off, but still making a handsome gross profit. You walk away feeling good until you find out the product you paid $50 for actually cost $10 to produce.  What's This Got to Do With Pfizer?Well, I happened to come across a CBC News piece from Feb. 15 entitled, Pfizer pushes up price of birth control used by low-income women, that highlights some price increases by the company for sexual health clinics in Southwestern Ontario.  For example, its Allese and Minovral birth control pills were increased in price by 114% from CAD$7 to CAD$15 a month. Its Demulen and Synphasic birth control pills increased by 186% from CAD$7 to CAD$20 a month, and its Depo contraceptive injection increased by 40% from CAD$25 to CAD$35. The company argues that manufacturing costs have risen, necessitating the price increases.However, the price increases will hurt the people most vulnerable to this type of inflationary pressure. Those visiting the clinics are generally people who don't have a family doctor or a drug benefit plan, making the increase even harder to swallow.&quot;When these costs go up, absolutely we start to wonder whether people will be able to access these medications in the same way,&quot; said Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) Associate Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Alex Summers.Situations like these demonstrate why there's a push in Canada to introduce universal pharmacare. &quot;National pharmacare isn't just a conversation about high-cost, rare drugs needed in more extreme health conditions in our lives, but also part of our everyday preventive health,&quot; said Lauren Cipriano, assistant professor of health policy studies at the Ivey Business School.  The Bottom Line on Pfizer StockWhile this particular scenario might not affect you, the fact that drug companies like Pfizer continue to initiate significant price increases without any apparent justification should concern you. So should the actions of Eli Lilly, whose recent sleight of hand might fool some of the people some of the time, but it won't fool all of them all of the time. I selected Canada Goose (NASDAQ:GOOS) as my best stock of 2019 for InvestorPlace's annual stock-picking contest despite not owning it personally. I won't, because I don't agree with its use of coyote fur on the hoods of its jackets. That's my personal choice. It doesn't have to be yours.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Today The same goes for Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and the rest of the pharmaceutical companies.

2019-03-16,"Shares of global pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) have performed incredibly well over the past decade, rising more than 350% as the market gained 300%. But, the LLY stock rally has kicked into overdrive during the past year. Shares are up more than 60% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pretty much flat over that same stretch.This big rally against the backdrop of a flat market has some investors concerned. Are these gains sustainable? Or is LLY stock out over its skis here?As we head into the close of the first quarter, the numbers support the bull thesis. Eli Lilly stock is a powered by healthy tailwinds from pharma product portfolio expansion and increased global healthcare spend. Rounding out this story are steady positive revenue growth, margin expansion and healthy profit growth. Assuming this persists -- and it should -- LLY stock has upside to prices above $135 in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEli Lilly stock currently trades around $125, so the shares should reasonably head 8% higher into the end of the year. Coupled with a 2%+ yield, LLY stock should produce about 10% return from here over the next 12 months. That is fairly good return from of a low-risk, stable-growth company like Lilly. As such, the bull thesis here looks pretty good. Stable Growth StoryIn the big picture, Eli Lilly has a large and growing portfolio of drugs and treatments that span a wide range of illnesses and conditions. It has broad exposure to the global healthcare market. That market is largely characterized by competitive stability, enduring demand, and mild growth.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash Zooming in, Eli Lilly has a heavy focus on the oncology and diabetes markets, including a distinguished leadership in the diabetes market with a robust pipeline of insulin-related products. These sub-sectors of the global healthcare are likewise characterized by competitive stability, enduring demand, and mild growth.As such, so long as Eli Lilly management continues to execute on its product road-map and maintain the company's competitive positioning in the global healthcare market, this company will benefit from stable and steady revenue and profit growth.This should happen. Management has successfully navigated the healthcare market over the past decade. During that time, they've not just maintained Eli Lilly's competitive positioning. They've actually improved it. There's no reason to believe that this won't continue. Also, the company has a promising pipeline of forthcoming products. Gross margins are guided to head higher, while opex rates have room to fall.Overall, the growth story underlying Eli Lilly stock is stable and solid. That stable and solid narrative should be enough to keep the shares on a winning track. Numbers Confirm Further Upside PotentialGiven reasonable long-term growth assumptions, it is reasonable to conclude that LLY stock is slightly undervalued at the current moment.  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs The math here is very simple: U.S. healthcare spend is expected to rise by 5.5% per year over the next several years, and global healthcare spend will likely rise at a similar, if not higher, rate. Allowing for competitive slippage but also accounting for management's strong track record and the healthy product pipeline, that should flow into roughly 5% revenue growth per year for Eli Lilly. Meanwhile, margins should track higher as the company leverages acquisitions and the current pipeline -- not internal R&D -- to grow. Long term, operating margins have the potential to stabilize in the mid-30's range.Given those assumptions, I think Eli Lilly can do about $10 in EPS by 2025. Based on a historically average 20x forward multiple, that equates to a fiscal 2024 price target of $200. Discounted back by 8% per year (two points below my normal 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that results in a fiscal 2019 price target of over $135.

2019-04-01,The large-cap pharma industry is on a strong footing in 2019. Here are three stocks from the space that investors may consider betting on.,3 Big Pharma Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio This April
2019-04-01,"The past three years have been tough for investors in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA). The share have gone from their 2015 peak near $72 to a current price below $16, slipping out of a rebound effort that took shape in 2018. TEVA stock has peeled back from last year's high near $26, after bottoming near $11 in late-2017.Nothing seems to excite investors for very long.Analysts -- some analysts anyway -- are starting to take notice of subtle changes, putting several upgrades in place during the first quarter of this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMost of those calls are still cautious ones, with the most recent one from BMO Capital Markets being no exception to that norm. The analysts at Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) see evidence of a turnaround taking shape, but remain concerned that Teva's generics business and pipeline aren't quite as robust as the firm would like.In taking a closer look at the analyst community's changing consensus, though, it's possible these professionals are quietly pointing toward more potential than most investors currently see in Teva stock. Disguised BullishnessBMO analyst Gary Nachman doesn't believe recent launches of Huntington's disease treatment Austedo and migraine treatment Ajovy will &quot;be enough to put the overall company on a solid growth trajectory,&quot; adding concern about the limited &quot;visibility on the generic pipeline, where we believe TEVA is behind its peers.&quot;  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 Still, there's enough potential in Teva Pharmaceuticals stock for BMO to initiate coverage on it, rating it a Market Perform … a call that leaves the door wide open to updated ratings in either direction.Nachman had a valid point, too, about the company's generics pipeline. From what can be gleaned about it, it's not necessarily scintillating.That's not exactly news though, to investors or to the company, or to other analysts for that matter. That's been a lingering problem at Teva to most professional and amateur observers.It may also be the groundwork for upgrades driven by the very pipeline BMO is concerned about.Even if unintentionally, most other analysts are doing the same. As of the latest look, the pros collectively rate TEVA stock at only a little better than a &quot;Hold&quot; but simultaneously sport a consensus price target of $20.50. That's 30% better than the stock's current price.  Click to EnlargeThe superficial mismatch isn't stunningly unusual; most stocks are priced below their consensus targets regardless of the collective buy/sell opinion on those names.This particular disparity, however, is also mismatched with the &quot;read between the lines&quot; rhetoric. Teva stock has been upgraded three times so far this year, with two new-coverage initiations at Hold that may be precursors to expected upgrades.If those upgrades are going to materialize, though, they're going to do so thanks to only a handful of names in the company's drug portfolio and pipeline. Identifying Growth DriversWhile its bench of drugs is deep, Teva's flagship product is multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.In its prime, Copaxone had no peers. It's past its prime though, largely thanks to generic alternatives that have hit the market just in the past couple of years. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) got the nod from the FDA in late 2017; Novartis (NYSE:NVS) is in the MS treatment race with its own version of Copaxone as well.Those rival drugs have taken a measurable toll. In 2016, Teva sold $4.2 billion worth of Copaxone, but that volume was almost halved to a little less than $2.4 billion last year.The bulk of the adverse impact of the generic multiple sclerosis treatment, however, is likely in the rearview mirror. Going forward, Teva shouldn't be fighting as much of a headwind on at least that one front.In the meantime, Ajovy and Austedo may be bigger growth drivers than BMO's Nachman is currently be letting on.Migraine drug Ajovy taps into a relatively underserved market. While Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)/Novartis are also in the same market with Emgality and Aimovig, respectively, analysts at Israel's IBI anticipates peak sales of between $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion for Teva's Ajovy. Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky forecasts peak sales of $1.3 billion for Austedo.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business That level of success, along with the rest of the company's portfolio and pipeline, should restore solid growth even as the benefit of Copaxone shrinks.Also keep an eye on subsidiary Anda, which saw sales growth of 26% last quarter, reaching $363 million.The upshot for owners of Teva stock is that it's crystal clear where growth needs to come from. It won't be difficult to see what's working, and what's not, given the relatively small portfolio and pipeline. Bottom Line on Teva StockAgain, without saying as much, most Teva stock analysts may be quietly expecting a respectable turnaround, but are thus far unwilling to say as much without more tangible proof it's taking shape.Analysts' careers don't just depend on quality analysis, but on being 'right' even if that standard is unspoken. These professionals may be cautiously leading investors to a marketwide conclusion that the forward-looking P/E of 6.0 for Teva stock is simply too cheap to pass up, given the potential -- even if not the assured promise -- of a turnaround.Undoubtedly though, the rhetoric about slowing Copaxone's deterioration and the growth of Austedo and Ajovy will help shape investors' and analysts' opinion. Investors would be wise to focus on those three drugs as a barometer of how the market feels about Teva stock.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This includes stocks like AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) as it set a new high late last month. From that standpoint, this is not an obvious entry point into AZN stock, but whether you should buy the stock also depends on a few other factors.Source: Shutterstock Those who want to own AZN shares for the long term can afford to ignore short-term downside risk. But for most other investors who prefer to start an ownership position into a stock in the green should be slightly more surgical than just jumping in at any time.AZN stock is on a tear up 11% in 12 months. But the company will report earnings on April 26 and those events are wild. So this makes buying the stock now a short-term binary bet. Reactions to earnings scorecards are usually more to do with expectations than the actual value of a stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore you label me a hater, my caution for AstraZeneca stock here is not a dis against the company itself or its prospects. I am merely concerned with buying into a stock that is not likely to fall soon thereafter. Looking back on its prior reactions to earnings, they are split.  * 10 Dow Jones Stocks Holding the Blue Chip Index Back Last quarter, the stock spiked drastically on the results, which left a giant open gap in the chart. Although this does not happen all of the time, Wall Street usually likes to fill these gaps.Since the spike to all-time highs, AZN stock has been drifting lower and testing recent support. If it loses $40 per share, it risks triggering a bearish pattern that would close the gap below. Although this is not a forecast, it is a scenario that could unfold here and investors need to be aware of it.The good news is that $39 per share is a mid-term pivot level and those tend to lend support on the way down. These are zones that the bulls and bears find interesting, so they will fight it out and create price congestion. How to Approach AZN Stock NowSo far my reservation to owning the shares immediately has been technically based. Fundamentally, AZN stock is not cheap as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 47. This is more than three times as expensive as Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and twice as expensive as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) … to draw absolute and relative comparisons, respectively.Moreover, healthcare and biotech stocks are back in the sights of the political rifles. This is the only current bipartisan consensus topic. Both Democrats and Republicans want to vilify and persecute the drug companies. The rhetoric of both sides involves bringing legislation that would bring down the price of medicine and change the current Health Care Act.  * 7 Vulnerable Stocks to Watch On Brexit News and Trade Wars These are nervous times on Wall Street. The S&P 500 has been on an extended run since the December crash and that makes investors nervous. Almost everyone I hear in the media suggests that traders are ready to sell at the first sign of trouble. So the prevailing idea is that we've come too far too fast. For some reason, they didn't say that on the way down, when last year we fell even faster and farther.But for now, we have to respect the collective and be cautious. This is not an obvious time to load up on new positions of AZN stock, even if it means I would miss out on a few upside dollars if it rips. And for those who already own AstraZeneca stock, it's not an alarm to sell out of the position. Furthermore, the options markets offer many ways I can temporarily defend my shares by selling covered calls or buying puts. Doing both would be a dollar neutral strategy.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-30,"For the past year, the share price of Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has been a flat-line. GILD stock is also down about 18% since its high set in July.Source: Shutterstock But on Thursday, the company will report its first quarter results. So might there be something to perk up Gilead stock?Well, if anything, the general pessimism may be setting things up for some much-needed gains. GILD stock really does look like an interesting value play.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOK, then, as for Wall Street consensus, it is calling for revenues to rise about 4% to $5.3 billion and earnings to come in at $1.61 per share.A big problem that's dogged Gilead stock is the competition for its treatments in the lucrative HIV and hepatitis C categories. Like many other big pharma companies, GILD has been struggling to find ways to bolster its pipeline.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years Now the company has been making a strong push in the market for CAR-T treatments, which is where a patient's own T-cells are used to fight cancer. To this end, Gilead purchased one of the leaders in the industry, Kite Pharma, in 2017. Yet the performance has been disappointing, as revenues have fallen below expectations. In the latest earnings report, Gilead took an $820 million impairment charge for the deal. Costly and Complex TreatmentsThis is not to imply that the growth potential is not significant. But it could take time to get to critical mass because of the costs and complexities of the treatments.In the quarter, Gilead also had some other notable highlights like:  * The company entered a strategic collaboration with insitro, which is a startup that leverages AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning to research new therapies. The agreement is focused on patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a progressive liver disease. Keep in mind that Gilead probably needs to look at unconventional approaches. After all, the company's treatments for NASH have had mixed results, as seen with the recent failure of Selonsertib (in a Phase 3 trial, the placebo actually had better results).  * On a more optimistic note, Gilead got good news with its Phase 3 trials for Filgotinib, which is for rheumatoid arthritis. The company is developing the drug in partnership with Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG). While there are other treatments on the market, such as from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Filgotinib does appear to have fewer side effects.  * Gilead's Executive Vice President of Oncology Therapeutics, Dr. Alessandro Riva, announced that he would leave the company.  A search is underway for his replacement. Bottom Line On Gilead StockThe HIV and hepatitis C franchises are high-margin businesses that produce enormous cash flows.  For example, last year Gilead reported operating cash flow of $8.4 billion.  In all, there is $31.5 billion in the bank.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now What's more, Gilead is fairly shareholder friendly. In 2018, the company bought back $2.9 billion of its shares. There is also an attractive dividend yield of 3.88%.Oh, and the valuation in the Gilead stock price today is quite reasonable, with the forward-price to earnings ratio of about 9.4x. All in all, it seems like much of the bad news is already baked in.So then what about the pipeline?  Isn't this a problem?  Again, the Car-T business is far from easy but this is to be expected with any cutting-edge innovation.  But of course, there is much more than this for Gilead.  Consider that the company has been finding more indications for existing drugs, such as with its HIV treatments.But looking ahead, and this week's Gilead earnings date, it seems like a good bet that the company will need to continue to focus on aggressive M&A.  And Gilead Sciences certainly has the war chest for this.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli.

2019-05-20,"After upgrading Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) to &quot;Outperform&quot; in January and raising its price target on Pfizer stock to $48 in May, one would think there's nothing else Credit Suisse could so to bolster its bullish case, but there is.Source:  Kojach Via FlickrFollowing a meeting with the pharmaceutical giant's top brass just a few days ago, on Thursday, Credit Suisse labeled PFE stock a &quot;top pick.&quot; It was apparently one heck of a meeting.The specifics prompting the accolade weren't made crystal clear, though Credit Suisse did note that the company's prospects for new products was compelling. Translation: Whatever stoked Credit Suisse's fires is likely to be in the company's late-stage pipeline, which is admittedly more exciting than it has been in a long while.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks)  A Brief Look at PfizerIt's not a story that needs a great deal of retelling. It was an unstoppable powerhouse when it had full patent protection of its erectile dysfunction drug Viagra and faced little competition. But, seeing the writing on the wall, the drugmaker allowed Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) to begin selling a generic version of the drug in 2017. In the meantime, consumer interest in ED drugs has broadly waned.Pfizer is about to lose ground with blockbuster neuropathic pain drug Lyrica too, which lost patent protection last year, threatening to quickly cut its $5 billion in annual sales in half once generic alternatives become available.It's the same story that plays out over and over within the pharmaceutical industry; these organizations must constantly replenish their portfolios with patent-protected drugs, or risk losing ground.It's something Pfizer hasn't done especially well in recent years.Although Pfizer stock has made reliable if choppy progress since turning around with all other stocks in 2009, revenue growth hasn't been overwhelming. The $53.9 billion in sales generated over the course of the past four reported quarters was not remarkable better than the $52.7 billion figure from a year earlier.&quot;Pfizer has been working through a dark period with extensive patent expirations,&quot; Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in late January. &quot;That period is now nearing an end.&quot; Solid PipelineWhat Pfizer told Credit Suisse at the meeting remains veiled, though when Divan upgraded Pfizer stock early this year he explicitly noted opportunities for several cancer and autoimmune disease drugs along with vaccinations.Two of the drugs Divan had in mind are Vyndaqel and Vyndamax (though they're actually different doses of the same molecule), which combats the buildup for amyloid in the heart.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALNY) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) already make similar rival drugs, but their versions are considerably more expensive. Divan foresees peak sales of $2 billion for Vyndaqel, but is willing to entertain a number &quot;significantly larger than that if Pfizer is able to commercialize it successfully.&quot;Pfizer has also partnered with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) on the development of a non-opioid arthritis treatment called tanezumab, another one of the 15 game-changing drugs Pfizer believes could be brought to the market within the next five years.Some analysts are looking for modest peak sales of around $500 million, although Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen thinks tanezumab could prove to a multi-billion dollar opportunity to replace a significant piece of the existing opioid market.In the meantime, Pfizer aims to widen the uses of already-marketable drugs like Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz.Ibrance has already become something of a wonder drug. Already approved as a therapy for multiple forms of breast cancer and generating revenue of $4.1 billion last year, expanded labeling could translate into peak annualized revenue of $8 billion before the treatment hits its ceiling.Eliquis (or Apixaban) for blood clots, co-marketed with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and arthritis/ulcerative colitis therapy Xeljanz generated nearly $3.5 billion and more than $1.7 billion worth of revenue for Pfizer last year, respectively,  yet both are also in trials for new uses after having proven they're safe and effective.All told, Pfizer's got 23 phase 3 trials underway right now. All of them look promising; most of them appear to have blockbuster potential. Looking Ahead for Pfizer StockIt was self-serving to be sure when CEO Albert Bourla proclaimed in January that Pfizer is sitting on its &quot;greatest pipeline ever.&quot;But that doesn't mean he's wrong.Granted, the deterioration of Pfizer stock since December's peak (PFE stock been performing completely contrary to the market for months) says investors don't exactly believe Bourla. The crowd has understandably become a &quot;show me first&quot; mob, willing to wait on the sidelines for proof that the pipeline can do all the company suggests it can do.Credit Suisse's Divan may have the right idea though. The time to step into a great prospect is when its stock is down because the majority of investors aren't convinced and analysts are collectively lukewarm because they're unable to see more than a few months down the road.That's certainly Pfizer stock right now.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The close of 2,802.39 leaves the index just above a huge technical floor.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)That loss took shape despite a huge win from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Shares of the tech giant were up almost 10% in response to the unveiling of some new hardware.It just wasn't enough to offset dips from the likes of equally influential names like Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA). The food company's stock was off to the tune of 6.6%, extending last week's weakness that was largely prompted by a planned but still distasteful failure to submit its quarterly accounting statements to the SEC. General weakness from most food stocks didn't help matters either. Teva Pharmaceutical shares fell 12.4% in response to news that a lawsuit alleging price-fixing for its generic drugs had been filed.

Here's why. Juniper Networks (JNPR)In late March, I cautioned that Juniper Networks was slipping into trouble. Although not past the point of no return, the undertow was bullish. The one saving grace was that there was a strong support level dead ahead. It had been proven as a floor more than once.That floor has since been tested, more than once. In fact, it has been given a major test just within the past few days, including yesterday. One more slip could turn the tide decidedly for the worst, and by some measures JNPR stock has already fallen past the point of no return.  Click to Enlarge  * The technical floor in question is, of course, the $25 area plotted in yellow on both stock charts. Juniper shares were driven to that level again yesterday.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart it's clear that the rising support line that had driven JNPR higher since 2014 has already been broken.  * The undertow is already bearish, with or without technical breakdowns. It's easy to overlook, but on the daily chart, all four key moving average lines are now sloped downward, suggesting a bearish trend in multiple timeframes. Hormel Foods (HRL)As of last Thursday, Hormel Foods shares were almost an interesting (even if somewhat risky) bullish prospect. Although HRL stock ended that day in the red, the intraday recovery effort on the heels of a huge plunge spoke volumes. Friday's bullish follow-through bolstered the bullish case.That potential buy clue was completely negated on Tuesday, however, supplanted by a new and much more convincing sell signal. All Hormel shares had to do was kiss a couple of key technical ceilings to slip into a tailspin.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June   Click to Enlarge  * The pair of technical ceilings are the purple 50-day moving average line and the brush with a previous key low right around $40.50. The encounter is highlighted on the daily chart.  * Underscoring the bearish case is the shape and scope (and placement) of yesterday's bar. Tuesday's open was above Friday's high, and Tuesday's close was below Friday's low. This bearish 'outside day' points to a sweeping change of heart.  * Zooming out to the week chart it becomes clear the stock was already in trouble, having broken under a key long-term support line plotted in yellow as of mid-April. Eli Lilly (LLY)The last time we looked at Eli Lilly back on March 1, the chief concern was that it had rallied too far, too fast, leaving it vulnerable to a pullback. Although not in a straight line, that's exactly what took shape over the course of the next couple of months.It looked like it might come to a close and begin to rally again earlier this month. But, with some help from the market's tide, yesterday's action put the stock back within uncomfortable reach of a critical support line that hinted of a bullish reversal just a few days ago.  * 7 Stocks to Buy From One of America's Best Pension Funds   Click to Enlarge  * The big line in the sand is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. The selloff was stopped cold there in early May, but the bears dragged it back to near that mark yesterday.  * If the 200-day moving average at $115.10 can't continue to hold up as support, the next-nearest floor is right around $110. That's the line that tagged the key lows from late last year, plotted in blue on both stock charts.  * If neither potential support level holds up as a floor, there's no &quot;next best bet&quot; nearby. The most plausible floor below $110 is below $90, where Eli Lilly bumped into resistance for the better part of 2017.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-10,"Shares of Eli Lilly & Co.  fell 2.4% in premarket trade on Monday after a randomized control trial showed that diabetes drug Trulicity lowered the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes by 12% -- a significant drop in risk, but by less than what some investors had expected. The trial, dubbed REWIND, evaluated 9,901 adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving standard-of-care therapy. Researchers looked at the effect of adding Trulicity, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, to the patients&apos; regimens, and found that those on the drug saw a significant reduction in their risk of heart attack, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. However, some investors and medical specialists were expecting more -- Cowen analysts said investors they polled earlier this year had anticipated at least a 20% risk reduction. &quot;REWIND&apos;s 12% overall risk reduction in 3-point MACE is below expectations, but positives include improvements in all 3 MACE components (especially stroke reduction) and benefits in patients with and without established CV disease,&quot; analyst Steve Scala wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

2019-06-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Pfizer Inc. is demonstrating once again how expensive it is for pharma firms to buy their way to growth.The company announced Monday morning that it’s paying almost $11 billion for cancer drugmaker Array Biopharma Inc.  The deal would bolster Pfizer’s cancer portfolio and add medicines that could meaningfully augment sales and profit. But the company isn’t getting much of a bargain, and its recent track record with a similar deal is a cautionary tale for investors. Pfizer’s relatively anemic projected sales growth and drug pipeline mean that, cost aside, a deal like this makes sense. Cancer is a particularly attractive market for drugmakers, offering both limited pricing pressure and an expanding set of potential treatments and areas to target; Array’s lead medicines Braftovi and Mektovi are already approved for melanoma patients and recently produced promising data in colon cancer. Also, the company has developed drugs for other companies that would net Pfizer royalties. But cost does matter when assessing a deal and in this case it seems excessive. Pfizer is paying a 62% premium on a stock that had already appreciated by more than 100% in recent months. Acquiring drugs that have been approved is always extra expensive, but Pfizer really ponied up here. Pfizer is paying nearly 8 times Array’s projected 2023 sales, which is higher than what GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Eli Lilly Inc. paid  in comparable recent deals for Tesaro Inc. and Loxo Oncology Inc., respectively. Array is expected to generate $274 million in revenue this year, and that figure is expected to pass $1 billion by 2022. That growth is still theoretical, though, and the company’s current product roster would have to exceed expectations to justify this price. Its many partnerships with other companies also limit its upside. All of this suggests that Pfizer is also paying up for Array’s extensive drug development expertise and broader pipeline. It could do worse on that front; Array has been unusually successful at inventing medicines. But Pfizer may not be able to retain the scientists that have turned Array into an R&D powerhouse or get the most out of what’s currently in the company’s labs. Pfizer’s last big oncology deal demonstrates the danger of paying up based on optimistic evaluations. The company bought Medivation for a hefty $14 billion in late 2016 for its prostate-cancer drug Xtandi and several pipeline assets. It’s only been about three years, but so far no part of the deal has lived up to Pfizer’s expectations or the price paid. Array may well help Pfizer transition into a more significant player in the cancer market or prove to be a bargain. But there’s a decent chance that we’ll be back for round three in just a few years. To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2019-06-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Pfizer Inc. will buy Array BioPharma Inc. for $10.6 billion to gain its promising new medicines for cancer, which could end or limit the use of punishing chemotherapy for some patients.The agreed price of $48 in cash is 62% above Array’s close last Friday -- already a record high. The company’s shares have soared thanks to drugs that target a mutation that’s found across a wide variety of tumor types, and could be used in treating a broad set of cancers in patients who carry the mutation. Array’s drugs, Braftovi and Mektovi, are already approved in the U.S. for use in advanced melanoma.Pfizer said in a statement that it will get royalties from the uses of drugs that Array has licensed out to other companies. It will acquire a pipeline of drugs in development, as well as future revenue from Braftovi and Mektovi in some other malignancies, such as colon cancer.Array shares rose 58% in to $46.67 at 9:32 a.m. in New York. Pfizer was little changed.Cancer has become one of the hottest areas for deal activity between drug and biotechnology companies. Research efforts dating back decades have helped scientists understand how genetic mutations cause some cancers to grow, and other scientific advances have helped them learn how tumors evade the body’s defenses. That knowledge has created an array of targets for drugmakers to attack, leading to new tailored therapies often defined by a tumor cell’s specific biology rather than its location in the body.Unlike other biotech stocks, many of which have pulled back from recent 2018 highs, Array’s shares have been on a steady march upward. The stock was already at a record before the deal announcement, following Array’s news last month of positive clinical trial results using Braftovi and Mektovi with Eli Lilly & Co.’s Erbitux. That combination could be the first chemotherapy-free regimen for some patients who have advanced colon cancer.Array’s drug targets a mutation called BRAF, which can show up in some forms of melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers, among others. Other drugs on the market target that mutation as well. Roche Holding AG’s Zelboraf is projected to bring in $168.7 million this year, according to a survey of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Novartis AG’s Tafinlar is used in combination with another drug Mekinist, and the combination is expected to bring in $1.24 billion this year, according to analysts.The deal could also boost other biotech stocks, especially companies with drugs in the later stages of development that could be appetizing for big drugmakers. “We expect this announcement to provide a tailwind for the sector,” said Stephen Willey, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. He called the premium for the Array deal appropriate, given the company’s positive clinical trial news.The deal is Pfizer’s biggest since its 2016 acquisition of Medivation for $14 billion, another blockbuster cancer deal that the New York-based company used to expand its oncology offerings. With that takeover, Pfizer gained Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug that last year Xtandi brought it $699 million.“From an overall capital allocation perspective, our priorities don’t change,” Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio said on a conference call Monday. The company will continue to look at dividends, buybacks and small or mid-size deals, and doesn’t see the need for a large merger, he said. Pfizer has lagged behind drugmakers like Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. that have brought to market best-selling drugs that use the immune system to attack tumors. But the company has acquired or developed a set of other treatments for breast, prostate other cancers that target disease based on its biological profile. Such methods can result in more effective drugs, fewer side-effects, or both.Pfizer plans to fund the deal with a combination of debt and cash. It said it expects the deal to close in the second half of this year. The deal comes with a $400 million termination fee, according to a regulatory filing by Array.Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley & Co. served as Pfizer’s financial advisers, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz gave legal advice. Centerview Partners was Array’s financial adviser, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as its legal adviser.(Updates with analyst comment in seventh paragraph.

They can be industrial accidents such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that cost BP plc (BP) nearly $65 billion in legal fees, settlements and cleanup costs as of 2018. There are technological squabbles, such as Apple's (AAPL) 2017 patent infringement lawsuit settlement with Nokia, which forced the iPhone maker to pay $2 billion upfront as well as ongoing royalties from iPhone sales. Pfizer (PFE) was weighed down considerably in 2011 as it was about to lose market exclusivity on its blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor - this so-called patent cliff is a frequent headwind for pharma stocks.Some blue chips, such as Apple and Pfizer, take the hit and keep on chugging. Others, like BP, take much longer to recover - if they ever do.You can get some insight into potential headwinds by reading the &quot;Risk Factors&quot; section of each company's annual 10-K filing.

Some risks apply to the entire economy, some to that particular industry and a few are unique to that company.Here are 13 blue-chip stocks that currently are navigating their way around a landmine or two. This isn't necessarily a list of stocks to sell, however. Great companies can often overcome major setbacks, and many of these companies are working toward that.

He already rated OSTK at &quot;Overweight,&quot; but raised his target to $350 per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Headed into Tuesday's trading, it's the stock charts of Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE:IPG), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) that merit the closest looks. This trio of names is knocking on the door of major moves. Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly has been sliding lower since peaking in March, breaking below the pivotal 200-day moving average line in early June. For a short while after that, it looked as if the bulls might have drawn a line in the sand. And, they may well have.As of Monday's close though, a that major line in the sand that's acting as support is under some serious pressure. Worse, it's being tested as a floor again after bumping into resistance at the one place it couldn't afford to hit resistance.  Click to Enlarge  * The ceiling in question is the 50-day moving average line, plotted in purple. Eli Lilly shares tried twice to crawl back above it since June (highlighted), failing both times.  * The recent support at $110.73, marked with a dashed yellow line on the daily chart is even more significant than it seems. As the weekly chart shows, that's where the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line lies.  * Should that floor fail to keep the stock propped up, there's a minor floor just under $105, plotted with a red dashed line, though the next Fibonacci retracement line at $97 is also worth watching. SYSCO Corporation (SYY)Each and every stock has its own trading personality. That is to say, it exhibits tendencies in a way that no other name does. SYSCO is no exception to that norm. Its personality is one that uses, for better and worse, moving average lines as support and resistance levels. When it can cross one, a major move tends to take shape.The interplay of SYY over the course of the past several weeks has set up a potential breakout thrust. But, right on cue -- so far -- SYSCO has once again bumped into resistance at a key line. If it can be broken, there's a great deal of upside to traverse.  * 7 Simple Ways for Young Investors to Invest Their First $1,000   Click to Enlarge  * The line in question is the purple 50-day moving average, with the recent encounter highlighted along with other instances of support or resistance.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the rebound since late last year is an upswing within in even longer-term rising trading range that extends back to 2015.  * It's modest thus far, but a glance back at the past several weeks shows more bullish volume than bearish volume, even if erratic. Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG)Interpublic Group of Companies shares haven't made any net progress since late 2015. But, the past year and a half has been constructive … in a sense. The stock has been squeezed toward the tip of a converging wedge pattern, and though there's a little more room left to move deeper into that point, the bulls are taking another shot at punching through the upper boundary of the wedge shape.  Click to Enlarge  * The wedge pattern is framed by blue lines on both stock charts. Monday's close has left Interpublic Group shares right at the upper line.  * Also note on the weekly chart that even though the stock has only moved sideways (if not lower) for months, the rising accumulation-distribution line says there are more buyers than sellers.  * If the budding rally effort takes hold, there's another ceiling just under $26, where IPG topped several times in 2017 and early 2018.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-11,"U.S. equities were hitting new record highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 27,000 for the first time ever while the S&P 500 hits 3,000. The catalyst is an all too familiar one: The promise of more cheap money from the Federal Reserve, with chairman Jerome Powell strongly signaling a rate cut later this month in response to uneven economic data.But the gains are being trimmed in mid-day trading after a strong inflation report suggests the U.S.-China trade spat is starting to have an impact on import prices. And higher inflation would undermine the Fed's desire to lower rates. Stocks, obviously, wouldn't react well to that.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown A number of big drug stocks are getting hit amid the pullback on reports the Trump Administration has pulled its plan to eliminate rebates from government drug plans.

Analysts are looking for earnings of 75 cents per share on revenues of $13.4 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of 85 cents per share beat estimates by 10 cents on a 1.6% rise in revenues. Eli Lilly (LLY)  Click to EnlargeShares of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are falling down and out of a four month consolidation range, returning to levels not seen since December. This caps a decline of more than 15% from the highs hit in late March. With the 50-day and 200-day moving averages already lost, watch for a drop down to mid-2018 support near $105, which would be worth a loss of another 4% from here.  * 3 Forgotten Tech Stocks Worth Remembering The company will next report results on July 30 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.45 per share on revenues of $5.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of $1.33 per share matched expectations on a 2.6% rise in revenues.

The stock has gained more than 50% from the lows seen in early 2018 and a ripe for a significant profit taking pullback -- likely resulting in a revisiting of the April lows.The company will next report results on July 30 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.16 per share on revenues of $10.9 billion.

2019-08-23,"Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is blue chip with a capital B. With its solid dividend and AAA credit rating, there's no denying that JNJ stock is high quality. But can the company's legal issues bring it to its knees?Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The likely answer is no. While multi-billion dollar judgements sound scary, the company's sheer size may help insulate it from these issues. Let's take a closer look at JNJ, and see whether the risks outweigh opportunity with Johnson & Johnson stock. What's the Worst That Can Happen?As InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto discussed Aug. 21, JNJ stock has two material legal risks. The first is the company's asbestos-contamination scandal. For decades, Johnson & Johnson allegedly kept quiet about the cancer risks of its baby powder products. Civil litigation has been going on for years. But only recently did federal authorities announce an investigation. Recent civil judgements were for $4.7 billion in July 2018, and $300 million in June 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip But JNJ's liability could be much less. As discussed in this Bloomberg article, most product liability judgements are reduced on appeal. But, as Enomoto discussed in his analysis, bad PR from the litigation could taint Johnson & Johnson stock. This scandal has been going on for years. While the story is well-known, it has not dominated the headlines.How about the Oklahoma opioid suit? After years of ignoring the opioid crisis, federal and state authorities are getting their act together. This puts opioid manufacturers in their cross-hairs, including JNJ. The Oklahoma suit alleges JNJ's Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit aggressively marketed opioids. Oklahoma is looking for $17 billion in damages, but JNJ could end up paying significantly less. Previous Oklahoma opioid suits ended with settlements. Purdue Pharma settled for $270 million. Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:TEVA) settled for $85 million. This means that JNJ could avoid a multi-billion dollar judgement. But JNJ is likely not out of the woods just yet. Other states (or the Federal Government) could pursue action.Do these legal risks impact the valuation of JNJ stock? Let's see if shares are selling at a discount (or a premium) to its peers. JNJ Stock Trades at a Fair ValuationJohnson & Johnson currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) ratio of 14.1. The company's Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) is currently 13. Here are the valuations of some of JNJ's competitors in the pharmaceutical space:Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY): Forward P/E of 10, EV/EBITDA of 9.8Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY): Forward P/E of 16.5, EV/EBITDA of 15.7Merck (NYSE:MRK): Forward P/E of 15.6, EV/EBITDA of 14.1Pfizer (NYSE:PFE): Forward P/E of 15.9, EV/EBITDA of 10.1Based on this peers comparison, Johnson & Johnson stock appears fairly valued. On a forward P/E-basis, JNJ stock trades higher than BMY. On a EV/EBITDA basis, JNJ trades in the middle of the pack. It appears that the recent legal issues have barely impacted the JNJ stock price. Shares are down just about 12% from their 52-week high. It may take more to sink a stock with a $346.4 billion market cap.JNJ stock may be attractive to dividend investors. While the 2.91% yield is not particularly high, JNJ is a dividend aristocrat. The company has raised the dividend 57 years in a row. But investors should be cautious given the legal risks. While JNJ may be on the hook for much less than anticipated, it's tough to predict litigation outcomes. Not a Big Risk, But Not a Big OpportunityJohnson & Johnson will likely weather the litigation storm. The talcum powder judgement sound high, but the company could appeal and reduce the final amount. The Oklahoma opioid case also features an eye-popping number. Given the Purdue and Teva settlements, a multi-billion dollar verdict would be surprising.However, the stock offers limited upside. Shares appear fairly valued relative to peers. The company's dividend aristocrat status is a strong selling point. But for short-term plays, better opportunities lie elsewhere. If the legal issues result in a short-term hit to JNJ's stock price, investors may find opportunity. Keep Johnson & Johnson on your radar, and consider a position if the stock sees a material drop in price.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-10,"The past several weeks have been raucous ones for all stocks, but particularly wild ones for healthcare stocks. Not only is the future of the nation's healthcare market in flux, drug companies are facing an inordinate degree of litigation, and biopharma names have dished out plenty of R&D updates … some good, some bad.By and large, the bearish market-wide tide and the weakness healthcare stocks have suffered has become something of an opportunity. A handful of these names have become bargains and are ripe for recoveries.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September To that end, here's a rundown of ten healthcare stocks to buy, even if they're surrounded by bad news and grim headlines. Some are familiar, and others are not. All of them, however, arguably boast more potential than risk at this time, even if not all of them have yet to reach their worst-case-scenario price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has arguably faced the worst and most alarming headlines of late, facing not one but two major legal battles.The first one of course is its liability linked to asbestos contained in its talcum powder sold under the brand name Johnson & Johnson. The other? Some states' attorneys general are suggesting J&J was culpable for what's turned into a nationwide opioid addiction epidemic. A closer inspection of both matters reveals the ultimate liability for both may not be as dire as is currently believed.Though the state of Oklahoma recently won a case that will fine Johnson & Johnson $572 million for allowing opioid abuse to become a &quot;public nuisance,&quot; that figure was smaller than shareholders had feared, and may point to similarly small figures in other state-level cases.As for its talcum powder woes, the company is prevailing in some state courts, and losing in others. With the exception of one case in California, the awards granted in cases it has lost have been relatively modest. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) shares are down nearly 50% from their early 2018 high, reaching another multi-month low in August.The underpinnings for that weakness aren't difficult to deduce. Aside from an increasingly tough battle to defend its patents on breadwinner drug Humira, the decision to acquire Allergan (NYSE:AGN) hasn't been a particularly popular one with shareholders.ABBV stock owners have also been disappointed by a couple of major busts on the R&D front. The company's work in turning Rova-T into a successful lung cancer treatment, for instance, was thrown away when AbbVie ended phase 3 trials after it failed to create meaningful results.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects The punishment, so to speak, hasn't fit the crime though. AbbVie now quietly rates as one of the top healthcare stocks to buy at its now greatly-lowered price thanks to a dividend yield of 6.44% that's reasonably well protected, and a forward-looking P/E of only 7.. CVS Health (CVS)Source: Shutterstock Admittedly, it remains unclear which sliver of the healthcare market will be the one to bear the brunt of any cost-cutting reform. Hospitals and insurers are just as targeted as pharmacy names like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), which is a key part of the reason CVS stock has been nearly cut in half since the middle of 2015.That doubt is rooted in a paradigm shift that isn't likely to happen, however, or at least not as abruptly as some are fearing.Case in point: Just days after announcing plans to eliminate the rebate enjoyed by pharmacies and pharmacy benefits managers, President Donald Trump backpedaled. Although it's not clear where the pressure for the reversal came from, clearly someone is in the industry's corner.In the meantime, CVS is preparing for all contingencies. It now owns health insurer Aetna and is tiptoeing into the medical device arena. In July the company announced it was beginning trials of an at-home kidney dialysis solution. Bausch Health Companies (BHC)Source:  n4i Via FlickrYou may recognize the name as one that has specialized in eye care for a long time now. And Bausch -- Bausch + Lomb, to be precise -- certainly still makes contact lenses and eye-surgery products. This is not the Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) in question, however. While Bausch Health owns and operates Bausch + Lomb, the Bausch that has earned a spot on a list of healthcare stocks to buy is actually the company formerly known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals.That name will also ring a bell for most investors … although not a good one. That's the company that went on an aggressive acquisition spree, planning on buying specialty drugs to then mark their price up to unnecessarily expensive levels.In addition to public outcry, congress got involved, ultimately forcing then-CEO Michael Pearson out, and forcing new CEO Joseph Papa to rebuild everything the company is, and does.  * 7 Best Stocks That Crushed It This Earnings Season Surprise! He's doing it. Though it's still erratic and somewhat unpredictable, sales are expected to grow 1.6% this year, and 3% next. It's not much, but it's enough to drive real earnings growth. Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT)Source: Shutterstock Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT) isn't an easy name to own. Although the biopharma outfit is driving major sales growth with its chronic liver disease drug Ocaliva, the company's a one-trick pony that's still losing money. Last quarter's top line of $66.3 million -- mostly Ocaliva -- was up 53% year-over-year, but still let Intercept book an operating loss of $63.6 million and a total net loss of $71.4 million.In this case though, the company's fiscal trajectory against the backdrop of an obesity epidemic translates into a bright future. Intercept Pharmaceuticals is also working on a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug that takes aim at what is expected to be the leading cause of liver failure by 2020. That under-served market could be worth $50 billion, if not more, leaving this company amazingly well-positioned for growth. Pfizer (PFE)Source: Manuel Esteban/Shutterstock Stripping out last month's 20% stumble, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been a pretty good bet in recent years. Thing is, the aspects that have made PFE stock one of the best healthcare stocks to buy for a long while now are still in place. That is, a diverse portfolio that doesn't lean too much on any one drug. No one product accounts for more than 10% of the company's total revenue.The selloff, for the record, was spurred by the decision to sell its 'off patent' drug business operating as Upjohn to rival Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL). The downside of that exit appears to be fully priced in now though, and then some.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off In the meantime, a $500 million investment in a North Carolina manufacturing facility pushes the company deeper into gene therapy waters, which may offer more upside than existing business lines. PRA Health Sciences (PRAH)Source: Shutterstock When investors thinks of healthcare stocks, PRA Health Sciences (NASDAQ:PRAH) isn't a name that generally comes to mind. Indeed, most investors may have never even heard of it.The one who have heard of it, meanwhile, might be wishing they hadn't. Even with this year's choppy rebound effort, shares of the contract research organization are still down 19%.A bet against PRA Health Sciences hasn't been a particularly wise bet in the grand scheme of things. Contracted research is a key part of the future of healthcare, as outsourcing R&D becomes the more cost-effective solution.PRA Health has the numbers to prove it, too. This year's expected 6.4% revenue growth isn't jaw-dropping, but it's reliable, as will be next year's projected 8.4% top-line growth. Better still, that progress is driving even greater profit growth. Per-share profits are expected to reach $5.03 this year, up from last year's $4.28, and grow 13% to $5.68 per share next year. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN)Source: Shutterstock Last week, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) shares started what would end up becoming a 14% plunge. The selloff may not be done yet either. The prod? Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is challenging Alexion's patent on Soliris, which is used to treat a trio of rare diseases. It makes up the bulk of Alexion's sales.It's an alarming development, although not one that's necessarily devastating. Right or wrong, running patent-based interference meant to disrupt other companies is the new norm within the pharmaceuticals arena, and there's not necessarily any assurance that Amgen will prevail. The chatter that Amgen could make an acquisition bid for Alexion still has its merits as well.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever In the meantime, the forward-looking P/E of 9.9 suggests ALXN is priced cheaply enough to survive any profit-sharing agreement that Amgen may end up pursuing instead of an outright legal victory. Cigna (CI)While pharmacies and pharmaceuticals are certainly vulnerable to any sweeping overhauls in the way the United States healthcare industry works, it's not like the insurers are particularly well-shielded. Cigna (NYSE:CI), for instance, is down more than 30% since its early 2018 high on concerns about insurers' futures, after they all had a pretty good run between 2013 and 2017.Not everyone is concerned about one of a myriad of 'maybes' that could impact Cigna though.Alliance Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes is one of those optimists. He recently upgraded CI stock while it was down, re-rating it at an &quot;Outperform,&quot; explaining &quot;We are increasing our price target and rating on [Cigna] based upon earnings growth driven from deal synergies and its low valuation, which we believe offset our [long term] concerns on policy risks and strategic position.&quot;CI stock is trading at only 14 times its trailing earnings, and only 8.2 times next year's expected profits. Eli Lilly (LLY)Source: Shutterstock Finally, add drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) to your list of healthcare stocks to buy despite a recent wave of bad news.For Lilly, that's mostly been spurred by pipeline and portfolio questions. In March it announced it would launch a cheaper alternative to its own top-selling Humalog insulin, and early this year it decided to acquire Loxo Oncology at an unpopularly frothy premium.There's a reason that slide suffered during the first half of the year has started to reverse course beginning in early August. Not only did Lilly win the outcome it wanted in a recent arbitration claim regarding a collaboration it entered with Adocia to develop rapid-acting insulin, a phase 3 trial of its oral JAK inhibitor Baricitinib as a therapy for atopic dermatitis showed tremendous promise with last month's update.They're little victories that can really add up in investors' heads.As of this writing, James Brumley held no position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just eight months after it announced the failure of its lead Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, Biogen Inc. is attempting to bring it back.The biotech giant announced Tuesday that it plans to submit the drug for FDA approval based on “a new analysis of a larger dataset,” which showed that the drug was able to slow mental decline in some patients after all.  It’s an astonishing turnaround that sent the stock surging some 40% in early trading.The drug represents a substantial commercial opportunity in a devastating and currently untreatable disease, and the Food and Drug Administration has been increasingly flexible on approving drugs in diseases with no good options. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Investors should treat this update with caution; instead, they appear to be overreacting. I’ll be surprised if this gambit works. The data is far from clear. Biogen discontinued two studies of aducanumab in March based on what’s called a futility analysis, a pre-specified early look to see if a study is likely to succeed and worth continuing. It now thinks the initial review was incorrect after looking at new data from more patients. After adding those findings, the company says one of the two trials, called Emerge, showed the drug had a statistically significant impact in patients who took a high dose. Even if Biogen manages to convince the agency that the director’s cut of its first trial is legitimate, the company may fall short. That’s because the FDA typically demands two successful trials for this type of drug, and the second trial, Engage, is still a clear failure. At the high-dose that Biogen is touting, patients who took aducanumab appeared to do worse than those who took a placebo on a key measure even with the new data. That’s tough to explain away, though Biogen is certainly trying. The company says more patients in Emerge were exposed to sufficient levels of the drug, and that data from a subset of Engage patients looks positive. But that second analysis appears to be from a small group of patients and is difficult to trust. There are other red flags. Generally speaking, scientists aren’t fans of re-analyzing data. It inevitably injects bias into trials that are carefully designed to avoid it. If you interrogate any data set long enough, especially when you have an enormous financial incentive to find success, you’re likely to discover a positive interpretation.  A few years back, Eli Lilly & Co. dug through two failed late-stage trials of a similar Alzheimer’s medicine and decided it only failed because the company had picked the wrong patients. It ran a new study based on that assumption, and it failed. Biogen’s rescue mission is in part a different spin on the story; the company says its new data means that one of its trials should never have been labeled a failure in the first place. The attempt to put a positive spin on the second badly failed trial is the same sort of cherry-picking that gets drugmakers in trouble. The world badly needs an Alzheimer’s drug, and the company’s engagement with the FDA may mean the agency is inclined to be open-minded. Biogen still has an uphill battle to prove that it actually has one. To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2019-11-01,"I always keep tabs on IPO stocks, as I'm a big believer in investing early, but I'll be the first to tell you that it's not always easy.If you're looking for large, long-term gains - and who isn't? - investing early is necessary. One example you probably know is Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). If you'd invested five years ago, you'd be richer today than if you'd just invested this year.But on the road to greatness, Facebook hit its share of roadblocks. In fact, the stock went absolutely nowhere for over a year after its IPO in 2012.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market is full of stories like that. And IPO stocks don't always go on to do great things. Some of the most anticipated IPOs fizzle out before they even begin, as we recently saw with the whole WeWork debacle.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November In the space of just one month, the coworking office space company filed for an IPO, saw potential creditors flee once they got a look at its financials, yanked the IPO entirely, and ultimately fired its scandalous CEO, Adam Neumann. WeWork was once privately valued at $47 billion, but now that seems to have gone up in smoke.One big problem here is that once WeWork got into the spotlight, the hype - and the valuation - got out of control. I've seen it many times before, but sooner or later, the honeymoon ends and reality sets in. Put These Two IPO Stocks On Your Watch ListRight now, the best-performing IPO stocks are also the least talked-about, which is pretty telling. A couple stand out to me right now. They might not have a cool enough story to get on TV, but you'll definitely want to put them on your watch list all the same.InMode (NASDAQ:INMD) is a medical device company based in Israel. Specifically, its products are used in minimally invasive surgical and aesthetic procedures in the fields of dermatology, cellulite removal, and gynecology. It's a $1 billion company by market cap, was founded in 2008, and has been profitable for years. Financial buzz puts the sector InMode is going after, medical aesthetics, at $22.2 billion in five years.INMD stock is up 133% since its IPO this August. Even better, its sales are on a steady climb, too - from $53 million in 2017 to $187 million projected for 2020. That would be 253% sales growth in just three yearsThe other promising, under-the-radar IPO is NextCure (NASDAQ:NXTC). It's a clinical stage biotech focused on cancer treatments. The company is pretty small at a market cap of less than $600 million, but it has a deal with drug giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) that could result in up to $1.4 billion in milestone payments. The stock is up 30% since its IPO this May. Given the lucrative deal with Big Pharma, I wouldn't be surprised to see much better gains down the road.If you've never heard of either of these IPO stocks before, I wouldn't be surprised. They've been neglected by the media &quot;hype machine&quot;… and that's promising. It tells me that there's still a lot of potential for future gains - gains that these companies can earn the old fashioned way: by selling more product and delivering shareholder value, year after year.I'll be keeping an eye out for that.

2019-11-01,"Investing in pharmaceutical companies is never easy. But with Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), that sentiment is multiplied a hundred fold. A nasty part of this business is that everything rides on key, flagship drugs. With science being the ultimate skeptic, passing clinical muster is an absolute. And Biogen stock demonstrated how critical this concept is within this year.Source: Shutterstock At the start of 2019, BIIB stock got off to a quick lead. Although shares have been frustratingly choppy over the trailing five years, Biogen did have one ace up its sleeve: aducanumab. A groundbreaking drug designed to slow cognitive decline in some Alzheimer's disease patients, Biogen began conducting clinical trails a few years back.However, in March of this year, the pharmaceutical halted two late-stage trails for aducanumab. Unfortunately for both Biogen engineers and hopeful patients, an independent audit revealed that the drug was likely ineffective. Upon the news, Biogen stock collapsed more than 29%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd between that point and Oct. 21, BIIB stock really didn't move much. Everything hinged on aducanumab, which represented - excuse the expression - a pharmaceutical cash cow.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November However, that same failed drug was responsible for a massive upswing in Biogen stock a day later on Oct. 22. Essentially, the Food and Drug Administration gave the green light for the underlying company to reapply for aducanumab's approval.Going on the media circuit, Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos expressed confidence that this time, aducanumab will receive FDA approval. But how likely is such an event, and how should investors approach BIIB stock?We'll take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly. The Good News for Biogen StockAccording to Vounatsos, the key reason why aducanumab failed was due to a small sample size. Additionally, the first round of clinical trials did not feature dosage diversity. Basically, Biogen did not give patients a strong enough dosage.However, a new analysis on a much larger data set with the higher dosages revealed a stronger mitigation of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. This encouraged Biogen to discuss the fresh findings with the FDA, leading to the green light to reapply.Of course, this does not guarantee that aducanumab will ultimately receive FDA approval. There's a big difference between applying for an Ivy League school and getting into one. And while Vounatsos has emphasized his confidence, I would expect that from any CEO.Still, it gives aducanumab a chance. For now, that's all investors need, having pushed BIIB stock roughly to where it was a year ago.But there's also a human component to aducanumab. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that 5.8 million Americans suffer from the disease. Further, it's the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. If aducanumab works as advertised this time around, it would represent a medical breakthrough.Plus, with so many people suffering from Alzheimer's, Biogen stock will be worth its weight in gold. The Bad News for BIIBAlthough the enthusiasm is palpable for Biogen stock, investors should take a breather before acting on it. As with any equity, you don't want to jump in after a big move without some serious thought.While the reasons forwarded for why the first trial of aducanumab failed makes sense, it doesn't necessarily mean that this latest analysis implies a tangible success for the drug. And investors, medical researchers and patients have reasons to be skeptical.Indeed, I would guess that any intellectually honest medical doctor would advise his or her patient to keep grounded. First, no one outside of Biogen has seen the details of this larger data set analysis. Thus, without peer review, it's hard to generate much excitement.As Dr. Michael Weiner, Alzheimer's researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, told the New York Times, aducanumab could spark &quot;the dawn of a new era.&quot; However, Weiner noted that this is not a cure, but rather, &quot;It is a slowing of decline. The practical impact on patients remains to be seen.&quot;Not only that, research for Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases is littered with failure. Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) have all abandoned this market.You can look at it two ways for BIIB stock: it's a massive opportunity if the company wins, but that probability is very, very low. And Finally, the UglyThus, comes the million-dollar question: how should investors approach Biogen stock?Here's the ugly truth: I have no idea. And I suspect that most analysts feel the same.Without the peer-reviewed analysis of Biogen's new study, investors are operating in the dark. Therefore, if I had to make a guess, I would rely on what we do know. And that is Alzheimer's treatments have a bad track record.Even Biogen's initial clinical trial failed when held to an independent audit. Therefore, BIIB has the credibility hurdle. Given that we won't know the details for some time, gambling on Biogen stock right now seems risky.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Zhang Haitao was a basketball-loving teenager who dreamed of going to a specialized sports high school when he got a pain in his right arm that just wouldn’t go away. It turned out to be acute lymphoblastic leukemia.The discovery set Zhang and his family, from a village deep in the mountains of southwestern China's Sichuan province, on a journey familiar to most cancer patients — a revolving door of hospital visits, blood tests and three rounds of chemotherapy. It was then that Zhang’s doctor suggested a last-ditch option: an experimental gene therapy being trialed by a Chinese startup called Gracell Biotechnology Ltd.After spending three weeks in the hospital in May — during which white blood cells were removed from his body, genetically engineered, and then infused back in — an analysis of Zhang’s bone marrow in June showed his body was clear of cancer.Seven months later, monthly medical tests conducted at a hospital in the nearby Chinese metropolis of Chongqing show he remains cancer free. “I don’t remember much about the treatment as I had a fever throughout,” said Zhang, who’s now almost 16 and spends his days playing video games and texting his friends. “It seems like a new solution that will give people hope.”Read more about how China is overhauling its healthcare systemThe therapy Zhang received was Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cells, known as CAR-T, and it’s being hailed as one of the most exciting developments in the quest to cure cancer. First developed by Israeli scientist Zelig Eshhar in the 1980s, CAR-T re-works the genes of the body’s own immune cells so that they actively seek out and destroy cancer cells. While it’s been embraced by researchers and drugmakers around the world, perhaps nowhere is CAR-T having more impact — and being pushed dangerously close to its limits — than in China, home to the world’s biggest cancer population and some of the most ambitious experiments.CAR-T works by supercharging T-cells, the body’s main line of defense against disease, so that they latch onto and destroy cancer. In clinical trials, leukemia patients who failed to respond to other therapies have shown remission rates of over 90% within two months of treatment.Though drug giants Novartis AG and Gilead Sciences Inc. have been marketing CAR-T globally since 2017, it’s expensive. The process of engineering an individual’s cells in a laboratory and then replicating them has also meant that some patients with more aggressive cancers can die waiting for treatment.That’s where Gracell’s therapy was revolutionary. Instead of the two to three weeks taken by current treatments from American and European drug makers, the Shanghai-based company — set up by a group of veteran Chinese cell-therapy researchers — is churning out cancer-killing immune cells overnight.And they’re doing it much cheaper in some cases than global pharmaceutical giants. Gracell has developed a process using genetic engineering that speeds up the cell production stage, according to founder William Cao Wei. Gracell plans to price its CAR-T treatment for about 500,000 yuan ($71,000), well below the $475,000 price tag for Novartis’ Kymriah, the Swiss company’s CAR-T therapy used to treat the type of blood cancer that Zhang had. A similar treatment from Gilead, based in Foster City, California, costs $373,000.The aging population and a raft of lifestyle factors mean that more new cancer patients are emerging in China than anyplace else in the world, giving the country a significant stake in the global fight to find a cure. Emboldened by the government’s push to become a scientific superpower and to dominate the field of genetics, Gracell and other Chinese biotech startups are racing ahead, with China likely to approve CAR-T for widespread use as early as next year. Up for grabs is a market for cancer drugs and experimental treatments that has exploded to $133 billion a year worldwide, according to life sciences researcher Iqvia Institute.“There can be both cooperation and competition between us and CAR-T developers in developed markets,” said Cao, who is also Gracell’s chief executive officer. “But there will definitely be competition.” That drive to forge ahead — and in front — can be seen in the way China is approaching regulation of CAR-T. The country is weighing new rules that would loosen oversight of the revolutionary technology, allowing academic ethics committees within hospitals to approve new CAR-T treatments and then administer them to patients for a fee.That would markedly loosen China’s current framework, which is presently in line with the approach taken by regulatory bodies like the U.S Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. These entities are the sole authorities in their jurisdictions that evaluate and approve all CAR-T therapies before they are cleared for public use.There is concern among researchers, regulatory experts and drugmakers themselves that allowing hospitals to market treatments for a fee could cause profit-making to trump ethical considerations. In a 2016 case widely reported in the Chinese media, a 22-year-old college student with a rare type of tissue cancer called synovial sarcoma died after going through an experimental cell therapy at a Beijing hospital.“Hospitals can become both players and referees at the same time”Before his death, the patient posted an essay online claiming the hospital had falsely advertised the treatment’s effectiveness, and that Chinese search engine Baidu Inc. had displayed the hospital’s advertising so that it appeared like a credible search result rather than a paid commercial. The essay went viral and sparked an outcry on Chinese social media over the ethics of private hospitals and the regulation of therapies for serious illnesses.Censured by the Cyberspace Administration of China, Baidu responded by restricting the number of sponsored posts to 30% of a results page, and established a 1 billion yuan fund to fight fraud. The hospital did not respond to requests for comment.It’s not the only death allegedly linked to genetic cell therapy in China. Last year, a hospital in the eastern city of Xuzhou was sued over the death of a lymphoma patient who died after receiving a CAR-T treatment. The patient developed severe side effects, including bleeding within the abdomen. The patient’s family argued that the treatment led to his death, but the hospital and doctor said it was the result of late-stage cancer. A court is yet to rule on the case.China’s proposed new framework is reminiscent of its wider approach to the regulation of science, an area President Xi Jinping has prioritized as part of his ambition to cement the country as a world power.The research of He Jiankui, an American-educated Chinese scientist whose revelation last year that he’d edited the genes of twin baby girls ignited a global firestorm, was signed off by the ethics committee of a Shenzhen hospital. The experiment, which He claimed made the twins immune to HIV, wasn’t backed by peer-reviewed data and still hasn’t been verified. Scientists around the world have condemned it as an irresponsible use of a technology that has the capacity to alter the very building blocks of life. The long-term effects of Crispr, the gene-snipping tool used by He and embraced by Chinese researchers, are also yet to be fully understood.China’s new draft rules on CAR-T could give rise to the same scenario, critics say.There’s no guarantee that the hospital committees have the qualifications to evaluate such a complicated therapy, said Tao Xin, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer at Hogan Lovells LLP who specializes in the health-care regulatory law of both the U.S. and China.“The proposal indicates that hospitals can charge a fee for the therapy, in addition to approving its own therapy,” he said. “With these two combined, are we going to see a replay of the 2016 incident? If there’s money to be made and I get to decide whether to do it or not, that’s really controversial.”Read about how Crispr is being used in China’s quest to make a super pigGracell’s Cao is also critical of the new framework as it removes the role of an independent entity that evaluates the therapy’s safety and efficacy: “Hospitals can become both players and referees at the same time.”Novartis and Gilead declined to comment on China’s regulatory plans, while a spokesman for the National Health Commission, the body in charge of governing the country’s health sector, said that the proposed new rules are still under discussion.Read about how Chinese parents are using DNA tests to map out their children’s livesMeanwhile, Chinese companies are racing ahead on CAR-T and attracting hundreds of millions of dollars from investors like Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, as well as global pharmaceutical giants. Venture capital investment in Chinese biotech firms climbed to $17.6 billion last year, quadruple the amount from 2015, according to consultancy ChinaBio LLC. Gracell — which counts Temasek and Lilly Asia Ventures, the venture capital firm spun off from Eli Lilly & Co. as investors — says 32 of the 35 patients it’s enrolled in its China-based trials over the past year have gone into complete remission “with minimal residual disease tested negative” four weeks after the CAR-T infusion — a clinical term that basically means there was no evidence of disease remaining in their bodies, the highest possible efficacy level for a therapy.Other Chinese startups like Nanjing Legend, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Genscript Biotech Corp., and U.S.-listed Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc., have developed similar capabilities.In 2018, Novartis paid $40 million for a 9% stake in Shanghai-based Cellular Biomedicine, and will use their cell therapy facility to manufacture its Kymriah treatment, which is currently being assessed for approval by China’s drug regulator. The startup is also developing its own CAR-T therapies and testing their potential against solid tumors, not just blood cancers. Chief Executive Officer Tony Liu Bizuo said Cellular Biomedicine’s digitized and automated process cuts the cell engineering time from four weeks to less than 10 days.Cellular Biomedicine is now mulling building a bigger cell production facility with the Shanghai government, as demand for cell therapy grows and on expectations more commercial CAR-T treatments will be approved in China in the coming years. In a sign of the support startups are getting from the authorities, the city’s government has earmarked a 4 million square feet space for cell therapy research. Of the 21 cell therapies currently in clinical trials approved by China’s drug regulator, 11 are being conducted in the lab, which is fast becoming the nation’s CAR-T Ground Zero.The next frontier is to make CAR-T as accessible as any other drug, and Chinese startups are at the leading edge. Dubbed “universal CAR-T,” this involves finding a way to take T-cells from healthy people and engineering them so that they can be infused into any cancer patient. Gracell is studying the use of donor white blood cells, marking a step toward that goal. Other startups like French company Cellectis SA are also racing to make universal CAR-T a reality.“I’m very impressed with the pace of technological progress in China and the expansion of CAR-T research coming so rapidly,” said Bruce Levine, a professor specializing in cancer gene therapy at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.“We all want these therapies to move fast and some are very good, but we need to be aware that some could be moving too fast for their expertise, even if they have very good intentions,“ he said.Read about how a Chinese genetics giant wants to tailor drugs to people’s DNAAfter a year in and out of hospital, Zhang, the teenage cancer patient in Chongqing, is starting to make plans for the future. If it wasn’t for the leukemia, he’d be in his first year of high school now.“I don’t think I can go to sports school anymore, but I hope to learn a professional skill,” said Zhang, who’s now a foot taller than his aunt, Chen Chunhua, his primary caregiver. “I want to grasp this chance I have.”While China’s approach to CAR-T may be criticized as moving too fast, Chen, who left her job at a ceramics factory to care for Zhang when he got sick, is thankful he had access to the treatment, which wouldn’t have been possible in China had the boy fallen ill just a year earlier.“I’m so happy we had this option within China,” she said. “It really helps to lessen our burden.”  &#92;--With assistance from Dong Lyu.To contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, Anjali CordeiroFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s Curing Cancer Faster and Cheaper Than Anywhere Else

2019-12-13,"Almost immediately after Karuna Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KRTX) soared to $152, the company priced a public offering of its stock. So, after the cash raise torpedoed the stock lower, investors need to evaluate the merits of Karuna stock.Source: Shutterstock On Nov. 18, Karuna Therapeutics reported KarXT demonstrated statistically significant results in Phase 2 clinical trials. Patients showed an improvement in a Total PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) score. The results sent the stock from ~ $18 to as high as $152.On Nov. 21, the company took advantage of the sharp rise in KRTX stock by pricing a $250 million public offering. It priced 2.6 million shares at $96 a share. Although KRTX stock ended last week at $67.53, the company needs the funds to support continued research activities and the eventual commercialization of the therapy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What is KarXT?Karuna's KarXT is a therapeutic that targets CNS indications. Patients suffering from psychosis and cognitive deficit have a potential drug that will treat psychosis in schizophrenia.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade If the company achieves an end-of-phase 2 meeting expected for Q2/2020, it will follow with Phase 3 started by the end of 2020. KarXT has five potential indications: three relate to schizophrenia, one for Alzheimer's Disease and another for pain. If Karuna brings a schizophrenia drug to the market, it faces minimal competition. Antipsychotics enjoy blockbuster sales but with little innovation; the market has an unmet need.KarXT is a combination of two drugs. Xanomeline, licensed from Ely Lilly (NYSE:LLY), targets muscarinic receptors in the brain. A generic drug called trospium chloride, also a muscarinic antagonist, is combined with xanomeline. KarXT then selectively activates various receptors in the brain. By increasing activity in the central nervous system, salivation glands, sweat glands, GI tract, and bladder, the patient has improved psychosis and recognition. The subject also has higher tolerability.On its press release, a member of Karuna's scientific advisory board said: &quot;The effectiveness of antipsychotics has been limited by the frequent and serious side effects of first- and second-generation drugs.&quot;Further, Jeffrey Liberman, M.D., professor, and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University, said: &quot;KarXT could be a new therapeutic option that has the potential to offer robust efficacy devoid of weight gain, metabolic effects, and extrapyramidal side effects.&quot; KarXT's Phase 2 Study ExplainedKarua enrolled 182 schizophrenia patients with acute psychosis, with 90 on KarXT and 92 on placebo. After 8-35 days, patients optionally received an increased dose. At week 5, total PANSS improved compared to the placebo. The rate of patients discontinuing treatment due to a serious adverse event is similar to the placebo, suggesting a good safety profile.Looking ahead, Karuna will complete a final analysis of the data. From there, it will have a Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in Q2/2020. At that time, it will have a development plan that includes a Phase 3 trial design. Valuation and Your Takeaway on Karuna StockAt a ~$2 billion market cap, Karuna stock is underpriced relative to the market it targets. Antipsychotic drugs may top $14 billion by 2025. So, if the company were to address the entire market, the stock trades at 0.14 (or one-seventh) peak sales. On Wall Street, only two analysts offer a &quot;buy&quot; rating and a price target that averages $121.50 (per Tipranks).Speculators could bet that KRTX will try to make another run higher that is driven by sentiment. And since the company is a few years away from profits, short-sellers may question its fundamentals. Nevertheless, add KRTX stock on the watch list and await updates on its future clinical studies.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Today’s Food and Drug Administration moves much faster than it used to. That may not always be a good thing. A review of drug approvals by the agency from researchers at Harvard Medical School released Tuesday found that the FDA is approving drugs more rapidly with weaker evidence than it did in the past. That can be beneficial when it leads to needed medicines getting to market quickly, and I believe that’s the agency’s intent. As the study’s authors highlight, however, this emphasis on speed and flexibility could be eroding standards. It may be time for a gut check.The gold standard for demonstrating efficacy — and the surest way of winning drug approval — is to demonstrate success in large, well-controlled studies that result in a hard outcome. But there are faster ways to get to market. In 1992, Congress created the accelerated approval program, which can green light medicines based on “surrogate” endpoints that predict rather than confirm benefit for patients, or those that have shown a shorter-term benefit. It’s one of several initiatives that have changed how the agency works. According to the study, 80.6% of approvals between 1995 and 1997 were supported by at least two pivotal trials. That number dropped to 52.8% between 2005 and 2017. Companies that get accelerated approval have to prove their drug works with a confirmatory trial in order to gain full approval, but there’s no hard timetable no when that must be done. Thus, drugmakers often don't hurry to conduct those tests. This is problematic at best, dangerous at worst.Here’s just one case: In 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. sought approval of a medicine to treat a rare muscle-wasting disease in young boys based on weak evidence from a tiny trial. In the face of significant public pressure, the FDA approved Exondys 51 even though one of its scientists called the treatment “an elegant placebo” in a report. Sarepta is selling the drug for over $300,000 a year but has continually delayed a confirmatory trial. It’s now years away from completion, and there have been no real consequences for the delay.When companies do complete post-approval trials, it sometimes reveals a mistake. Eli Lilly & Co.’s cancer drug Lartruvo got accelerated approval in 2016. Lilly then pulled the medicine from the market last year after a larger trial found no benefit. That’s a rare outcome, but there are many expensive drugs on the market that have never moved beyond surrogate endpoints. A study of 93 accelerated cancer drug approvals between 1992 and 2017 found that only 19 had proved to help patients live longer in a followup trial. There are some good reasons for faster approvals, as former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb outlined in a Twitter response this week to a critical New York Times editorial penned on Jan. 11. Scientists are better at evaluating the safety of medicines and trial design has improved, for example. And advances have made it easier to create drugs that target small populations and have dramatic effects, Gottlieb wrote.He makes good points. But the agency arguably hasn’t found the right balance between embracing advances and maintaining a high bar. It certainly has a ways to go on post-approval follow up. America is entirely unable to control the price of new medicines; the approval of marginal drugs has financial consequences. The FDA will soon face one of its most important and controversial decisions yet. Biogen Inc. is seeking approval for the first purportedly disease-modifying Alzheimer’s drug — a medicine that could be used by millions of people and cost billions — without good evidence that it works. The agency often uses unmet need as a justification for shifting standards, and there’s no bigger unmet need than Alzheimer’s. That doesn’t justify an approval based on one failed trial and another that is a questionable success at best.The agency will have to decide whether to review or approve the medicine in the next year or so. This choice is an opportunity to resist public pressure and move back toward demanding firmer proof of efficacy before drugs hit the market. To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2020-01-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Once-untreatable cancers and rare diseases are being vanquished. Medical breakthroughs have put Ebola and HIV on the back foot, even as new viruses emerge. Drug stocks have touched record highs after a decade of gains.But at the industry’s biggest annual gathering, a San Francisco investor meeting that draws in thousands from biotechnology, pharmaceutical and insurance companies, plus investors, bankers and consultants, there was a sense of uncertainty, even worry.“The model is broken in the U.S.,” Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Paul Hudson said in an interview.Despite record scientific and market returns, the health-care industry’s future in the U.S. has never seemed less clear. Candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have proposed nationalizing the health-insurance system. The president has called for drug-price controls. And after years of struggle, there’s been no winner among the warring factions of drugmakers, health insurers, pharmacy-benefit managers and patients.For one attendee at the conference, hosted in a cramped hotel in the Union Square neighborhood, it felt like waiting for a metaphorical earthquake.“I think that these constant price increases create a situation where there’s all this built-up tension, all this built-up energy,” Denny Lanfear, the CEO of Coherus Biosciences Inc., said about his company’s goal to drive down drug prices with lower-cost competitors to expensive biotech drugs. “It’s kind of like the seismic tension along the San Andreas fault: At some point, you simply have an event which causes a tectonic shift in thinking.”And this week, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said on a conference call that the long, volatile debate about the U.S. health care system has contributed to “what may sometimes feel like uncertain times.”Despite the industry’s worries, the market has for weeks suggested that things couldn’t be better. An S&P 500 subindex of health companies, including players like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc., would hit an all-time high by the conference’s end. Registration for the always-crowded event rose this year, as did San Francisco hotel occupancy, and average hotel rates were $972 a night, according to data from the San Francisco Travel Association.On Friday, some of that confidence began to crack. Health stocks including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., CVS Health Corp., Amgen Inc. and others led declines after a report that the Trump administration could make a fresh push to lower prices.Among the almost 10,200 attendees last week at the conference, one of those small seismic tremors could be felt between the CEO of one major drugmaker and the top executive from CVS, the pharmacy plan and drugstore chain that negotiates drug prices for patients. The company is also one of the U.S.’s leading health insurers.“We need more regulation of the insurance industry,” David Ricks, CEO of Indianapolis-based drug giant Eli Lilly & Co., said in an interview Tuesday morning in one of the hotel’s lounges. “I don’t think the system will maintain itself like this for the next decade. We’ll have to see reform.”Moments later, Ricks spotted his counterpart at CVS, Larry Merlo, coming into the room with a group of employees and walked over to him to talk about a long-running business dispute.“We’ve had some differences in the past,” Ricks said to Merlo, as Whitney Houston’s “Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” played over the speakers. The drug CEO told him that he hoped they could soon find some common ground on coverage of insulin, one of Lilly’s major products, and drug affordability.The two executives have clashed before, as have their industry lobbies -- blaming the other for the increasingly expensive price tags for U.S. pharmaceuticals. CVS currently excludes Lilly’s top-selling insulin from its main list of covered drugs.A CVS representative declined to say how the conversation ended, saying CVS would continue to work on getting insulin to patients at the lowest cost.“We’re willing to work with any part of the supply chain,” said CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford, “but we’re also willing to go it alone.” A Lilly spokesman also declined to comment further on the details of the executives’ conversation.Political TargetLater Tuesday evening, Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa for the final debate before the state’s presidential primary caucus took aim at the industry. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders condemned health-care companies -- three times -- for “greed and corruption.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads many polls, called for price controls: “You don’t have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge,” he said. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Sanders’s main rival, said she would use presidential authority to lower the prices of insulin, EpiPens and HIV medications. And almost all the candidates have either called for nationalizing the health insurance system or creating a government-run competitor to it.Sanders kept up the broadside a few days later, attacking “price-gouging” pharmaceutical companies Friday after BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. said it may place a $2 million to $3 million price on its experimental gene-therapy treatment, according to the Wall Street Journal.A BioMarin spokeswoman said in an email that the company hasn’t announced a price for its therapy and declined to comment on the Sanders tweet.President Donald Trump, who is making a bid for re-election this fall, has said he favors a proposal to peg price tags in the U.S. to the much lower levels in other countries, what’s known as an international pricing index. The drug industry is instead is pushing for a cap to how much patients pay out of their own wallets for prescriptions under Medicare’s prescription drug benefit.“The greatest threat the industry faces right now is President Trump pulling the trigger on international price index. It’s clear he doesn’t want to go into the election with nothing on pricing,” said James Greenwood, who leads industry group the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, which is ramping up lobbying efforts going into the election cycle.Washington’s appetite for drug pricing reform could even affect the most commercially viable medicines, like cancer treatments, said Chris Boerner, chief commercialization officer of Bristol-Myers.“Innovation has never been better: immuno-oncology, cell therapy, gene therapy are fundamentally changing diseases,” Boerner said. “But now we unfortunately do see an environment where policies put forth could change the ecosystem that led to those innovations. That’s deeply concerning.”New FocusAs scrutiny of the industry’s prices has continued, some drugmakers have turned away from areas where the pressure is most acute. Sanofi announced in December it would halt research in heart disease and diabetes: two legacy areas that faced significant cost pressure. Hudson, who took the helm in September, will double down on medicines for cancer and other diseases where reimbursement is more straightforward -- and often higher.They’re also making smaller bets, a striking contrast to 2019 mega-mergers like Bristol-Myers’s $74 billion acquisition of Celgene Corp. and AbbVie’s $63 billion bid for Allergan Plc.With the future uncertain, those type of big bets are no longer fashionable. In favor instead are smaller, “bolt-on” deals.Lilly announced a $1.1 billion deal on Jan. 10 that CEO Ricks described as “the definition of bolt-on,” while German drugmaker Bayer AG plans deals to invest further in cell and gene therapy, a move that would complement its acquisition of cell therapy-focused biotech BlueRock last year, Stefan Oelrich, president of pharma, said.Jennifer Taubert, executive vice president and worldwide chairman of pharmaceuticals at Johnson & Johnson, touted the company’s partnerships. “There still is a really good appetite and ability to partner even though there’s other funding mechanisms and things out there,” she said. Sanofi CEO Hudson said he, too, was looking at smaller, earlier-stage deals.“This year, it’s a tricky year, because with the prospect of drug pricing legislation there’s a number of different outcomes that could influence the type of company you’d want to buy,” said Richard Pops, CEO of biotech Alkermes Plc. “What’s going to be in the crosshairs in terms of regulatory or statutory reform that makes certain businesses more or less attractive?”“I can see why pharma is waiting to see how the dust settles before they make big commitments to different businesses,” Pops said.&#92;--With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.To contact the reporters on this story: Emma Court in New York at ecourt1@bloomberg.net;Riley Griffin in New York at rgriffin42@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net, Timothy AnnettFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Drug Stocks Slide as Never-Ending Political Worry Gathers Steam

2020-01-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you’re a prosecutor or a regulator looking to get a little good press, one surefire approach is to sue Martin Shkreli, the infamous “pharma bro.”That’s what New York State Attorney General Letitia James and the Federal Trade Commission did on Monday, and it worked like a charm. Reports popped up in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Toronto Star, CBS News, Daily Beast and many other outlets. James herself took a victory lap on Twitter:Shkreli is a perfect target. Five years ago, he became the symbol for outrageous drug prices after he raised the cost of his company’s one drug, Daraprim, to $750 a pill from $13.50 — and then basically laughed at everyone who complained. His nonstop smirking during a subsequent congressional hearing infuriated lawmakers. In the spring of 2018, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for committing financial fraud. Last year, he was transferred from federal prison in New Jersey after the Journal reported that he was using a contraband mobile phone to run the company from his cell. The charges leveled by the attorney general and the FTC against Shkreli(1)and the company — Vyera Pharmaceuticals LLC, as it’s now called(2)— flow directly from that now-infamous price increase. According to the complaint, they have been using illegal tactics to prevent low-cost generics from entering the market. For instance, Vyera drew up agreements with distributors that prevented them from selling Daraprim, which treats toxoplasmosis, to generic manufacturers. (Generic companies need access to the brand-name drugs to make their copies.) It had “data-blocking” agreements, which made it impossible for generic makers to obtain the information to assess whether enough patients needed the drug to make it worth pursuing. And it cut off competitors’ access to pyrimethamine, the active ingredient in Daraprim. All of these measures helped Daraprim maintain its monopoly — and its high price.All five of the FTC commissioners approved the lawsuit, although the two Democrats had reservations, which I’ll get to in a moment. In the FTC’s press release, Gail Levine, the deputy director of the agency’s bureau of competition, said that “Vyera kept the price of Daraprim astronomically high by illegally boxing out the competition.” In the New York attorney general’s press release, James described Shkreli as despicable and said that one of the goals of the lawsuit was to prevent him from ever working in the pharmaceutical industry again.“We won’t allow ‘Pharma Bros’ to manipulate the market and line their pockets at the expense of vulnerable patients and the health care system,” she added.Except pharma bros aren’t the problem. Shkreli jacked up the price of one drug with a small patient population. Meanwhile, the cost of insulin has tripled in the past decade, and many of the country’s 30 million diabetics are rationing insulin shots because they can’t afford the high price. The country’s three insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly & Co., Novo Nordisk A/S, and Sanofi, are not pharma bros.Humira, the world’s top-selling drug, costs $60,000 a year. Its manufacturer, AbbVie Inc., has successfully fended off generic competition for years. It’s not a pharma bro either. Neither is Roche Holdings AG, Gilead Science Inc. or Biogen Inc., which all have drugs whose prices have skyrocketed. When I asked Rutgers University law professor Michael Carrier why New York and the FTC weren’t going after these bigger — and, frankly, worthier — targets, he made a plausible case that the Daraprim situation was unique. Carrier co-wrote a paper in 2018 that laid out the way antitrust law could be used against Vyera and Shkreli — a paper that the state and the commission appear to have used as a blueprint.“With Daraprim, you can make a straightforward application of antitrust law,” he told me. “Everything they did had anticompetitive effects, and no pro-competition justification. It was maintaining its monopoly by taking actions that had no other rationale other than keeping competition away.”When I asked him why that was any different from, say, Humira, Carrier responded with one word: patents. AbbVie has protected Humira’s monopoly by surrounding the drug with dozens of add-on patents, a practice called “evergreening.” Although the ordinary person might view those patents as being solely intended to maintain the drug’s monopoly, courts tend to give great weight to patent protection. To make an antitrust case against Humira, the authorities would have to argue that its add-on patents are frivolous, and that’s not a winning argument, even if it’s true.Fair enough. Still, Big Pharma uses other tactics to keep generics off the market. Many companies now file “citizen’s petitions” to the Food and Drug Administration — originally intended to allow citizens to influence health policy — against other companies to keep their drugs off the market. They cut deals with generic companies to delay the introduction of a competitor. They also do some of the same things Vyera does to maintain Daraprim’s monopoly.So, yes, maybe a straightforward antitrust case wouldn’t work against these larger players. But there is something else the FTC could do to take on the big boys — and that’s what the two Democrats on the commission, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, suggested in their concurrent statements.Section 5 of the FTC Act gives the agency the ability to declare unlawful “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” Like many federal agencies, the FTC has become timid, so its use of this broad mandate has been circumscribed in recent decades. “I believe that some of the conduct alleged in the complaint,” against Shkreli and Vyera, Chopra wrote, “also constitutes a violation of the FTC Act’s prohibition of unfair acts and practices.”“I believe that the FTC and many of the State Attorneys General should pursue this legal claim in cases with the similar facts,” he said, adding, “I continue to be concerned that the FTC does not use its authority to the fullest extent possible to combat marketplace abuses. This is another missed opportunity for the Commission.”He’s right. If the FTC and James were willing to go after Big Pharma’s tactics using Section 5, they might be able to do something big and important to rein in drug prices. But that would be difficult, and they might not win. So instead they went after the easiest target on the planet: a “pharma bro” who’s already in prison.If and when they win the case, there will no doubt be another round of congratulatory press releases.

2020-02-10,"Experimental drugs from Roche and Eli Lilly failed to halt Alzheimer's disease in their latest test, the companies said on Monday, in a blow to people whose genes make them particularly vulnerable to the illness.  Pursuit of an Alzheimer's remedy, which would inevitably reap drugmakers billions of dollars, has been marked by more than 100 failures, although researchers still hope to tame a condition that affects nearly 6 million Americans, more than 40 million people worldwide, and which is growing more prevalent.  The study of Roche's gantenerumab and Eli Lilly's solanezumab spearheaded by Washington University in St. Louis focused on rare autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, which is caused by gene mutations that follow generations of families.","Roche, Lilly drugs fail to halt gene-driven Alzheimer's disease"
2020-02-10,"Alzheimer’s drugs made by Eli Lilly and Roche have disappointed in a late-stage trial, dealing another blow to the most common hypothesis about what causes the devastating degenerative disease.  An initial analysis of the trial results found the drugs both failed to slow cognitive decline, as measured by tests of thinking and memory, in patients who have a rare inherited form of Alzheimer’s that can cause deterioration in their 40s or 50s — or even earlier.  The trial — which followed 197 patients for up to seven years — was an important attempt to slow the symptoms of Alzheimer’s before they manifested.",Roche and Eli Lilly drugs fail ‘inherited’ Alzheimer’s trial

Lilly said it does not plan to submit the experimental therapy to regulators for approval based on the primary endpoint studied in the trial. The results did not surprise analysts. &quot;We were not optimistic on this trial given it was a relatively small trial and in a more severe form of the disease,&quot; Mizuho Securities' Vamil Divan said in a note. Lilly said it will continue to study solanezumab in another trial. Drugmakers have long struggled to gain ground in the development of treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

2020-02-27,"Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 6-5 that CYRAMZA® (ramucirumab) plus erlotinib demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile for patients with untreated metastatic EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on the results of the positive Phase 3 RELAY study. &quot;Given the unmet need that remains in treating metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, we are encouraged that the majority of these experts agree CYRAMZA plus erlotinib has a favorable benefit/risk profile for the first-line treatment of these patients,&quot; said Maura Dickler, M.D., vice president of late phase development, Lilly Oncology. &quot;We believe in the clinical meaningfulness of the data from the RELAY trial, which targeted the VEGFR and EGFR pathways together. We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA on this application to offer a new front-line treatment option for people with metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; The ODAC considered the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 RELAY trial, which is the basis for the CYRAMZA supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) currently under review by the FDA. In the RELAY study, CYRAMZA, a VEGF receptor 2 antagonist, in combination with erlotinib, a globally approved EGFR-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival – the time patients live without their disease getting worse – compared to erlotinib alone. Median PFS on the CYRAMZA-plus-erlotinib arm was 19.4 months compared to 12.4 months on the placebo-plus-erlotinib arm, an improvement of seven months (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46-0.79; P&lt;0.0001). The safety profile observed in the RELAY study was consistent with what has been previously observed for CYRAMZA in Phase 3 clinical trials and the established safety profile of erlotinib. The most common (&gt;5% incidence) Grade ≥3 adverse events occurring at a higher rate (≥5% difference) on the CYRAMZA-plus-erlotinib arm compared to the placebo-plus-erlotinib arm were hypertension, dermatitis acneiform (an acne-like rash), and diarrhea. There is no cure for people with metastatic EGFR-mutated lung cancer and disease progression following acquired resistance remains a challenge. Most patients receive several lines of treatment and the therapeutic regimen prescribed for first-line treatment can impact a person's options for later lines of therapy. Globally, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) – including erlotinib, which was used in the trial – are the current standard treatment option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. There remains an ongoing need for additional first-line therapeutic options that provide clinically meaningful benefits – including delaying disease progression and use of chemotherapy as long as possible. Moreover, new treatment options could allow oncologists greater choice on how to use the available agents, in shared decision-making with their patients. Advisory committees provide the FDA with independent opinions and recommendations from outside medical experts during the drug review process. The FDA is not obligated to follow their recommendation, but it often does. Lilly has also made regulatory submissions outside the U.S. based on the RELAY data. In January 2020, the European Commission granted European Union approval for CYRAMZA in combination with erlotinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. Lilly has submitted in Japan and expects regulatory action in the second half of 2020.",FDA Advisory Committee Votes in Favor of Lilly's CYRAMZA® (ramucirumab) as First-Line Treatment for Metastatic EGFR-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If we want a vaccine or drug treatment to stop coronavirus, the government should ignore those complaining about drug-company profits and commit to a huge reward that encourages more businesses to develop one. It wouldn’t just save lives; it could save the global economy. The coronavirus could cost the U.S. $1.5 trillion in annual economic output, or $125 billion every month — and that’s a conservative estimate. The losses for the entire world economy will be four to five times larger. And these economic costs will be dwarfed by the human costs of illness and death. Absent a vaccine or treatment, this pandemic will likely be with us for more than a year. Speeding the development of vaccines and effective drug therapies by vastly increasing the rewards for businesses would decisively limit the economic damage. Based on the economic losses in the U.S. alone, the government should be willing to spend at least an additional $62.5 billion to spur Covid-19 research and development. Even if that shortened the crisis by just two weeks, it would be a bargain. Research teams at large pharma companies such as Roche, Eli Lilly, Sanofi Pasteur and Takeda, and smaller biotech firms such as BioNTech, are racing to develop a vaccine. But these firms stand to capture only a small fraction of the large economic benefit that will accrue to society when they successfully produce a vaccine or therapy. Developers will likely be pressured to offer a future vaccine at a low price. Even now, there have been calls to sharply limit future profits from such a vaccine. The result is significant underinvestment in the development of vaccines that will likely have large social benefits. Here is a simple way to see this. U.S. spending on all pharmaceutical R&D in 2020 was projected to be $80 billion — equivalent to three weeks of the annual U.S. economic output loss — with only a small fraction of this directed toward infectious diseases. In 1967, 26 pharmaceutical companies produced vaccines; by 1980, 17 did; only four — GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer and Sanofi Pasteur — undertake significant production today. This is not surprising. Developing a vaccine requires $500 million to $1 billion in investment, recent estimates suggest, while only 7% of projects result in a vaccine. As a result, even today, with the pandemic raging, many small biotech firms are watching from the sidelines. Those working on vaccines rely on money from foundations and government initiatives. Two of the most promising developers of a Covid-19 vaccine, Inovio and Moderna, are funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), an alliance of charities and governments. The U.S. government, perhaps working with others, should guarantee a significant financial payment to whoever first develops a vaccine. One way to do this would be to commit to a high price for each administered dose of an effective vaccine or treatment therapy. As an example, if the U.S. government were to promise a price of $190 per administered dose to the developers, spending a maximum of $62.5 billion to vaccinate or treat all Americans, then society would have earned back its investment even if this only sped up the development by two weeks. The vaccine should also be made available at marginal cost to developing countries.The government could further stimulate collaboration by committing to large awards for successful clinical trials, provided that the research is fully disclosed. If the European Union were to make a similar commitment to this price per administered dose, the total incentives could be strengthened by another $100 billion. While creating vaccines always takes time, experts in the field have learned from previous episodes that there can be major bottlenecks in vaccine development and manufacturing. Once developed, the supply is likely to fall short of demand for a long period. Additional financial resources can relieve these production bottlenecks. We are not asking the U.S. government, or any other government, to pick winners. We are asking the government to make an ironclad commitment right now, backed by legislation, to reward those companies that successfully lead the fight against Covid-19 and future outbreaks.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Hanno Lustig is a professor of finance at Stanford University.

According to Flynn, Lilly’s strong growth profile coupled with its &quot;significant&quot; margin expansion, limited exposure to near-term loss of exclusivities, a favorable U.S. channel mix and a 2.2% dividend yield positions its shares for continued outperformance this year.Overall, the analyst community is not as bullish as Flynn. 3 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

2020-04-09,"Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) stock has outperformed its big pharma peers, prompting an analyst at Morgan Stanley to turn cautious on the stock.The Lilly Analyst David Risinger downgraded shares of Lilly from Overweight to Equal-weight and maintained a $148 price target.The Lilly Thesis Lilly's stock, having closed Wednesday's session at $146.22, has approached Morgan Stanley's price target, Risinger said in a Thursday downgrade note. (See his track record here.)Lilly's P/E premium to the group has increased notably and is close to historical peaks, the analyst said. Morgan Stanley sees some risk to 2021 sales and earnings due to unemployment risks to U.S. commercial drug coverage. Risinger said he believes Lilly has outperformed due to the following reasons:  * A higher percentage of revenue from outpatient drugs that face less short-term, COVID-related disruptions than hospital and physician-administered drugs.   * The company reaffirming 2020 guidance on March 23 while other pharma companies have suggested some COVID-related uncertainties.   * Less dependency on new drug launches than some peers.   * Lilly's status as a high-quality, durable growth company with less long-term patent exposure. Morgan Stanley estimates long-term, mid-single digit revenue and low double-digit EPS growth for Lilly.The firm is optimistic concerning Lilly's diabetes franchise, which stands to benefit from pipeline candidates, including high-dose Trulicity and the novel drug tirzepatide, Risinger said. The Alzheimer's candidates are high-risk, high-reward prospects, the analyst said. &quot;The stock's high multiple reflects these prospects, in our view.&quot;LLY Price Action Lilly shares were down 0.32% at $145.56 at the time of publication.

2020-04-10,"Eli Lilly and Co.  said late Friday it has reached an agreement with the National Institutes of Health to study one of its drugs as a COVID-19 treatment. Baricitinib, marketed as Olumiant, is approved in more than 65 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The study to use it on COVID-19 patients involves those hospitalized because of the illness, and begins this month in the U.S. with a planned expansion to other countries, the company said. The results are expected within the next two months, Eli Lilly said. One of the warnings regarding the use of baricitinib includes the risk of developing serious infections, which could be related to the drug's effects on the immune system. &quot;Given the inflammatory cascade seen in COVID-19, baricitinib's anti-inflammatory activity has been hypothesized to have a potential beneficial effect in COVID-19 and warrants further study in patients with this infection,&quot; the company said.

2020-04-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Eddie Yoon took over the Fidelity Select Health Care Fund in 2008, just as the financial crisis ushered in the worst recession since the Great Depression. He outperformed health-care's benchmark during the ensuing 12 years when his fund quintupled to almost $7 billion. That record made him No. 1 among 20 peers managing at least $200 million with combined 1-to-5-year returns, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.He has never seen anything like the Covid-19 pandemic, an unprecedented disruption that, for the first time, he says, is aligning patients, health-care providers and payers, including insurers.The coronavirus has “fundamentally changed the way we think about the outlook,” said the 40-year-old Yoon earlier this month in a remotely arranged interview near Fidelity's Boston headquarters. “Big winners and losers are going to emerge, and that provides an enormous opportunity for folks like us that run active funds that really capitalize on the companies that are going to be successful in that new world.”Basel-based Roche Holding AG, Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly & Co., London-based AstraZeneca PLC and South San Francisco-based Principia Biopharma Inc. are “still are very big parts” of Fidelity Select Health Care. They appreciated 20%, 17%, 14% and 110%, respectively, during the past 12 months.Yoon said he relies on the “same investment framework that we've been using for over 10 years.” This means focusing simultaneously on free cash flow — how much money a business has to sustain its operations after paying for buildings, equipment and other capital expenditures — and the long-term growth rates of companies.“We construct a portfolio where we're trying to extract the most amount of return — income plus appreciation — for the least amount of risk,” Yoon said. “With the demand shock we're seeing in our economy as well as this public health-care crisis, things are changing rapidly, so when you are uncertain, you want more downside protection or more upside opportunity.”Fidelity Select Health Care almost tripled its weighting in Western European companies compared with the MSCI US Health Care Index during the past three years at the expense of U.S. companies whose underweighting increased to 19% from 10% versus the benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Coming into 2019, we were de-risking” as “a lot of growth stocks got very, very expensive,” said Yoon, who joined Fidelity after an initial stint at JPMorgan Asset Management starting in 2002, when he received a B.A. in business economics from Brown University.  “We actually narrowed the pharmaceuticals positioning in the fund, and I own more large pharma companies now than I have before.”Fidelity Select Health Care gained 9.3% during the past 12 months, outperforming the benchmark by 5.2% when the MSCI declined 4.1%. Most of the return came from the pharmaceutical companies he selected even when the fund held fewer of them than the benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“My general philosophy is deliver a double-digit return for shareholders that will outperform the underlying benchmark and other asset classes that investors might want to put their capital into,” Yoon said. The fund returned 549% since he became its manager. Health care remains something of a haven during periods of market turbulence. When the S&P 500 index lost 12% last month, the shares of health-care companies lost only 3.8% when the comparable measures for the financial and energy industries declined 21% and 35%, respectively. During the last recession, between December 2007 and June 2009, health care retreated 25% when the S&P 500 decreased 35%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Yoon, who also oversees Fidelity's global health-care research, said “until we get to a way to find a health-care breakthrough — whether it be a therapeutic, a preventative medicine, helping people develop antibodies against the coronavirus or a vaccine — we're going to have to deal with this coronavirus as we think about the demand picture for the foreseeable future.”While Yoon dealt with the upheaval of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and the disruption caused by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which went into effect in 2013, “this time it's different,” he said.“The companies that we're trying to find that actually are impacted by this crisis are companies that are going to see a cyclical benefit where demand is going to rise because of the coronavirus and then stay high for longer because of something unique in their business model. Those are the companies we own and will hopefully own for a long time.”&#92;-- With assistance from Shin Pei, Cara Slear and Chase Lynch.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Matthew A.

2020-04-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Eli Lilly & Co. saw a tsunami coming, but instead of being crushed by the brute force of the novel coronavirus, the pharmaceutical giant found a way to ride the wave.The challenge facing executives now will be to maintain the company’s momentum as the effects of the pandemic wash through a radically altered U.S. economy.The Indianapolis-based drugmaker’s stock hit a record Thursday after Lilly boosted its outlook and reported first-quarter sales that outpaced Wall Street estimates. At 2:54 p.m. in New York, the shares were trading up 2.2% at $160.22 after earlier gaining as much as 3.7%.While most blue-chip companies have been roiled by Covid-19, Lilly saw an added benefit of about $250 million in the quarter from the virus as patients stockpiled prescriptions, leading revenue to top $4.86 billion. Sales of its top-selling drugs, including diabetes treatment Trulicity and the autoimmune therapy Taltz, surged.Normally, satisfying such a spike in demand would strain the company’s manufacturing capacity, but Lilly’s management had recognized early on that the new coronavirus would put great stress on its operations, and took steps to protect production outposts and make sure that workers could producing its drugs.Senior executives watched closely as the virus began to break out in China in December, jeopardizing a key drugmaking facility. In February, the company rushed to secure travel documentation for Italian employees at a Tuscan manufacturing site that makes insulin for diabetes patients in the U.S.Still, Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks sought to temper investors’ expectations during a conference call on Thursday. He said the pandemic is expected to have a long-term negative impact on the company, potentially leading to a drop in new prescriptions, de-stocking of medicines and pricing pressures.Early StepsIt was clear early on that the potent virus would cross oceans, transcend borders and even pass through the hands of executives at health-care industry conferences, said Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley in an interview.Smiley, alongside an internal task force that included Ricks and Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky, acted quickly. On March 9, before many S&P 500 companies, Lilly told its 33,000-plus global staff of administrators, sales representatives, researchers and accountants to stop traveling and start working from home.“We’d never tried anything of this magnitude,” Smiley said. “But if you look at our major facilities--one near Shanghai, one near Florence, one in Madrid, one in France--we’re in all the places that are affected by Covid-19.”Lilly needed to get nonessential employees off premises to ensure that 3,000 to 5,000 manufacturing operators around the world could safely remain in place, working flat-out to get the 40 million patients it serves their medicines. In China, Italy and the U.S., Lilly didn’t have to close a single manufacturing facility or curb production.Smiley, who is working from home -- at times in his pajamas -- said he’s more frequently in contact with employees abroad than ever.“We closed first quarter books at one-hundred-plus locations with nobody in the office,” he said. Smiley is holding daily video calls with lieutenants in major markets to ensure that drug orders are fulfilled. He said employees have been asking for assurances, but the future remains hard to predict.“The thing everyone wants, that we can’t provide, is certainty,” he said. “When are we going to go back to the office? When are things changing? Our answer is we don’t know yet, we don’t think it’s anytime soon.”Covid ResearchLilly said it is looking to rapidly develop potential new therapies for coronavirus. It’s already working with closely held biotechnology company AbCellera Biologics Inc., to develop a treatment based on antibodies present in the blood of patients who’ve recovered from Covid-19.Skovronsky said Thursday that Lilly intends to approach U.S. regulators before the end of May for permission to move into human trials. Lilly is also working with the National Institutes of Health to evaluate an existing rheumatoid arthritis medication in hospitalized Covid-19 patients.“We have to prepare now to make millions of doses,” said Smiley, the chief financial officer, noting that there will be an increase in R&D and manufacturing expenses related to Covid-19 effortsfor the foreseeable future. “It’s a challenge for us. We haven’t done it before.”Should Lilly and other pharmaceutical companies be successful in developing Covid-19 drugs, it could improve the industry’s standing with policy makers and the public after fierce battles over rising drug costs and other issues.“We have an opportunity to reset the reputation of the industry,” Ricks said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Lilly Shares Reach Record After Drugmaker Moves Fast on Virus

Reflecting the speed of the turmoil caused by the pandemic, the declines come just months after private equity managers said they were struggling to do deals because prices were too high. Despite the declines, which mirrored the fall in public markets, the firm’s leadership struck a bullish tone.“We built a business that’s designed to ride through a difficult environment,” Jonathan Gray, president of the firm, said in an interview. “Blackstone ultimately emerged much stronger coming out of the ’08 financial crisis.” Blackstone’s private equity group suffered the largest drop in the quarter, with assets falling 22%.

The government is set to request parliamentary approval for broadening the budget deficit by $59.4 billion to fund a new stimulus package.Australia Urges Scrutiny of Wet Markets (6 a.m. NY)Australia used a virtual meeting of G-20 agriculture ministers to call for scrutiny of wildlife wet markets, calling them a risk to biosecurity and human health -- a move that may exacerbate tensions with China. Though the minister did not single out China in the statement, the call could be perceived as criticism of Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan where non-traditional animals were suspected of being sold for food.Since then, China has banned its wildlife meat trade. Still, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said America is calling for China to “permanently close its wildlife wet markets” and urged “ASEAN governments to do the same.”Beijing said it doesn’t have so-called wildlife wet markets. “There is no such concept as the wet market in China,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. “The common ones are agricultural markets and live poultry and seafood markets. Such markets exist not only in China, but also in some Southeast Asian countries and a large number of developing countries.” International law does not restrict their operation, Geng said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",N.Y.

2020-04-23,"A month ago today, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) sank to three-year lows under 2200 as the economy reeled from the coronavirus pandemic.The crisis still rages, but the SPX has sure caught fire since then. It closed yesterday just a touch below 2800 and up nearly 28% from last month's low point, reflecting what appears to be a lot of faith in the ability of Congress and the Fed to prevent a devastating blow to the economy.In some ways, it's been devastating already when you think of so many people out of work and struggling to get by. Today's weekly new jobless claims of more than 4.4 million, the oil market collapse, and companies pulling their guidance all reflect economic upheaval. More rough news came from overseas Thursday as Europe's April PMI reading slid to 13.5, the lowest on record.Besides claims--which were a little higher than analysts had expected but below the previous week-- earnings continue to be the main focus today. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) led things off with a really solid report, beating analysts' estimates and even raising guidance. Shares bounced in pre-market trading. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) comes after the close, and there's optimism following strong results from other chipmakers like Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN). Some analysts following the sector say demand remains strong despite the pandemic.Getting back to our look at the last month, the SPX remains down 17.5% from its Feb. 19 intraday high and off 13% for the year, but it feels like it could be a lot worse from a market point of view. To put it in perspective, at its weakest level last month, the SPX was down 35% from its high point. Just because things seem to be improving a little for stocks doesn't mean anyone can relax. For one thing, analysts continue to chop their earnings estimates for 2020. Looking at the market from that perspective, one could argue that major indices might have come too far, too fast (see more below).On the other hand, some investors seem to be in a &quot;don't fight the Fed&quot; mode. With bond yields still near rock-bottom, there isn't a lot of competition outside of corporate bonds for the dividends many companies continue to pay. All this could favor stocks over the long run, but we'll have to wait and see how it plays out.Crude Revival Sparked Midweek Rally The market's 5% cumulative losses from Monday and Tuesday got cut in half thanks to Wednesday's 2.5% gains in the SPX. Thursday begins with the SPX just below 2800.Information Technology, which suffered a setback earlier in the week, recovered its mojo Wednesday and looked more like the upbeat sector we got to know the first two weeks of April. Semiconductor stocks led the way following solid earnings from TXN, with INTC, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) among the top performers. INTC presents earnings this afternoon, so stay tuned.Crude's comeback helped inject some optimism across the rest of the market, especially in the battered Energy sector. Oil field services firm Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) helped lead the way with double-digit gains. Crude is up this morning as tensions rise in the Gulf between the U.S. and Iran.Communication Services was another top dog on Wednesday as social media stocks got lifted by strong earnings from both Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Snap, Inc. (NYSE: SNAP). Strength spread into the rest of the sector to behemoths like Facebook, INc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), in part because the SNAP earnings helped ease some fears about the chance of advertisers potentially abandoning the social media space. Next week could bring new insight on how advertising is doing online when GOOGL and FB report. Strength in tech stocks helped the Nasdaq (COMP) outperform competing indices yesterday, while small-caps remained the laggards, with the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) climbing the least. That's been a theme for a while now and points to a trend where many investors seem to feel more comfortable climbing aboard big, deep-pocketed companies instead of small-cap or value names in these uncertain times. From Thursday's perspective, it feels like the crazy action in crude that saw front-month futures turn negative Monday for the first time ever might have really spooked the market. It took a couple of days and the May crude contract going off the board to help get through some of that oil-related volatility, and then Wednesday saw a relief rally in stocks based partly on crude settling down. The crude market and the U.S. Energy sector are still in deep water, so to speak, but at least there's a sign of life in the futures market. Prices there remain in contango for crude, meaning the farther-out contracts hold premiums to the nearby June. If that curve starts to flatten, it could spell some trouble as a possible sign of investors losing faith of any sort of &quot;V-shaped&quot; economic recovery.Headlines Still in Driver's Seat A lot of the recent life on Wall Street could reflect hopes of seeing light at the end of the virus tunnel. Talk of some states getting ready to reopen sparked some of that, along with last week's news of positive early results from a treatment study. The way things are, investors could continue to seize on any uplifting news, including this week's expected passage in Congress of more help for small businesses. That's what's made it hard for bears the last few weeks since that atrocious start to April. It's also possible that having the backdrop of earnings helped ease some of the severe volatility of late March. Though earnings have been bad and many companies expect worse in Q2, it feels like a lot that got baked in through last month's selloff. Remember, the market tends to look far ahead, and some analysts say major indices appear to already be pricing in hopes for better earnings in 2021.The Fed, which meets next week, already has rates at basically zero. Bonds remain near recent highs and don't show much sign of coming down. The 10-year yield fell below 0.6% earlier this week but now is back at 0.62%, and tests of the all-time low close not far below that can't be ruled out amid all the caution. Volatility remains elevated at above 40 for the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). This caution reflects in part what most analysts expect will be continued soft data. Today's big number, besides claims, is March new home sales, coming up right after the open. Durable orders bow tomorrow, with analysts expecting a 10% plunge for March, according to market research firm Briefing.com. When you look up from here, it's pretty simple to see some technical resistance for the SPX stretching from around the 50-day moving average near 2830 up to last week's closing high near 2875 (see chart). A punch through that area would potentially set up a challenge of the 200-day moving average just above 3000, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Technical support could rest at the psychological 2750 level, and below that at recent lows recorded this week and last of just below 2730.   CHART OF THE DAY: CHECKING THE RANGE: This one-month chart of the S&P 500 (SPX--candlestick) shows it trending well above the 20-day moving average (yellow line) and closing in on the 50-day moving average (red line), which rests just above Wednesday's close at around 2830. The SPX continues to trade in a range between the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, but multiple tests of support below 2730 this week and last failed, perhaps putting the market into more positive technical territory.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.Multiple Matters: It's looking like many market participants have started to conclude that 2020 earnings will be bad and have turned their attention to 2021, research firm CFRA told investors in a note this week. If forecasters are right about earnings falling in the mid-teens this year, as some now project, that might imply the SPX has room to the downside--assuming you plug in a multiple near the ones the index traded at over the last year or so, say around an 18 price-to-earnings ratio. If investors end up unwilling to assign that kind of multiple, which is historically on the high side, you could argue the market has even more room to fall.This kind of thing that could be making some people nervous about the recent rally, but cold calculations don't account for many other factors that could influence the market. Any headlines about a positive bend in the virus curve or possible progress on treatment always have a chance to re-ignite so-called &quot;animal spirits&quot; we saw last Friday. There's also the chance companies could return in Q2 with improved outlooks. These are some reasons why if you're bearish, it's also too hard to get comfortable. By the way, some would say an 18 multiple is on the high side, but it might make more sense if you consider all the backing the Fed and Congress continue to give the market in the form of low rates, massive balance sheets, and fiscal stimulus. These aren't normal markets, so one could make the argument that normal multiples aren't necessarily required, either.Want a Metal? An under-the-radar economic indicator gained a little ground Wednesday as copper prices jumped from recent lows. Copper is often thought of as a barometer for economic demand because it's a material used in many electronic devices, including phones. Last month, copper futures touched nearly four-year lows near $2 a pound, but have rallied back to nearly $2.30 and were up 2.5% yesterday. That's still way below mid-2018 highs above $3.30 when the economy and stocks were rolling along. The February 2020 peak was above $2.88. Sometimes people ignore commodities outside of gold and crude, but copper prices are worth a look because of what they might hint for the technology sector and electric cars, where copper is also a key component.Seeking Sentiment Sunshine: Markets are all about relationships, and one big relationship is between consumer sentiment and performance. When consumers are pessimistic, so is the market a lot of times. And vice versa, as baseball great Yogi Berra might have said. If sentiment still means anything, it could be worth looking at a poll that came out this week from the Washington Post/University of Maryland. The vast majority of people surveyed said they wouldn't feel comfortable gathering in groups of 10 or more until the end of June at the earliest. That's possibly bad news for anyone who'd been hoping for restaurants and other public places to start attracting customers anytime soon, once they can reopen. The good news, if you can call it that, is 37% of people polled think the economy can recover quickly. OK, 37% isn't huge, but it counts for something that more than a third of the population is hopeful the economy can bounce right back when this is over. Positive sentiment can mean a lot, but we have to remember that with so many having lost their jobs, a quick return of consumer spending along the lines of last year's is probably too much to hope for. For more on this, stay tuned tomorrow for April sentiment data from the University of Michigan.See more from Benzinga  * Little Things Count: After Selloff To Start Week, A Bit of Light Arrives With Positive Earnings  * How Stable Are Their Networks?

2020-05-01,"Weakness has cropped up in a handful of stocks that have been holding up well during the global pandemic. And I think it presents a golden opportunity to purchase at lower prices. Though there are many leading stocks slipping over the past few days, I'm unveiling my top three stocks to buy.The novel coronavirus has torpedoed a number of companies, but some have found themselves benefiting from the fallout. Though today's selections call different industries home, they've all benefited from Covid-19 to one degree or another.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades And, unless you think this week's hit is the beginning of a more ominous rollover, it should be viewed as a chance to deploy bullish-leaning trades into the following three stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  * Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)  * Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)Let's take a look at the charts of each and identify which options strategies you can use to profit. 3 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy Into Weakness: Walmart (WMT)Source: fotomak / Shutterstock.com Short of one or two brief feints lower, Walmart stock has spent the past two months holding steady or rising. It's been a bastion of strength and defensive investors have flocked.I can think of multiple trends arising due to the coronavirus that Walmart is well-positioned to capitalize on -- like hoarding. Or how about all the shuttered restaurants, forcing consumers to stock up on groceries to cook at home.Walmart stock is always a top pick during an economic downturn due to its stable business model and low beta. But it seems like the current recession is tailor-made for the company.The past two days have seen heavy selling pressure for WMT on the heels of an analyst downgrade, citing increasing margin pressures and its &quot;stretched&quot; stock price.From a charting perspective, the stock is returning to a previous breakout area near $121. I think there's a good chance the old ceiling becomes a new floor. It's paid to be a buyer into weakness for Walmart for the past few years, and I see zero reasons why this time is any different.I'm willing to respect the strength of the pullback by recommending a less-bullish type of bet.The Trade: Sell the June $110/$105 bull put spread for around 55 cents. Eli Lilly (LLY)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Though it's taken a back seat during this week's sector rotation, healthcare has hosted some of the best-performing stocks to buy in April. Eli Lilly just notched a new record high and has since put in a perfect four-day retracement. LLY stock boasts a rising 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving average and confirms that buyers are in complete control across all time frames.Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Volume during the retreat was subdued, suggesting garden variety profit taking over a distribution-laced bear raid. Last week's earnings report preceded the jump to all-time highs, so you know investors liked the numbers.Since implied volatility is down to the 23rd percentile of its one-year range, premiums are cheap, and long options plays are the way to go. If you think LLY can make a push toward $170 over the next six weeks, then this trade will deliver.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades The Trade: Buy the June $160/$170 bull call spread for around $2.61 Dominos Pizza (DPZ)The coronavirus has done little in slowing demand for pizza. So says the price of Dominos Pizza stock, which finds itself a stone's throw from another record. We've seen slight profit-taking this week after earnings, but it's been minimal, and DPZ was hot as a pistol before the report and thus deserving of a cool-down.Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade If anything, the pullback makes the stock even more tempting because it's created a lower-risk entry at the rising 20-day moving average. The rich price tag of $360 makes the stock a prime target for options. It allows traders to build a much cheaper and lower risk trade to speculate on further upside.Implied volatility is down big time since the earnings report, so like LLY, long premium plays are probably the way to go here. If you think a push to $400 over the summer is in the cards, then the following spread offers a huge payout.The Trade: Buy the July $390/$400 bull call spread for around $2.90. DPZ options are illiquid, so limit orders are a must here.For a free trial to the best trading community on the planet and Tyler's current home, click here!

2020-05-08,"Biopharma shares have outperformed the broader market year-to-date, giving rise to apprehension over whether a pullback is in the offing. An analyst at BofA Securities said Friday that now is the time to go from defensive to offensive in the sector, as quarantines are winding down in several parts of the globe.The Biopharma Analyst Analyst  Geoff Meacham  shortlisted Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: VRTX), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY), BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) as biopharma stocks where he would put his money to work.The analyst has the following ratings and price targets for the shares:  * Lilly: Buy/$165  * Vertex: Buy/$300  * Bristol-Myers Squibb: Buy/raised the price target from $75 to $80  * BioMarin: Buy/lifted price target from $110 to $120  * Amgen: Buy/price target increased from $265 to $2755 Reasons For BofA's Bullish Disposition BofA is increasingly bullish on the biopharma group due to the following factors, Meacham said:   * Expectations for robust revenue growth of 6% in the second half of 2020 compared to the first-half, which is double that of the S&P 500's revenue growth.  * Reasonable price-earnings for the stocks in the sector.  * Many value-creating events lined up for the second half.  * Lower policy risk stemming from goodwill earned from the COVID-19 pipeline.  * A consistently positive FDA backdrop.Q1 Earnings Get 'A' Grade All of the big biotechs and major pharma companies reported both revenue and adjusted EPS beats in the first quarter, with Lilly and Vertex even raising some parts of their 2020 guidance, Meacham said.Citing slower new starts and forex headwinds, Bristol-Myers Squibb and BioMarin lowered their 2020 revenue guidance, but maintained their EPS guidance, the analyst said. Meacham expressed surprise at Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) lowering their 2020 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, given his belief that oncology or orphan diseases wouldn't be as sensitive to COVID-19 disruption.See also:  Attention Biotech Investors: Mark Your Calendar For These May PDUFA Dates Lilly One of The Higher Quality Stocks In BofA's Coverage Lilly is a source of differentiated growth given its early product cycle and diversified base business, including diabetes, immunology and immunotoxicology and migraine, and an advancing late-stage pipeline of potentially best-in-class or first-in-class therapies, Meacham said.The analyst said he likes Lily's potential for additional earnings growth in 2020-2021 and views Lilly as one of the higher quality stocks in his coverage despite its  higher valuation. The prospects for 2021 look attractive, with selpercatinib potentially launching in non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer by year's end, and tirzepatide approval in 2021 representing a ""step change"" for the diabetes franchise, he said. Consensus For Vertex To Move Higher? Vertex has a richer -- though well-deserved -- valuation, due to its differentiated growth profile, Meacham said.Given that Vertex's commercial execution is largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the analyst said investors will begin to look forward to 2021 sooner than for other companies with more commercial risk.BofA expects consensus estimates to continue to move higher, making Vertex's valuation even more attractive.Bristol-Myers Has Highly Differentiated Growth With an estimated 8% revenue growth and 19% EPS growth in 2021 compared to 5-6% and 12%, respectively, for peers, and with six new launches expected this year, 2020 is shaping up to be a very robust period for Bristol-Myers despite the ongoing COVID-19 headwinds, Meacham said. The analyst said the company's growth looks highly differentiated.An increasingly diversified product mix and beatable launch expectations position the company for meaningful upside to consolidated P&L, with improving synergies, he said. BioMarin's 'Game-Changing' Late-Stage Pipeline BioMarin's late-stage pipeline in valrox and vosoritide have improved its growth outlook, Meacham said.The analyst termed the company's late-stage pipeline as ""game-changing."" The second-half launch of Roctavian is the most important catalyst for the company this year, with the product likely to accelerate the company's already above-average growth profile, he said. ""We see BioMarin as one of the higher quality names in our coverage universe given its clean growth story and it remains our SMid cap top pick."" Amgen Looks To New Product Growth To Compensate For Legacy Product Erosion The long-term outlook for Amgen's Otezla is improving given the recently announced Phase 3 data for mild-to-moderate psoriasis, Meacham said.The company rapidly refocused its story from legacy product erosion to new product growth with the acquisition of Otezla from the Bristol/Celgene deal, the analyst said. ""Since then Amgen's growth profile has only improved, led by an expanded addressable market for Otezla, outperforming Amgen Biosimilars and Evenity franchises, aggressive formulary negotiation for Aimovig, and an exciting pipeline in AMG 510 and tezepelumab looking to contribute as soon as 2021.""

2020-05-08,"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said Friday it is testing Gilead Sciences Inc.'s  remdesivir in combination with Eli Lilly & Co.'s  rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant in COVID-19 patients as part of the next phase of the randomized, controlled clinical trial that led to the authorization of remdesivir. This study will enroll 1,000 people at more than 100 sites in the U.S. and abroad, to &quot;examine if adding an anti-inflammatory agent to the remdesivir regimen can provide additional benefit for patients,&quot; NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a statement. The topline results from the remdesivir trial helped make up the basis of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) emergency use authorization for the drug last week. A number of medicines that have been previously approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis have been proposed as possible COVID-19 treatments, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.  and Sanofi's  Kevzara and Roche Holding AG's  Actemra. Olumiant, which was developed by Incyte Corp.  and is licensed to Lilly, brought in $427 million in sales in 2019 for the Indianapolis-based drugmaker. Only two types of therapies - remdesivir and hydroxycholorquine and chlorquine - are authorized by the FDA as COVID-19 treatments. Year-to-date, Gilead's stock has gained 18.6%, while shares of Lilly are up 16.6%. The S&P 500  is down 10.8%.",Government to test remdesivir with Lilly drug in COVID-19 patients

This is true across all economic sectors, and today we'll apply this concept to companies in the pharmaceutical industry and their big stock charts.Source: Shutterstock Don't get the wrong idea. One good earnings report doesn't mean that a company's stock shares will necessarily go up. It's important to examine the price action in addition to the fundamentals, and that's where stock charts are helpful.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now Today's big stock charts will feature names in the pharmaceutical market that recently posted earnings and/or revenue data that beat expectations. Hopefully, the charts can guide us as we digest the good news and add it to our knowledge base as informed traders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Source: Provided by Finviz Owners of Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock were delighted to hear that the company recently beat Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations. With revenue of $10.8 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72, Bristol-Myers Squibb unquestionably had an amazing quarter.With the earnings report behind us, what does the future hold for BMY stock?  * Thursday's candlestick for BMY stock looks big and red. However, it was really basically a flat day. The volume has been flat lately as well, so we can assert that the situation is neutral from that perspective.  * The BMY stock price is above the 20-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages, which is bullish. However, the price is not far above the 20-day moving average, so the bulls shouldn't be complacent now.  * There is strong resistance at the $67.50 level as a double-top formation occurred there. So, that's not a bad place to take profits. Eli Lilly (LLY)Source: Provided by Finviz Much like Bristol-Myers Squibb, drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) had an outstanding first quarter. The company posted quarterly of $5.9 billion, signifying a 15% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Moreover, Eli Lilly reported quarterly net income of $1.5 billion, which is also impressive.Have LLY stock traders priced these positive developments into the share price?  * Unlike with BMY stock, Thursday's big red candlestick really does indicate a strongly bearish move for the day. The daily trading volume has been declining, though, so there might not be much conviction behind the selling.  * BMY stock is still above the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Yet, it is struggling with the 20-day moving average, so watch that line closely.  * The large broadening channel indicates that the price action is widening in both vertical directions. A breakout above the upper resistance line of the channel would be a major victory for the bulls. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)Source: Provided by Finviz Yet another drug manufacturer with an excellent first-quarter earnings result is GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). Quarterly core earnings of $0.93 per American depositary share blew the consensus estimate of $0.79 out of the water.That's all fine and good, but will the GSK stock chart provide us with any clues as to how we should trade it now?  * The rebound in GSK stock appears to be petering out lately. The bulls will need to prove that they're not exhausted as otherwise the bears could regain control soon.  * There's a serious battle going on around the three major moving averages on the GSK stock chart. Thursday's candlestick is sitting right on top of the 20-day moving average. Moreover, it's sandwiched between the 50- and 200-day moving averages. In time we'll know whether the bulls or the bears will prevail here.  * We can see a very wide channel that's slanting downwards. However, the GSK stock price is near the upper boundary of the channel and could be ready to break above it soon.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Retevmo was approved under the FDA's Accelerated Approval regulations based on the LIBRETTO-001 Phase 1/2 trial's endpoints of objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).

The $161.20 average price target indicates upside potential of 5% in the coming 12 months.

2020-05-21,"When it comes to investing in dividend stocks, it's patience that results in the real payday for shareholders.The most obvious measure of a company's income potential, its dividend yield, is calculated on an annualized basis using 12 months of distributions. That typically is spread across four payments, with one dividend paid out each quarter, meaning you can hold a stock for about 12 weeks without seeing a penny in dividends if you wind up selling at an inopportune time.Beyond the simple practicalities of making sure you're eligible for the next dividend, the real reason patience pays for income investors is the dramatic lift dividends provide over the very long term. Consider that the S&P; 500 Index of large U.S. stocks is up 167% since the beginning of 2010. However, if you account for the dividends paid out by the constituent stocks in this benchmark and reinvest that cash back into the index, your return jumps to more than 230% over the past 10 years or so!If this is the performance that dividends can deliver across a decade, imagine what happens when you account for a century or more of payouts.These 13 dividend stocks have provided just that: a rich history of uninterrupted cash distributions to shareholders stretching back at least 100 years.

2020-05-21,"(Bloomberg) -- The air has suddenly come out of a rally in a biotech firm that’s been working with China’s military to develop a coronavirus vaccine.CanSino Biologics Inc. tumbled as much as 23% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday afternoon, erasing an earlier 16% surge. The stock had almost tripled since announcing on March 4 it was in the process of developing a vaccine. The rally accelerated after the company said on Monday Canada approved its clinical trial application for a vaccine.The sudden reversal underscores the risks in chasing the most popular theme this year -- vaccine producers. Moderna Inc. slumped from a record in New York trading earlier in the week as investors digested early data from a small trial of the company’s coronavirus vaccine, as well as a $1.3 billion stock sale.Some traders said a series of large transactions may have triggered the selloff in CanSino, with at least 17 trades comprising more than 10,000 shares each changing hands in the afternoon. Eli Lilly & Co. is the company’s biggest shareholder with a 15.5% stake, according to an April filing.The firm listed in Hong Kong in March last year, raising $160 million in a heavily oversubscribed initial public offering. It developed the first Ebola vaccine approved in China for emergency use and national stockpile, it said at at the time. The company has a current market value of $6.1 billion.CanSino made no revenue in 2019, according to a March exchange filing. Its operating loss was about 200 million yuan ($28 million) last year.Other biotech firms have rallied in Hong Kong as the coronavirus spread across the globe. Viva Biotech Holdings has jumped 65% this month, while Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co. has surged to a record. Innovent Biologics Inc. slumped nearly 10% on Thursday after jumping almost 80% since mid-March.CanSino didn’t immediately reply to emails sent to its investor relations and press departments seeking comment on the stock move. An external representative said she couldn’t immediately comment on behalf of the company.“No one knows how much CanSino is worth,” Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Hong Kong, said before the afternoon plunge. “People are making bets on the success of its vaccine, but the trial is just in stage two and there is possibility for it to fail.”CanSino shares were last down 14%, ending a 10-day winning streak. Its 14-day relative strength reached 89 on Thursday morning before the rally reversed. More than 70 indicates sentiment is overheated on a stock.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",CanSino’s 23% Stock Slump Shows Perils of Chasing Vaccine Hype

The results showed that while both antibodies demonstrated “substantial” neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2, CB6 exhibited “superior” neutralizing activities.“The fact that CB6 can protect rhesus monkeys from COVID-19 infection suggests a potential for prophylactic use in humans,” said Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We are moving as quickly as possible to test such a protective effect in patients at risk for COVID-19.”As part of the collaboration, Lilly will receive an exclusive license to conduct clinical development, manufacturing and distribution of products outside of Greater China.

2020-06-01,"Drugmaker Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) started a human study of a potential antibody treatment for COVID-19 patients, and CEO David Ricks said on Fox Business that it is the first of its kind.Lilly's Brand New Medicine Eli Lilly's medicine to treat COVID-19 patients is the first of its kind, as it consists of antibodies found in a recovered patient's cells. In contrast, other drugs and therapies are merely ""repurposed"" from other uses, Ricks said.Eli Lilly scientists collaborated with Canada-based AbCellera to engineer a treatment out of the ""very best one or two"" antibodies it can find out of millions of cells, the CEO said. The initial study will consist of less than 40 patients, and results are expected in a ""couple of weeks,"" he said. Lilly's Production Timeline Eli Lilly has already started the process of ramping up production for its hopeful therapy despite it being in the early stages of testing, Ricks said.The company expects to produce 100,000 or more doses that will be available in the fall, the CEO said.During the pandemic's peak, there were around 60,000 people in a hospital in the U.S., so 100,000 could treat every person, he said.Important Treatment Before Vaccine Eli Lilly wants to study how its medicine can be used to treat people to avoid the need of going to a hospital in the first place as part of an ambulatory treatment study.The company also wants to explore later on in the summer months how its treatment can be used among those most at risk and vulnerable.""This is an important bridge therapy until a vaccination could arrive and even perhaps vaccination this kind of therapy could find an important use,"" the CEO said.Lilly shares were trading down slightly at $152.86 at the time of publication Monday.Related Links:Moderna Doses First Participants In Phase 2 Study Of Coronavirus Vaccine53% Of Americans 'Very Likely' To Get Coronavirus Vaccine, Rasmussen ReportsEli Lilly CEO David Ricks.

2020-06-01,"Eli Lilly (LLY) has today announced patients have been dosed in the world’s first study of a potential antibody treatment designed to fight COVID-19.This investigational medicine, referred to as LY-CoV555, is the first to emerge from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.Lilly scientists developed the antibody in just three months after AbCellera and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) identified it from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. LY-CoV555 is the first potential new medicine specifically designed to attack SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The first patients in the study were dosed at major medical centers in the U.S., including NYU Grossman School of Medicine and Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. Study J2W-MC-PYAA is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1 trial that aims to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of LY-CoV555 following a single dose administered to participants hospitalized for COVID-19.“Antibody therapies such as LY-CoV555 may have potential for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and may be particularly important for groups hardest hit by the disease such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems,” said Daniel Skovronsky, chief scientific officer of Lilly Research Laboratories.“Later this month, we will review the results of this first human study and intend to initiate broader efficacy trials.

2020-06-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As companies and countries pour money into the effort to develop Covid-19 vaccines, timelines keep getting more ambitious and dates for delivering a workable immunization against the virus keep moving up. Yet even with companies such as Moderna Therapeutics Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc signaling rapid progress and already enrolling patients in mid-stage trials, it would be quite a feat if we had a stockpile of proven doses by year's end. That’s a best-case scenario. A longer wait is more likely, and that may seem discouraging. The good news is, there is a batch of treatments in development with a chance of accelerated approval, and they can provide needed relief in the interim.Dozens of approaches could serve as a valuable bridge, from repurposed drugs to bespoke antibody cocktails. None can replace the value of a vaccine in getting the world back to normal, but the availability of more treatment options for sick patients could help to increase the chances of a faster and fuller recovery, and reduce the lethality of the disease. Two of the most familiar treatments options — the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir — have recently run into issues over safety and degree of efficacy, but there are plenty more in the pipeline.When it comes to development, the pathway for treatments is generally smoother than the one for vaccines, which can run into bottlenecks that are fundamentally difficult to break. For one, the fact that innoculations are aimed at healthy individuals means there is a higher safety bar. And the large trials necessary for trying out vaccines would have to occur in places where Covid-19 is spreading substantially to get the random exposure required to test them properly. With multiple candidates in development and ongoing precautions to avoid infection, getting robust data fast may be an issue. Finding volunteers is also an issue for treatment trials, as case counts level off. Still, many outcomes for infected patients can be determined comparatively rapidly. Along with a higher tolerance for side effects in individuals at possible near-term risk of dying, this permits smaller and faster tests.There are a few significant groups of possible treatments. The first involves repurposing existing drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. Because these types of medicines were originally designed to treat other conditions, they are less likely to produce a dramatic effect. However, if one is useful, it can be deployed quickly.One category within this group doesn't aim at the virus, but the out-of-control immune response it can cause. Roche Holding AG's arthritis drug Actemra has shown some early promise and is in larger trials. Researchers plan to test a variety of other medicines that target inflammation. If successful, they could provide several avenues to improved outcomes in critically ill patients. Another idea? Drug cocktails. That's the thought behind a recently started trial combining remdesivir and Actemra. Several other repurposed combinations, existing flu drugs, and a host of other medicines have opportunities to prove their worth.A second category of drug treatments involves a different type of recycling: using the blood of recovered individuals. People who survive Covid-19 develop antibodies against the virus and their donated plasma is already part of treatment regimens for sick patients around the world. Early results look promising, but they need confirmation from randomized trials that are now under way. Scale and variability issues may prevent convalescent plasma from treating millions, so it's worth boosting identification and collection efforts now even if the benefits of this type of treatment aren’t yet fully determined. A concentrated version under development by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. also could prove useful.A related third group of medicines centers on artificially produced antibodies, which could be more effective and available than natural counterparts. Companies including Eli Lilly & Co., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Vir Biotechnology Inc. are pursuing this approach. Lilly announced the start of its first trial Monday. Regeneron, which created a successful antibody cocktail for an Ebola epidemic, is right behind. While there's no guarantee of success, these treatments have a better chance of autumn availability than even the fastest vaccines. It would take additional trials to confirm, but this category has particular value as a bridge because it can function as both treatment and temporary protection.Unless making and deploying hundreds of millions of inoculations is a lot easier than I expect and the fastest vaccines durably prevent both infection and transmission — a big ask for warp-speed efforts — Covid-19 may be around in diminished form for a while to come. That means treatments will remain valuable even after vaccines arrive.

2020-06-08,"Junshi Biosciences has announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase I clinical study of JS016 in China. JS016 is the first SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody to enter clinical trials in China.Junshi is collaborating with Eli Lilly (LLY) to co-develop JS016 globally, with Junshi leading clinical development in China and Lilly leading clinical development in the rest of the world.The trial is a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study to evaluate JS016 in healthy subjects. If Phase 1 results show the antibody can be safely administered, the company intends to move to the next phase of testing to study the antibody’s ability to prevent and treat Covid-19.According to Junshi, previous clinical trials for Ebola have shown that monoclonal neutralizing antibodies can substantially improve clinical symptoms and reduce the mortality of those infected.In this case, the fully human monoclonal antibody was identified by screening blood samples of patients who recovered from Covid-19. A preclinical study showed that JS016 expresses extremely high specific affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, blocking the virus from invading host cells.A recent publication in Nature also detailed the findings from a study showing JS016 protected rhesus monkeys from Covid-19 infection.Professor Zhang Wenhong from Huashan Hospital said: “Neutralizing antibodies can precisely target the SARS-CoV-2 virus which may quickly prevent the virus from replicating in the human body. We hope to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of JS016 in Phase I and provide supporting data for additional clinical trials.”Shares in LLY are currently trading up 14% year-to-date, and analysts have a cautiously optimistic take on the stock’s outlook. With 5 recent buy ratings and 4 hold ratings, Eli Lilly shows a Moderate Buy Street consensus.

(See Eli Lilly stock analysis on TipRanks).“Lilly’s current valuation appears stretched to us relative to its large cap biopharma peers so we maintain our Neutral rating, but we raise our price target to $155 (from $148) and acknowledge current investor bias towards safer, higher quality names will likely continue to support the stock” he explained.Related News:  Teva Wins Court Ruling Against Opiant, Emergent Bio On Narcan Nasal Spray  5 Promising Covid-19 Vaccines Picked For Trump’s Operation Warp Speed  Think Novavax Has Surged Enough for Now?

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Unlike many people on Twitter or CNBC, the co-hosts of the show actually reveal their losing trades. The reason being is that we believe it's more important to learn how to manage losing trades than winning trades since one catastrophic loss can take a trader out of the game for good.With that being said, we were dead wrong about how to trade Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) off today's open.The News: Before the open, Eli Lilly made a trio of positive announcements regarding drugs in its pipeline:  * The FDA had approved Lilly's new rapid-acting insulin, Lyumjev.  * Verzenio significantly reduced the risk of cancer returning in people with early and high-risk breast cancer.  * Results from the OVERCOME study show that greater than 30% of people living with migraines take recommended prescription medication, emphasizing the need to find appropriate treatments.The Pre-Market Call: Off the headline, the issue immediately bolted from its previous day close of $141.42 to $155.25 and later on to $157.50 before the opening bell. Both hosts viewed the move as overdone based on the news and were looking to short the opening print.  Dennis Dick put his words into action: &quot;I will short it.&quot;The End Result: Eli Lilly opened the regular session at $156.12, where Dick was executed on his short position. For a brief moment, he felt comfortable with the trade as within seconds, it sprinted down to $155.But when it began to bounce hard off that level, Dick knew he was in trouble. He stated when doing these types of risky trades, &quot;you want instant gratification and when you do not get a lot of it, it is time to exit.&quot;At that point, Dick's mental stop was as close to the opening print ($156.12) as possible, and he was in full scrambling mode.&quot;Lucky for me, I was executed at $156.07 on my $156.12 order,&quot; he said. &quot;If I had missed that, I would have been dead meat.&quot;Despite a roller-coaster day in the markets, the issue is higher by $25 (or 17.7%) and $165.79 stands as the high for the session at the time of publication.The full discussion on the issue can be found here:See more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: American Airlines  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Hertz  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Wells Fargo(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 3.08%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Eli Lilly Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 33.44 of the General Drug Manufacturers industry.

An intravenous version of the drug received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in May.

O'Day also said Gilead plans to test whether remdesivir can help patients before they become severely ill, in vulnerable patient populations like children and pregnant women, and in combination with other therapies, including Eli Lilly & Co.  and Incyte Corp.'s  Olumiant and Roche Holdings'  Actemra. &quot;We have been keen to explore how remdesivir might work when combined with anti-inflammatory agents, particularly in the most severely ill patients,&quot; he wrote.

Chi-Med will collaborate with Lilly in commercializing Elunate across China.“After many years of constructive and successful collaboration, Lilly and Chi-Med believe that this agreement now establishes the optimal structure that will allow us to leverage the full resources of both companies to maximize the potential of Elunate in China” commented Christian Hogg, CEO of Chi-Med and Julio Gay-Ger, President of Lilly China.Starting October 1, 2020, Chi-Med will be responsible, through its commercial team in oncology of over 320 staff, for the development and execution of all on-the-ground medical detailing, promotion and local and regional marketing activities in China for Elunate.Lilly and Chi-Med will continue to collaborate in the formulation and execution of national marketing strategy and events in China for Elunate, the companies said.Chi-Med and Lilly will share gross profits linked to sales target performance.

2020-07-31,"Shares of Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) fell 5.4% on Thursday after the drugmaker disappointed its investors with lower-than-expected 2Q sales. Its revenues of $5.5 billion declined 2.4% year-over-year and fell short of the analysts’ estimates of about $5.8 billion.The pharma giant witnessed decreased buying and a delay in new patient prescription trends, which took a toll on its revenues, offsetting the gain from product stocking in the first quarter.However, increased demand for its diabetes drug, Trulicity, helped Lilly to post upbeat earnings of $1.89 per share in 2Q, as compared to the analysts’ estimates of $1.56 per share.Eli Lilly also raised its full-year earnings forecast to $7.20 - $7.40 per share, as compared to the prior earnings range of $6.70 - $6.90 per share.Lilly’s CEO David A. Ricks stated that “the COVID-19 pandemic continues to strain healthcare systems around the world and has decreased new patient starts for some of Lilly's medicines.” However, he also mentioned that “We expect growth in new prescription volume for our key growth products in the second half of 2020, and we remain confident in our outlook for the year.”Analyst Vamil Divan of Mizuho Securities maintained his Buy rating with a price target of $164 (7.2% upside potential). Divan said, &quot;we believe more important than the results from a single quarter during this volatile time is news that their drug Jardiance met the primary endpoint in a large outcomes study of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, opening up a large new market opportunity for the product and potentially driving further upside in the shares.&quot;Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The average price target of $172.86 implies an upside potential of about 13%.

I trust the parents more than anyone,” Cuomo said. “If they don’t have a good plan for reopening, no kids are going to come and no teachers are going to come. So then you have no reopening.”With just 545 positive results out of 51,839 tests conducted, New York’s positivity rate hit 1.05% on Aug. 2, Cuomo said.

Wear a mask if you’re asked to wear a mask.”Asked to comment on White House coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx’s comments that the U.S. is in a new phase, Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, said his interpretation is that the statement is intended as a reminder that the disease hasn’t gone away and states need to re-evaluate the measures they’re taking.“It’s not our job to be telling the U.S. what it should be doing at a sub-national level,” Ryan said. The way states are taking measures under the guidance of national experts “seems to be the right path,” he said. Many countries need to review their approach in fighting Covid as the disease spreads further and flare-ups occur in countries that had previously stemmed the rate of new infections, he said. “This is going to require a reset in many countries.”WHO Says Studies Put Mortality Rate at 0.6% (10 a.m. NY)Several studies estimate the mortality rate of the novel coronavirus at 0.6%, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s top epidemiologist on Covid. “That may not sound like a lot, but it is quite high,” she said. The death rate is about 1 in 200 compared with one in 10,000 or 100,000 in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, according to Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program.Eli Lilly Starts Testing Drug in Nursing Homes (6:45 a.m. NY)Eli Lilly & Co. will begin testing its Covid-19 antibody drug in nursing homes in the U.S., a treatment with potential to protect vulnerable groups that vaccines may not cover.

The digitization of information has accelerated in just past months as various countries try to trace people to curb Covid-19, Tsai said at the virtual launch event of the Singapore FinTech Festival.Portugal in Talks With U.K. to Lift Quarantine Rule (6:02 a.m. NY)Portugal is in talks with the British government to try to lift a rule that requires anyone arriving in England from the southern European country to self-isolate for two weeks. Rita Marques, Portugal’s secretary of state for tourism, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday that she wasn’t sure when the U.K. would revise its quarantine rule even as the coronavirus situation in the country continues to evolve positively.

2020-08-03,"Eli Lilly has announced the initiation of BLAZE-2, a Phase 3 trial studying LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities in the US.LY-CoV555, the lead antibody from Lilly’s (LLY) collaboration with AbCellera, is a neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 among residents of long-term care facilities combined with the higher mortality rate for the elderly creates the urgent need for therapies to prevent COVID-19 in this vulnerable population.“COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on nursing home residents. We’re working as fast as we can to create medicines that might stop the spread of the virus to these vulnerable individuals” commented Daniel Skovronsky, of Lilly Research Laboratories. “While it’s not easy to conduct clinical trials in this setting, we’re taking on the challenge in an effort to help those who need us the most” he added.LLY is carrying out the first-of-its-kind COVID-19 trial with NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as the COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) and several long-term care facility networks.The study will enroll residents and staff who live or work at facilities that have had a recently diagnosed case of COVID-19 and who are now at a high risk of exposure. It will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, testing whether a single dose of LY-CoV555 reduces the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 4 weeks, as well as complications of COVID-19 through 8 weeks. It is expected to enroll up to 2,400 participants.To carry out the trial, Lilly has created customized mobile research units to support the on-site study and will deploy additional staff at the facilities.Lilly has successfully completed dosing of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and long-term follow-up is ongoing. BLAZE-1, a Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting, is ongoing.  Based on current trends, enrollment is estimated to be completed in September, with initial data readout soon after followed by full data in Q4. LY-CoV555 has been well tolerated at all doses tested and no drug-related severe adverse events (SAEs) have been observed to date, the company says.Despite trials still ongoing, LLY is already engaging in large-scale manufacturing of this potential therapy. It is aiming to have over 100,000 doses available by the end of the year should LY-CoV555 prove to be a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19.Overall LLY scores a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus from the Street. That’s with an average analyst price target of $173 (15% upside potential). Shares are up 14% year-to-date.Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan has just reiterated his Hold rating on the stock with a $164 price target after Eli Lilly reported 2Q 2020 results that missed on the topline, but beat handily on the bottom line. LLY also significantly raised their FY 2020 EPS guidance, driven mainly by increased Other Income, lower expenses and a lower tax rate.“Lilly’s 2Q20 revenue of $5.50B was well below our $5.84Bn estimate and Consensus at $5.76Bn, with the company seeing a $500M headwind from the COVID-19 pandemic (half mainly due to runoff of inventory stocking from 1Q20 while the other half was due to delayed new prescription trends) and increased pricing pressures” he commented.

LY-CoV555, the lead antibody from Lilly's collaboration with AbCellera, is a neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Researchers will evaluate whether the therapy is efficacious in 300 people who have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19. Lilly is developing the therapy in partnership with the privately held Abcellera Biologics. Patients in the trial will be given LY-CoV555 or placebo, and all patients will receive the standard of care, which includes Gilead Sciences Inc.'s  remdesivir. The Food and Drug Administration granted remdesivir an emergency use authorization in May as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.

2020-08-10,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and Innovent Biologics have announced encouraging interim analysis data from ORIENT-11 at the virtual IASLC World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) 2020.The randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial of 397 patients assessed TYVYT (sintilimab injection) with ALIMTA (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsqNSCLC) without sensitive EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement.Based on interim analysis by an independent committee, the treatment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo, which met the pre-defined efficacy criteria.After a median follow up of 8.9 months, the median PFS of the sintilimab combination and the placebo combination assessed by the Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC) was 8.9 months and 5.0 months, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached in both groups, but OS showed an improvement favoring the sintilimab combination. Confirmed objective response rate was improved from 29.8% to 51.9%, and the sintilimab combination showed a shorter time to response (1.51 months vs 2.63 months for the placebo combination).The safety profile was consistent with previously reported sintilimab studies, and no new safety signals were identified.National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China has accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for this indication.Dr. Li Wang, Senior VP of Lilly China, stated: “With these encouraging results of ORIENT-11, sintilimab may soon be able to expand its indication to the first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC. We look forward to its potential approval in China, with the goal of helping more patients with lung cancer and giving these patients and their families hope of a longer life.”Indeed, lung cancer is a malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality in China. NSCLC accounts for about 80 to 85% of lung cancer. About 70% of NSCLC in China is the nonsquamous subtype and 50% of nsqNSCLC is without sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. These patients do not respond well to targeted therapy and there are limited treatment options available to them.TYVYT (sintilimab injection) is being jointly developed in China by Innovent and Lilly, and has already been granted marketing approval for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after systemic chemotherapy. It is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells.Shares in LLY are up 16% year-to-date and analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock’s outlook. That’s alongside a $173 average analyst price target (13% upside potential).“We see Lilly as a best-in-class story but have remained Neutral on the stock given the premium multiple at which it has been trading” commented Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan on August 3, after the company delivered an ‘admittedly messy 2Q20.’ Results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but boosted by higher Other Income, lower expenses and a lower tax rate.Divan has a $164 price target on LLY, but notes that he could become more constructive on the stock ahead of upcoming catalysts if the current weakness persists.

2020-08-12,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and Innovent Biologics have announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China has accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for TYVYT (sintilimab injection) in combination with Gemzar (gemcitabine) and platinum as first-line therapy in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (squamous NSCLC).Recently, the NMPA accepted sNDA for TYVYT (sintilimab injection) as first-line therapy in non-squamous NSCLC on Apr 23, 2020.The sNDA was based on the analysis of a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study (ORIENT-12) of 357 patients, which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo. The safety profile was also consistent with previously reported sintilimab studies.Professor Caicun Zhou, Head of Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, stated: “We are pleased to see that sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy has met predefined primary endpoint in ORIENT-12 study. There still exists large unmet medical needs in squamous NSCLC patients. Globally, ORIENT-12 has demonstrated for the first time survival benefit by treatment with PD-1 inhibitor in combination with gemcitabine and platinum in first-line squamous NSCLC.”Lung cancer is a malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality in China. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnosis- and about 35% of patients with NSCLC in China are of squamous subtype without driver genes.TYVYT (sintilimab injection), is being jointly developed in China by Lilly and Innovent, and has already been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy.It is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells.Shares in LLY are up 15% year-to-date and analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock’s outlook.

2020-08-21,"Over the past five years, it's been Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) that's been the best large-cap pharmaceutical play. Including dividends, LLY stock has a little better than doubled investors' money.Source: luchschenF / Shutterstock.com Among pharma stocks with a market cap over $100 billion, only Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) comes close. Better-covered names like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) have lagged badly, with total returns of 30% and 14%, respectively.Obviously, the important question at the moment is whether that outperformance will continue. And I believe it will. Lilly has one of the best portfolios in the entire industry. Valuation is somewhat expensive by sector standards, but reasonable given growth potential. And there's a potential play on the novel coronavirus as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCertainly, it's not guaranteed that LLY stock will be the winner over the next five years, as it's been over the last five. But there's certainly a good chance, and a solid bull case to stick with Lilly even after an impressive run. A Strong PortfolioWhat stands out when looking at Eli Lilly is how strong the current products are. That's true not just in the sense of the market share of the company's various products, but in the potential growth in those markets.For instance, Lilly is a clear leader in diabetes, a condition which unfortunately is likely to both grow and see more diagnoses going forward. The company's top two drugs in 2019 (Trulicity and Humalog) both treat the condition; so does Jardiance, Lilly's eighth-biggest seller. The portfolio expanded in Q2 with the launch of Lyumjev.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns NowLilly also has a strong franchise in cancer. Alimta and Cyramza combined for nearly $3 billion in revenue last year. LLY stock soared last year on strong results for Verzenio in preventing recurrence of breast cancer. Here, too, a Q2 launch adds to the opportunity, with Retevmo approved to treat lung and thyroid cancers.Like most diversified pharma companies, Lilly does have drugs whose sales are fading. Erectile dysfunction drug Cialis, for instance, is facing generic competition. But overall, this is one of the stronger portfolios in the space. And that's obviously a key reason why LLY stock has been a winner in recent years. A Covid-19 Play?Despite that strength, Eli Lilly likely hasn't been on the minds of investors looking for a Covid-19 play. J&J and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) garnered the headlines among Big Pharma names. Among early-stage players, the likes of Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Inovio (NASDAQ:INO), among many, many others, attracted investor attention and optimism.But Lilly has irons in the fire itself. It's created partnerships for development of both a vaccine and a treatment. And it's launched a Phase III study of an arthritis drug for potential use with hospitalized victims of Covid-19.To be sure, given a roughly $150 billion market capitalization, success on the Covid-19 front won't move LLY stock the way it would INO or even MRNA. But investors have bid up AZN, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) and other large-cap names on coronavirus hopes. Lilly likely deserves at least the same boost. Valuation Concerns for LLY StockMeanwhile, valuation seems reasonable. LLY trades at 21x the midpoint of this year's adjusted earnings per share guidance, and about 19x analyst estimates for next year.It's worth noting that those numbers aren't as cheap as they seem. Pharma stocks in general merit lower multiples, owing to the fact that product lifespans can be relatively short. Indeed, 19x forward EPS is expensive relative to peers.After all, JNJ trades at less than 17x. Merck (NYSE:MRK) is at just 13x, PFE 11x, and Bristol-Myers at a seemingly cheap 8.5x. We've already seen one analyst recently downgrade LLY stock based on valuation, and the average Street price target suggests about a 10% return (including the dividend) over the next 12 months.But I'd suggest investors consider the context of the valuation. Yes, LLY is more expensive than peers. But the strength in the diabetes and cancer franchises suggests it probably should be. Many of those large-cap peers have significant concerns. Even Bristol-Myers Squibb, which I've recommended in the past (and still like), faces a looming &quot;patent cliff&quot; for its revlimid and has seen disappointing results from cancer drug Opdivo.Meanwhile, 10% returns for a defensive stock are nothing to sneeze at. That's doubly true at a time when the 10-year Treasury bond yields less than 1%.Finally, it's worth noting that investors in this market repeatedly have been rewarded for paying up for quality. The five-year return in LLY stock is another example of that trend. As long as that trend holds, investors in LLY stock should be just fine.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-08-31,"The pharmaceutical industry is considered to be more resilient in difficult economic times compared to other industries. However, this time around, the coronavirus-led lockdowns and social distancing restrictions resulted in fewer doctor visits and prescriptions filled, which in turn hurt pharma companies' drug sales. The cancellation and deferral of elective procedures also had an adverse impact on several companies in the healthcare space.We will analyze the recent performance of two leading pharma companies, Merck and Eli Lilly, using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, to see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.Merck (MRK)The COVID-19 pandemic put a $1.6 billion dent on Merck’s second-quarter sales, leading to a 7.6% decline in overall sales to $10.9 billion. Adjusted EPS grew over 5% to $1.37 despite weak sales due to higher unrealized gains on securities (mainly from investments in Moderna and MGM) and a lower tax rate. What's more, the company beat analysts’ sales and earnings expectations and raised its full-year guidance.Merck’s blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda delivered sales of $3.39 billion in the second quarter, reflecting 29% growth year-on-year. The cancer drug generated sales of over $11 billion for Merck in 2019. On Aug. 24, Keytruda won two new approvals from the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency to treat a type of esophageal cancer and for use in a six-week dosing schedule.In addition, Merck is spinning off its women’s health, biosimilars and legacy products business into a company called Organon & Co. The spin-off, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021, will help Merck focus on key growth areas like Keytruda and other cancer drugs, vaccines and animal health. In total, Merck has a pipeline, which includes 24 phase 3 trials.On the COVID-19 front, Merck announced two vaccine development efforts in the second quarter. One vaccine development is in collaboration with IAVI (International AIDS Vaccine Initiative) and the other through the June acquisition of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience. Merck has also teamed up with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop an oral antiviral candidate for COVID-19. This compound is in a Phase 2 clinical trial.Following second-quarter results, Mizuho Securities analyst Mara Goldstein reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $100 price target. Highlighting the company’s efforts in developing a COVID-19 treatment, the analyst said, “MRK's vaccine efforts are becoming more visible and this, in our view, is upside.”Goldstein added, “MRK's Covid-19 drugs lag competitors but the company is positioning itself with multiple vaccines that may address a variety of patient populations, including older more vulnerable populations with cardiovascular disease.” (See MRK stock analysis on TipRanks)The Street has a Moderate Buy analyst consensus for Merck based on 8 Buys, 3 Holds and no Sells. The stock has declined 5.8% so far in 2020. Looking ahead, the average analyst price target of $94.75 indicates upside potential of about 11% over the next 12-months.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly is considered one of the leading players in the diabetes space with drugs like Trulicity, Humalog, Humulin, and Basaglar. Notably, Trulicity alone contributed over $4 billion to sales in 2019. The drugmaker's results in the first quarter benefited from patients and consumers stockpiling on their products amid the pandemic lockdown. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly’s second-quarter revenue lagged analysts’ forecast and declined 2.4% Y/Y to $5.50 billion.Aside from Trulicity, which delivered revenue of $1.23 billion (20% Y/Y growth), other drugs that performed well in the second quarter included Taltz, Jardiance, Cyramza, Verzenio, Olumiant, Emgality and Tyvyt. Second-quarter adjusted EPS was ahead of the Street consensus and rose 26% to $1.89 driven by higher other income from favorable mark-to-market adjustments on investment securities.Eli Lilly raised its full-year EPS guidance citing &quot;expectations of lower marketing, selling and administrative expenses, higher other income and a lower effective tax rate&quot;. However, the company maintained its revenue outlook.As of the end of July, Eli Lilly’s pipeline included 18 drugs in Phase 3 trials. Beyond the company’s strong diabetes portfolio, the company is gaining traction in oncology. Cancer drugs Alimta and Cyramza contributed $2.1 billion and $925 million respectively to sales last year.In June, the company announced positive Phase 3 data for Verzenio, an early breast cancer treatment, which will open up a new growth market for the drug. Eli Lilly plans to submit the data to regulatory authorities by the end of this year. Verzenio is already approved for metastatic breast cancer and advanced breast cancer. Its sales increased 56% in the second quarter to about $209 million.On Aug. 18, Eli Lilly announced the global expansion of its collaboration with Innovent Biologics for immuno-oncology drug Tyvyt. The two companies currently co-commercialize the drug in China. The extended alliance will give the drugmaker an exclusive license to Tyvyt in markets outside of China.Eli Lilly’s COVID-19 efforts include two potential antibodies called LY-CoV555 (began Phase 3 trial in early August) and JS016, as well as the rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant, which is now being studied for treating hospitalized cases of COVID-19.Barclays analyst Carter Gould believes that the stock sell-off following Eli Lilly's second-quarter results and due to the lack of incremental disclosures about COVID-19 efforts and the discontinuation of the company’s KRAS G12C inhibitor was a &quot;meaningful over-reaction&quot;.Gould raised his price target to $170 from $160 and maintained a Buy rating saying that Eli Lilly shares are the &quot;most attractive they've been in two plus months&quot;. Moreover, the analyst noted that the &quot;further de-risking of twin growth pillars,&quot; Verzenio and tirzepatide along with &quot;optionality&quot; from multiple other readouts &quot;should warrant further multiple expansion from here&quot;. (See LLY stock analysis on TipRanks)Eli Lilly stock has advanced about 12% year-to-date. Shares are poised to appreciate another 18.1% as indicated by the average analyst price target of $174. A Moderate Buy consensus for the stock breaks down into 6 Buys, 3 Holds and no Sell ratings.Merck or Eli Lilly?About 73% of analysts covering Merck stock have a Buy rating compared to 67% in the case of Eli Lilly. Both Merck and Eli Lilly have strong growth prospects over the long-term. However, Merck’s blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, its lower valuation compared to Eli Lilly, and a higher dividend yield (2.9% against Eli Lilly’s 2%) make it a better pharma pick in the current scenario.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-09-03,"Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) stock has pulled back in recent months, rendering its  valuation  more attractive, according to a Morgan Stanley analyst. The Lilly Analyst: David Risinger upgraded Eli Lilly from Equal-weight to Overweight and increased the price target from $157 to $176.The Lilly Thesis:  The 9% pullback in Lilly shares seen since June 30 was mainly due to disappointing second-quarter results, the management downplaying COVID-19 antibody opportunities and concern about an impending readout on high-dose Ozempic from rival Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO), Risinger said in a Thursday note. This has rendered the forward P/E in line with the five-year average, the analyst said. Fundamentally, Lilly is likely to outperform, driven by long-term growth prospects, positive Phase 3 tirzepatide results starting in the fourth quarter and rising enthusiasm for its Alzheimer's pipeline, he said.The consensus estimates underappreciate Lilly's long-term revenue and EPS growth potential, Risinger said.Morgan Stanley's 2025 revenues and EPS estimates are both 7% above the consensus, the analyst said. Tirzepatide could be best-in-class for glucose lowering, weight loss and cardiovascular risk, he said. Risinger sees peak sales potential for the candidate as reaching $10 billion. Beyond diabetes, tirzepatide could become a leading prescription drug for obesity, the analyst said.Among other catalysts, Lilly has four proof-of-concept results from its early stage diabetes pipeline coming in 2021, he said. &quot;Lilly's Alzheimer's pipeline represents an inexpensive call option, in our view.&quot;  The analyst estimates only $725 million in risk-adjusted Alzheimer's pipeline sales in 2025.An FDA approval for Biogen Inc's (NASDAQ: BIIB) highly controversial Alzheimer's investigational drug  aducanumab  could be a perception positive for Lilly, as a regulatory nod could suggest a low regulatory bar for Alzheimer's, he said.Lilly has two Alzheimer's candidates -- N3PG and tau antibody -- set to report Phase 2 data in 2021, Risinger said.With Morgan Stanley assuming only 5% odds of success for each, the risk-reward is skewed to the upside, the analyst said.As such, Morgan Stanley increased its estimates for Lilly's key franchises and extended its model.LLY Price Action:  At last check, Lilly shares were down 0.84% at $148.30.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study evaluated LY-CoV555, a SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody, for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. The trial enrolled mild- to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients across four groups (placebo, 700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg).The prespecified primary endpoint, change from baseline in viral load at day 11, was met at the 2800 mg dose level, but not the others. Most patients, including those receiving placebo, demonstrated near-complete viral clearance by day 11. Additional analyses of viral data demonstrated that LY-CoV555 improved viral clearance at an earlier time point (day 3) and reduced the proportion of patients with persistently high viral load at later time points.These biomarker data correlated with LY-CoV555’s positive impact on the prespecified endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalization or ER visit. This endpoint occurred in 1.7 percent (5/302) of LY-CoV555 patients, pooled across dose groups, as compared to 6 percent (9/150) of placebo patients, which corresponds to a 72 percent risk reduction in this limited population. Most study hospitalizations occurred in patients with underlying risk factors (age or BMI), suggesting a more pronounced treatment effect for patients in these higher-risk groups. Ongoing studies will seek to confirm this finding. Across all treatment groups (including placebo), no patients progressed to mechanical ventilation or died. Exploratory analyses indicated a more rapid improvement in symptoms for patients treated with LY-CoV555 versus placebo, supporting the hospitalization effect.LY-CoV555 was well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events reported. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across all dose groups and comparable to placebo. Viral RNA sequencing revealed putative LY-CoV555-resistance variants in placebo and all treatment arms. The rate of resistance variants was numerically higher in treated patients (8 percent) versus placebo (6 percent).“This antibody—LY-CoV555—appears to demonstrate a direct antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2, and these early data suggest it may reduce COVID-related hospitalizations,” said Doron Sagman, M.D., Lilly Canada's vice president, R&D and medical affairs. “These results are very encouraging, and we look forward to generating broader data to gather a fuller understanding of this antibody’s potential to help in the fight against COVID-19.”Lilly intends to quickly publish the results of this interim analysis in a peer-reviewed journal and discuss appropriate next steps with global regulators. The BLAZE-1 clinical trial remains ongoing, testing LY-CoV555 in combination with a second Lilly antibody, LY-CoV016, which binds a different epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The trial is currently enrolling a larger, confirmatory cohort of higher-risk patients, testing the ability of the antibody combination to reduce the number of patients with persistently high viral load and reduce COVID-related hospitalizations.About BLAZE-1  BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll an estimated 800 participants.The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild- to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients across four groups (placebo, LY-CoV555 700 mg, LY-CoV555 2800 mg, and LY-CoV555 7000 mg). To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than 3 days prior to drug infusion.The primary outcome measure for the BLAZE-1 monotherapy arms was change from baseline to Day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through Day 29, as well as safety.The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms.About LY-CoV555   LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and tested by the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. Lilly has successfully completed enrollment and primary safety assessments of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing. A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (NCT04427501) is ongoing. Lilly recently initiated a Phase 3 study for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (NCT04497987). In addition, LY-CoV555 is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3 studies of ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients.About Lilly’s COVID-19 Efforts    Lilly is bringing the full force of its scientific and medical expertise to attack the coronavirus pandemic around the world. Existing Lilly medicines are now being studied to understand their potential in treating complications of COVID-19, and the company is collaborating with two partner companies to discover novel antibody treatments for COVID-19. Lilly intends to test both single-antibody therapy as well as combinations of antibodies (sometimes known as antibody cocktails) as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.About Lilly Canada  Eli Lilly and Company is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world.

2020-09-16,"Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley.

ACTT-2 included more than 1,000 patients and began on May 8 to assess the efficacy and safety of a 4-mg dose of baricitinib plus remdesivir versus remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Baricitinib in combination with remdesivir met the primary endpoint of reduction of time to recovery in comparison with remdesivir.Study investigators noted an approximately one-day reduction in median recovery time for the overall patient population treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir versus those treated with remdesivir. This finding was statistically significant. Recovery was defined as the participant being well enough for hospital discharge, meaning the participant either no longer required supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care in the hospital, or was no longer hospitalized at Day 29. The study also met a key secondary endpoint comparing patient outcomes at Day 15 using an ordinal 8-point scale ranging from fully recovered to death.An independent data and safety monitoring board overseeing the double-blind, randomized controlled trial met regularly throughout the trial to review safety data. Additional analyses are ongoing to understand other clinical outcome data, including mortality and safety data. NIAID is expected to publish full details of the study in a peer-reviewed journal.“As a tightly knit organization, we are truly working as one team to help discover a number of treatment options for COVID-19, including the potential role of baricitinib. We are pleased by the topline ACTT-2 results and look forward to the full data to completely understand baricitinib’s impact on COVID-19,” says Dr. Doron Sagman, Vice President, R&D and Medical Affairs, Eli Lilly Canada.Based on the ACTT-2 data, Lilly plans to discuss the potential for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to explore similar measures with other regulatory agencies, including Health Canada, for baricitinib as a treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. If authorized for use in Canada, Lilly will propose that baricitinib be available through commercial channels and will work with hospitals and governments to ensure patient access. Lilly will continue to create adequate supply for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and ensure baricitinib remains available in Canada and around the world where it is approved. In Canada, baricitinib is approved for RA patients at a 2-mg daily dose.  Lilly will review the ACTT-2 data with NIAID and assess any impact on COV-BARRIER, the Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study it initiated in June to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib versus background therapy in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America.Lilly is also currently supporting ongoing multisite and single-site investigator-initiated trials in Europe and North America, including the SAIL-004 study in Nova Scotia, Canada, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections.About Lilly’s COVID-19 Efforts   Lilly is bringing the full force of its scientific and medical expertise to attack the coronavirus pandemic around the world. Existing Lilly medicines are now being studied to understand their potential in treating complications of COVID-19, and the company is collaborating with two partner companies to discover novel antibody treatments for COVID-19. Lilly intends to test both single antibody therapy as well as combinations of antibodies (sometimes known as antibody cocktails) as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.About OLUMIANT®  In Canada, OLUMIANT (baricitinib), in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for reducing the signs and symptoms of moderate- to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). OLUMIANT can be used as a monotherapy in cases of intolerance to MTX.1OLUMIANT is believed to interfere with the activity of an enzyme called Janus Kinase (JAK). Normally JAK enzymes help turn on your immune system when you need it. The immune system then causes swelling and tenderness. This is called inflammation. There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.2 OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. About Lilly Canada  Eli Lilly and Company is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world.

2020-09-18,"Over the past three months, shares of Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) moved lower by 4.31%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Eli Lilly has.Eli Lilly's Debt According to the Eli Lilly's most recent financial statement as reported on July 31, 2020, total debt is at $16.33 billion, with $15.06 billion in long-term debt and $1.26 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $2.37 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $13.96 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Eli Lilly has $41.97 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.39. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 3, 2020  * Recap: Eli Lilly Q2 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For July 30, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-22,"New indication reflects distinct patient population in the REWIND study – people with type 2 diabetes with multiple cardiovascular risks or established cardiovascular diseaseTORONTO, Sept. 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 11, 2020, Health Canada approved Trulicity® (dulaglutide) to reduce the risk of non-fatal stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease, as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and standard of care therapy. This decision makes Eli Lilly and Company’s Trulicity the first and only GLP1 receptor agonist (RA) approved to provide a cardiovascular benefit in people with multiple CV risk factors or with established cardiovascular disease.  The new indication reflects the differentiated patient population of REWIND, the Trulicity cardiovascular outcomes trial. The study consisted primarily of people with multiple cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease. REWIND showed a significant risk reduction in MACE-3, a composite endpoint of nonfatal myocardial infarction (heart attack), non-fatal stroke or CV death. Results demonstrated consistent MACE-3 risk reduction with Trulicity across major demographic subgroups. Trulicity's safety profile was consistent with the GLP-1 RA class. The most common adverse events leading to the discontinuation of Trulicity were gastrointestinal events.“REWIND showed that the drug dulaglutide (marketed as Trulicity) reduced major cardiovascular events, including non-fatal stroke, in adults with type 2 diabetes who either had multiple cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease,” says Dr. Hertzel Gerstein, Professor, and Deputy Director of the Population Health Research Institute at McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, ON. “Trulicity’s new indication to reduce the risk of non-fatal stroke in these patients will provide physicians with an important tool for type 2 diabetes care.”In addition to its proven glycemic efficacy and easy-to-use device*, Trulicity can now be prescribed to provide cardiovascular benefit to people with type 2 diabetes.“The GLP-1 RA class represents an important advancement in the treatment of type 2 diabetes,” says Dr. Doron Sagman, Vice President, R&D and Medical Affairs, Eli Lilly Canada. “The combination of Trulicity’s proven efficacy along with a new indication for non-fatal stroke represents a significant milestone in diabetes and cardiovascular management.”About the REWIND Study   REWIND (Researching cardiovascular Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effect of Trulicity 1.5 mg, a weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), compared to placebo, both added to standard of care (according to local standard of care guidelines), on cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary CV outcome was the first occurrence of MACE (the composite of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke). Secondary outcomes include each component of the primary composite CV outcome, a composite clinical microvascular outcome comprising retinal or renal disease, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure requiring hospitalization or an urgent heart failure visit, and all-cause mortality. The 9,901 participants from 24 countries had a mean duration of diabetes of 10.5 years and a median baseline A1C of 7.2 percent. While all participants had CV risk factors, only 31.5 percent of the study participants had established CV disease while 62.8 percent only had multiple CV risk factors Prior (established) cardiovascular disease in REWIND was defined as a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, unstable angina, revascularization (coronary, carotid, or peripheral), myocardial ischemia by a stress test or cardiac imaging or hospitalization for unstable angina with at least one of the following: ECG changes, myocardial ischemia on imaging, or a need for percutaneous coronary intervention.The REWIND trial's international scope, high proportion of women, high proportion of people without established cardiovascular disease and inclusion of participants with a lower mean baseline A1C suggest that the findings will be directly relevant to the typical type 2 diabetes patient seen in general practice.About Diabetes in Canada  Approximately 11 million Canadians live with diabetes or prediabetes. People with diabetes are over three times more likely to be hospitalized with cardiovascular disease and contribute to 30% of strokes and 40% of heart attacks. Diabetes can reduce lifespan by 5 to 15 years and complications are associated with premature death. It is estimated that the all-cause mortality rate among Canadians living with diabetes is twice as high as the all-cause mortality rate for people without diabetes.1About Lilly Diabetes  Lilly has been a global leader in diabetes care since 1923, when we introduced the world’s first commercial insulin.

2020-10-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump is all-in on antibody treatments — medicines that can mimic the body’s response to infection, including Covid-19. After receiving an experimental dual-antibody cocktail from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. last week to treat the case of coronavirus he contracted, he is claiming that the drug and a similar medicine from Eli Lilly & Co. cure the disease and will soon be widely available to Americans for free. “I want to get for you what I got. And I’m going to make it free,” Trump told viewers in a video he tweeted. “It’s a cure.” The reality is more complicated. These drugs are promising and may serve as a valuable bridge to vaccines. Both Regeneron and Lilly have requested emergency use authorizations of their medications based on small studies, and the Food and Drug Administration will face pressure to say yes. However, the president is exaggerating their benefit and likely availability. What’s more, his hype and rush to push antibodies out will make it harder to get the most out of them.Antibodies aren’t a miracle cure responsible for the president’s recovery. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Faye Flam wrote earlier this week, Trump received so many other medicines, including the antiviral remdesivir and the powerful steroid dexamethasone, it’s impossible to tell which did what. Drawing conclusions from just the president’s experience is irresponsible. We do know that medicines developed by Regeneron and Lilly reduce viral load early in a patient’s illness. There’s some evidence that this translates to reduced symptoms and fewer hospitalizations. But these preliminary conclusions are based on a limited number of patients who received different dose levels. There are enough open questions that it's unclear whether the FDA should allow broad use of these drugs at all. The data we have so far comes only from patients with relatively mild disease treated outside of the hospital. Researchers are now testing the medicine on sicker hospitalized people, as well as for use as a short-term vaccine in those at high risk of infection. Prophylactic use is particularly promising because it may require a lower antibody dose. The lower the dose, the more people doctors can treat. Releasing the drug early may derail or delay these crucial trials. Fewer people will be willing to enroll in studies that may give them a non-working placebo when the medicine is available, and limited supplies will be used quickly on what may be the wrong patients.There are currently 50,000 treatment-level doses of Regeneron’s therapy available; the company hopes to have doses available for 300,000 patients within the next few months. Lilly expects to have 100,000 doses of its treatment this month and as many as a million by year’s end. But it will have only 50,000 doses of a more promising combination. (As a point of context, the U.S. is reporting nearly 40,000 new Covid-19 cases a day; at that rate, we can expect 1.2 million people infected in the coming month alone.) The president’s promise of an imminent wide rollout will be hard to keep. The same goes for his pledge that the antibodies will be entirely free. Initial doses of Regeneron's treatment will be free to patients because taxpayers already shelled out $450 million through an “Operation Warp Speed” contract. There's no assurance on pricing after that initial batch. Lilly has signed no such agreement, and it remains unclear how it will price its therapy; it won't be free unless the government takes action.With new stricter FDA guidelines seemingly ruling out a vaccine by Election Day, Trump appears to be trying to fill the void with these therapies instead. The rush means some may get treated sooner, but more may lose out in the long run. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2020-10-08,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: REGN) said Wednesday that it requested emergency use authorization from the FDA for its investigational coronavirus antibody cocktail.The experimental drug, named REGN-COV2, was in news last week after it was administered to President Donald Trump. What Is REGN-COV2? REGN-COV2 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies: REGN10933 and REGN10987.The company said it  has doses 50,000 patients and hopes to make available doses for 300,000 patients in the months ahead. Regeneron's early data -- and perhaps the Trump news -- have led to the FDA being supportive of the company filing, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young said in a Thursday note. Patient Access In Q4?  The filing means that patients could obtain access to the drug in the fourth quarter, Young said.The analyst's base case assumes COVID-19 sales of $1.8 billion in 2021 for Regeneron, with a 50% probability of success.Assuming 100% success on Cantor's revenue forecasts for 2021-2023, $18 per share would be added to Regeneron's valuation, she said. Going by the urgency with which Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GILD) remdesivir was approved, REGN-COV2 could be approved in the coming weeks -- especially as COVID-19 remains an urgent issue in the U.S., Young said. ""Our positive thesis on REGN is more than REGN-COV2, but certainly we think commercial sales from REGN-COV2 could be a near-term positive earnings driver for 2021."" Dupixent is likely to be another earnings growth driver for Regeneron, the analyst said. Related Link: Attention Biotech Investors: Mark Your Calendar For October PDUFA DatesRegeneron Vs. Lilly: The coronavirus antibodies from Regeneron and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY), which submitted an emergency use application Wednesday, have similar efficacy and safety, Canaccord Genuity analyst John Newman said in a note. The lack of baseline viral load data for Lilly is not helpful, the analyst said. Regeneron's antibody cocktail showed better efficacy for higher viral loads or in patients who were likely more ill, while Lilly did not disclose any such data, he said.Hospitalization or medical visits for both were similar, with Lilly holding a slight edge, Newman said. ""Importantly, Regeneron illustrated faster symptom resolutions in patients with higher viral load at baseline.""Cantor Fitzgerald has an Overweight rating on Regeneron with a $690 price target.

2020-10-09,"Regeneron might be hogging all the headlines with its Trump administered COVID-19 antibody cocktail REGN-COV2, but it is not the only large cap pharma company staking a claim for its COVID-19 antibody program.On Wednesday, Eli Lily (LLY) announced it has applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) for one of its COVID-19 antibody candidates, LY-CoV555, as a monotherapy for higher risk patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms.The positive news, however, got an added layer of gloss. The company also presented new interim trial data for the combination therapy of LY-CoV555 and another antibody, LY-CoV016, which indicates the antibody pairing improves outcomes for COVID-19 patients by significantly lowering viral load, symptoms, and COVID-related trips to the hospital.The company will submit an EUA request for the combo treatment next month, and once enough data is available, will submit a full BLA (Biologics License Application) as early as Q2 2021.While Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan calls the new data “promising,” the analyst believes the “clinical meaningfulness of some datapoints remains up for debate.”“The combination therapy reduced viral load at day 11 (p=0.011), meeting the primary endpoint of the study, although the company noted that most patients including those on placebo achieved near complete viral clearance by day 11,” Divan noted.That said, Divan also points out other benefits from the trial such as “a greater than six-fold reduction (a relative risk reduction of 84.5%) in the rate of COVID-related hospitalizations and ER visits over placebo, as well as the time-weighted average change in total symptom score from day 1 to 11 that was similar in magnitude and timing to those previously seen with LY-CoV555 monotherapy.”Nevertheless, while the data appears encouraging, other questions still remain, and Divan wonders “where the combination would fall in the COVID treatment algorithm, how/where patients would receive it, and how Lilly may price the therapy.”Overall, Divan rates LLY a Neutral (i.e. Hold) along with a $164 price target. This figure implies a modest upside of nearly 4% from current levels. (To watch Divan’s track record, click here)Overall, opinions on the pharma giant’s trajectory are split, but tilting to the bulls. LLY's Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds and is backed by a $170.67 average price target. Investors are looking at gains of 9%, should the figure be met.

2020-10-18,"Eli Lilly & Co. announced a definitive agreement to snap up privately-held biotechnology company Disarm Therapeutics for $135 million, in a bid to a develop a new class of disease-modifying therapeutics for patients with axonal degeneration.Under the terms of the agreement, Disarm shareholders will be eligible for up to $1.225 billion in future payments for potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones should Lilly (LLY) successfully develop and commercialize new medicines resulting from the acquisition. Axonal degeneration is a common, yet unaddressed, pathology in a broad range of neurological diseases and is known to cause severe sensory, motor, and cognitive symptoms.Disarm has discovered novel, potent SARM1 inhibitors and is advancing them in preclinical development, with the goal of delivering treatments to patients with peripheral neuropathy and other neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis. The biotech company found that SARM1 protein is a central driver of axonal degeneration. As such, SARM1 inhibitors are designed to directly prevent the loss of axons.""Lilly continues to seek medicines to treat the debilitating pain and loss of function associated with nerve damage,"" said Lilly’s Mark Mintun. ""The scientific team at Disarm discovered an important and highly promising approach to combat axonal degeneration. We will move quickly to develop their SARM1 inhibitors into potential medicines for peripheral neuropathy and neurological diseases, such as ALS and multiple sclerosis.""Lilly said that the transaction won’t have any impact on its 2020 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance.Shares in LLY are up more than 11% year-to-date, but have dropped almost 7% over the past 5 days as the Phase 3 trial of its leading monoclonal antibody coronavirus treatment has been paused by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over potential safety concerns.Earlier this month, Lilly announced that it had applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) for one of its Covid-19 antibody candidates, LY-CoV555, as a monotherapy for higher risk patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms. The company also presented new interim trial data for the combination therapy of LY-CoV555 and another antibody, LY-CoV016.While Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan viewed the new data as “promising,” the analyst believes the “clinical meaningfulness of some datapoints remains up for debate.” Divan reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $164 price target (12% upside potential).“We wonder where the combination would fall in the Covid treatment algorithm, how/where patients would receive it, and how Lilly may price the therapy, but overall find today’s data release encouraging,” Divan wrote in a note to investors on Oct. 7. (See Eli Lilly’s stock analysis on TipRanks).Overall, the stock scores a bullish Strong Buy Street analyst consensus. That’s with a $175.50 average analyst price target, indicating 20% upside potential lies ahead.Related News:   Eli Lilly Pauses Late-Stage Covid-19 Antibody Trial Over Safety Concerns   PerkinElmer Raises 3Q Sales Outlook Fueled By COVID-19 Testing Demand   J&J Halts Covid-19 Vaccine Trial Due To ‘Unexplained Illness’ More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Loop Drops 6% On SEC Subpoena; Roth Sees 104% Upside   * Macy’s Or TJX: Which Retail Stock Is The Street's Better Pick?   * Boeing On Cusp Of EU Approval For Grounded 737-MAX Jet - Report   * Pfizer Targets FDA Approval For Covid-19 Vaccine In November; Shares Rise",Eli Lilly To Snap Up Disarm In $135M Deal; Street Stays Bullish

2020-10-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Covid-19 antibody therapies, drugs that mimic the body’s response to infection, have been hailed as a “bridge to a vaccine.” They can’t get us there alone. Eli Lilly & Co.’s entrant in this category hit a roadblock Monday evening when the National Institutes of Health announced the failure of a key clinical trial testing the medicine in hospitalized patients. The researchers didn’t end enrollment based on harmful side effects — a concern after the trial was halted amid safety concerns earlier in the month — but rather because a look at the data suggested Lilly’s antibody is unlikely to help.Monday’s news doesn’t  mean that the drug or antibodies generally are ineffective. But the fact that one of the most prominent and furthest-along therapy options has limits as a commercial and pandemic-easing prospect isn’t great news in the fight against the virus. Compounding the antibody concerns for Lilly investors, the company’s third-quarter results missed Wall Street estimates; the stock slumped almost 6% on Tuesday morning.The Lilly and Regeneron antibody treatments still show promise in treating recently diagnosed patients, and trials are continuing  to see whether they can serve as a short-term vaccine. Both companies have applied for emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in milder patients, and it makes sense that they might work better in that setting. Hospitalized patients may have generated antibodies on their own and may have more problems with an out-of-control inflammatory response than the virus that the antibody is targeting.Regeneron’s treatment is a cocktail of two antibodies, unlike Lilly’s single effort, and could still prove effective in sicker patients. But the failure risk appears high. That’s concerning because patients requiring hospitalization are at the highest risk of bad outcomes or death, putting them in greater need of effective treatments.While these therapies may be valuable in heading off the virus before it takes hold, that type of treatment isn’t as straightforward as in-hospital use from a commercial or public health standpoint. It is more challenging to show a robust impact or justify high prices in a group of patients who may be more likely to recover independently. It's also still unclear who benefits most from antibodies. Regeneron suggests it could be patients who have trouble producing their own antibodies, while Lilly recommends that people who are older or have other risk factors for severe disease should get them.Either way, early use presents logistical hurdles. Speedy identification of eligible patients is difficult; Covid testing is unevenly distributed and often slow. The antibodies then have to be promptly delivered and administered with special equipment that isn’t available in an average doctor's office. It’s a big challenge compared with sending supplies to hard-hit hospitals, especially because quantities will be limited at first. Even in the best of times, the development of medicines is rarely quick or straightforward. We’re seeing that now in the race for Covid-19 treatments and vaccines. However much we may hope for quick remedies, it will take time. It’s best to let the trials continue and focus on what we can control and what can make a difference: wearing masks, washing hands, boosting testing, and limiting potential super-spreading events. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2020-10-27,"Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) said Monday that a trial of its antibody treatment for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients has come to an end as the treatment is unlikely to help such patients. What Happened: The one of its kind study -- conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health -- was evaluating the efficacy of bamlanivimab, according to a statement issued by the company.Eli Lilly said that trial data has led to the recommendation that the treatment is unlikely to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover from an advanced stage of the disease.Other studies investigating bamlanivimab will continue, including an NIH-sponsored study evaluating the efficacy of the treatment in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases and the company's own Phase 2 trial in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in a non-hospitalized setting.Why It Matters: The Indianapolis, Indiana-based drug giant said it has submitted for an emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab based on its own Phase 2 trial results.This month, the drugmaker halted the Phase 3 trial of its antibody treatment due to a &quot;potential safety concern.&quot; It was reported earlier that the Eli Lilly plant being readied to make the antibody treatment for COVID-19 was found to have serious quality control problems by the United States Food and Drug Administration.President Donald Trump was administered a similar antibody treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: REGN), which he touted as a &quot;cure&quot; for COVID-19.Price Action: Eli Lilly shares closed nearly 0.5% lower at $141.70 on Monday and fell 0.83% in the after-hours session.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Fauci Says He Was 'Absolutely Not' Surprised That Trump Got COVID-19  * Regeneron's Inmazeb Becomes First Ebola Treatment To Get FDA Approval(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-27,"Eli Lilly & Co. announced on Monday that it will stop a US-based clinical trial for its COVID-19 antibody treatment after data found that it is “unlikely” to help hospitalized patients recover from the advanced stage of the disease.The move comes after the Phase 3 trial of the monoclonal antibody treatment was paused this month by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over safety concerns. Lilly (LLY) said that based on an updated dataset from the trial on October 26, no additional COVID-19 patients in the hospitalized setting will receive the antibody treatment bamlanivimab. According to the updated dataset, differences in safety outcomes between the groups were not significant, the drugmaker added.“While there was insufficient evidence that bamlanivimab improved clinical outcomes when added to other treatments in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we remain confident based on data from Lilly’s BLAZE-1 study that bamlanivimab monotherapy may prevent progression of disease for those earlier in the course of COVID-19,” Lilly said in a statement.The ACTIV-3 clinical trial was being run by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and was the only study evaluating the efficacy of bamlanivimab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, Lilly said it will continue all other ongoing trials for its coronavirus antibody treatment, including ACTIV-2, the NIH-sponsored study in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.Lilly’s Phase 2 trial in patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting, studying bamlanivimab as a monotherapy and in combination with etesevimab is also ongoing.Earlier this month, Lilly announced that it had applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) for one of its COVID-19 antibody candidates, LY-CoV555, as a monotherapy for higher risk patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms. The company has also presented new interim trial data for the combination therapy of LY-CoV555 and another antibody, LY-CoV016.Shares in LLY are up almost 8% year-to-date, but have dropped almost 4.3% over the past month following the Phase 3 trial pause. (See Eli Lilly’s stock analysis on TipRanks).Ahead of LLY’s 3Q results today, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $164 price target (16% upside potential), noting that additional information related to Lilly's work on COVID-19 therapeutics will likely garner investor interest, as will any potential comments on the Phase 3 data for tirzepatide expected by year-end and Phase 2 Alzheimer's data expected in 2021.“Lilly sales this quarter is a little more challenging than usual given the dynamics related to COVID-19 destocking as well as the impact of the donut hole,” Divan wrote in a note to investors. “Our sales estimates appear to be lower than consensus mainly for their diabetes business, including Humalog, Jardiance and Tradjenta.”The analyst expects Lilly to report 3Q revenues of $5.862 billion vs. consensus of $5.884 billion and Non-GAAP EPS of $1.76 in line with the $1.76 consensus.“We see Lilly as a best-in-class story but have struggled to see additional drivers of upside,” he summed up.Overall, the stock scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus. That’s with a $176 average analyst price target, indicating 24% upside potential lies ahead.Related News:   Eli Lilly To Snap Up Disarm In $135M Deal; Street Stays Bullish   Eli Lilly Pauses Late-Stage Covid-19 Antibody Trial Over Safety Concerns   PerkinElmer Raises 3Q Sales Outlook Fueled By COVID-19 Testing Deman More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * J.M.

2020-10-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Housebound Americans’ new buying habits are showing up in everything from home-renovation supplies to takeout chicken and casual footwear.With the third-quarter earnings season well underway, the results are showing how coronavirus shutdowns are helping some companies absorb the impact on the economy, while others struggle.For instance, paint maker Sherwin-Williams Co. on Tuesday raised its full-year guidance and beat third-quarter expectations, citing “continued and unprecedented strength” in do-it-yourself demand as people spent to spruce up their homes. Restaurant Brands International Inc. said sales at its Popeyes chain jumped 22% amid strong demand for drive-through and takeout. Crocs Inc. saw sales climb 16%.At the same time, dressy shoemaker Steven Madden Ltd. posted a 31% drop in revenue. Xerox Holdings Corp. also took a hit from the shift to working from home, with equipment sales falling 15% amid business closures and office-building capacity restrictions.Overall, the earnings season so far has been strong. With about one-third of S&P 500 companies having reported as of Tuesday morning, more than 75% have beat sales estimates and nearly 85% have beat earnings expectations. That may reflect a low bar that analysts had set heading into the quarter, according to Deutsche Bank’s chief strategist Binky Chadha.“Companies that have reported have beat estimates by a massive 16.3% in aggregate, only modestly lower than the record 20.3% in Q2,” Chadha wrote in a note. The consensus for the fourth-quarter may also be too conservative, he said.Pharma giants Merck & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co. also joined the nearly 700 companies set to report earnings this week.Key Developments:AMD Agrees to Buy Chipmaker Xilinx for $35 Billion in StockHedge Funds’ Shot at Stock Secrecy Fades as SEC Shelves RevampU.S. Durable Goods Orders Rose More Than Forecast in SeptemberAll-In Push for Vaccine in U.S. Raises Risk Virus Will LingerHere’s today’s top earnings news by sector:Health CareEli Lilly reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenue results that missed analysts’ estimates, while maintaining its full-year guidance. The company said that the EPS miss was partly a function of its higher R&D spend on novel therapies to combat the coronavirus. Lilly spent $125 million on pandemic-response efforts in the quarter.Merck released updated 2020 guidance that included upbeat profit expectations for the year. The company also reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenue that beat analyst expectations. However, Merck said “lower back-to-school demand” in the pandemic has carved into sales of vaccines.Pfizer reported revenue that came in slightly below analyst estimates and it tightened its guidance for the year. The company said it has enrolled more than 42,000 patients in its Covid-19 vaccine trial, and more importantly, almost 36,000 have received their second dose as of Oct. 26.IndustrialsCaterpillar said it sees “positive signs in certain industries and geographies” while failing to give reassurance that the worst of the hit from the coronavirus pandemic is behind the heavy-equipment maker. The company said machine sales fell 20% in September on a rolling three-month basis.ConsumerRestaurant Brands announced a plan to overhaul its drive-thrus with predictive technology after reporting another quarter of falling sales. The enhancements include digital screens with “predictive selling” technology and contactless payment options, the Burger King owner said. The revamped plan was announced as the company reported third-quarter sales of $1.34 billion, down 8.3% year-over-year but still slightly ahead of analyst expectations.Harley-Davidson reported better-than-expected profit as CEO Jochen Zeitz’s moves to cut costs and boost margins on a smaller revenue base paid off in the third quarter. The motorcycle maker said dealer inventory fell more than 30% compared with a year ago.Steven Madden reported adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter that exceeded the average analyst estimate, but revenue dropped 31%. Crocs reported adjusted earnings per share and revenue for the third quarter that topped the average analyst prediction. The shoe company said digital sales in the quarter grew 35.5% to 37.7% of total revenues versus 32.2% for the same period last year, with growth in all regions.MaterialsTeck Resources’ revenue for the third quarter fell short of the average analyst estimate. The company reduced its capital expenditures, capitalizing stripping and zinc unit cost guidance for the second half of 2020. Sherwin-Williams reported third-quarter earnings per share and net sales that beat expectations. CEO John Morikis pointed to “continued and unprecedented strength in our DIY business,” as well as solid demand in residential repaint and new residential segments, for the company’s strong third-quarter results.TechnologyXerox reported revenue for the third quarter that came in higher than the average analyst estimate despite business closures and office building capacity restrictions. The workplace technology company said equipment sales revenue fell 15% in the quarter, particularly in the mid-range and high-end products used in offices.TransportJetBlue reported operating revenue for the third quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. The airline said it expects capacity to decline about 45% year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a drop of 58% in the third quarter, reflecting its expectation for improved bookings.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Stuck Americans Spend on DIY Projects and Crocs: Earnings Wrap

2020-10-28,"Shares of Eli Lilly & Co.  were down 0.7% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the drug maker said the U.S. government signed a deal to acquire 300,000 doses of its experimental neutralizing antibody COVID-19 treatment bamlanivimab for $375 million. Per the terms of the deal, Lilly will distribute vials of the drug, which is also referred to as LY-CoV555, to the government if the Food and Drug Administration grants an emergency use authorization. (The company in October filed for emergency authorization of the drug in the treatment of people with mild to moderate forms COVID-19 who are also at high risk.) SVB Leerink's Geoffrey Porges had previously predicted that the drug will receive an EUA before the end of the year. A Phase 2 study indicates that bamlanivimab may reduce the rate of hospitalization and viral load in some COVID-19 patients. Two days ago the National Institutes of Health halted a clinical trial for bamlanivimab saying the therapy is not likely to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover, and a trial pairing the therapy in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc.'s  remdesivir in hospitalized patients was halted in mid-October over safety concerns. There are at least three other trials of the investigational drug underway, including one testing the therapy in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 patients that is also sponsored by the NIH. There is an option for the U.S. government to buy additional doses on the same terms through June 30. In the news release, the U.S. government has &quot;committed&quot; to patients being charged no out-of-pocket costs; however, bamlanivimab is a drug that must be infused in a health care setting, so health care providers can charge a fee for that service. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients are not usually hospitalized. Lilly said this &quot;presents unique challenges.&quot; Lilly's stock is down 0.3%. for the year, while the S&P 500  is up 4.9%.",Lilly signs deal with U.S. government for still-investigational COVID-19 antibody drug

2020-10-29,"Eli Lilly & Co. has struck a $375 million agreement with the US government to supply 300,000 vials of its bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555), an investigational neutralizing antibody, for the treatment of COVID-19. Shares are advancing 1.7% in Thursday’s pre-market trading.According to the agreement, the US government will receive the LY-CoV555 vials once it has been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Earlier this month, Lilly (LLY) submitted an FDA request for EUA approval of the investigational treatment used for mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. The initial agreement is for supply over the 2 months following an EUA. After that, the US government has the option to purchase up to an additional 650,000 vials through June 30, 2021, under the same terms and subject to product availability and the medical need in the US.LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19.&quot;Supply agreements with governments – such as this one with the US government to meet Operation Warp Speed goals – are fundamental to enable the most widespread and equitable access to our potential therapy,&quot; said Lilly CEO David A. Ricks. &quot;The US is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations, and we believe bamlanivimab could be an important therapeutic option that can bring value to the overall healthcare system, as it has shown a potential benefit in clinical outcomes with a reduction in viral load and rates of symptoms and hospitalizations.&quot;Lilly targets manufacturing of up to 1 million doses of bamlanivimab 700 mg by the end of 2020 – with 100,000 doses ready to ship within days of EUA authorization – for use around the world. The supply of Lilly's antibody therapy is expected to increase substantially beginning in Q1 2021, as additional manufacturing resources come online throughout the year.The drugmaker said that it has a robust, global supply chain in place to produce LY-CoV555 at 5 manufacturing sites worldwide. To ensure rapid access of the treatment to patients around the world, Lilly has invested in large-scale manufacturing of LY-CoV555, even before data demonstrated its potential to become a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19, the company added.However, the antibody treatment suffered a setback earlier this week after data found that it was “unlikely” to help COVID-10 hospitalized patients recover from the advanced stage of the disease. As a result, the US-based Phase 3 clinical trial for hospitalized patients was stopped, while all other ongoing trials for its coronavirus antibody treatments will be continued.Shares of LLY have dropped more than 7% over the past 5 days and are trading close to their start of the year level. (See Eli Lilly’s stock analysis on TipRanks).Following LLY’s quarterly results this week, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $164 price target, noting that the company maintained its FY 2020 sales and EPS guidance, and commented that the higher end of the revenue range would &quot;likely require the inclusion of moderate revenue from potential COVID-19 treatments, which is possible but not certain at this point.&quot;&quot;LLY shares have faced some pressure since the company announced 2Q 2020 results three months ago, and we would expect further pressure given the disappointing 3Q 2020 results,” Divan wrote in a note to investors.

2020-11-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Drugmakers and health insurers were the biggest gainers on Wednesday after Democrats failed to sweep the election in a “blue wave.” While the presidency remains up in the air, health-care analysts were largely positive about the results, with SVB Leerink calling the outcome, so far, the “best of all worlds.”“Even though drug pricing and reimbursement reform have seen support from both Democrats and Republicans, we expect the Senate’s filibuster-proof, 60-vote supermajority requirement to pass major legislation will shield the biopharma industry from the most controversial reforms,” SVB Leerink’s Geoffrey Porges told clients in a research note.Drugmaker deals are likely to continue unabated, particularly for companies targeting new cancer medicines, said Michael Yee, an analyst with Jefferies. He called the results “a clearing event that allows investment across more fundamentals, rather than fears of headlines.”Goldman analyst Asad Haider also called out the divided government as positive for health insurers, saying the managed-care sector faces less risk of a “large progressive public option” or a corporate tax increase. Before the election, the health-care sector was trading at its largest ever price-to-earnings discount to the broader market. “The group starts to become more investible again,” he wrote in a research note.Veda policy analyst Spencer Perlman said the public option as well as government negotiation on drug prices are “dead for at least the next two years.” There’s some downside from health-care providers, which are more likely to get less-than-hoped stimulus funds. Among insurers, Centene Corp. and Molina Healthcare Inc. are at a disadvantage because of their reliance on Obamacare and managed Medicaid.The S&P Supercomposite Managed Health Care Index, a benchmark of insurers, rallied to a record and biotechs climbed for the biggest jump since March. Large-cap biotechs, along with the insurers, were some of the biggest gainers among S&P 500 stocks with Biogen Inc. leading the way after positive developments for its experimental Alzheimer’s disease medicine.

2020-11-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When it rains good pandemic news, it pours. On a Monday that brought unexpectedly positive vaccine news from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, the Food and Drug Administration also granted emergency use authorization to an Eli Lilly & Co. drug to treatment for individuals newly infected with the coronavirus. It's the first to be approved of a promising group of therapies called monoclonal antibodies that mimic the body’s response to infection, and could be a powerful weapon in the pandemic fight. Some questions remain about Lilly's treatment, called bamlanivimab, which was found to reduce the viral load in patients and may help keep people out of the hospital. It was authorized for treatment at a dose that didn't produce a statistically significant effect in published data, and there's some concern that resistant mutant strains might develop. But with the drug now authorized, the crucial question is who will get access to a highly limited supply.The government has purchased 300,000 doses, and manufacturing will ramp up; meanwhile, an authorization may come soon for a competing treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., which would give doctors more options. But with new daily cases exceeding 100,000 in the U.S., these treatments will have to be rationed for some time to come. The Trump administration plans to leave distribution up to states, prioritizing them based on case rate but offering little additional public guidance. The whole pandemic has demonstrated the failures of a disjointed 50-state strategy. Without more federal help, it’s hard to envision a fair or efficient rollout. The government used a similar strategy with Gilead Sciences Inc,'s drug remdesivir, used in hospitalized patients. It wasn't a resounding success, with early complaints emerging about limited supply and lack of  transparency. Distribution of Lilly's medicine will be even more complicated. Bamlanivimab appears to work best when given early in the course of the disease, which requires quick testing turnaround. The treatment doesn't seem to help hospitalized patients and may even harm them. On top of that, it needs to be delivered using specialized infusion equipment that's likely not available at your local pharmacy. It's also not clear who gets the greatest benefit from the treatment with limited available data. There's some evidence suggesting people with risk factors for severe disease need the drug  the most, and the authorization highlights those patients. The FDA's definition of high risk is very broad, though, encompassing everyone with a confirmed infection over the age of 65, people with a body mass index equal to or over 35, and various others who have conditions that make Covid-19 especially dangerous. It's an enormous group, far larger than the hospitalized population eligible for remdesivir. Doctors face difficult clinical judgments with little help, and states will have far too many eligible patients. Future trials may help narrow the drug's use, and distribution questions will be less of a concern as supply builds. Until then, fairness needs to be the guiding principle. It's entirely too easy to imagine inequality and varying approaches in the absence of detailed guidance. The pandemic has been disproportionately hard on communities of color, who are consistently treated unequally by the American health-care system. Without specific preparation and intervention to identify and treat eligible patients in these communities, inequality is likely to extend to antibodies. Rural populations face the dual risk of limited access to both testing and sites that will administer these treatments. Much of the supply will go to hard-hit states with limited testing capacity. Early identification is crucial to the proper use of this medicine. People who find out about potential exposure early or can pay for access to accelerated testing may have an advantage. Without strict guardrails and a proactive approach, people who happen to know about the treatment or are well-connected may push for access, while those unaware are left behind. President Donald Trump's VIP use of Regeneron's antibody and his adviser Chris Christie's access to Lilly's long before they were available to the public doesn't set the best of examples.States will do their best to find a way to distribute doses fairly. But they're being saddled with a logistical and ethical dilemma with  limited support. With case counts rising every day, the government needs to offer a real plan. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2020-11-10,"Looking at Q3, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) earned $1.28 billion, a 6.81% increase from the preceding quarter. Eli Lilly also posted a total of $5.74 billion in sales, a 4.4% increase since Q2. In Q2, Eli Lilly earned $1.20 billion, and total sales reached $5.50 billion.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Eli Lilly posted an ROCE of 0.26%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on LLYROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Eli Lilly is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In Eli Lilly's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Recap Eli Lilly reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.54/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $1.71/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Price Over Earnings Overview: Eli Lilly  * Recap: Eli Lilly Q3 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-10,"Shares of Eli Lilly & Co. rose as much as 5% in Tuesday’s pre-market session after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab’s (LY-CoV555) use in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 .Specifically, Lilly’s (LLY) bamlanivimab is now authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with a positive COVID-19 test, who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 and hospitalization. According to the EUA, bamlanivimab should be administered immediately after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptoms persisting. The authorization allows for the distribution and emergency use of bamlanivimab, which is administered via a single intravenous infusion.Lilly will now begin shipping bamlanivimab to AmerisourceBergen, a national distributor under the US government's allocation program. The US government has purchased 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab and promised that Americans will have no out-of-pocket costs for the medicine. LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19.“This emergency authorization allows us to make bamlanivimab available as a COVID-19 treatment for recently diagnosed, high-risk patients – adding a valuable tool for doctors fighting the now-increasing burden of this global pandemic,"" said Lilly CEO David A. Ricks. ""The rapid development and availability of bamlanivimab could not have been achieved without collaboration across the industry and the urgent work being done by the government to ensure appropriate allocation to patients who need it the most.""The EUA was granted following data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in patients with recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Patients treated with bamlanivimab showed reduced viral load and rates of symptoms, Lilly said. The EUA includes a warning for hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions. Lilly added that the data showed that bamlanivimab, when given early in the disease course, may help patients clear the virus and reduce hospitalizations.Lilly said that it targets manufacturing of up to 1 million doses of bamlanivimab 700 mg by the end of 2020 – with 100,000 doses ready to ship within days of EUA authorization – for use around the world. The supply of Lilly's antibody therapy is expected to increase substantially beginning in Q1 2021, as additional manufacturing resources come online throughout the year.The drugmaker said that it has a robust, global supply chain in place to produce LY-CoV555 at five manufacturing sites worldwide.Shares of LLY have dropped almost 8% over the past month but are up more than 8% on a year-to-date basis. (See Eli Lilly’s stock analysis on TipRanks).Following LLY’s quarterly results, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan on Oct. 27 reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $164 price target, noting that the company maintained its FY 2020 sales and EPS guidance, and commented that the higher end of the revenue range would ""likely require the inclusion of moderate revenue from potential COVID-19 treatments, which is possible but not certain at this point.""“LLY shares have faced some pressure since the company announced 2Q 2020 results three months ago, and we would expect further pressure given the disappointing 3Q 2020 results,” Divan wrote in a note to investors.Overall, the stock scores a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus.

2020-11-12,"U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Thursday that efforts are underway in the U.S. to push for the development of antivirals and other therapies for early intervention during the course of the COVID-19 respiratory illness.  Fauci's comments come days after the United States authorized emergency use of Eli Lilly & Co's bamlanivimab, the first experimental antibody drug for COVID-19 in patients who are not hospitalized, but are at risk of serious illness because of their age or other conditions.  ""Studies have shown that things like dexamethasone and remdesivir have very positive effects late in the course when people are hospitalized, even when they've been on ventilators and requiring oxygen,"" Fauci said at a webinar conducted by British think tank Chatham House.","Antivirals, therapies for early intervention need of the hour to tackle COVID-19 - Fauci"
2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The fight against Covid-19 got a big boost this week, with the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine showing much better-than-expected effectiveness in preventing disease in its first readout and Eli Lilly & Co.’s therapeutic antibody getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Other vaccines and treatments are likely to follow with similarly positive data. So far so good.But exactly how jubilant should we be? Answering this question depends in large measure on how quickly the virus mutates and finds a way to bypass vaccines and other approved therapies. How quickly it mutates, in turn, depends on our ability to slow the spread through responsible mitigation measures.Some background. Viruses mutate all the time. During the course of a single infection, a person can have coronaviruses with slight differences. If a vaccine or an antibody isn’t 100% effective in eradicating an infection, then even if it prevents disease it could still allow resistant clones to form. These clones could then spread to other people and undermine the efficacy of the vaccine or treatment.This isn’t theoretical. Denmark, one of the world’s biggest producers of mink skins, is in the process of culling its entire 17 million mink population after the virus found its way into herds at hundreds of the country’s farms. By virtue of their sheer numbers, the mink provided the virus with an opportunity to spread rapidly and mutate. Then, in exactly the same way that the virus first entered into the human population in China, it jumped back into humans. One variant of the Danish virus has the potential to be resistant to the very vaccines and therapies that we have just been celebrating.But we don’t need mink farms to generate mutations. A recent study from Emma Thomson, professor at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, and associates found a mutation that can bypass infection-fighting antibodies produced by some people. What this means is that there is one more reason to be concerned about the rapid spread of the coronavirus among humans: The more people get infected, the more likely it is for new versions of the virus to evolve. If the number of infections remains at current levels — or if it continues to rise — there is a risk that new mutations start to spread. Some of these new versions may even be able to reinfect people who had been infected before, a phenomenon that until now has been quite rare.Read More: Covid-19 Reinfections Are Real. Should You Worry?: Sam FazeliAlmost all vaccines in development target the current version of the virus, meaning that they should be effective in preventing the disease in a vast majority of people. However, if we allow the virus to spread, we risk further mutations, and, consequently, less effective vaccines.Should we put the Champagne back on ice? Definitely not. We can take comfort in that we have seen how effective a vaccine can be, at least based on early prevention of disease, and how quickly we can make one. And the beauty of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and another in development by Moderna Inc. is that they can be adapted to deal with new variants that develop. The same applies to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccines, with some caveats.The Danish experience suggests it’s critically important to stop the evolution of the virus before we even start vaccinating people. That means bringing to bear all mitigation tools, from testing and tracing to social distancing and masks. And we may need to keep up these practices after a vaccine has been deployed until we can be sure inoculations eliminate virus transmission. On top of all this, countries should keep a better eye on their animal populations so as to avoid another Danish mink situation. The more responsible we are with our behavior, the better the chance for a successful vaccine.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sam Fazeli is senior pharmaceuticals analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence and director of research for EMEA.

2020-11-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Canadian antibody-drug discovery platform AbCellera Biologics Inc. filed for an initial public offering, detailing plans for an antibody treatment for Covid-19 that it’s developing with Eli Lilly & Co.AbCellera in its filing Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission listed the size of the offering as $200 million, a placeholder that will likely change. The company will disclose the size and price range for the IPO in a later filing.The company’s antibody discovery platform provides “lab-on-a-chip” technology to help biopharmaceutical companies identify next-generation drug candidates.One of the most promising drugs in AbCellera’s pipeline is the monoclonal antibody treatment for Covid-19 that it’s co-developing with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly.Using a blood sample from one of the first patients in the U.S. to recover from Covid-19, AbCellera began screening more than 500 antibodies. The companies settled on one -- LY-CoV555 -- and Lilly scientists developed the antibody in less than three months.300,000 DosesThe therapy, known as bamlanivimab, received an emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Nov. 9 to treat people who have mild-to-moderate symptoms of Covid-19. Lilly anticipates manufacturing 1 million doses before the end of the year, and has already reached a deal with the U.S. government for 300,000 doses.AbCellera said it’s entitled to receive a specified percentage of proceeds that Lilly receives from these sales. AbCellera can also reap a total of $29 million from Lilly related to clinical and approval milestones, according to the filing.On Thursday, Vancouver-based AbCellera said in a statement that Peter Thiel had joined its board. Thiel, who is chairman of Palantir Technologies Inc. and also a Facebook Inc. board member, acquired a small stake in AbCellera earlier this year, people with knowledge of the matter said.AbCellera founder and Chief Executive Officer Carl Hansen, a former professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of British Columbia, owns a 26.3% stake in the company, making him the largest shareholder, according to the filing.Thermopylae Holdings Ltd. owns 26% of the shares, while DCVC Bio LP has a 12.4% stake and Viking Global Investors and its affiliates own 8%.Trump TreatmentMonoclonal antibodies are being developed by a handful of companies, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., AstraZeneca Plc, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc and its partner Vir Biotechnology Inc. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease doctor, has likened the treatments to a bridge to the time when vaccines are widely available. The class of drugs came into the spotlight when President Donald Trump received Regeneron’s experimental antibody after he became infected.Apart from the newly authorized Covid-19 antibody therapy, AbCellera has built a broader portfolio with hundreds of programs. The company became profitable during the nine months ended Sept. 30, according to its filing. It had net income of $1.9 million on revenue of $25 million.The offering is being led by Credit Suisse Group AG, Stifel, Berenberg, SVB Leerink, BMO Capital Markets. AbCellera plans to list its share on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ABCL.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Covid-19 Treatment Developer AbCellera Biologics Files for IPO

2020-11-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Vir Biotechnology Inc.’s stock has lost some of its luster after quadrupling earlier this year as competition heats up for Covid-19 antibody therapies. Yet its chief executive officer is looking ahead to the next viral scourge.With two well-heeled competitors ahead of it, Vir has pared a February surge to a still impressive 115% leap this year. Eli Lilly & Co.’s antibody treatment received an emergency use authorization on Nov. 9 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s therapy got its nod over the weekend. Vir’s medicine is unique because it targets a variety of coronaviruses, CEO George Scangos said.It “has the potential not only to be effective against Covid-19, but it has a reasonable chance of also being effective against the next coronavirus outbreak,” Scangos said in an interview. An interim look at late-stage data for VIR-7831 is expected in January.Regeneron has touted its two-antibody cocktail as being better than single-antibody treatments like those from Lilly or Vir. Yet Scangos, a former Biogen Inc. chieftain, said that while Lilly and Regeneron’s medicines block the ability of the virus to infect cells, the virus could evade these antibodies by mutating.‘Babe Ruth’“Would you rather have two random baseball players or Babe Ruth?,” he said. “It’s not just the number but the quality and the characteristics of the antibody.”Vir’s antibody was developed not from a Covid-19 patient but from one who’d recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which is also caused by a coronavirus. The company chose an antibody that also works against Covid-19 and Scangos postulates that it responds to something in the SARS and Covid viruses that hasn’t changed over years of viral evolution.He also sees potential advantage for Vir’s antibody in its engagement of part of the immune system where Lilly and Regeneron’s molecules have had less potent activity.Baird’s Madhu Kumar, the only analyst with a sell-equivalent rating on Vir, is skeptical. He said this particular component of Lilly and Regeneron’s antibodies may be what led to some safety signals and “could trigger inflammatory cascades that could be detrimental to patients.” This particularly concerns hospitalized patients, which Vir is still studying, Kumar told Bloomberg.Email requests for comment to Lilly and Regeneron weren’t returned.Much of Kumar’s skepticism is tied to Vir’s valuation. Even after the stock pulled way back from a Feb. 27 record, it’s still has more than doubled this year. He’s also wary of the market for antibodies in general because successful vaccine results from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE as well as Moderna Inc. have blunted its longer term “tail value.”Outside of Covid-19, Kumar has a positive view on Vir. “There’s a real company behind this,” he said, calling out Vir’s hepatitis B RNAi platform. Vir’s stock slipped as much as 3.2% in early Tuesday trading.Others on Wall Street take a more optimistic view with five analysts deeming it a buy, and one with a hold rating. The average analyst price target of $55 suggests the Street expects shares may almost double over the next 12 months.GlaxoSmithKline Plc is also a believer and has invested $250 million in San Francisco-based Vir. The duo are in a deal to pursue not only Covid-19 but future coronaviruses using CRISPR screening technology and artificial intelligence to find new compounds.(Updates to add shares in eleventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Vir Biotech CEO Says His Covid-19 Medicine Offers Promise for Next Outbreak

2020-12-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vaccines are a crucial tool in the fight against Covid-19, so it’s great news that the U.K. on Tuesday became the first country to begin mass inoculations using a new shot developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. This vaccine and another developed by Moderna Inc. are set for early approval in the U.S. soon, and there are a handful of additional vaccines on the way. But even if they are as effective in the real world as they look in clinical trials, they can’t change the course of the pandemic overnight, and may not be able to entirely stop the spread of the virus. We need reinforcements.It will take months for Covid-19 vaccines to reach a large enough percentage of the population to create “herd immunity” — and that’s assuming they win the public’s trust and the vaccination effort goes smoothly. Manufacturing enough doses may not be as easy as the headline deals with various countries suggest. There are also questions around how long immunity to Covid-19 may last. And vaccines may come up short in the really frail or elderly, especially those with preexisting conditions. Worst of all, the virus may mutate around our vaccines and start re-infecting people. That’s one reason public health officials have called for continued social distancing and masks even after the vaccination effort is in full force.If vaccines aren’t a silver bullet and won’t be widely available at first even as case loads keep rising, then that makes Covid-19 treatments -- drugs that reduce hospitalizations and death, and even help ward off the virus — just as important in battling the pandemic. The easier they are to take, the better. The good news is, there are several promising therapies in use and more in development. But the biggest game-changers are still months away. Here’s where things stand.To date, companies and clinicians have been somewhat successful in their quest for therapies. For instance, Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir, Eli Lilly & Co.’s baricitinib and the generic steroid dexamethasone have all been shown to reduce hospital stays and improve recovery speeds. Dexamethasone also appears to cut the risk of death. Another new group of therapies called monoclonal antibodies, which mimic the body’s response to infection, have worked relatively well in reducing hospitalizations in high-risk patients. Two such treatments, one from Lilly and another from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., have been approved for use so far, though as my colleague Max Nisen has written, there are some questions around Lilly’s therapy and how best to use it. Also, both of the new drugs require medically supervised intravenous infusions and may only be effective for a few months, requiring repeat IV visits that could burden health systems.Related: These Covid-19 Vaccines Are Safe, Right?: Sam FazeliWithout taking anything away from the above achievements, all of these drugs fall short of what’s really needed to tackle the disease and prevent hospitalizations: either oral antivirals that target the virus’s ability to copy itself, or long-duration antibodies that can be used as viable preventatives in people who are not able to use or respond to vaccines. These treatments are coming, but they’re in earlier stages of development, so we need to wait. There’s progress, though.AstraZeneca Plc is working on an infusion cocktail of two antibodies that may be effective for six months to a year and has been engineered to reduce the risk of the treatment making the disease worse. Initial data is expected in the first half of 2021. There is also Vir Biotechnology Inc. which, working with GlaxoSmithKline Plc, is developing two antibodies with potential to have long durability. Vir has also designed one of the antibodies in a way that could leave an immune “memory” behind like a vaccine. The first antibody is in a late-stage trial with data expected in the first quarter, while the second has yet to enter trials.What would truly step up our efforts to fight the pandemic is a safe oral antiviral drug. Merck & Co. and Pfizer are in hot pursuit of this. These are drugs that are designed to interfere with the virus’s ability to make copies of itself, and they work in much the same way as hugely successful anti-HIV and anti-HCV drugs. But, just like vaccines and antibodies, we have to keep a close eye on the virus and assess any mutations that render the drugs inactive. Both HIV and HCV therapies use cocktails of drugs for exactly this reason. Merck and partner Ridgeback Therapeutics are expected to publish data from a small Phase II trial of their drug, molnupiravir, before year-end, while bigger Phase III trials will report in 2021, starting with Merck’s in the first half of the year.As we ramp up the immense machinery that is required to get the global population vaccinated against the coronavirus, we will continue to need therapeutics.

2020-12-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Diabetics getting the highest dose of Eli Lilly & Co.’s tirzepatide experienced dramatic weight loss in a late-stage study, and more than half of those patients saw their blood-sugar levels fall back to a normal range.Lilly jumped as much as 5.5% to the highest since August, reversing a premarket slide as investors continued to digest data that included a high number of people stopping treatment in the study. Shares of rival Novo Nordisk A/S closed 2.5% higher in Copenhagen, the biggest gain in over a month.Diabetes medicines are big business and with the obesity crisis driving nearly $150 billion a year in medical costs in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drugmakers big and small are looking for solutions. Medicines that can potentially reverse the disease as well as help people lose weight could bring in billions of dollars in new revenue.Lilly is looking to extend its diabetes franchise beyond the blockbuster Trulicity, which is expected to generate more than $5 billion in revenue this year. Trulicity belongs to an increasingly competitive class of drugs, called GLP-1, that includes Novo’s Ozempic for diabetes and Saxenda for obesity, as well as AstraZeneca Plc’s Bydureon. Tirzepatide targets not only the GLP-1 receptor, but also a second target known as GIP. That dual action could potentially make Lilly’s medicine even more potent.Participants in Lilly’s study lost as much as 11% of their body weight, or just over 20 pounds (9.5 kilograms), with the highest dose of the experimental medicine, according to the initial results. Blood sugar as measured by A1C levels was trimmed by about 2%. At the highest dose, 52% of participants had A1C levels below 5.7%, which many clinicians consider to be a non-diabetic range.Side EffectsThe number of participants that stopped treatment ranged from 9.1% to 22% across the various doses, compared with 15% for people getting a placebo. Lilly said much of the discontinuations were due to concerns over the pandemic or personal reasons rather than adverse events. The study showed participants getting tirzepatide had a higher incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea than those getting the placebo.Less than 7% of discontinuations across the different arms of the study were due to adverse events and lower than what was seen in earlier studies, Jamie Croaning, Lilly’s global brand development leader, said in an email. He viewed the results as encouraging and said they were “comparable” to other drugs in the class.“The blood sugar improvements for the product appear best in class,” said Chris Schott, an analyst with JPMorgan. He added that the high dropout rate impacted the analysis and further data will be needed to quash bearish concerns, but overall Lilly has “a highly competitive asset in tirzepatide.”(Updates shares, adds chart, details in third and fourth paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Lilly Jumps After Results From Next Generation Diabetes Drug

The offering raised $483 million before commissions and expenses, making it the biggest Canadian pharmaceuticals IPO on record and the second-largest Canadian initial offering announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.AbCellera is riding a wave of interest in companies whose products may be used to combat the pandemic.

If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Eli Lilly, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Recap Eli Lilly reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.54/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $1.71/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: Plug Power  * ROCE Insights For Arvinas(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To assess the safety and effectiveness of their Covid-19 vaccines, BioNTech SE, Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. sponsored clinical trials overseen by independent boards that recruited tens of thousands of participants, randomly assigned them to receive vaccines or placebos and waited to see if there was a discernible difference in outcomes between the two groups.With the rapid spread of the new coronavirus in the U.S. this fall, they didn’t have to wait long — and the results were stunning. In both trials, about 95% of those who developed Covid symptoms were in the placebo group, meaning that the vaccines appeared to be 95% effective.A chart from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration briefing document illustrates that effectiveness perhaps more clearly than the percentages do. It shows the cumulative incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 cases in the days following the first dose of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (in blue) versus a placebo (in red).The chart for the Moderna vaccine is nearly identical. What both show is that for the first 10 days or so after getting a shot, people in the placebo and vaccine groups were infected with the virus at nearly identical rates. After that, the placebo recipients kept on getting Covid-19 at the same pace, while those who received the vaccine hardly got it at all.These results don’t bring absolute certainty about how well the vaccines will work, or for how long, or what if any long-term side effects they might bring. But they provided convincing enough evidence to persuade the FDA to grant emergency-use approvals for both, with multiple peer agencies abroad taking similar steps, and to offer realistic hope that the pandemic could be over by summer.If only most of the other virus-related studies delivered results like that! Consider the new mutation of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) that was first identified in the U.K. in September and about which epidemiologists began ringing alarm bells last month. It seems to be more contagious than earlier variants — how else could it have so quickly become the country’s dominant strain? But is it 70% more contagious, as originally estimated? Or 56% more, as one quick-turnaround study concluded last month? Or something more like 10% to 20%, which some experts still hold out hope for?We’ll probably never know for sure. There’s no plausible and ethically defensible method for comparing the contagiousness of different virus variants in the controlled way that vaccines are tested, plus the exact answer just isn’t that important. Far more crucial is whether existing vaccines can stop it. The early thinking is that they can, and we should get a lot more information on that over the next couple of months.So it goes with the state of knowledge on Covid-19. There’s certainly a lot of it: 254,798 Covid-related articles, working papers and other publications had been produced as of Tuesday, according to the Dimensions database maintained by Digital Science & Research Solutions, Inc., with 7,871 clinical trials completed or in the works. But there are huge differences in the reliability, importance and durability of the findings.At one end are large, randomized controlled trials such as the vaccine studies. The great strength of that RCT research method, which physicians first started dabbling with in the 1700s and developed into its modern form in the decades after World War II, is that researchers can hold more or less everything equal except for the vaccine or other treatment being tested, allowing them to draw clear connections between cause and effect.Those connections are seldom made as clear as they have been in the BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials, though. The one other big Western vaccine trial for which results have been released found the vaccine developed at the University of Oxford and produced by AstraZeneca Plc to be 70.4% effective. Subjects who were erroneously given a half-dose on their first shot seemed to be better protected than that, but that result may necessitate new trials to determine that it’s not a fluke.Meanwhile, the large-scale Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy (known by the portmanteau “Recovery”) trials in the U.K. have so far found three of the four treatments studied, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir, to deliver “no clinical benefit” and the fourth, dexamethasone, to reduce deaths by about one-third among patients already on ventilators. Trial results of new antibody therapies from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co. seem to indicate improvements in outcomes of 50% or more, but the trials have been small and there are still lots of questions about how to maximize the effectiveness of the treatments.Go from pharmaceuticals to the so-called “non-pharmaceutical interventions” — such as masks and distancing — used to slow the pandemic, and things rapidly get more complicated and muddled. In many cases RCTs just aren’t practical, and even when they are they face obstacles that trials of shots and pills generally don’t.Norwegian public-health researcher Atle Freheim tried to set up an RCT last spring on the effect of school closures on the spread of Covid, for example, but the country’s health minister, while agreeing that it was a good idea, said (in Freheim’s paraphrase) “it would be too difficult to get popular support for it.”In Denmark, a large group of researchers did succeed in conducting an RCT on the protective benefits of face masks this April through June, but it was tough to draw any conclusions from it. Just 46% of those who were given disposable surgical masks and instructed to wear them outside the home reported following those instructions every week, with another 47% saying they did so most weeks — making the trial a test perhaps more of adherence to mask mandates than of mask effectiveness. Low incidence of the disease in Denmark during the study period also made it hard to produce meaningful results, as did the fact that the study wasn’t even testing what is generally represented to be masks’ main benefit: keeping mask wearers from infecting others.“Statistical insignificance and/or too-small effect measured are the most likely outcome as an artifact of the study’s design, regardless of the true effect of masks,” three public-health researchers argued in a letter posted online well before the results were published. Sure enough, the study’s authors ended up reporting that while members of the mask group were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections or antibodies than those in the non-mask control group, the difference (1.8% versus 2.1%) wasn’t statistically significant.Most evidence on masks thus comes not from RCTs but from simple observation of how masks affect air flow, as well as studies that compare real-world Covid-19 outcomes where and when masks are widely used with those where and when they aren’t. The latter approach has great limitations, though, compared to an RCT where every variable but one can be held constant. One early study that made big claims for the effectiveness of masks by comparing the spread of Covid-19 in different parts of the U.S., published in June in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, “ignores other clear differences in disease control policy between these areas,” wrote the same three researchers cited above, along with several dozen others, in a letter requesting retraction of the article (it hasn’t been retracted).Still, I would guess that all the signatories of that letter also believe that masks are effective in the fight against Covid-19. Noah Haber, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University’s Meta-Research Innovation Center and a ring-leader of both letter-writing efforts, certainly does. Which begs the question of why. As Haber said last month when I sought him out for advice on weighing Covid evidence, “One of the things that I get asked a lot, especially with masks, is ‘Okay, these studies are bad. What’s a good one that you’re basing all of your opinions on?’”While there are definitely better mask studies than the one discussed above, there is none that delivers results anywhere near as convincing as the BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials. Instead, as Haber said in an article for Wired, there is “a collection of evidentiary bits and pieces; and when these are taken all together they say that masks are certainly somewhat effective — maybe even very effective — at slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.”Also key, in my opinion, is that the cost-benefit analysis for masks is a bit like Pascal’s wager on the existence of God. If they do in fact work the gains are huge, while if they don’t the cost of having worn them for nine or 12 months is relatively modest.This isn’t true of some of the other non-pharmaceutical interventions used to combat Covid: closing schools and banning indoor dining and entertainment are extremely costly, and while the big shift to remote work has brought benefits as well as costs, it’s had wrenching economic consequences for urban downtowns and transit systems. Yet for the most part we’re also having to make do with “a collection of evidentiary bits and pieces” to arrive at such decisions.As someone who has been struggling since starting to write about the pandemic 10 months ago with how to weigh that evidence, I can attest that there’s no simple answer. Relying on scientific journals to sort things out tends to disappoint. As has been made clear by decades of often-contradictory published studies on whether consuming this, that or the other food or beverage is likely to make you live longer or die young, many top journals have a bias for bold and surprising study results over judiciously expressed uncertainty.Since April, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium hosted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has provided a happy corrective by evaluating the strengths and limitations of hundreds of Covid-related studies, and developments elsewhere in scientific publishing suggest that such open peer review will become more common. Haber and five other researchers have also recently organized a systematic review of Covid-19 policy evaluation studies to determine whether they at least “meet basic requirements for study design.” And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after often being muzzled by President Donald Trump’s administration, already seems to be returning to its proper role as expert and mostly independent weigher of evidence.None of that, though, can remove the uncertainty and error inherent in figuring out what to do about a fast-moving disease. At the moment, governments are beginning to announce new rounds of school shutdowns, non-essential business closures and other tough measures to combat the spread of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant that seems to be a lot more contagious than the old one. Can they be sure this is the right approach? No, not yet at least.It’s quite clear that reducing people’s contacts with other people slows the spread of the disease, but the question of which policies most efficiently accomplish this has generated a cacophony of answers. A group of mostly Vienna-based researchers published an effectiveness ranking of Covid-19 government interventions in November that put canceling small gatherings first and closure of educational institutions second, but the evaluation for the Johns Hopkins research compendium offered a long list of reasons why the conclusions could be off.In conjunction with the arrival of seemingly very effective vaccines, though, there is at least a logic to taking drastic measures aimed at slowing the spread of a more-contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant until a big enough share of the population is vaccinated that it slows down automatically. Waiting for certainty isn’t really practical in a pandemic.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2021-01-11,"Stocks ended lower Monday as Democrats in Congress filed an impeachment charge against President Donald Trump, while the number of coronavirus cases continued to climb.

2021-01-11,"Shares of Eli Lilly and Co  gapped higher today on news of promising results from their Phase 2 study of donanemab, an antibody that targets a modified form of beta amyloid called N3pG, for Alzheimer's disease (AD).",Here's Why Eli Lilly Broke to the Upside
2021-01-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Alzheimer’s disease is a grim reality for many people as they age, with one in 10 U.S. seniors older than 65 diagnosed with some form of dementia related to the ailment, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Nothing on the market can effectively treat the disease, let alone halt its relentless progress, so a working therapy is akin to the holy grail for drugmakers and their investors.Against this backdrop, Eli Lilly & Co. released data on Monday from a small phase II clinical trial for its antibody drug, called donanemab, that showed significant slowing of decline for patients in early stages of the disease, compared with those who received a placebo. This was a surprise and investors cheered the news, sending Lilly’s shares up more than 11% and adding almost $20 billion to the company’s market value. Shares of Biogen Inc., which is working on an Alzheimer’s drug targeting similar problems in the brain as Lilly’s treatment, also got a boost. Is this reaction justified? Sadly, as much as I would love to say yes, the answer is no, not yet. Here is why.First, it’s about how the trial was designed and what it was meant to show. Lilly’s trial sought to gauge changes in both cognition and daily function of patients, which is different from other trials of Alzheimer’s candidates, which sought to measure one or the other, or both but separately. That makes it hard to compare. And it’s difficult to draw a firm conclusion about the results without more data that can help to explain any nuances related to this new measuring stick. The trial also missed some of its secondary goals, which included some of the more standard ways of measuring the efficacy of drugs for Alzheimer’s.Next, while the trial showed a slowing in decline by 32% compared with a placebo over 76 weeks, it was set up under the assumption that it would show a 50% reduction. As such, showing only 32% may actually be viewed as a failure. This is an early trial with a new drug mechanism in a disease that is poorly understood, so we should be more forgiving. But even so, and more important, it’s not clear that reducing the decline by a third is really meaningful in the long-term evolution of the disease. We simply need more detailed data.msg msg fazeliAs for there being any connection to Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug, called aducanumab, that’s also tenuous. While the Lilly drug targets a similar enemy in the brain, namely amyloid and amyloid plaques, there are subtle but important differences in what type of amyloid it attacks. So there is no direct connection.Everyone wants to get a drug that can help us manage this awful disease, but it’s still too soon to celebrate. We need more data and better trials to prove they are worth the clinical and financial risks.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sam Fazeli is senior pharmaceuticals analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence and director of research for EMEA.

2021-01-11,"Shares of Biogen Inc.  gained 5.6% in trading on Monday after another drugmaker shared positive clinical data about an experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment that is similar to a Biogen therapy under review by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly & Co.  on Monday said its investigational drug, donanemab, slowed cognitive decline in patients with early forms of Alzheimer's in a mid-stage clinical study. The Lilly and Biogen drug candidates are in the same class of therapies. Both therapies focus on beta amyloid, which has been a somewhat controversial target for drug developers trying to figure out how best to treat people with Alzheimer's disease. The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve Biogen's drug, aducanumab, by March 7. ""Though reported results are limited, today's topline is likely to reignite the bull debate on the amyloid hypothesis,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams told investors on Monday. ""However, we believe key differences between donanemab and aducanumab and questions remain."" Biogen's stock is down 9.8% over the last year.

2021-01-11,"Looking at Q3, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) earned $1.28 billion, a 6.81% increase from the preceding quarter. Eli Lilly also posted a total of $5.74 billion in sales, a 4.4% increase since Q2. Eli Lilly earned $1.20 billion, and sales totaled $5.50 billion in Q2.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Eli Lilly's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, Eli Lilly posted an ROCE of 0.26%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on LLYROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Eli Lilly is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Eli Lilly, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Recap Eli Lilly reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.54/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $1.71/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * A Look Into Eli Lilly's Price Over Earnings(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Lilly has not only potentially found an effective drug, but also understood how to properly design its clinical trials to demonstrate that effect in the right patient population, Divan said. The fact that Lilly was able to generate statistically significant results on the primary endpoint in a relatively small trial bodes well for the absolute differences when the full data is released, as well as the clinical meaningfulness of those results, the analyst said.The full data is set to be released March 13 at the 2021 International Congress on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease, he said.Related Link:  The Week Ahead In Biotech: FDA To Issue Decisions On Merck And Aurinia Drug Applications The Lilly story is already robust with multiple recent positive developments in the areas of diabetes and oncology, Divan said.Additionally, there are a number of additional pipeline data releases this year, including pivotal data from lebrikizumab and mirikizumab and additional clinical data from tirzepatide and Jardiance, the analyst said.Since expectations from these data releases, especially lebrikizumab and mirikizumab, aren't too high, Divan sees the possibility for further upside.Lilly is also expected to release additional Phase 2 Alzheimer's data from its tau antibody zagotenemab, the analyst said.LLY Price Action: At last check, Lilly shares were rallying 3.99% to $198.43.Related Link:  Attention Biotech Investors: Mark Your Calendar For January PDUFA Dates Latest Ratings for LLY  DateFirmActionFromTo  Jan 2021MizuhoUpgradesNeutralBuy  Dec 2020Wolfe ResearchUpgradesPeer PerformOutperform  Nov 2020MizuhoMaintainsNeutral    View More Analyst Ratings for LLY   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Why Aclaris, Tenax, Gritstone, Merus, Minerva And Celyad Are Rallying Today  * The Daily Biotech Pulse: GSK, Vir To Start COVID-19 Antibody Study, Novartis In-Licenses BeiGene's Cancer Drug, Earnings Preannouncements Continue(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-26,"Trial met primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints with high statistical significanceResults from more than 1,000 high-risk patients were consistent with previous dataIn November, Lilly submitted a EUA request to the FDA for etesevimab and bamlanivimab together for mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients, which remains under review by the FDAFindings from BLAZE-4 trial provide data on lower doses of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together SHANGHAI, China, Jan. 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Junshi Biosciences (HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180), a leading innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies, announced today that etesevimab (JS016 or LY-CoV016) 2800 mg and bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 2800 mg together significantly reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths (collectively, “events”) in high-risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19, meeting the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 BLAZE-1 trial, according to the company’s global partner Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY). Across 1,035 patients, there were 11 events (2.1 percent) in patients taking therapy and 36 events (7.0 percent) in patients taking placebo, representing a 70 percent risk reduction (p= 0.0004). There were 10 deaths total, all of which occurred in patients taking placebo, and no deaths in patients taking etesevimab and bamlanivimab together. Etesevimab and bamlanivimab together also demonstrated statistically significant improvements on all key secondary endpoints, providing strong evidence that the therapy reduced viral load and accelerated symptom resolution. In the trial, the safety profile of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together was consistent with observations from other Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials evaluating these antibodies. Serious adverse events were reported at a similar frequency in the etesevimab and bamlanivimab together and placebo groups. Across multiple clinical trials, Lilly has collected safety and efficacy data in more than 4,000 participants treated with its neutralizing antibodies, either bamlanivimab alone or bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. Additionally, initial results from the ongoing BLAZE-4 trial provide viral load and pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic data which demonstrated lower doses, including etesevimab 1400 mg and bamlanivimab 700 mg together, are similar to etesevimab 2800 mg and bamlanivimab 2800 mg together. Lilly plans to explore even lower doses of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together, as lower doses can maximize available supply to treat more patients, allow potential for subcutaneous dosing, and potentially reduce the burden on healthcare system and patients through reduced infusion times. Bamlanivimab is authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients, and it has also been granted authorizations in several additional countries. In November, Lilly submitted a request to the FDA for emergency use authorization for etesevimab and bamlanivimab together as another treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. It remains under review by the FDA. Lilly has received feedback from front-line nurses and doctors administering these infusions regarding the complexity and time requirements for preparation and administration. As a result, Lilly is working with the FDA to potentially reduce infusion times to be as short as 16 minutes – a significant reduction from the currently authorized time of 60 minutes. This potential change is aimed at simplifying administration and reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Lilly will continue to accelerate the manufacturing of etesevimab in collaboration with Amgen, providing up to 1 million doses of etesevimab for administration with bamlanivimab by mid-2021 – including more than 250,000 doses in the first quarter – for use around the world. About etesevimab（JS016）Etesevimab (JS016 or LY-CoV016) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody, which specifically binds to the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein receptor binding domain with high affinity and can block the binding of the virus to the ACE2 host cell surface receptor. Point mutations were introduced into the native human IgG1 antibody to mitigate effector function. Lilly licensed etesevimab from Junshi Biosciences after it was jointly developed by Junshi Biosciences and Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science (IMCAS). Junshi Biosciences leads development in Greater China, while Lilly leads development in the rest of the world. Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study (NCT04441931) of etesevimab in healthy U.S. volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. Junshi Biosciences has completed a similar Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in China and has initiated Phase 1b/2 trials in COVID-19 patients globally. About bamlanivimab（LY-CoV555）Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients. About BLAZE-1BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion. In the Phase 2 portion of BLAZE-1, cohorts of mild to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, were randomized to one of three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg), etesevimab 2800 mg plus bamlanivimab 2800 mg, or placebo. Results from the Phase 2 cohorts of BLAZE-1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association. In the Phase 3 portion of BLAZE-1, the combination therapy arms enrolled mild to moderate, recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization, studying etesevimab 2800 mg plus bamlanivimab 2800 mg versus placebo. The primary outcome measure for the Phase 3 portion of the BLAZE-1 trial was the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalizations or death from any cause by day 29. The key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to day 7 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, persistently high SARS-CoV-2 viral load on day 7, time to sustained symptom resolution, and COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from any cause from baseline by day 29. Additional endpoints include change from baseline in viral load at other time points, symptom improvement, symptom resolution, as well as safety. The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll up to 3,300 participants. About BLAZE-4BLAZE-4 (NCT04634409) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone, and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, at various doses, versus placebo for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll an estimated 1,000 participants in the United States and Puerto Rico. The primary outcome measure is percentage of participants who have a viral load greater than 5.27 at day 7. Additional endpoints include change from baseline to Day 7 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through Day 29, as well as safety.

The combination of bamlanivimab, which has received emergency use authorization in the U.S. as a standalone treatment for some COVID-19 patients, and the still-investigational etesevimab is being tested in about 1,000 patients. Lilly said the combo therapy also helped reduce viral load and sped up recovery from symptoms. The Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing an emergency use application for the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. , which also has an authorized COVID-19 antibody treatment, shared new clinical data evaluating whether that drug can prevent COVID-19 infections on Tuesday, as well.

2021-01-27,"Eli Lilly & Co. said new data showed that treatment with two of its antibody therapies lowered COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients by 70%. Specifically, Lilly (LLY) said that the results of the Phase 3 trial testing the treatment of bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) and etesevimab (LY-CoV016) together met the primary endpoint. Among the 1,035 patients, there were 11 events, or 2.1% in patients treated with the therapy and 36 events, or 7% in patients taking placebo, representing a 70% risk reduction. There were 10 deaths among patients taking placebo, and no deaths in patients taking bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. “Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together also demonstrated statistically significant improvements on all key secondary endpoints, providing strong evidence that the therapy reduced viral load and accelerated symptom resolution,” the drugmaker said. Bamlanivimab is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. ""These exciting results, which replicate positive Phase 2 data in a much larger set of patients, add valuable clinical evidence about the role neutralizing antibodies can play in fighting this pandemic. While the preliminary nature of Phase 2 results from COVID-19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies may have limited acceptance of treatment, these Phase 3 data further strengthen the available evidence,"" said Lilly's chief scientific officer Daniel Skovronsky. ""These data further support our belief that bamlanivimab and etesevimab together have the potential to be an important treatment that significantly reduces hospitalizations and death in high-risk COVID-19 patients.” “Bamlanivimab alone is authorized for emergency use as a treatment for high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in the US. and widely available for use,"" Skovronsky added. (See Eli Lilly’s stock analysis on TipRanks). Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan believes that the released data “should support FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the combo and further boost Lilly's sales and earnings for 2021 (and potentially 2022).” However, Divan, who has a $222 price target on the stock with a Buy rating, added that it is “not likely a driver of the long-term investment thesis on the stock.” “We expect the combination to play an important role in treating patients over the next several months/quarters until the COVID-19 vaccines are more broadly administered and the pandemic starts to be brought under control,” the analyst wrote in a note to investors. “We continue to recommend Lilly shares on the back of a well-diversified product story that is poised to deliver above market topline and bottom-line growth over the next decade, with further upside possible in the coming weeks as the full Phase 2 donanemab data are presented on March 13.” Shares of LLY, which have advanced 28% over the past month, are up 53% over the past year. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock. That’s with an average analyst price target of $194.90, indicating 8.4% downside potential lies ahead over the coming year. Meanwhile on TipRanks' Smart Score system, LLY scores a 9 out of 10, implying that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-01-28,"On Friday, January 29, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) will release its latest earnings report. Here is Benzinga's outlook for the company. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect Eli Lilly's EPS to be near $2.36 on sales of $7.29 billion. In the same quarter last year, Eli Lilly reported EPS of $1.73 on revenue of $6.11 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on LLY The Wall Street estimate would represent a 36.42% increase in the company's earnings. Sales would be up 19.23% on a year-over-year basis. Eli Lilly's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 1.71 1.56 1.48 1.51 EPS Actual 1.54 1.89 1.75 1.73 Revenue Estimate 5.91 B 5.76 B 5.51 B 5.90 B Revenue Actual 5.74 B 5.50 B 5.86 B 6.11 B Stock Performance Shares of Eli Lilly were trading at $207.78 as of January 27.

2021-02-10,"Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY)’s antibody treatments have received an emergency use authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration. What Happened: The federal regulator issued the EUA for the two drugs, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, to be administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in both adults and children above 12 years of age. The treatment is meant for those who test positive for COVID-19 and are at high risk of progressing to a severe version of the disease. Bamlanivimab, in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GILD) remdesivir, received FDA emergency approval for use in hospitalized patients back in November last year. The EUA clears the way for the use of the two drugs in those who are 65-years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions. The EUA is based on a clinical trial that established that the two antibody treatments when given together cut the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients by 70%, as per the FDA. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are not authorized for hospitalized COVID-19 patients or those who require oxygen therapy due to the viral disease. Why It Matters: Lilly is partnering with Amgen to make up to one million doses of etesevimab for administration with bamlanivimab by mid-year, the company said in a statement. One-hundred thousand doses are ready immediately and an additional 150,000 doses would be available through the first quarter. In December, it was reported that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: REGN) antibody cocktail showed positive results in early-stage trials of hospitalized patients. See Also: Regeneron To Supply US With Another 1.25M COVID-19 Treatment Doses Regeneron reported sales of $145.5 million for its REGN-COV antibody cocktail for COVID-19 last week.

2021-02-10,"Etesevimab and bamlanivimab administered together is authorized for treatment of recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who are high risk for progression to severe COVID-19More than 250,000 doses manufactured throughout Q1 2021; up to 1 million doses by mid-2021FDA authorizes shortened infusion time for this neutralizing antibody therapy authorized for emergency use SHANGHAI, China, Feb. 10, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Junshi Biosciences (HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180), a leading innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for investigational etesevimab (JS016 or LY-CoV016) 1400 mg and bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg together, according to the company’s global partner Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY). This therapy is authorized for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients aged 12 and older who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. Etesevimab and bamlanivimab should be administered together via a single intravenous infusion as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset. In addition, the FDA has authorized infusion times for bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together to be as short as 16 or 21 minutes, respectively – a significant reduction from the previously authorized time of 60 minutes. This change has been made in response to feedback received from front-line nurses and doctors administering these infusions and is aimed at reducing the burden on the healthcare system. The EUA is based on Phase 3 data from the BLAZE-1 trial, announced on January 26, 2021, which demonstrated that etesevimab and bamlanivimab together reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and death by 70 percent. These data replicate earlier results, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (IF=45.54), in a much larger group of patients. The most common adverse event more often reported for patients receiving etesevimab and bamlanivimab together versus placebo was nausea on the day of infusion. While Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials evaluated a range of doses of bamlanivimab alone and etesevimab and bamlanivimab together, data demonstrated consistent and similar clinical effects among all doses studied. Additionally, initial results from an ongoing Phase 2 study provided viral load and pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic data which demonstrated etesevimab 1400 mg and bamlanivimab 700 mg together produced similar effects to those observed in the Phase 3 trial with etesevimab 2800 and bamlanivimab 2800 together. Together, these data provide confidence in the authorized dose, which expands available supply to help more patients without sacrificing potential efficacy. The FDA grants EUA to provide availability of a medicine that may help diagnose, treat or prevent a life-threatening disease when no adequate and approved alternatives are available. This administration of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together is authorized only for the duration of the declaration, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. The authorization is temporary and does not replace the formal review and approval process. The administration of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together remains investigational and has not been approved under a Biologics License Application (BLA). Evaluation of its safety and efficacy is ongoing in clinical trials. Data from these studies will be used to support a future BLA submission for the treatment. Bamlanivimab alone is authorized in numerous countries, while bamlanivimab and etesevimab together is currently authorized in the U.S. and Italy. Lilly will continue working with global regulators to make these therapies available around the world. In an effort to help as many patients as possible, Lilly will continue to accelerate manufacturing of etesevimab for use around the world. Lilly, in collaboration with Amgen, plans to manufacture up to 1 million doses of etesevimab for administration with bamlanivimab by mid-2021. There are 100,000 doses ready immediately and an additional 150,000 doses will be available throughout the first quarter. Lilly anticipates procurement and allocation of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together will mirror the process followed for bamlanivimab alone – making the therapy available directly to governments for allocation based on unmet needs. Global allocation will aim to ensure access for patients with high unmet need, no matter where they live. Dr. Ning LI, CEO of Junshi Biosciences said: “Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Junshi Biosciences and the IMCAS have been dedicated to the co-development of neutralizing antibodies. Now, with Lilly, our global partner’s participation, the innovative therapy is authorized for use in the U.S. and Italy, while unremitting endeavors to meet the extensive anti-COVID-19 needs are made by the local and overseas medical industry. The data of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together provides strong evidence for the safety and efficacy of JS016, thus giving us confidence to proceed with the clinical trial of JS016, which is ongoing in several countries and regions, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, etc."" About etesevimab（JS016）Etesevimab (JS016 or LY-CoV016) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody, which specifically binds to the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein receptor binding domain with high affinity and can block the binding of the virus to the ACE2 host cell surface receptor. Point mutations were introduced into the native human IgG1 antibody to mitigate effector function. Lilly licensed etesevimab from Junshi Biosciences after it was jointly developed by Junshi Biosciences and the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science (IMCAS). Junshi Biosciences leads development in Greater China, while Lilly leads development in the rest of the world. Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study (NCT04441931) of etesevimab in healthy U.S. volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. Junshi Biosciences has completed a similar Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in China and has initiated Phase 1b/2 trials in COVID-19 patients globally. About bamlanivimab（LY-CoV555）Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients. About BLAZE-1BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or together with etesevimab for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion. In the Phase 2 portion of BLAZE-1, cohorts of mild to moderate, recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, were randomized to one of three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg), etesevimab 2800 mg plus bamlanivimab 2800 mg, or placebo. Results from the Phase 2 cohorts of BLAZE-1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association. In the Phase 3 portion of BLAZE-1, the combination therapy arms enrolled mild to moderate, recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization, studying etesevimab 2800 mg plus bamlanivimab 2800 mg versus placebo. The primary outcome measure for the Phase 3 portion of the BLAZE-1 trial was the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalizations or death from any cause by day 29. The key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to day 7 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, persistently high SARS-CoV-2 viral load on day 7, time to sustained symptom resolution, and COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from any cause from baseline by day 29. Additional endpoints include change from baseline in viral load at other time points, symptom improvement, symptom resolution, as well as safety. The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll up to 3,300 participants. About BLAZE-4BLAZE-4 (NCT04634409) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone, and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, at various doses, versus placebo for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll an estimated 1,000 participants in the United States and Puerto Rico. The primary outcome measure is percentage of participants who have a viral load greater than 5.27 at day 7. Additional endpoints include change from baseline to Day 7 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through Day 29, as well as safety.

2021-02-17,"Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) have announced topline results from two Phase 3 studies, SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-5, evaluating Tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes. Data showed that Tirzepatide led to significant A1C and body weight reductions from baseline after 52 (SURPASS-3) weeks and 40 (SURPASS-5) weeks, respectively. Using the efficacy estimand, the highest dose of tirzepatide (15 mg) reduced A1C by 2.37% and body weight by 12.9 kg (13.9%) in SURPASS-3, and reduced A1C by 2.59% and body weight by 10.9 kg (11.6%) in SURPASS-5. At the highest dose, 62.4% of SURPASS-5 participants achieved an A1C of less than 5.7%, the level seen in people without diabetes. In both studies, the overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to that of the well-established glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most commonly reported adverse events and decreasing with continued dosing. Tirzepatide is an investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist that integrates both incretins' actions into a single molecule. SURPASS-3 was a 52-week trial comparing the efficacy and safety of three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) to titrated insulin degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control on stable doses of metformin with or without an SGLT-2 inhibitor. SURPASS-5 was a 40-week trial comparing the efficacy and safety of three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) compared to placebo, both as an add-on to titrated insulin glargine with or without metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes. The complete SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-5 data have not yet been evaluated but will be presented at the American Diabetes Association's 81st Scientific Sessions and published in a peer-reviewed publication in 2021.

Eli Lilly also posted a total of $7.44 billion in sales, a 29.59% increase since Q3. In Q3, Eli Lilly earned $1.28 billion, and total sales reached $5.74 billion. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Eli Lilly's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, Eli Lilly posted an ROCE of 0.34%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on LLY ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Eli Lilly is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. In Eli Lilly's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions. Q4 Earnings Recap Eli Lilly reported Q4 earnings per share at $2.75/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.35/share.

2021-02-26,"SHANGHAI, China, Feb. 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Junshi Biosciences (HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180), a leading innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies, announced today that the U.S. government has agreed to purchase a minimum of 100,000 doses of etesevimab (JS016 or LY-CoV016) 1400 mg and bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg together, according to the company’s global partner Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY). Etesevimab and bamlanivimab together recently received emergency use authorization for the treatment of recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently updated the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines to recommend the use of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab for the treatment of outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of clinical progression. The agreement is for $210 million and doses will be delivered through March 31, 2021. The U.S. government will have the option to purchase up to an additional 1,100,000 doses through November 25, 2021, under the same terms as the base agreement and subject to agreement from Lilly, product availability and the medical need in the U.S. The government has said it will provide neutralizing antibodies at no out-of-pocket cost to patients, although healthcare facilities may charge a fee for the product's administration. The federal government directs the distribution of etesevimab and bamlanivimab together. About etesevimab（JS016）Etesevimab (JS016 or LY-CoV016) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody, which specifically binds to the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein receptor binding domain with high affinity and can block the binding of the virus to the ACE2 host cell surface receptor. Point mutations were introduced into the native human IgG1 antibody to mitigate effector function. Lilly licensed etesevimab from Junshi Biosciences after it was jointly developed by Junshi Biosciences and the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science (IMCAS). Junshi Biosciences leads development in Greater China, while Lilly leads development in the rest of the world. Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study (NCT04441931) of etesevimab in healthy U.S. volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. Junshi Biosciences has completed a similar Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in China and has initiated Phase 1b/2 trials in COVID-19 patients globally. About bamlanivimabBamlanivimab is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing, and results from the Phase 2 cohorts of BLAZE-1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab alone or bamlanivimab and etesevimab together in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

The companies were informed that VIR-7831 could continue to the next phase of the ACTIV-3 trial as no reported safety signals were observed. But the sensitivity analyses of the available data raised concerns about the magnitude of potential benefit.

Shares of the healthcare company rose 3.2% to close at $206.92 on March 5. Eli Lilly (LLY) said that bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab administered together with etesevimab can be used for treating COVID-19 in patients aged 12 years and older. Notably, these patients do not require supplemental oxygen for COVID-19 and have a high risk of getting severe COVID-19. The EMA’s opinion followed Phase 2 and Phase 3 results from Eli Lilly’s BLAZE-1 trial, which demonstrated the efficacy of both antibodies. (See Eli Lilly stock analysis on TipRanks) Eli Lilly CEO David A. Ricks said, “Today’s CHMP recommendation is another important milestone in our efforts to extend access to antibody therapies for patients with COVID-19 around the world, providing a pathway for more EU countries to enable use of potentially life-saving treatments for COVID-19.” “We hope this opinion will accelerate those reviews and authorizations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where Lilly is prepared to provide doses at greatly reduced costs or free of charge,” Ricks added. On March 4, Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $228 (10.2% upside potential). “With limited patent exposure over the next decade and the potential for continued margin expansion” the analyst “continues to see Lilly as a best-in-class story in large cap biopharma.” Divan believes “the premium valuation the stock trades at is more than justified.” The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $225.67 and implies upside potential of 9% to current levels over the next 12 months. Shares have gained more than 52% over the past year.

2021-03-15,"Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY) gave an in-depth look at its donanemab Phase 2 trial in Alzheimer’s disease at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases. As announced in January, the drug met the trial’s primary goal by slowing down the rate of cognitive and daily function decline by 32% compared to a placebo. But it missed the mark on several secondary tests. Donanemab is a monoclonal antibody that was designed to target tau and amyloid plaque, Alzheimer’s-associated proteins. New data also showed that donanemab slowed the accumulation of tau and substantially cleared amyloid plaques from the brains of the majority of patients. Alzheimer’s in the trial sustained the same level of cognitive skills after 18 months of donanemab treatment as the placebo group showed after 12 months. On secondary goals of the study, while patients on the drug did numerically better on various other cognitive and functional scales than placebo, the differences weren’t statistically significant in some cases. The new data maintains its safety meets standards; noted side effects had included “amyloid-related” swelling in the brain.

2021-03-18,"In a webinar with the American Medical Association, the FDA acting commissioner Janet Woodcock said that the U.S. government is not distributing Eli Lilly And Co’s (NYSE: LLY) bamlanivimab in California, Arizona, and Nevada amid prevalent COVID-19 virus variant. A Lilly spokesperson, when spoke to Endpoints News, said, “We recognize the U.S. government has made the decision to no longer allow direct ordering of bamlanivimab alone in California, Arizona, and Nevada due to concerns about the prevalence of the ‘California’ variant, with the specific L452R substitution found in B.1.429/B.1.427 lineages. Importantly, preclinical data from our labs demonstrate that the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab maintains its neutralizing effect against this variant, specifically.” Woodcock suggested that the initial rollout of these monoclonal antibodies “wasn’t the greatest” because it followed Gilead Sciences, Inc’s (NASDAQ: GILD) antiviral remdesivir distribution model, and “hospitals were in no position to give out monoclonals.” John Farley, director of the FDA’s office of infectious diseases, said that the three authorized monoclonal antibodies remain active against the variant originating in the U.K. Still, there are “other, more worrisome variants,” and physicians should expect to see more information on those soon. Last month, the U.S. government agreed to purchase a minimum of 100,000 doses of therapy combining bamlanivimab and etesevimab, for $210 million to be delivered this month. Last week, data from Phase 3 study showed that the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab significantly reduced COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19.

2021-03-22,"Ahead of an advisory committee meeting scheduled for later this week, the FDA released its in-depth review of Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and Eli Lilly And Co’s (NYSE: LLY) tanezumab, an anti-NGF osteoarthritis drug. What Happened: Potential FDA approval for tanezumab still looked rocky as the regulator casts doubt over its safety. The primary safety worry is rapidly progressing osteoarthritis, dubbed as RPOA, which the companies are aware of, reports FDA in a regulatory document. FDA explained, noting, “The review team has concerns that the Applicant’s proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is not sufficient to mitigate the risk of RPOA and would not ensure that the benefits of tanezumab outweigh the risks of RPOA.” In spite of the risk mitigation strategies in clinical studies, the risk of developing RPOA remained concerning, as a large number of patients with RPOA required total joint replacements (TJR) - 15% of patients progressed to TJR following RPOA1, and 60% of patients with RPOA2 progressed to TJR. The FDA said that though tanezumab proved to be effective, its effect size “is modest, and there is no convincing evidence of a superior efficacy of tanezumab over NSAIDs.” Why It Matters: Tanezumab has been in development for more than 15 years, across 41 clinical studies and at least 43 formal meetings with the FDA. Another concern was that the drug could cause abnormal peripheral sensation characterized as (mostly) mild, self-limited mononeuropathy (singular nerve damage), with the most common coming out as carpal tunnel syndrome. Price Action: PFE shares are trading 1.2% higher $35.96, and LLY is up 0.52% at $185.25 in market trading hours on the last check Monday.

2021-03-23,"Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. gained 1.1% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the drug maker said its COVID-19 antibody cocktail still reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by about 70% among COVID-19 patients at high risk of hospitalization when prescribed a lower dose. The drug, REGEN-COV, first received emergency authorization in November as a 2,400 milligram dose administered intravenously; the new data examines a 1,200 milligram dose and found that the lower dosing regimen had comparable clinical results. Regeneron said it plans to request that the lower dose be added to the emergency use authorization. It also said that a Phase 2 trial testing even lower doses of the antibody treatment administered subcutaneously demonstrated a reduction in viral load among study participants. There has been slower-than-expected utilization of authorized antibody treatments for COVID-19 that were developed by Regeneron and Eli Lilly & Co. , the companies have said.

2021-03-26,"An expert panel of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has rejected Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) application to approve their experimental drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain, citing safety risks and an inadequate plan to manage them. What Happened: The FDA’s Joint Arthritis Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee voted 19-1 that the drug Tanezumab’s risks outweigh its benefits for patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain, Pfizer and Eli Lilly said in a statement Thursday. A single voting question focused on whether the proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for tanezumab will ensure its benefits outweigh its risks. The Advisory Committee’s discussions were based on Tanezumab’s Biologics License Application (BLA) currently under review by the FDA. The agency is not required to follow the recommendations of the committee, but it usually does. Pfizer is seeking FDA approval of Tanezumab given by injection every two months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain in adult patients for whom the use of other analgesics is ineffective or not appropriate. Pfizer said that while it disappointed with the outcome, it will continue to work with the FDA as the agency continues its review of the company’s application.

Currently-available treatment options for moderate-to-severe OA do not meet the needs of all patients. Tanezumab has been in development for more than 15 years. In 2013, Pfizer and Lilly entered into a collaboration to develop and commercialize tanezumab. If approved, the companies will jointly commercialize tanezumab in the U.S. and Pfizer will be responsible for commercialization activities outside of the U.S. Price Action: Pfizer shares closed about 0.2% higher on Thursday at $35.67, while Eli Lilly shares closed 1.6% higher at $183.09.

2021-03-26,"Looking at Q4, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) earned $1.99 billion, a 55.84% increase from the preceding quarter. Eli Lilly also posted a total of $7.44 billion in sales, a 29.59% increase since Q3. Eli Lilly earned $1.28 billion, and sales totaled $5.74 billion in Q3. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Eli Lilly's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, Eli Lilly posted an ROCE of 0.34%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on LLY Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. In Eli Lilly's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions. Q4 Earnings Recap Eli Lilly reported Q4 earnings per share at $2.75/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.35/share.

Patients treated with baricitinib were 2.7% less likely than those receiving standard of care to progress to ventilation or death, a difference that was not statistically significant. The trial, involving 1,525 patients, showed 38% reduction in mortality by Day 28 in patients that were treated with baricitinib plus standard of care, including corticosteroids and remdesivir.

Baricitinib-treated patients were 2.7% less likely than those receiving standard of care to progress to ventilation (non-invasive or mechanical) or death. Treatment with baricitinib in addition to SoC (which included 79% receiving corticosteroids and 19% receiving remdesivir, with some receiving both) resulted in a significant reduction in death from any cause by 38%. A numerical reduction in mortality was observed for all baseline severity subgroups of baricitinib-treated patients. It was most pronounced for patients receiving non-invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (17.5% versus 29.4% for baricitinib plus SoC versus SoC. The frequency of adverse events was generally similar in the baricitinib and placebo groups. Severe infections and venous thromboembolism occurred in 8.5% and 2.7% of patients treated with baricitinib, respectively, versus 9.8 % and 2.5% on placebo.

2021-04-09,"Shares of Provention Bio nosedived 40.3% in pre-market trading on Friday as the biopharma company suffered a regulatory setback when the company received a notification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its drug, teplizumab, used for the prevention or delay of clinical type 1 diabetes. Provention Bio (PRVB) said that the FDA had “identified deficiencies that preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements/commitments at this time” in the review of PRVB’s Biologic License Application (BLA) for teplizumab. Provention also said that FDA had reviewed the data regarding the drug comparability produced by its partner, AGC biologics, for the teplizumab BLA with a similar drug manufactured by Eli Lilly (LLY) and said that the data was not comparable and indicated that additional data would be required. This could result in a delay in Provention’s plans to commercialize teplizumab. Provention Bio’s CEO and Co-Founder Ashleigh Palmer said, “While we believe the FDA’s initial feedback will likely result in a delay in timelines within which teplizumab has the potential to be approved by FDA and be made available for at-risk T1D patients, we believe in the comparability of the drug product produced by our partner AGC biologics with Eli Lilly manufactured product. We look forward to working closely with the Agency to address its additional data requirement, so we can deliver teplizumab to patients as soon as possible.” “Additionally, we remain enthusiastic about the clinical efficacy and safety data submitted in connection with the BLA in support of teplizumab’s potential to address the high unmet needs of at-risk T1D patients and look forward to meeting with the FDA’s Advisory Committee and hearing from patients, KOLs [key opinion leaders] and other key stakeholders next month,” Palmer added. The US FDA intends to conduct an Advisory Committee meeting on May 27 and will continue the review of clinical data submitted in Provention’s BLA application. (See Provention Bio stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the announcement, Oppenheimer analyst Justin Kim lowered the price target from $29 to $18 and reiterated a Buy on the stock. Kim commented, “""Additional data” required for addressing the FDA’s raised issues will remain the focus as Provention approaches its May 27 AdCom. During the ongoing review period, we expect additional clarity on the scope of activities (and timeline to complete these objectives) that may be required to address the agency’s concerns. Prior to this clarity, we anticipate volatility for the shares.” Overall, the rest of the Street is bullish on the stock in line with Kim’s view with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $24.60 implies that PRVB shares have 152.7% upside potential to current levels.

2021-04-09,"Provention Bio Inc (NASDAQ: PRVB) revealed it had received a notification on April 2 from the FDA stating that the agency has identified deficiencies that preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements/commitments at this time. Notably, the FDA expressed concerns over teplizumab pharmacokinetics data and comparability when Lilly first put teplizumab into clinical trials. Regulators assert the PK profiles from Provention’s studies and Lilly’s trials are not the same and asked for more data on April 2. According to the regulators, such concerns mean that the candidate cannot start post-marketing and label discussions. Investors responded sourly to the news after Thursday’s bell, with the stock crashing almost 40%. Provention responded, noting it is “willing to discuss these issues.” Regulators had scheduled a May 27 AdCom to discuss the experimental drug, which will continue as planned. The drug has a long history. In 2007, Eli Lilly And Co’s (NYSE: LLY) and MacroGenics Inc (NASDAQ: MGNX) partnered to develop and commercialize teplizumab. In 2010, teplizumab failed a pivotal late-stage diabetes study undertaken by Eli Lilly, and it handed the rights back to MacroGenics. In 2018, Provention Bio stepped in and in-licensed the drug from MacroGenics, hoping to bring the experimental drug back from the dead. PRVB used teplizumab as their lead drug for a $56 million IPO filing. Teplizumab is an investigational anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody for the delay or prevention of clinical type 1 diabetes (T1D) in at-risk individuals.

2021-04-09,"The National Institutes of Health on Thursday recommended that patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of worsening disease should be treated with monoclonal antibody cocktails. The recommendation was issued by the NIH's COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s casirivimab-imdevimab combination therapy and Eli Lilly & Co.'s bamlanivimab-etesevimab. (Prescribing bamlanivimab as a standalone treatment is no longer recommended because of its lack of efficacy against some of the new variants.) The panel said that in regions where variants are more common, it recommends using the Regeneron cocktail rather than the Lilly one, because it includes bamlanivimab. Lilly and Regeneron both received emergency authorizations for the first round of monoclonal antibody therapies in November; since then, both companies have released additional clinical-trial data and the authorizations for those products have been updated. Executives at both companies previously told MarketWatch that there has been slower-than-expected utilization of these therapies. Since the start of the year, Regeneron's stock is down 1.4%, shares of Lilly are up 8.1%, and the S&P 500 has rallied 8.%.",NIH recommends Lilly and Regeneron's combination antibody treatments to people with mild and moderate COVID-19

2021-04-16,Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has requested the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoke the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg alone. Lilly made this request due to the evolving variant landscape in the U.S. and the full availability of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. This request is not due to any new safety concern.,Lilly requests revocation of emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab alone to complete transition to bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S.
2021-04-16,"Eli Lilly and Co. said Friday it is seeking a revocation of the emergency use authorization granted by U.S. regulators for its bamlanivimab antibody treatment for COVID-19 alone in order to complete the transition to bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. ""Lilly made this request due to the evolving variant landscape in the U.S. and the full availability of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together,"" the company said in a statement. The combination has proved to be more effective in neutralizing the COVID-19 variants that have been detected in the U.S. after first emerging in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil, and that are more infectious than the original virus. The combination is also better at treating the rapidly growing B.1.427/B.1.429 California strain that currently accounts for 50% of virus cases in California and over 10% of cases in other states. ""In the U.S., bamlanivimab alone should no longer be administered. However, sites of care should not dispose of bamlanivimab supply; instead, they should order etesevimab to pair with it,"" said Lilly. Bamlanivimab was the first neutralizing monoclonal antibody to receive an EUA from the FDA as a treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 and more than 400,000 patients have been given it. Lilly estimates that has prevented more than 20,000 hospitalizations and at least 10,000 deaths during the peak of pandemic cases. Lily expects that in collaboration with Amgen Inc. , it can manufacture sufficient supply of the two antibodies to meet global supply needs.

This study, called COV-BARRIER included 1525 patients and did not meet statistical significance on primary endpoints. Dr. Doron Sagman, Eli Lilly (LLY) Vice President of R&D and Medical Affairs for Canada said, “While we hoped to see a significant benefit on the composite primary endpoint, we were pleased to find a 38 percent reduction in all-cause mortality by day 28 in patients treated with baricitinib, the largest reported effect on mortality to date for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.” Sagman added, “We will continue to evaluate our findings and remain committed to exploring treatment options for COVID-19.” (See Eli Lilly stock analysis on TipRanks) In the study, the patients treated with baricitinib showed a 38% reduction in death by day 28. The company plans to publish detailed results of this study in the coming months and to also share data with regulators in the US, EU, Canada, and other geographies to determine the next steps to use the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients under hospitalization. Additionally, the drug is also under evaluation to treat COVID-19 patients together with remdesivir in the ACTT-4 trial. On April 7, Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a $228 price target (20.5% upside potential). Divan said he was “impressed by the Phase 2 donanemab data” and beyond donanemab sees “multiple potential upside drivers to the Lilly story, including diversified near-term top-line growth, continued margin expansion, and a promising pipeline with limited patent loss exposure.” Consensus among analysts is that Eli Lilly is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 1 Hold.

2021-04-27,"Tucked in its Q1 earnings release, Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) has scrapped its plans to seek approval for mirikizumab in psoriasis. The company decided not to enter the market despite the anti-IL-23p19 antibody outperforming Novartis AG’s (NYSE: NVS) Cosentyx in a Phase 3 trial last year. AbbVie Inc’s (NYSE: ABBV) anti-IL-23 antibody Skyrizi and Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE: JNJ) Tremfya and Stelara, which hits IL-12 and IL-23, are already approved in plaque psoriasis. Despite being behind the already approved anti-IL-23 drugs, Lilly moved mirikizumab into a Phase 3 program that included three psoriasis studies, including a long-term study. “We look forward to bringing mirikizumab to market to provide patients with an additional treatment option that has the potential to provide near-complete or complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 90 and PASI 100, with sustained results at 52 weeks,” Lilly USA president Patrik Jonsson noted when data were announced. The company said it would no longer submit mirikizumab for approval in psoriasis in any geography. The decision leaves mirikizumab development focused on ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Last month, Lilly showed mirikizumab improved clinical remission in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had been failed by conventional or biologic therapies. The company posted weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings and cut its forecast for full-year adjusted profit due to lower demand for its COVID-19 drugs.

2021-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- As Indian authorities and hospitals struggle to cope with record Covid-19 infections and deaths, companies ranging from the nation’s biggest conglomerate to global giants like Amazon.com Inc. are stepping in to help ease the crisis.Reliance Industries Ltd., controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, the Tata group, global drug giants like Gilead Sciences Inc., technology titans such as Alphabet Inc. are all rushing in supplies and funds. Blackstone Group Inc.’s Chairman Stephen Schwarzman said his private equity firm is committing $5 million to support India’s Covid relief and vaccination services to “marginalized communities.”With haunting visuals of mass funeral pyres, long lines of ambulances outside overcrowded hospitals, and desperate pleas on social media for oxygen canisters, the unfolding tragedy is prompting some of the biggest corporations to organize aid for a country they view as a crucial market with 1.3 billion consumers. India’s federal and state governments, grossly unprepared to tackle the latest coronavirus wave, have also encouraged the non-state sector to help narrow the vast chasm of shortages.Most critical has been the unavailability of medical oxygen, and a bulk of the efforts have been directed at boosting supplies. Ambani’s Reliance, Tata Steel Ltd., ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India and JSW Steel Ltd. are among manufacturers that have diverted thousands of metric tons of liquid medical oxygen from their plants. Others such as consumer giant ITC Ltd. and the Adani Group -- controlled by India’s second-richest man Gautam Adani -- are shipping in cryogenic tanks, and offering portable concentrators and generators.‘More Important’“Saving lives is more important than producing steel,” said Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Steel, the largest producer of the gas among the country’s non-state companies in India.State-owned refiners Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. chipped in with oxygen production as well.Underscoring the severity of the latest wave, official data on Wednesday showed new infections rose by 360,960 in the prior 24 hours, while 3,293 additional lives were lost -- both a record for the country. India has the world’s fastest growing caseload. Total confirmed virus cases reached 18 million while deaths topped 200,000, and reports indicated both the numbers may be under counted.As the enormity of India’s challenges shook the world, Indian-origin technology industry czars have extended help. Earlier this week, Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla tweeted an offer to fund public hospitals and import planeloads of bulk oxygen or supplies to India to improve stocks. A day later Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he was “heartbroken” by the situation in India and Microsoft is using its voice, resources and technology to aid relief efforts and help purchase oxygen concentrators.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a tweet that Google and its employees would rush medical supplies and support non-profits in a country that’s a sizable market for its products. His company has proffered some $18 million in funding.Amazon is harnessing its global logistics supply chain to airlift 100 ICU ventilator units from the U.S., and the equipment will reach India in the next two weeks, the company’s local chief Amit Agarwal said in a blog post. The e-commerce giant will help install, maintain and train personnel to use the machines, he said.Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone maker would donate relief but didn’t provide details.Remdesivir AvailabilityGlobal drugmakers including Merck & Co. are licensing critical drugs to Indian generics manufacturers. Eli Lilly & Co. offered to donate Covid antibody drugs, while Gilead this week said it would expand the availability of Remdesivir, a drug used to treat symptoms of Covid-19.Several industry lobby groups are also jumping in. A collective of members of the prominent U.S. India Business Council plans to supply 20,000 oxygen concentrators in the coming weeks.

2021-05-05,"Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE: LLY) employees have reportedly accused a factory executive of altering documents required by the FDA to downplay quality control problems at Branchburg, New Jersey plant producing its COVID-19 treatment. Reuters notes that an unsigned report was filed last month, which claims that the executive rewrote findings by Lilly’s technical experts to make the conclusions appear more favorable to the company.

2021-05-20,"Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY) has reported topline data from Phase 3 SURPASS-4 clinical trial evaluating tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk. Measuring the GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide against titrated insulin glargine, Lilly reported that its program hit all primary and key secondary endpoints across three dosage levels. The primary endpoint was measured at 52 weeks, and many participants continued treatment beyond 52 weeks, some up to two years. It’s the fifth Phase 3 study Lilly has completed for the candidate, and now it plans to submit details to regulatory authorities later in 2021. Participants began the study with an average baseline A1C of 8.52%, and each of the treatment arms lowered the levels at a significant rate compared to titrated insulin glargine, Lilly said. At one year, the changes for each escalating dose were -2.24%, -2.43% and -2.58%, against -1.44% for the control. Tirzepatide reduced weight from the average baseline by 8.1%, 10.7%, and 13% for the three arms, respectively. Meanwhile, participants in the titrated insulin glargine arm saw a mean weight increase of 2.2% relative to the baseline. Lilly noted that the overall safety results in the study were consistent with the profile of the GLP-1 class, with gastrointestinal side effects proving to be the most common such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Meanwhile, most people in the U.S. plan to spend the Memorial Day weekend much like before the pandemic, a Quinnipiac University poll showed.U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was too early to say whether England’s economy can fully reopen as planned on June 21, warning that the virus variant first identified in India continues to spread across Britain.Key Developments:Global Tracker: Cases top 168.5 million; deaths exceed 3.5 millionVaccine Tracker: More than 1.78 billion doses have been givenU.S. Spotlight: Blacks and Latinos suffer a disproportionate amount of Covid painSeychelles’s Covid mysteries pit anti-vaxxers against scientistsGeneration of Covid orphans at risk of exploitation in IndiaWhere are we in hunting for the coronavirus’s origin?: QuickTakeU.S. Covid Inequities Persist (3:07 p.m. NY)While things have improved for all Americans, Black people are still being hospitalized with Covid-19 at twice the rates of White people, according to Covid-Net, a hospital surveillance network for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The disparities reflect the same long-running inequities in health care and wealth that have contributed to higher rates of diabetes and obesity. But they also underscore the urgency for the U.S. to improve its vaccination campaign in the Black community.It’s clear that Black and Hispanic communities want the vaccines more than now-famously hesitant groups such as Republicans and White Evangelical Christians -- and yet they’ve received fewer by comparison.U.S. Vaccine Readiness Rises in Poll (2:45 p.m. NY)Most people in the U.S. plan to spend the Memorial Day weekend much like before the pandemic, while about one in four adults say they don’t plan to get vaccinated, according to a Quinnipiac University poll published Thursday.Those planning to get a Covid shot or already vaccinated rose to 72% compared to 68% in a poll published April 14. The share saying they don’t plan to get immunized declined to 23% from 27%, according to Quinnipiac.Asked if they’ll spend the Memorial Day weekend much the same way as before the pandemic, 73% agreed. President Joe Biden said Thursday that 50% of adults in the U.S. are fully vaccinated.California Plans to Boost Vaccinations (2:30 p.m. NY)Governor Gavin Newsom said he will announce “major efforts” this afternoon to encourage residents in the state to get vaccinated ahead of the California’s reopening on June 15.A total of 36.9 million vaccines have been administered, according to the state’s health department. California’s positive test rate remains at 0.9%.Chile Plans More Virus Debt (2:15 p.m. NY)Chile will tap bond markets to help finance $10.8 billion worth of fresh measures aimed at confronting a persistent coronavirus outbreak, Finance Minister Rodrigo Cerda said.Expanded aid for families and cash transfers to small companies announced by President Sebastian Pinera will enlarge the deficit, Cerda told Radio Futuro on Thursday. The measures will be paid for by windfalls from higher copper prices, the government’s sovereign funds and extra debt, he said.N.Y. Requires Paid Leave for Vaccine Side Effects (2:05 p.m. NY)New Yorkers that have side effects from the coronavirus vaccine can take a sick day without losing wages, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday.The announcement comes as vaccine rates are plateauing in the state and nationally. Over 10 million New Yorkers, about 64.4% of those aged 18 or older, have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and nearly 9 million are fully vaccinated, Cuomo said.North Carolina Passes 1 Million Cases (1:06 p.m. NY)North Carolina became the 10th U.S. state to pass 1 million Covid-19 cases, reporting another 849 infections on Thursday, state data show. Cases and hospitalizations have been falling steadily, though deaths have been relatively flat, passing 13,000 this week.Almost 43% of people in the state have received a first dose of vaccine, below a national average nearing 50%, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.Germany to Vaccinate Young Teens (12:17 p.m. NY)Germany plans to expand Covid-19 inoculations to children aged 12 and older starting June 7 as Europe’s largest economy seeks a way out of the pandemic.Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized that immunizations for children would be voluntary and wouldn’t impact school participation. The vaccine made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE would likely be approved for this age group in the coming days, she said Thursday after a meeting with leaders of Germany’s 16 states.U.K. Reopening ‘in the Balance’ (12:03 p.m. NY)U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the spread of the variant first identified in India means it’s too early to say whether stage four of the reopening of the economy in England can go ahead on June 21 as planned.A formal assessment of data on cases and hospitalizations will be published before June 14, Hancock told lawmakers, and the lifting of remaining restrictions will only happen “if it’s safe.”The U.K. on May 27 reported 3,542 more people tested positive, up from yesterday’s daily figure of 3,180.Portugal Battles New Surge (11:59 a.m. NY)Portugal’s government approved a series of measures to contain a surge in the number of cases in Lisbon and the Tagus valley, Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said after a cabinet meeting on Thursday.These measures include increasing the number of tests to detect and isolate people infected with the coronavirus in order to control the pandemic, Vieira da Silva said.Florida Cruise Cleared (11:55 a.m. NY)Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. said it had been cleared to resume cruises in the U.S. starting with a June 26 embarkation from Florida’s Port Everglades on Celebrity Edge, which is part of its Celebrity Cruises brand.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given cruise lines two paths back to the seas: they can require and verify that 95% of passengers and 98% of crew are vaccinated, or they can prove their Covid-safety to the government through no-revenue test voyages. In this case, Royal Caribbean is opting for the former, requiring everyone over 16 to present proof of vaccination, according to a statement.But Florida banned so-called vaccine passports, and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has insisted that the rule applies to cruise companies operating out of the state’s ports. It’s unclear how the cruise can sail from the Sunshine State, home of the world’s busiest cruise port, as long as both the CDC and Florida rules stand. Royal Caribbean and its competitors have already announced Alaska cruises in the coming months, but they avoid that conflict by departing from Seattle.Black Businesses Owners Turned to Fintech (11:15 a.m. NY)Black-owned businesses were much likelier than their peers to use online lenders than traditional banks when applying for U.S. pandemic relief loans, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.About one in four Black owners seeking a Paycheck Protection Program loan applied to a fintech company, more than twice the rate of Whites, Asians and Hispanics, the New York Fed said in a blog post, part of its Economic Inequality series.Sweden Easing on Track (10:42 a.m. NY)Sweden will go ahead with the planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions on June 1, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said at a press conference. The government’s assessment is that the pandemic situation isnow moving “in the right direction.”Qantas Weighs Free Flights (10:37 a.m. NY)Qantas Airways Ltd. is considering giving free flight vouchers or air miles to people who’ve had Covid-19 shots, joining a growing list of businesses offering vaccination incentives to kick-start global travel.Seychelles Risk Six Times Higher for Unvaccinated (10:36 a.m. NY)Seychelles, which has vaccinated a greater proportion of its population against the coronavirus than any other country, said unvaccinated citizens are six times more likely to develop Covid-19 than those who have taken the inoculations.The nation of 98,000 people has experienced a surge in infections even though 65% of the population have taken two doses of a vaccine. Most of those infected haven’t been inoculated, the health ministry said in a presentation on Thursday.Eli Lilly Get Subpoena (8:11 a.m. NY)Eli Lilly & Co. received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting documents related to a manufacturing site for its Covid-19 antibody drug.The drugmaker said in a filing Thursday that it has previously engaged external counsel to conduct an investigation of certain allegations relating to the plant in Branchburg, New Jersey and is cooperating fully with the investigation.Regulators raised concerns last year, requiring Lilly to vet its quality-testing data and other records of the plant.Johnson Hits Back (7:51 a.m. NY)U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson hit back at his former adviser Dominic Cummings, who alleged ministers failed to protect the public from the coronavirus and declared the premier is “unfit” for the job.Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a hospital, Johnson said some of the comments his controversial former aide made bore no relation to reality.India in Talks With Pfizer (7:48 a.m. NY)India is in talks with Pfizer to import its vaccine with a possible July start date, V.K. Paul, who heads the panel on the country’s vaccine rollout, said on Thursday. A key sticking point has been vaccine makers’ demand for indemnity protection against liabilities.“In the hot spot areas, around one in 10 of those in hospital are people who have had both jabs,” a function both of the protection the vaccine offers against the variant and the age profile of those who are catching the disease, Hancock said. “We will learn more about this in the forthcoming week or two.”South Africa Weighs More Curbs (5:37 p.m. HK)South Africa’s rising coronavirus infections puts pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa to reintroduce stricter lockdown measures.The country has been slow off the mark to administer vaccines, with the latest health department data showing just 761,903 people out of a population of almost 60 million have received the shots. The majority of cases are in the three most-populous provinces.Ireland Nears Vaccine Milestone (5 p.m. HK)Half of the adult population in Ireland will have received at least one dose of a vaccine by the end of the weekend, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said. He raised doubts over the vaccination pace going forward, warning of a “significant under-delivery” of the Janssen vaccine and “question marks” over deliveries of the AstraZeneca shot.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Florida Cruise Tests Rules; U.K. Opening in Doubt: Virus Update
2021-05-27,"The U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY) focused on alleged manufacturing irregularities and records tampering at Branchburg plant, reports Reuters. The plant manufactures Eli Lilly’s COVID-19 therapy and other drugs, three people familiar with the matter said. The probe represents a significant escalation of the government scrutiny on Lilly. Last week, Emergent BioSolutions Inc’s (NYSE: EBS) executives faced House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus related to its troubled Baltimore plant that ruined 15 million Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE: JNJ) COVID-19 vaccine doses. Today, the company received a subpoena from the Justice Department seeking documents related to the Branchburg factory. The company did not disclose anything more about the nature or focus of the investigation and said it was cooperating fully in the matter. Lilly said it had previously engaged external counsel to conduct an independent investigation of some allegations regarding the Branchburg plant. It submitted the same information to Reuters in response to the news agency’s questions. The investigation is in its earliest stages, the three people told Reuters, and the Justice Department has not accused Lilly or any of its employees of wrongdoing. The department could ultimately pursue criminal charges, seek civil sanctions, or close the probe without action.

2021-05-28,"The U.S. government said this week it is halting distribution of Eli Lilly & Co.'s COVID-19 antibody treatment in six states due to the growing prevalence of the P.1 and B.1.351 variants there. Lilly's combination therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab ""are not active against either the P.1 or B.1.351 variants,"" which were first identified in Brazil and South Africa, respectively, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response said Wednesday. Coronavirus cases associated with these variants now make up more than 10% of all cases in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachussetts, Oregon, and Washington. Instead, the agency recommends using Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s antibody treatment. This is not the first time there has been concern about bamlanivimab's effectiveness. The Food and Drug Administration in April pulled the emergency authorization for bamlanivimab as a standalone treatment over concerns about its effectiveness against variants. There are three authorized antibody cocktails in the U.S., developed by Lilly, Regeneron, and Vir Biotechnology Inc. /GlaxoSmithKline .
