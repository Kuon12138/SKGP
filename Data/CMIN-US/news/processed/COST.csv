During recent research trips we&apos;ve been impressed too, highlighting some of the best things retirees should buy at Costco as well as some of the warehouse club&apos;s best store-branded Kirkland Signature products. With annual membership fees ranging from $60 to $120, it&apos;s tempting to wring as much as you can from every Costco run: bulk packages of toilet paper, eggs in 24-packs, 10-pound bags of flour or a 12-pound Japanese Wagyu boneless ribeye roast (just $999.99).

  * 10 Oversold Stocks Due for a Bounce 



### Grocery Is Very Competitive

In mid-December, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares took a hit, after the warehouse behemoth missed first-quarter earnings estimates . 

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

&quot;There's been a little bit more retail competitive pressure out there, not only from supermarkets but Sam's as well,&quot; CFO Richard Galant said during the quarterly conference call Dec. 13. &quot;We've got good fresh sales numbers, but we -- like others -- our competitors are working in a little lower margin.&quot;

Don't sweat it if you own Costco stock. Very few retailers are as good as it is at adapting to market pressures. It will be fine. 

Over at Walmart and Target, both companies (note Galant's comment above about Sam's, a Walmart banner) are doing a good job grabbing grocery market share. 

Target's in the middle of transforming its grocery operations. In 2018, Target hired a couple of grocery executives to improve its food and beverage offerings in its stores. Also, it continues to grow private label grocery brands such as Archer Farms, to better compete with Walmart and Amazon. 

Target's looking strong heading into 2019.

Walmart's also making significant strides in the grocery game, something I alluded to in an August article about the company, noting that it had grocery pickup in more than 1,800 of its U.S. stores, a sign that part of its business is alive and well. 

And then there's Amazon.

Some experts believe Amazon's got a long way to go if it wants to satisfy the overall needs of grocery shoppers beyond delivering essentials or hard-to-find items.

While the statistics don't lie -- grocery shoppers spend an average of $200 a month with grocery delivery services such as Instacart compared to $74 per month at Amazon -- Amazon's combination of Prime with Whole Foods is bound to bear fruit in the years ahead. 

Don't you worry, Jeff Bezos and company will figure out how to leverage the two brands to grow grocery revenues. 

### Kroger Stock and the Delivery Market

There's no doubt that Kroger's faced an uphill battle against some of these non-traditional grocery providers. That said, it didn't sit still in 2018. 

For example, Kroger has launched a grocery delivery service in Arizona  that uses unmanned vehicles to deliver online orders to customers' homes through a partnership with Nuro, a Silicon Valley autonomous driving startup. 

The service costs $5.95 plus the order itself. There's no minimum order. Nuro's fleet of self-driving, unmanned vehicles, will provide same-day or next-day delivery. 

&quot;Nuro envisions a world without errands, where everything is on-demand and can be delivered affordably,&quot; Nuro President and co-founder Dave Ferguson said in the joint press release. &quot;Operating a delivery service using our custom unmanned vehicles is an important first step toward that goal.&quot;

What began in August as a self-driving Prius fleet with a person in the car for safety purposes completing more than one thousand deliveries has morphed into an unmanned service that should help continue to grow Kroger's digital sales. 

However, that's not the only thing Kroger's been doing to fend off the competition. 

It's also been renovating stores to make them more technologically efficient for both customers and employees, sending groceries through the mail, more private label brands and products, rolled out the company's meal kit Home Chef across the country, and many more. 

### The Bottom Line on Kroger Stock

The big fly in the ointment for Kroger shareholders is the company's profitability, which has taken a hit given the investments it's made on the digital side of its business. 

That's likely a temporary situation. Once some of the initiatives it was working on in 2018 are fully implemented along with future efforts like rolling out the unmanned delivery service, I'd expect operating profits to revisit the 3% range.

Trading at 12 times its forward P/E and yielding close to 2%, 2019 -- assuming the economy stays strong and the markets don't correct too much further -- could be the year Kroger stock revisits $40, something it hasn't done since 2015. 

As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Recent performance impresses  

Walmart (WMT) had impressive earnings in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. Walmart beat analysts’ expectations in the past three quarters. There was increased pressure on Walmart’s margins from its continued price invest to defend its market share, an unfavorable mix, and higher transportation costs.

Walmart’s bottom line benefited from the lower effective tax rate, the decline in the outstanding share count, and reduced interest costs. Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) had stellar bottom-line growth. However, the profit margins remained pressured due to value pricing and increased digital fulfillment costs.

## Outlook 

Buoyed by the better-than-expected performance in the first three quarters, Walmart increased its fiscal 2019 earnings outlook. Walmart’s bottom line is expected to be $4.75–$4.85 per share—up from its earlier guidance of $4.65–$4.80.

However, Walmart’s fiscal 2020 earnings are projected to decline by low-single-digits. Analysts expect Walmart’s EPS to decrease 2.6% in fiscal 2020, which reflects pressure on its margins. Excluding the Flipkart acquisition, Walmart expects its bottom line to increase by low to mid-single-digits. Walmart’s bottom line will likely benefit from improved sales and the lower outstanding share count. However, price investments in certain markets and an unfavorable mix, driven by increased e-commerce sales, are expected to remain a drag.

## Amazon’s physical store sales soared 250%

As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, Amazon (AMZN) is planning to open more Whole Foods stores across the United States in a move that will expand its physical store network.

Amazon is considering widening its physical store network at a time when its physical store sales are exploding. In the third quarter of 2018, its most recently reported period, Amazon’s physical store sales soared 250% YoY (year-over-year). In contrast, the company’s online store sales rose just 10% YoY in the period.

At $4.2 billion in the third quarter, physical store sales still make up just a tiny part of Amazon’s retail business. With more stores, though, Amazon could capture more retail dollars, particularly in the grocery market, which is currently dominated by traditional retailers.

## Amazon is chasing grocery dollars

According to data from Cowen cited by the Wall Street Journal, Amazon captured just 3.2% of US grocery spending through its Whole Foods subsidiary in 2017. In comparison, Walmart (WMT) captured a 21% market share, Kroger (KR) captured an 11.4% share, and Costco (COST) captured a 6.4% share. However, Whole Foods’ sales have increased since Amazon took over in 2017, and the business could do better with more outlets, as it now allows customers to order online and pick up in store.

In addition to Whole Foods, Amazon operates physical stores under the Amazon Go and Amazon 4-star brands. Amazon 4-star stores stock top-rated items based on the reviews of Amazon’s online customers. Alibaba (BABA) operates a supermarket chain under the Hema Supermarkets brand.

## Analysts’ expectations

Most of the analysts maintained a neutral outlook on Walmart (WMT) stock. Walmart will likely sustain the momentum in its comps due to higher traffic and the ticket size. Walmart’s expanded e-commerce offerings, value pricing, focus on merchandising, and easy returns are expected to drive the traffic. However, pressure on Walmart’s margins and increased competition are keeping analysts on the sidelines.

Analysts have a consensus target price of $107 per share on Walmart stock, which indicates an upside of 15.2% based on its closing price of $92.86 on January 3. In comparison, analysts have a target price of $83.47 per share on Target (TGT) stock, which implies an upside of 27.4%. Analysts have a consensus target price of $239 per share on Costco (COST), which indicates an upside of 19.3%.

## Rating summary 

Among the 32 analysts covering Walmart stock, 18 recommended a “hold,” while 14 recommended a “buy.” Analysts maintained a neutral outlook on Target. Among the analysts, 16 recommended a “hold” on Target stock, nine recommended a “buy,” and one recommended a “sell.”

Most of the analysts recommended a “buy” on Costco stock. Among the 28 analysts covering Costco, 17 recommended a “buy,” while 11 maintained a “hold.”

2019-01-09,"In a tumultuous 2018, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) suffered more than many other stocks. Best Buy stock was down more than 20%, while Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) were barely down. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) also was flattish and out-performed the S&P 500.

So the 2018 drag on BBY stock is not a general retail problem since those did better than the S&P. Investors clearly have issues with Best Buy. It can't be a matter of valuation, as BBY stock sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15. Compare that to Walmart's 54. So it is clear that traders are worried about BBY's prospects.

In 2018 and while equity markets were reeling with fears from tariff and rate hike headlines, consumer spending had been on fire. From that sense, retailers should have done better. The holiday shopping period was stronger than anticipated, especially in the U.S.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

BBY is the &quot;last man standing&quot; among electronic brick-and-mortar retailers, yet Best Buy stock is still struggling. Best Buy has made improvements. It was once considered to be the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) showroom store where people could touch the products before they bought it on AMZN.

This is no longer the case.

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



Consensus now is that BBY and other retailers are finally growing their online sales. In this case, they actually could be taking back some sales from AMZN. BBY is perhaps the only brick-and-mortar doing that. Macy's (NYSE:M) or J.C. Penny (NYSE:JCP) are not taking back their clients from Amazon; they are merely taking away from their own remaining foot traffic.

Nevertheless, Best Buy stock still faces a huge problem. Recovering its portion of the pie is one thing, but doing it in a profitable matter that is the ongoing challenge. AMZN built its empire on thin margins like Walmart did decades ago. BBY still has to prove it can compete like that on a similarly thin budget.

Onus is on BBY management to prove the viability of this strategy in the long term. So far, Wall Street is not giving them the benefit of this doubt. So I can't argue for the long-term investment in the stock today. But there still is an opportunity in 2019.

### How to Approach Best Buy Stock Today

Technically, Best Buy stock has more upside potential and could retest $65 per share. It has recently had a nice 20% rally off the lows, but it still has more room to go. The idea is that it probably won't have much resistance until it hits the prior ledge from which it fell apart in early December.

What supports this thesis is that the markets in general are in the process of repairing the crisis of sentiment that we've had all second half of 2018. So Best Buy stock will have the benefit of the general market lift to help it get there. The December employment report was extremely strong, so people in the U.S. are employed. So as long as that continues to be true, consumer spending will remain strong and the economy will be fine.

This would be a trading vehicle and I won't want to turn it into an investment. Meaning I would set appropriate stops below. I would also want to exit before the earnings event. I believe there will be too much uncertainty.

  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks Set to Charge Higher 



The 2018 holidays were great so BBY management will be under pressure to deliver on expectations. They'd better show it in the result late February. The March options prices are expecting a +/- $10 move up or down on the headline, so my upside target is within reach if I am correct in my thesis. But on the flip side, I should be ready for another dip below $50.

Other than a short-term scalp, I see no specific reason to chase it for the long term. If it cannot rally with record holiday sales, then I'd rather bet on stocks that have growth on their side. For retail I'd rather chase AMZN or  Costco (NASDAQ:COST). These two are up big even when markets have faltered.

With that said, let's get a look at some top stock trades for Friday.

### Macy's (M)

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Macy's (NYSE:M) stock made its direction pretty clear: Down. Shares are plunging almost 20% on the day after the company cut its full-year guidance and reported disappointing holiday sales results.

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



Down almost 20%, bulls had a chance to defend Macy's between $26 and $27, keeping it above a pivotal level. Below this level, I want nothing to do Macy's.

### Target (TGT)

Target (NYSE:TGT) shares slipped almost 4% on Thursday too, but not for the same reasons. The company reiterated its full-year outlook and reported strong holiday sales. But its CFO is stepping down.

That's causing some hesitation, but it's clear that Target is resonating with shoppers. The stock is holding up over $65, a key level. So long as that remains the case, bulls can stay long and look for an eventual challenge of the $74 the $76 area.

### Costco Wholesale (COST)

Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) are about flat on the day, outperforming the retail sector overall. However, after December's breakdown, the stock is still under pressure even though the recent numbers -- as usual -- are good.

So what do investors do?

Costco is in a &quot;best house in a bad neighborhood&quot; situation. At least in the short-term. Between $213 and $219, there's a decent amount of possible overhead resistance, while we have a rising wedge situation near current levels.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



It's possible for COST to push through all of these levels and challenge downtrend resistance (blue line). On a pullback, a decline to $190 is technically possible, but I want to give COST a few days to see how it shakes out. I don't have a lot of confidence in a long setup right now, especially if retail remains weak.

### Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)

Short of stocks like J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) and Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD), not many retailers have been worse than Bed Bath & Beyond (NYSE:BBBY). That's not stopping shares from popping 14% on the day though, after the company beat on earnings expectations and provided a better-than-expected outlook.

Shares are ramming right into the backside of downtrend support (blue line). Can it push though? Maybe, after a move like this. Should shares fail to push through resistance, look to see if they hold up near $13. If they do get through resistance, look for BBBY to rally to the 200-day moving average.

### 

### American Airlines (AAL)

American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) took a dive earlier this month after Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) issued worse-than-expected guidance. However, the stock held $30 on the downside, its lows over the past few months.

Then American slashed its guidance on Thursday, sending shares lower once again. Initially back down to $30, AAL has made up roughly half the day's losses. If it can push higher, this low should hold once again. In 2018, we highlighted AAL as one of the cheapest in the industry and with some of the best growth. Even after the guidance cut, that remains true for American Airlines and may very well draw in some buyers.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Are Run By Billionaires 



That said, should AAL lose $30, I wouldn't want to stick around. The trend is clearly lower, but if $30 holds, bulls may be all right. That said, the news isn't great and it's hard to see what catalysts will push the industry higher in the short term.

## Holiday sales

On January 10, Target (TGT) reported stellar holiday sales results due to its improved performance across all of the core product categories. The company invested in remodeling stores and expanding its fast delivery options.

Target’s comparable sales or comps rose 5.7% during November and December. The comps compared favorably to the 3.4% growth Target registered during the same period last year. Management stated that the comps have increased 9% in the last two years.

Target’s comparable sales were driven by higher traffic and an improvement in the average ticket size. Comparable digital sales (a key contributor to the comps growth) grew 29% led by an acceleration in its Store Pickup and Drive Up services. Target’s Store Pickup and Drive Up services rose 60% and accounted for ~25% of its digital sales during the holidays.

In comparison, Costco (COST) reported a strong set of numbers for November and December. Costco’s comps in the United States rose 12.2% in November. The comps increased 7.5% in December. We expect Walmart (WMT) to report strong comps for the holidays. Walmart has strengthened its e-commerce offerings and continues to attract value-driven shoppers.

Target reaffirmed its fourth-quarter comps growth outlook. The company expects its comps to rise 5%. Target’s adjusted earnings are projected to be $5.30–$5.50.

## What could hurt Target stock?

Despite reporting solid comps, Target stock was trading 2.5% lower during the pre-market session. Investors are concerned that Target’s growth came at the cost of its margins. Retailers are investing in price and the e-commerce platform to drive traffic. However, these growth measures are having a negative impact on the margins.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## TGT is likely to sustain its momentum in 2019

Target Corporation (TGT) reported strong financials in the first three quarters of 2018, and we expect it to end 2018 on a strong note and post stellar comps and EPS growth. Target is also expected to sustain the growth momentum in its sales and earnings in 2019 led by the expansion of its digital offerings. However, its growth rate is expected to slow as it faces tough YoY (year-over-year) comps.

Target’s top line is expected to increase led by growth in its comps. The company’s expansion of its fulfillment options, including delivery through Shipt, Drive Up, and Order Pickup, is expected to drive its traffic. Meanwhile, store remodelings and the opening of new stores are likely to support its comps growth, as these stores generate higher sales and productivity. Target’s focus on merchandising and exclusive product launches should also drive its sales.

Target managed to stabilize its bottom line in the first three quarters of 2018. A considerable fall in its effective tax rate, lower interest expenses, and share repurchases supported Target’s bottom line. We expect Target’s bottom line to continue to increase in 2019 driven by improved comps and an anticipated fall in its per-unit digital fulfillment costs.

Wall Street expects Target’s top line to increase 3.1% in 2019. Meanwhile, its bottom line is expected to increase 4%.

## Stock performance in 2019

Retail stocks had wiped out most of their gains as of the end of 2018. However, these retailers started 2019 on a positive note. Target stock is up 3.3% so far this year. Meanwhile, Costco (COST), Kroger (KR), and Walmart (WMT) stocks have risen 3.4%, 3.6%, and 1.9%, respectively.

Source: Shutterstock 

Costco's (NASDAQ:COST) website lists the massive bucket of mac and cheese as sold out. That's a lot of mac and cheese, but there's evidently a market for it with the product no longer being up for purchase due to the high demand.

The Costco 27 pound Mac and Cheese bucket is six gallons in size and contains 180 servings of mac and cheese. This includes 180 servings of elbow noodles and 180 servings of cheddar cheese sauce.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

It's worth noting that the elbow noodles and cheddar cheese sauce aren't just sitting loose in the Costco 27 pound Mac and Cheese bucket. Instead, each of the 180 servings are stored in their own separate bulk Metalite pouches.

Customers with concerns about going through all of the Costco 27 pound Mac and Cheese bucket servings in a timely matter need not worry. The shelf life for the product is 20 years when stored in a cool, dry location. Each of the Metalite packs also contain oxygen absorbers to keep the product fresh for longer.

While customers can no longer order the Costco 27 pound Mac and Cheese bucket, it's still interesting to note the price for the product. Customers that bought the product were paying $89.99 for all that mac and cheese. Current reviews give it 4.7 out of 5 stars.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Ratings and target price

The majority of Wall Street analysts maintain neutral outlooks on Target (TGT) stock. Analysts expect Target to benefit from increased consumer spending. Its comps are likely to sustain momentum in the coming quarters driven by growth in its traffic.

Target’s investments in price, expanded digital offerings, store remodelings, the opening of small-format stores, and exclusive brand launches are expected to support its top line growth. However, pressure on its margins is expected to hurt its stock.

Among the 26 analysts providing ratings on Target stock, 16 have given it “holds,” nine have given it “buys,” and one has given it a “sell.” Analysts have a consensus target price of $82.12 per share on TGT stock, which implies a potential upside of 20.3% based on its closing price of $68.29 on January 10.

## What Wall Street recommends for TGT’s peers

The majority of analysts have favorable outlooks on Costco (COST) stock. Costco continues to generate strong sales and earnings growth and outperform its peers. Among the 28 analysts following COST, 17 have given it “buy” ratings, and 11 have given it “holds.” Analysts maintain a consensus target price of $237.70 on the stock, which indicates a potential upside of 12.8%.

Meanwhile, of the analysts covering Walmart (WMT) stock, 18 have given it “holds,” and 14 have given it “buys.” Analysts have a consensus target price of $106.81 on WMT, which indicates a potential upside of 12.5% based on its closing price of $94.96 on January 10.

2019-01-22,"2018 ended with a bang between the good and bad sentiment trading on Wall Street. The final battle occurred around Christmas and finally investors were able to shake the malaise that had dominated trading for most of the year.

All year long, the stock rally died a slow death by a thousand cuts. The stream of negative headlines was too much to overcome and investors were selling rallies. There were two dominant fears: The tariff war between the U.S. and China, and the fear of the Federal Reserve. But in December, U.S. Fed chairman Jerome Powell finally confirmed that they will not invert the yield curve on purpose. That alleviated half the fears on Wall Street.

So the sell the rip mentality died and the buyers are back in control. This is not to say that is all green pastures from here. After all, we still have the tariff deal to work out. On that front, both sides are singing softer tunes. They sound intent on resolving the matter by the March deadline.

  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold 



For now and going into the earnings season, stocks can trade mostly on merit. Today I share three blue-chip stocks that are likely to do well in 2019. My mid-term thesis is still bullish on these S&P 500 index stocks. There is too much good news now to let headline fears cripple stocks. In the long run, fundamentals will prevail over fear.

### Amazon (AMZN)

Source: Shutterstock 

For decades Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has been the mother of all momentum stocks. This is a company that emerged out of nothing and crippled several industries. This is most evident with what it did to the brick-and-mortar retail industry. These stocks there are still reeling and have not yet figured out how to solve that riddle.

The bullish thesis on Amazon stock is very simple: If the stock market is higher, then Amazon is leading the charge. AMZN has created and now dominates the cloud. This is a great cash cow that will feed any new growth to come. And it is constantly seeking new income streams so it will indeed have more home runs to follow.

My bet is that voice control technology will play a big role in AMZN's next chapter. Alexa licensing income will probably be a huge contributor to the company's bottom line. Furthermore, they have over a hundred million subscribers each paying $119 per year for prime. This is also a giant contribution to their bottom line much like similar memberships benefit Costco (NASDAQ:COST).

What all of this means is that AMZN is a blue-chip stock to own for the long-term. Even Warren Buffet may buy some shares eventually. The tricky part is that momentum stocks like Amazon rarely give a clear points of entry, so choosing the perfect time to buy this king among S&P 500 stocks means that you will never own it. Amazon's earnings are just around the corner and those can temporarily be binary. So I would prefer to own half a position going in and add to it thereafter.

### Facebook (FB)

Source: Shutterstock 

There have been few blue-chip stocks that fell more out of favor than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) last year. Management had to justify its very existence in congressional hearings, after FB took the blame for a giant data breach in 2018. Facebook's management failed to mend the wound. The mistake management made was hiding the event when it happened and then not severely and publicly punishing those who actually did the wrongs.

While the headline from that particular Cambridge Analytica incident is gone, the stigma lingers. So now all eyes are on FB, so it cannot afford to make another major mistake. Operationally Facebook is a marketing behemoth. Its reach stretches far beyond its own FB platform and advertisers are not likely to leave the company.

In addition, FB also has several platforms that it has yet to monetize. I personally use WhatsApp and will probably pay for it it or would tolerate the ads if and when they come. Facebook has over a billion users engaged on its platforms every day for hours at a time. This is massive potential that is almost impossible to ruin. So this is merely an adjustment period. That is necessary and the company will come out of it better in the long run. The key perspective with FB stock is that it's a long-term investment and not just a trading vehicle.

The stock has violently bounced off recent lows and it has been setting higher ones since the Christmas bottom. So going into the earnings FB stock has momentum on its side and the buyers are in control. I do worry about the expenses that management is incurring in order to appease public opinion. Management wants to make sure legislators see them fit to lead, so they don't come down hard on the industry with extreme litigious cuffs.

  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality 



This is one of the greatest names among other S&P 500 stocks and no one truely wants to cripple it. As such, we need to adjust our privacy expectations. There is no way to stop data breaches from happening, but companies have to put their best efforts forward on that front. I am realistic with my expectations on privacy, so I am aware that they already know too much about me, even though I never used the platform. But so does Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and every other company I do business with electronically. Facebook is not evil, it just happens to be the most successful of all social media platforms. Once investors get over these moral difficulties, FB stock should get back on track.

### Nvidia (NVDA)

Source: Shutterstock 

Our lives are completely dependent on technology now more than ever and this is a trend that is not going to reverse anytime soon. We have a few suppliers to power that tech. Semiconductor companies, especially chip providers, are at the heart of this trend. Unfortunately they are momentum stocks and that makes them hard to trade, so it is best to invest into a longer term thesis.

On the way down, they seem like they're falling into an abyss and on the way up they seem perpetually ready to correct. And that's what happened to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. This was a company that everybody had to own when it was $290 a share. But when it fell to $120 last year, no one would touch it. The upside of a big NVDA stock fall is that the price-to-earnings ratio comes back to earth. At $156 per share, NVDA's P/E is now 20 and it is no longer bloated.

NVDA has shed most of its froth, so in the long run Nvidia stock will recover a lot of the premium it had earned before the correction. This is a classic case of a stock loosing too much too soon. The company still has excellent chips in all the right areas, including gaming, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Since these trends are not going away anytime soon, neither is NVDA stock.

Much like AMZN, if the markets in general are higher, then this will be one of the blue-chip stocks that will be higher. Add to that the fact that it is much less frothy than than its competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and it's no wonder that this is a solid S&P 500 stock to buy.

2019-01-24,"While the 2019 stock market is getting off to a good start, equities are still reeling from headlines. We are still in a tariff war with China and Europe and deadlines are looming. We also have to contend with the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.

Yet the retail sector SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) is up 6% year-to-date. But they have a big hole from which to dig out. Target (NYSE:TGT) for example is down 10% in 12 months so it has plenty of room to run if markets are able to maintain the rally. The December crash presents an opportunity for an extended run. Sentiment may have been too grim.

Investors on Wall Street feel better about stocks. Yesterday for example, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) got an upgrade from Morgan Stanley and the stock spiked over 1% in a tough tape. They raised the price target to $110 per share. This is a gutsy move and I respect it. But I cannot chase WMT from these bloated levels. Its trailing 12 month price-to-earnings ratio is 56, which is far too rich for my taste.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Compare that to TGT, which was flat yesterday. This is a company that has the respect of experts on Wall Street. Consensus is that management is competent and that they are on track to succeed as a big box retailer in the new shopping world that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) created in the last ten years.

While Walmart is hogging the headlines, Target stock makes for a better bet from here. The rally off the December crash is not done.

So today I suggest that the better trade off the Morgan Stanley upgrade is to buy Target stock. If WMT is going to be higher, then so is Target and it has a lot of catching up to make. At least I know that by buying TGT stock here, I would be buying more value than froth. Its P/E is three times cheaper than that of WMT and twice as cheap as Costco (NASDAQ:COST). So if things continue to be difficult for the indices, then I should have less downside exposure owning TGT than WMT.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



Moreover, there are technical reasons to own TGT into the first quarter. My macro-economic thesis is that these negative headlines will abate in the next few months so stocks will rise. Target will have a chance to trigger a breakout trade off the $72 per share neckline. This is a zone that spans +/- $1 and it could easily fill the gap to $78 per share.

For the last half of 2018 sellers were in complete control. They made the sell-the-rip meme take hold so rallies didn't last long. This is no longer true in 2019. Every effort to fade the rallies failed. Even on Wednesday and in the face of a slew of negative political headlines, the S&P 500 shrugged off the dip and closed strong. The CBOE Volatility Index (INDEXCBOE:VIX) closed down 6% in comparison.

Furthermore, and even if we retest the February lows, it would still be inside the acceptable range and another buying opportunity. This means I can buy Target stock now and sit on it for a few months for the upside reward knowing that it could fade a little for the next two weeks.

  * 7 Best Stocks to Buy Until the Next Seismic Shift 



### TGT Stock Has Support

The recent price action has a point of control around $68 per share. Those tend to be supportive on the way down. So I am confident owning the shares knowing that if it dips, there will be congestion below that translates into support. The December crash was a complete overshoot and is not in my forecast now. Anything below $66 is extreme and won't last.

The experts on Wall Street agree, but the analysts are shy about upgrading it even though it's trading below their average price range. So this leaves decent odds to positive headlines on that front.

Meanwhile, it will be hard to ignore the negative rhetoric. The media tends to inflame the potential pitfalls because drama sells. It is important to keep it simple and trade the levels at hand. Once I choose a thesis, I trade the price action in the charts. This way I eliminate the sentiment element.

I bet we would all be better traders if we completely ignore the news.

2019-01-28,"This morning we learned that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) ex-CEO Howard Schultz may be throwing his hat in the political ring. While he is not leading Starbucks, this will certainly put the company in the line of potential political fire.

This morning the stock is down 1.5%, which could be partly due to the headline or as a reaction to Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) bad earnings news. Last year, there were rumors about this, yet the stock did relatively well. But the reaction is always different when the actual news comes out.

That aside, Starbucks is doing well of late. SBUX stock is up 17.6% in a year while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) is down 8.4%. Starbucks has had its fair share of worries but most were around their throughput. Their critics complained about the long lines, which is a good problem to have for any retailer.

Last year there were fears stemming from Starbucks' China markets but those, too, are subsiding. Admittedly, this may change in early March if the two countries don't come to terms or kick the can on the deadline. Otherwise, SBUX stock is a proven performer and deserves the benefit of the doubt.

  * 10 of the Best Stocks to Invest In for February 



But that is nothing new to me. I've been a long time fan of Starbucks stock. But for a long while, it was stuck inside a wide horizontal range with hard resistance around $61 per share. Last November's earnings report changed that -- SBUX stock spiked by $10 to reach $68 per share.

Then, on this most recent earnings report, SBUX shrugged off headline concerns, and the important thing about this is that it's defending the neckline from where it finally broke out.

So is it too late to chase it? No.

When a stock spends months consolidating inside a range then breaks out of it, that range will serve as forward support. So the bulls will have a good base on where to build higher levels. All that management has to do is continue to deliver on plans.

Just recently, Starbucks announced that it partnered with Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) to perk up its delivery service in China, which is a huge opportunity market for SBUX. Clearly, they are not afraid to seek alliances where they see fit. This is a heads-up management team even after the recent change in the C-Suite. Hopefully, Howard Schultz's political aspirations won't cause any blow-back to the stock.

While it was stuck below $61 per share I sold put options on dips to create income but now I can hold the stock outright for the long-term. Those who want to invest in a basket of solid fundamentals ought to consider SBUX stock.

This year, SBUX stock is off to a good start in spite of a shaky knee-jerk reaction to the earnings headline. So there could be sellers still lurking especially if the general markets correct in the next few days. This is a potentially violent week from several angles.

We have almost $200 billion in potential market capitalization that could move from this week's earnings, especially leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But so far the bulls have prevailed in times of uncertainty in 2019. I expect that to continue as I doubt that all mega-cap stocks will disappoint investors this week.

The Starbucks-specific earnings headline has passed for SBUX, so from here it will move with the general markets but inside its own range of prices. So I expect the recent lows to hold and they, too, will be buying opportunities.

So to guard against the potential dips, I would start with a partial position just so I can leave room for adding, in case equity markets fade a little. In the long run, SBUX will continue its growth strategy and build upon its cash cow. The immediate sentiment threat that we had last year is dead. This year while we've had a few stints of fear, they have not had follow-through selling.

Those who are looking to invest in a stable of staple companies for the long-term should consider SBUX. Trading in and out of it will likely be more work than benefit unless someone plans on actively trading and using options. So the idea is to enter the stock with the confidence that management has proven itself worthy and that they will deliver on their plans for years to come. The world is addicted to Starbucks' coffee, and it's a cash cow upon which it can expand into other income streams.

### Bottom Line on SBUX Stock

Fundamentally, Starbucks stock is priced in line with other mega consumer retailers like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Costco (NASDAQ:COST). This is to say that it's not susceptible to an obvious correction from a bloated state. Buying it here for the long-term carries no undue risk.

In summary, SBUX is a great American company on a global expansion mission. It has proven management and a strong opinion on Wall Street. So my worry is that it sounds too easy. But I will always be comfortable taking risks on solid fundamentals.

I reiterate the short term potential risk stemming from the political headline threats into mid-March. So patience and sizing are important here even if the SBUX story is strong on its own.

In three weeks, U.S. politicians will fight it out again over the government budgets and the spending limit. This is in addition to the drama over the China tariff war.

All in all, it's becoming clear that AMZN stock will not have an easy road back up to the $2,000 per share level and beyond. It's worth remembering that as recently as November 2017, AMZN stock still traded under $1,000 per share.

So it should come as no surprise that Amazon stock is struggling to maintain its rapid rate of appreciation. Amazon stock already looked expensive heading into earnings. And now, there's a big, new issue to worry about: Losing Amazon's Prime's most important advantage.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * The 9 Best Stocks to Invest In During a Manic Market 



### Amazon Prime Offers Many Services, But One Stands Out

A recent report in Business Insider quoted survey results from The Diffusion Group. The research agency polled 1,160 Amazon Prime members. It found that, by an overwhelming margin, Amazon's most important perk is free expedited shipping. In fact, 79% of the respondents listed free shipping as Prime's most important service.

Amazon Prime offers myriad other services. But few of them stand out as key reasons to pay the increasingly expensive Prime membership. Remember, Prime just went up from $79 per year to $99 per year in 2014, and then it was hiked to $119 in 2018.

Prime Music, Prime Photos, faster free deliveries from Whole Foods, Prime Video and a variety of other benefits other than free shipping may be sufficient to encourage some members to retain Prime, but most still are probably sticking with Prime because of the fast, free shipping.

### Key Rivals Will Soon Have Free, 2-Day Shipping

Against that backdrop, it's worth watching Deliverr and other Prime competitors closely in 2019. Deliverr, which was only founded in 2017, is already disrupting the market. It raised funding last October and aims to be the Uber of warehouses and fulfillment technology. The company is investing heavily in machine learning to predict where it should store goods, in order to deliver them most quickly to end users.

While Deliverr is new, it is already attracting key customers. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), for example, has already partnered with Deliverr to greatly expand its free, two-day delivery options. As a reminder, Wal-Mart has offered free two-day delivery on orders over $35 for quite awhile, but it is rapidly increasing the number of products available on its website by allowing third-party vendors to use its marketplace as well. Wal-Mart is already the top rival to AMZN in total U.S. e-commerce sales, although WMT still trails AMZN by a large amount in that area.

Deliverr has picked up other key partnerships as well. It is becoming a key logistics partner for rapidly growing Canadian firm Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). And Deliverr could provide a particularly compelling service for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). As it stands now, eBay does much of its fulfillment through Amazon, causing eBay packages to often arrive in Amazon packaging. That's obviously bad for eBay's brand. Deliverr, and other  third-party competition, can offer neutral packaging that should be more appealing to companies like eBay.

### Amazon's Network Effect Can Be Reversed

The loss of the key Prime membership perk is a problem in and of itself. With around 100 million members,  the company  receives more than $10 billion annually from the program. That's key, high-margin revenue for AMZN stock, since its operating margins are quite low elsewhere.

In a sense, Amazon has become similar to a warehouse club. Companies that use that model, like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Sam's Club, generate diminutive profit margins from the goods they sell, but earn solid revenue streams from members who pay annual dues to shop at their stores.

In Amazon's case, however, its virtuous cycle could start to go backwards. Many online shoppers, knowing they are already paying for Prime, only look at prices on Amazon's site. Why go through the hassle of signing up for other sites and worrying about shipping costs when Amazon is so easy?

But once members start quitting Prime, knowing they can get fast, free shipping from Wal-Mart and other huge e-tailers, there is much less rationale for staying exclusively on Amazon's site. A huge part of the bull thesis related to Amazon's retail business is that it can raise prices later, once consumers are too lazy to do comparison shopping. Without a shipping advantage, Amazon's comparative advantage diminishes meaningfully.

### What It Means for Amazon Stock

Now, this competitive headwind won't hurt AMZN stock for a quarter or two. In the nearer-term, analysts will be watching the growth of the company's cloud business, and they will try to determine if the recent soft guidance by AMZN is a one-time thing or the start of a worrying trend.

In the longer-term, however, the health of Amazon Prime is a huge concern for the owners of AMZN stock. Already,almost one in three Americans are Prime members. Many analysts expect Prime membership to exceed 150 million within a few years.

That sort of exponential growth can be achieved by early-stage tech companies, but such growth gets more difficult to achieve for businesses as they get larger.

At this point, AMZN is starting to reach that ceiling, particularly in the United States. It's worth considering how rosy analyst outlooks are for Prime in the U.S., particularly since its most compelling feature can and should be greatly undermined by competition. The valuation of AMZN stock is quite high. As a result, even small headwinds to the bull thesis could cause AMZN stock to sink.

2019-02-20,"Last year, trading the retail sector was challenging because the whole market sentiment was very sour for the latter part of the year. So far, 2019 has been the exact opposite. The bulls have been in complete control and the buy-the-dip gang is back in charge. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock is up 11% year-to-date. It has mounted a 20% rally off the December lows. Yesterday, management reported earnings and investors rejoiced. WMT stock spiked then faded into the close but it was still up 2% on the day.Source: Sam's ClubSo the long tail it left in the daily candle leaves some doubt among critics that it can maintain the spike and build on the momentum.Walmart is a great American company but at these levels there are better entry points. There are two coming up soon so I'd get ready for either.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow Walmart stock is close to an important trend line of lower highs. Because they are also setting higher lows means that this is an opportunity for the bulls to break out even further from here. However, they first need to prove that they can overcome and break this descending trend line.Otherwise they could fade to fill the gap below and retest levels near $96 per share. Even if this happens, it would still be inside normal trading price action. It would not be alarming and won't change the fact that Walmart is still executing on plans flawlessly as it has for decades.Recently, the December retail report struck fear into investors, but I believe this was a mistake. The change in the data was too sudden and too far outside the expectations for it to be correct. The report covered December when we had the U.S. government shutdown and extremely nasty sentiment on Main Street and on Wall Street. So it's likely to be a one-off and not the trend for retail.  * 10 Small-Cap ETFs That Pack a Wallop We've seen several retailers prove this and Walmart earnings is the biggest most recent one. Management over delivered on most metrics and guided well into next quarter. So for now, I will take their word for it being that they are the largest retailer on the planet.Fundamentally, Walmart stock is no longer a bargain. It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 44 which is nearly double that of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stocks. This is also more than triple that of companies like Target (NYSE:TGT). So clearly from a valuation perspective, this is not an obvious entry point in Walmart stock. How to Trade WMT Stock TodayNow before you label me a perma-bear, I've only traded Walmart on the positive side but from much better entry points. It was easy for me to make bullish bets when everybody was hating on it in below $85 per share. But up here at these levels, I'd rather wait for a dip or a breakout.If Walmart dips to more attractive levels, I would go long WMT stock for a swing trade. Conversely, if the bulls manage to break out of the new descending trend line, then I would also go long WMT stock for a tactical trade to chase the breakout toward $115 per share. Until then, I let them fight it out here without my money.  * 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Lagging the Market Walmart stock will need to help us in the general market. Currently, we are approaching several deadlines, which will become trigger headlines soon. The U.S. and China are negotiating on the tariff situation in order to avoid 25% tariffs on Mar. 1. We also have politicians fighting over budgets and funding here in the U.S. So the outcome of these battles is still binary, which adds to the guessing part of investing in WMT stock right here.Moreover, the sentiment is important and although it is much improved in 2019 on Wall Street, the rhetoric from experts in the media is uniformly expecting a dip in stock prices. Convention is that we've come too far too fast, this may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The S&P 500 has several support levels below, so even if we dip, I would consider the price action as normal. Above current levels, the S&P 500 has a magnet around 2,825, where the bears will want to make their stand as they have two times before.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-02-20,"Over the long run, few companies can match the performance of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock. Since its first day of trading in March 1982, COST stock has delivered shareholders returns of nearly 24,000%. Better yet, Costco has largely avoided the extreme volatility that other retail stocks have exhibited.  * The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now To analysts and market observers, the resilience of COST stock isn't surprising. Out of all the big-box retailers, COST has the most affluent consumer base. According to surveys conducted in past years, the average income of COST shoppers ranges from above $77,000 to $100,000. The wealth of Costco's customers allows it to weather volatile markets better than its rivals.In addition, Americans counterintuitively love super-sized warehouses. I'm not just referring to Costco. COST's chief competitors like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) -- which already offer outsized stores -- have their own &quot;XL&quot; options.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Good Times Have Faded for Costco StockAt a time when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is actively disrupting the retail landscape, the strength of COST stock represents an anomaly. However, some of the good times have faded. In December, Costco stock dropped nearly 12% after Wall Street panicked over the retailer's first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings report. While the company's earnings per share only missed the consensus outlook by a penny, investors were disappointed by the decline of its margins.In order to address rising competition, COST has invested heavily in its e-commerce platform. Additionally, Costco's grocery sales came under pressure as Walmart, Target, Amazon and Kroger (NYSE:KR) stepped up their games in that area.If that wasn't enough, COST stock hasn't kept up with Walmart stock in recent months. Since October, COST stock is  down about 10%,versus Walmart's slight gain of 2%.While no one doubts the viability of Costco's business, investors want to see positive returns from COST stock. COST Stock Has a Key MoatAdmittedly, the lackluster performance of Costco stock doesn't inspire confidence. COST stock pays a 1% dividend, but that's nothing to write home about. Considering that many investors are seeking safe bets with strong passive-income potential, COST stock isn't a fashionable name.Nevertheless, the fundamentals of COST stock will almost surely win the day. Although COST lacks pizazz, the big-box retailer benefits from a consumer moat: its affluent and addicted customer base.According to a Cowen and Co. survey in December 2015, Costco shoppers' annual income averaged $77,400. The only retailers that catered to a wealthier clientele were Macy's (NYSE:M) online platform and its brick-and-mortar locations.Significantly, Costco beat out Target.com, which averages income of $69,900, and Amazon Prime shoppers, whose average income came in at $69,300. For all the talk about millennials killing Costco's brick-and-mortar-heavy-business model, COST is getting the last laugh.Thanks to Costco's unworldly economies of scale, it's able to beat almost anyone in terms of its prices on common goods. Not even Amazon can compete with COST in that area, bolstering the case for COST stock. Given the breadth of COST's scale, the company's pricing advantage will remain intact for quite some time to come.It's also important not to overlook the fact that Costco members pay for the privilege of shopping there. Worldwide, the company's membership growth rate remains steady and impressive. In fact, last year the growth of the company's global memberships accelerated slightly  to 4.4% from 4.2% in 2017.Within the disappointing Q1 earnings results, membership metrics represented a bright spot. Furthermore, the company's renewal rates moved slightly higher, even though it increased its membership fees.No matter what the retailer does, consumers won't give up their membership. That type of addiction should boost Costco stock over time. Costco Stock Hedges Against Economic, Political UncertaintyIf you saw the State of the Union address, you'll immediately recognize that our country is incredibly divided. I'm surprised that we can even agree on (nearly) universally-accepted concepts, such as &quot;increasing taxes on the middle class is bad.&quot;Of course, one dark cloud that has many Americans fretting is the government shutdown. We suffered a record-breaking one a few weeks ago. Potentially, we can have another one -- if not soon, then perhaps in 2020.  * 10 Smart Money Stocks to Buy Now Such prospects dampen the outlook for Walmart and dollar stores, since they rely heavily on volume. Certainly, a prolonged government shutdown will crimp the revenue they obtain from shoppers who use benefit programs like food stamps.But the owners of Costco stock don't have to worry about that issue. In a worst-case scenario, COST will be the last retailer to suffer a crippling blow.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Warehouse retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is one such investment whose solid business model has kept it above the fray as its peers battled against online competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Costco stock has been a reliable bet throughout.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The most important thing to understand about Costco stock is that selling merchandise in bulk isn't how COST makes its money. In 2018, the company reported $138 billion worth of goods.The cost of those products plus the firm's operating expenses totaled around $137 billion- leaving a profit of just $1 billion. However, the firm's net income was over $3 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market That extra cash came from Costco's yearly membership fees. In order to take advantage of Costco's bulk goods and cheap fuel, customers have to pay a yearly membership fee, and that's actually where the firm generates the majority of its income. Why That's Worth Investing InThe Costco business model makes COST stock a worthwhile addition to your portfolio for a few reasons. First, the membership-based model has helped the company avoid &quot;the Amazon effect.&quot; Costco's membership program breeds loyalty and that loyalty translates into to renewals; the firm boasts a more than 90% customer retention rate.That 90% retention rate is made possible by the firm's business model. By selling its goods at-cost and offering fuel at a loss, Costco is building trust with its clientele. People expect Costco goods to be the lowest available price and that keeps them coming back. Plus, Costco has been able to create an in-store experience that people are willing to pay for. First, there's the &quot;treasure-hunt&quot; feel to the stores. While some items are always re-stocked, others like furniture and office supplies are one-time bargains. There's also the company's infamous sample stations and a variety of cheap meals at the Costco cafe. People like going to Costco and that's another reason they're willing to pay for a yearly membership.  Lucrative Way to Make MoneySo, while Costco is technically a retailer the firm isn't battling against the same issues as many of its peers. Instead the firm is benefitting from it's high-margin membership fees. It doesn't cost much to sign members up and collect their dues each year, so the majority of those fees are going straight to Costco's bottom line. Wealthy CustomersAnother thing Costco stock has going for itself is that its customer base is primarily affluent. The average Costco customer has an annual income of around $100,000, which has helped to insulate COST from market volatility in the past. The company's value proposition is enough to keep its customers coming back even when the economy is down. The fact that the firm sells everyday necessities at a low price means people are unlikely to cut their membership when they tighten their pursestrings.  December WoesCostco stock is still recovering from a 12% drop back in December when the firm released its quarterly results. Investors were disappointed to see margins decline during the fiscal first quarter of 2019, but it's worth noting that Costco has been investing heavily in its online platform in order to keep-up with the rising demand for online shopping options.That kind of investment is hurting the company's overall margins, but it's paying off. Online sales were up 32.2 percent from the previous year. Plus, the key metrics that Costco's overall business model relies on were strong.Store traffic in the first quarter was up 4.9% worldwide and 5.2% in the US. membership revenue was up 10% from the previous year due to new sign ups as well as higher membership fees. The firm's renewal rate in the US came in at 90.5% and 88% across the rest of the world.  Bottom Line on Costco StockThe bottom line here is that Costco's unique business model and wealthy customer base has insulated the store from problems that many of its peers are experiencing. The retail sector has enjoyed strong traffic in recent quarters, but an economic downturn could turn that around.I'd argue that Costco is largely immune to that kind of risk, making it a solid play in the retail space. Plus, the worries about Costco's margins back in December were overdone considering the strength in other areas- I'd expect to see the firm's share price rise over the next few weeks as its earnings report date approaches.

2019-02-26,"Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) and ACB stock just took a body blow. Source: Shutterstock Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) announced Feb. 25 that it bought Manitoba Harvest, the world's largest hemp foods manufacturer, for $317 million. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) plans to spend as much as $500 million on the U.S. Hemp industry. What's Aurora up to?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough it acquired Agropro UAB last September, Europe's largest organic hemp grower, a company that can process more than a million kilograms of organic hemp, it wasn't a huge deal financially. Aurora paid CAD$12.6 million, including debt, a pittance compared to the investments of both Tilray and Canopy Growth. It can and ought to do better.  What Is Manitoba Harvest?Based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the hemp food manufacturer has its products on the shelves of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Whole Foods in both the U.S. and Canada. Consumers might be familiar with Hemp Hearts, the company's line of seeds often used for cereal and yogurt.    * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market This summer, Manitoba Harvest plans to launch a line of branded tinctures, sprays and soft-gels containing CBDs in the states where the sale of CBD products is legal. Manitoba Harvest's products are on 16,000 shelves in the U.S. and Canada. Tilray gains access to the hemp-derived CBD market in the U.S., which is estimated to hit $22 billion by 2022. The tricky part is jumping through all of the various state-level rules regarding hemp-derived CBD and CBD-infused foods. It will, however, get sorted, and when it does, Manitoba Harvest will be a leading U.S. supplier of hemp-derived CBD-infused foods. A Focus on MedicalRight now, Aurora Cannabis CEO Terry Booth isn't ready to let go of its stronghold in the medical marijuana market because it's too darn profitable. Booth rightfully believes that it makes little sense to go after other markets when it can make more selling into the higher-margin medical market. &quot;We're not that ready to give them more than what our contract requires when we are getting double in other locations,&quot; Booth told analysts on the company's second-quarter earnings call. &quot;It is not something that we have top of the priority list in providing cannabis for a lesser price if we don't have to.&quot;That's business 101. I get it. In the second quarter, Tilray had CAD$47.6 million in net revenue, 55% from medical cannabis and 45% from recreational cannabis. It's not avoiding selling recreational pot; it's just not rushing out of the medical side of its business to meet the shortages of recreational pot in Canada. Nor should it. &quot;If I lose sleep over anything, I lose sleep over our ability to supply this global cannabis market. It is coming at us very fast,&quot; Booth said. &quot;I see this world expansion in the cannabis space not even close to being fed properly. It's at least five years before we have an oversupply situation for companies that can export under EU GMP compliant facilities.&quot;So, if you own ACB stock, I'd look at Booth's concerns as opportunities dressed up as hard work. To meet the global demand for cannabis will be financially rewarding for all. Missed a Big ChanceI believe that Tilray's purchase of Manitoba Harvest was brilliant. While the dried leaf business is going to be big, CBD-infused food and beverages are going to be bigger. That's why I recently recommended New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) as a speculative buy. I have no way of knowing how widely its current owner, Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE:CODI), shopped Manitoba Harvest, but if it crossed Terry Booth's desk, he should have taken a more serious look.As time passes, owners of ACB stock will learn if Aurora Cannabis is on the path to riches or rags. Missing out on Manitoba Harvest might not hurt its future, but it sure would have helped it.If you own Tilray stock, you ought to be smiling at the company's latest acquisition. It's a winner.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-26,"Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) reports earnings on Wednesday before the market opens. The Richfield, Minnesota-based electronics retailer has struggled in recent months as lower revenue forecasts and a falling stock price have caused concerns. However, valuations have fallen to near single-digit levels, and the longer-term profit outlook appears brighter. As long as the upcoming earnings report does not hold any dramatic negative surprises, Best Buy stock looks poised to recover the losses suffered in 2018.Source: Best Buy Wall Street expects Best Buy stock to post earnings of $2.57 per share. If this holds, it will mean a 6.2% increase from the same quarter last year when the company earned $2.42 per share. Analysts also project revenues of $14.7 billion. That would mean a 4.3% reduction from the same quarter last year when BBY brought in $15.36 billion. Analysts credit foot traffic from the Christmas shopping season. They also believe lower tax rates went a long way toward improving profits for both the quarter and fiscal 2019.  * 5 Dow Jones Stocks That Will Lead the Market Higher For the year, Wall Street forecasts earnings of $5.18 per share, up from $4.42 per share in 2018. This comes amid predicted revenue growth of only 1.5% for the fiscal year. If predictions hold, the company will bring revenue of $42.78 billion for the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Best Buy Stock Already Recovering From 2018 SlumpBest Buy stock had seen a steady uptrend since 2013. BBY had become a victim of online retail in the early part of the decade. The stock nearly fell into the single-digits in 2012 as fear of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other e-commerce retailers sent the stock plummeting. Since that time, BBY stock benefitted from a turnaround plan that briefly took it above $84 per share last summer.However, after July, the stock again began to tumble. By Christmas Eve, it had dropped by over 43%. Analysts blamed a generalized selloff in equities as well as cost-cutting to compete with Amazon.Best Buy stock has since recovered. Still, it trades about 28% below the July high. Now, the question investors will want answered in the upcoming report hinges on whether the company can increase its growth rate. The current increase in profits came in large part from the tax cut. However, this will only serve as a one-time boost. Best Buy Stock Looks Inexpensive Compared to PeersThe slower profit growth may prove temporary. For the upcoming fiscal year, analysts predict a 6% increase in net income. However, for the next five years, they believe profit growth will average 16.27% per year during that time.When factoring in the forward P/E ratio of 11.1, Best Buy stock looks like a buy, especially when compared with the P/Es of its peers. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) maintains a forward PE of 26.3. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) trades at about 20 times forward earnings. BBY's multiple also falls below the 13.1 forward multiple on Target (NYSE:TGT). Even if BBY recovers to its 52-week high, it will still have a P/E below that of Costco and Walmart.That said, BBY still faces some challenges.Analyst guidance for the new fiscal year has fallen by two cents per share over the last ninety days. That could show up in the earnings report and temporarily take Best Buy stock down. However, BBY stock has maintained a track record of beating estimates, so I see a departure from the usual pattern as unlikely. As long as earnings, revenue, and guidance do not stray far from current estimates, BBY stock appears undervalued at these levels. The Bottom Line on Best Buy StockThe upcoming earnings report for Best Buy stock will likely surprise to the upside if it brings unexpected news at all. Analysts expect profit growth for both the prior quarter and the previous fiscal year. If recent reports serve as an indication, Best Buy will probably exceed estimates again.Yes, Best Buy stock fell in 2018 amid competition and falling stock prices. However, I see this as a temporary setback. BBY stock has seen a natural pullback as it had steadily moved higher over the past few years.  * 7 Cheap Stocks That Make the Grade With profit-growth on track and a valuation flirting with the single-digit levels, BBY should continue to rise. The upcoming report will probably not change that expectation.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-04,"Why Kroger (KR) Stock Won;t Get a Boost From Battling VisaUpset over the fees Visa (NYSE:V) charges it to handle customer transactions, Kroger (NYSE:KR) is halting its acceptance of Visa cards at some of its outlets, and considering a nationwide ban of Visa cards. That is a huge deal for Kroger and KR stock because Visa has more than half the credit card market, and customers continue to use cash less frequently.This could be a huge deal for Visa as well, since Kroger is the second-largest grocery-store chain in America, behind only Walmart (NYSE:WMT). If Walmart, or even eighth-place Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) join the fight, things could get nasty.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March The trouble for KR stock is that they're not joining the fight. Kroger, which is due to release its results through January before the market opens on Mar. 6, is all alone. KR stock is already suffering, as it has dropped 5% over the last few trading days. Kroger's Worst NightmareI am Kroger's worse nightmare.When I go to Kroger, usually about twice each week, I use a Visa card. I only use one credit card and one debit card. Both carry the Visa logo.I often spend only $10-$20 on each visit because I make my big purchases at Costco (NASDAQ:COST).  I use the automated check-out, plug the card in, take my groceries and go. I'm in-and out in ten minutes.But Kroger's hangover is just beginning. It costs KR 21 cents to process my transaction and could cost as much as 35 cents if I were using a small bankGrocery margins are wafer-thin. Kroger is fortunate when it brings 2 cents of every dollar to its bottom line. During the third quarter, which ended on Halloween, its profit margin was slightly over 1%.  If I spend $10 and it costs KR 35 cents to process my card, it's losing money.Settlement fees aren't the only hassle. Merchants are also subject to fees when their merchandise is returned. Taken together, the average merchant pays about 2.5% of the revenue it gets from credit cards in fees to the card networks and banks.KR can't get mad at me. I wouldn't understand. There's a Walmart just as close to me, in the other direction. So, Kroger is getting mad at Visa. Smith's, a Kroger-branded store in the Rocky Mountain region, will be no longer accept Visa cards starting on Apr 3. Kroger's Food 4 Less chain in California has already stopped accepting Visas. Going to CourtThe rest of the industry has chosen to go to court to fight these so-called &quot;swipe fees,&quot; and recently made a $6.24 billion settlement  The settlement covers 14 years and follows a preliminary deal last year some merchants said didn't go far enough. Visa and rival MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which was also part of the case, thought that was the end of the battle. They're already contemplating a new price hike, which could go into effect as early as next month, and while the increase will only be assessed to the banks the networks do business with, it's assumed those banks will pass the costs on to merchants. The Bottom Line on KR StockKR stock is an incredible bargain. It has a price-earnings ratio of 6.3, and its market cap of $22.6 billion is about one-sixth its fiscal 2018 sales of $122 billion. The tiny, 14-cent-per-share-dividend paid to owners of Kroger stock currently yields 1.9%.But KR stock has been cheap for a long time It currently trades below where it was two years ago, despite two dividend hikes. I've suggested that Kroger stock could rise if KR consolidated under one brand ; it currently has 17. At least it now has a quest. Too bad that quest looks like an impossible dream.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Secondly, it can compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) because driving to the store is still faster than ordering and waiting.  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound But what kind of investment is Target stock? The Bull Case for Target StockTarget's fourth-quarter and full-year earnings did make a bullish case for the stock. Sales were up 5.3% year-over-year, online sales were up 31%, and earnings of $799 million, $1.53 per share, on revenue of almost $23 billion beat the official estimate of $1.52 per share of earnings. But they didn't beat the hoped-for &quot;whisper number&quot; of $1.55 per share on $23.15 billion in revenue. This is Target we're talking about …By that, I mean that Target, like the Minnesota sports teams on whose stadia it splashes its name, does not get ahead of its skis. The stock's 2019 performance is roughly in line with that of the S&P 500 average.What's most attractive about Target is its dividend, which at 64 cents per share yields a respectable 3.52%. The dividend is up from 43 cents per share five years ago, and the company said it returned $3.4 billion to shareholders, between dividends and buybacks, during the last year.That means if you picked up some Target at its Christmas low of under $62 per share, you got a nice yield to stick under the tree, a real bargain. But can it really be worth $75, which is where it opened after analysts digested those great results? The fourth-quarter earnings beat was its first in a year, and the gain only brings it back to where it was before it missed on its last quarter. CEO Brian Cornell promised to invest $7 billion into the stores when he took over two years ago and says those investments are now paying off.Some of that went into making the stores look better, but more of that went into logistics and in launching dozens of new private label products, so its generic merchandise looks worth buying. Target can now offer same-day delivery of products with a $99 yearly subscription to its Shipt service, with next-day delivery of even bulky items for just $2.99.It offers in-store pick-up of orders, or curbside delivery, with the aim of making it &quot;America's easiest place to shop.&quot; To differentiate itself from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has re-committed to the large store format, Target is putting small-format stores into major cities, near college campuses, and at upscale tourist sites like Cape Cod. Bottom Line on Target StockTarget has been catching up under Cornell, but now that it has caught up, is it really a better investment than the companies it is emulating, Amazon, Walmart and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST)?The two-year return is surprisingly close to that of the stores, although Target will never be a tech company. If you live in Minneapolis, Target is the home team, and Cornell has it playing well.  * 7 Stocks Under $10 You Shouldn't Buy But if you see retirement as imminent and need some fast returns, Target is not going to win the pennant for you. Target offers a competitive yield. When the excitement over earnings dies down so will the stock, making it worth a long-term investor's attention.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-05,"Following a positive earnings report, many have become bullish on Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant beat earnings and revenue estimates in its fourth-quarter report. The company has proved itself as a resilient omnichannel retailer despite the rise of e-commerce. This led to a dramatic increase in Walmart stock in 2016 and 2017.Source: Shutterstock Still, WMT stock pulled back in 2018 amid a U.S.-China trade war.  Many feel like this stock will take off once a U.S.-China trade agreement expands the company's access to cheaper Chinese goods.However, given the slower overall growth predicted for WMT stock, I see any China trade agreement as a reason to sell the news.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Optimism Abounds on Walmart StockAt first glance, one might wonder why they should not get excited about Walmart stock. Investors overreacted a few years ago when they believed a &quot;takeover of retail&quot; by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would come soon. Instead, Walmart managed to leverage its brick-and-mortar stores to deliver an omnichannel experience Amazon could not match. Now, we are seeing Amazon build a growing collection of physical stores to compete.Also, the board of directors raised the annual dividend by four cents per share. Owners of Walmart stock will now receive $2.12 per share in payouts every year. This marks the 44th consecutive year Walmart has raised its dividend. It also takes the yield to about 2.15%, slightly higher than the S&P 500 average.  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound Moreover, both the U.S. and China say they have reached the &quot;final stages&quot; of hammering out a trade deal. Due to Walmart's dependence on imports from China to maintain low prices, an end to the trade war would logically bolster the profits of Walmart stock in the coming quarters. China Trade, E-Commerce May Not Help EnoughHowever, I disagree with those who think this will boost Walmart stock in the near term.For one, as our own Josh Enomoto points out, the U.S.-China trade war did not hit Walmart stock as hard as the equities of most of its peers. Indeed, most competitors saw larger declines than the 4% drop WMT stock experienced in 2018. Also, I expect profits in WMT to rise with a trade agreement. Profit growth should also turn positive.The question is how positive is this growth? Yes, during the fourth quarter, e-commerce sales rose 21% overall and 43% within the U.S. However, e-commerce revenue only makes up a small fraction of the company's revenues. Overall revenues for the fourth quarter increased by a more modest 3.1%. Struggles Outside of the U.S. ContinueAside from the labor woes that have plagued Walmart for years, its failed execution outside of North America should lead investors to question long-term growth prospects. Despite overall growth, international sales fell by 3.2%. When dealing with a saturated market at home, the failure to execute abroad should concern investors.Succeeding overseas is far from impossible. Retailers such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have seen more success abroad. Walmart became one of the first U.S. retailers when China when it entered the market in 1996. More than 20 years later, Walmart operates only 424 retail stores in China, hardly penetration in a country of almost 1.4 billion people.Walmart has also left countries completely after it failed to impress local customers. The company is trying again in India through online store Flipkart. Walmart has yet to report specific results on Flipkart, so we do not know if and how well this online venture in India has succeeded. Walmart Stock Is Not CheapAnalysts expect to see a 3.1% drop in profits this year, and 5.5% profit growth in 2020. For this growth, investors will pay about 19.5 times forward earnings. While that may come in cheaper than Amazon or Costco, those companies enjoy double-digit profit growth.Moreover, buyers can also purchase Target (NYSE:TGT) at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13. Wall Street predicts average growth of 8% per year for TGT over the next five years. This is more than double Walmart's 3.53% growth rate for the same period. Target investors will also receive a 3.5% dividend yield with a comparable track record of annual payout increases. This exceeds WMT's yield by about 63%Further, the decline may have already begun. The stock still has not recovered from the November high of $106.21 per share, and the post-earnings rise in the stock price reversed quickly. At about $98 per share, Walmart stock trades slightly below the levels it saw prior to the earnings report. Hence, when looking closer, investors have good reason to question the positive narrative on WMT. The Bottom Line on Walmart StockInvestors should sell the news on Walmart stock once the U.S. and China announce a trade deal. Yes, it should reverse declining profits once the U.S. and China agree on a trade framework. Walmart has also proven that it will continue its growth and itself become a player in the e-commerce space.However, overall, Walmart is an older, slower-growth retailer. This growth will remain slow as it continues its lackluster performance internationally. As long as these struggles remain, I would avoid Walmart stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Online grocery sales in the U.S. are projected to increase about 26% this year, according to data aggregated by Statista, and could grow by nearly 40% by 2021.  Amazon's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in the summer of 2017, adding brick-and-mortar to its prime grocery store and delivery business, has not only taken the retail giant into the heart of the food sales business, but also added immense pressure on rivals to hone their e-commerce offerings and increase their online footprints in order to win market share.","E-Commerce Driven Grocers Costco, Walmart Are Winning: Amazon's Impact"

2019-03-08,"After an incredible rally to start the year, equity markets are under pressure this week. We have had sustained selling and all efforts to buy the dip have so far failed. In that sense, it's reminiscent of what happened in December, which means companies reporting earnings this week are at a disadvantage during this headline sensitive time.Source: Shutterstock Last night, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) reported its earnings and Costco stock is rallying 5% on the headline. This is despite the fact that markets are under tremendous pressure from China-based headlines.So for now, the bears are not looking to fight it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo let's start with the fundamentals first. I am a fan of the company and I am a weekly customer. I think it's more than just a shopping trip but more of an experience. I often run into friends while there so it's almost like a trip to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).COST has a proven management team that always delivers on its plans. They almost never give Wall Street specific reasons to sell COST stock. Last night, management did it again, as they blew away the earnings-per-share expectations and that's the literal bottom line.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 Moreover, they continue to grow total sales up 7%, which was a bit lower than expected but they made it up in other areas. While the overall comparable sales were impressive, their e-sales comps were up 25%. This is the trend to e-tailing that matters most to the retail sector investors. The impression is that online sales bring higher margins.Another saving grace for Costco stock is that management does not provide forward guidance. That is the one headline sellers love to sink their teeth into on earnings reports. The company could deliver the best report but if they show forward caution, the stock falls. Not for COST stock; management left no opportunity for sellers to act. The bears lack any reason to sell it on this headline.This is how it should be for every stock, because the forward guidance is merely an opinion or forecast and those can be wrong. It doesn't mean that the company is deteriorating. Nevertheless, Costco stock today is rallying and celebrating the news. How to Approach Costco Stock After EarningsAs much as I like the fundamentals, COST stock is not cheap. It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30. In absolute terms, I compare that to say Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and it's 40% more expensive. Or relatively speaking, it is twice as expensive as Target (NYSE:TGT). Only Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is more expensive among the retail stocks I track. TGT stock is not only cheaper, but it is also better. Year-to-date, TGT is up twice as much as COST.Nevertheless, the high P/E is not a deal breaker for me because if markets are rallying, then Costco stock is also with them. In other words, I'd own it for the long term. If that's the case, then I don't have to be surgical with my entry point and I should just buy it.But for the rest of us that like to enter a stock at optimal spots, there are lines to watch.The zone around $220 per share has been pivotal since last July. Usually, those levels of contention are resistance on the way up. But here, COST stock is beating them and if it closes above the zone, then the bulls could have solid footing to drive even higher into it.  * 10 Top Pot Stocks 2019 Has to Offer In this scenario, Costco stock would have a trend line breakout opportunity somewhere around $230 per share and it is a moving target. Since it set a new high last September, the stock has set a trend of lower highs. When bulls break through them, they tend to overshoot higher. This is easiest to see on the weekly chart.Shorter time frames show that the upside opportunity is at $232.50, but that level is also resistance. There is another potential stalling point at $29.80 from the failure on Dec. 12. For support, in case this spike fades for whatever reason, I'd look for the same pivot levels around $220 to continue to hold.In summary, these minute levels won't matter much in the long run. COST is a company set to continue higher and if my assumption is that markets will be higher in the future, then so will Costco stock. However, investors should be cautious during this macro-sentiment crisis through next Wednesday.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

This is the second crash involving the 737 MAX 8 in the past six months, and multiple countries have decided to suspend flights that use the aircraft.In the options pits, Friday's down gap lit a fire under puts and caused their total volume to outpace calls. Specifically, about 18.5 million calls and 19.6  million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe fear bid kept readings lofty at the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio held firm at 0.75. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average continued its climb, notching a new two-month high at 0.65.Here were three stocks that found themselves squarely in the crosshairs of options traders. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares surged after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) calls were active while the stock passed a critical support test. The desperately oversold conditions in CVS (NYSE:CVS) finally attracted enough bargain hunters to score an up day.Let's take a closer look: Costco Wholesale (COST)Costco stepped up to the earnings plate Thursday night and delivered data worth celebrating.

Analysts were expecting $1.69 in earning per share.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio With Friday's 5.1% gain, COST has just about recovered all that was lost during last quarter's post-earnings beatdown. Furthermore, its year-to-date gain now stands at 11.8%.This year's return to bullishness has improved the technicals of Costco considerably. With the stock now perched north of rising 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, buyers have officially re-established dominance across all time frames. Resistance at $235 and then $240 are the next two upside targets.On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Activity rocketed to 601% of the average daily volume, with 90,119 total contracts traded. 60% of the trading came from call options alone.The usual post-earnings crush descended on implied volatility Friday, sending the metric down to 20%.

Fortunately for shareholders, buyers emerged to save the day and prevent a potentially trend-shattering breakdown. The successful support test also boosted interest in AMZN stock options.All major moving averages are slithering sideways which confirms the sloppy trading range and the inability of buyers or sellers to wrest control of the stock.

Total activity grew to 175% with 272,131 contracts traded.

Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of $26.15 or 1.6%. CVS (CVS)After falling for 10 out of 11 days, CVS finally scored a legitimate up day. The prior one that interrupted its losing streak was a doji candle that provided little inspiration. Since reporting disappointing earnings last month, CVS has lost a fourth of its value.With its bull market gains continuing to be unwound, the company's shares have returned to levels not seen since early-2013. While fundamental analysts will point to the disappointing earnings backdrop as the cause for the latest descent, chart watchers are blaming the break of critical support at $60.Even if buyers build on Friday's up day, this is a rally born to be sold. Too much overhead resistance awaits to reject the recovery attempt.On the options trading front, calls won the day. Activity jumped to 168% of the average daily volume, with 118,987 total contracts traded. Calls added 60% to the total.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-12,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in January 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing continues to gain the interest of investors looking for stocks to buy to produce market-beating results. But are you familiar with the concept of ESG Momentum? I wasn't until I saw a recent InvestmentNews article on the subject. It turns out that Truvalue Labs, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company, has developed the &quot;Truvalue Platform,&quot; which uses ESG data and analytics to help investors evaluate a stock's intangibles. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhatever it takes, remember?ESG stands for environment, social and governance. There is evidence that evaluating these factors -- along with the traditional metrics investors have always used -- leads to better performance over time.Therefore, ESG Momentum rates companies on how much ESG improvement they've made from one period to the next. So, you might have an oil and gas company with an ESG Momentum ranking of 85, which demonstrates that even though it might rank poorly in the entire S&P 500 universe regarding its ESG rating, it's improved recently, compared with its peers. &quot;Improvements in governance scores are a significant factor in producing superior returns,&quot; Eoin Murray, head of Investment at Hermes, a £30 billion London-based asset manager, said in March 2018. &quot;Investors should always look for evidence of improvement as it is the change in ESG metrics that is the key.&quot;Also studies suggest that companies with excellent ESG ratings tend to do better in corrections. Given many experts are predicting lower annual returns over the next few years, layering ESG Momentum rankings on top of whatever ESG analytics you use to evaluate stocks could deliver a winning portfolio.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary For those who buy the idea that ESG factors do play a role in better stock performance, here are seven stocks to buy from companies winning through ESG. Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B)Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) owns too many companies to list them all in one sitting. Naturally, that makes rating it for ESG factors a complicated task. &quot;We have a fiduciary obligation to our clients in almost all cases to outperform, and ESG's most important claim is that doing good will drive better returns. That argument is weakened by inconsistent ratings,&quot; CFA Christopher Merker wrote in July 2018. &quot;As James Mackintosh recently observed, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was ranked dead last in the S&P 500 by one ratings firm and in the middle of the pack by another. That's too much dispersion.&quot;He's not wrong. That's always been a weakness of ESG methodologies. However, I managed to find a Truvalue screen from October of the top ten S&P 100 stocks regarding ESG Momentum, and Berkshire Hathaway made the list. &quot;Berkshire's short-term Pulse Score hit its highest mark for the past year in May 2018 with the announcement that a Berkshire Hathaway electricity utility serving six Western states won't build new gas or coal, instead it is planning to add gigawatts of wind and solar capacity,&quot; Truvalue Labs blog stated Oct. 10, 2018.You don't have to do much arm twisting to convince me BRK is an excellent stock to buy. The ESG shout out is just icing on the cake. Stocks to Buy: Costco (COST)Like Berkshire Hathaway, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) made Truvalue Labs' list from October 2018. It did so because of several new initiatives including introducing compostable coffee pods in its warehouses, a new policy regarding the use of chemicals, and a commitment to install solar panels at its stores.Anyone who's followed the warehouse club for a reasonable amount of time is likely aware of the company's treatment of its employees. In October, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced it was raising its minimum wage for U.S. workers to $15, one dollar more than Costco. However, the actual wage of the typical Costco employee is more like $22.50 per hour, well above any other retailer operating nationally. And the benefits are better than most. &quot;The best part is all the perks -- guaranteed hours, benefits, time and a half on Sundays, free turkeys at Thanksgiving, four free memberships, a livable wage,&quot; a Costco employee with six years of experience told Business Insider in April 2018.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary I shop at Costco a lot and I've never seen a grumpy employee. The company takes the &quot;S&quot; in ESG seriously. Stocks to Buy: Eversource Energy (ES)When it comes to ESG, Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) gets a lot of compliments. In 2016, Eversource's Massachusetts' utility was named the most energy-efficient utility provider in the U.S. In 2017, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) named Eversource the most efficient utility in the U.S. by saving 3% of their annual sales through energy efficiency initiatives. I haven't heard about its 2018 awards as of yet, but I'm sure they'll arrive soon enough. As far as sustainability goes, Eversource also ranks high among its utility peers. No less than five different organizations have rated it anywhere from first to sixth in sustainability among U.S. utilities. If you're concerned about the sustainability  of the utility whose stock you will buy, Eversource is the right one for you. More importantly, Eversource's good deeds have resulted in outstanding shareholder returns, Over the last year, Eversource has generated a total return of  over 25%, Stocks to Buy: Keysight Technologies (KEYS)I had never even heard of Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) until I saw it on Sustainalytics Research's list of the 30 Most Sustainable and Ethically Responsible Companies. Eversource is also on the latest ranking.Not only did the company make Sustainalytics Research's top 30; it also finished 21st in Just Capital's 2018 list of America's most just companies. To rank highly on Just Capital's list, companies must pay their workers well, be actively studying gender pay gaps, offer flexible work hours, set diversity targets, employ a lot of people, etc. As for Keysight, it turns out it is the electronics measurement spinoff of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A). Independent since November 2014, Keysight provides hardware and software solutions for measuring stuff in various industries including automotive, communications, and even the government.In the four years since going public, KEYS has close to tripled in value.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary It's not easy being a large company with all the different responsibilities involved, but Keysight seems to have figured out how to do it. I'll be paying more attention to it in the future. Stocks to Buy: McCormick (MKC)I wonder if McCormick (NYSE:MKC) is concerned about ESG matters because it owns Billy Bee honey? I'm sure it's worried about the well-being of bees. However, I only asked that in jest. Dig a little deeper and you'll find it cares a great deal about sustainability.In 2018, McCormick was named the 23rd most sustainable company on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Sustainability Index. The index is a group of companies that are leaders in their respective industries from a sustainability perspective. To make the list, a company must have a market cap of at least $2 billion. Each company is ranked for 12 different sustainability indicators. &quot;This honor validates our efforts to embed sustainability throughout our operations, to provide transparency to our stakeholders and to positively impact communities where we live, source and work,&quot; stated CEO Lawrence Kurzius about the recognition. In 2017, McCormick committed to improve the world around us, arguing that how it performs as a company is directly related to how it acts as a global citizen. I wonder if President Trump has made the same commitment.McCormick has set all kinds of goals, both business and community-based, which sets it apart from a lot of big companies. I've recommended its stock several times in the past year. Given how much the company cares, I like it even more. Stocks to Buy: Prologis (PLD)If you know anyone big in e-commerce, he or she has probably heard about Prologis (NYSE:PLD). As of the end of the third quarter of 2018, PLD owned or had an interest in 768 million square feet of logistics real estate across 19 different countries, including the U.S. Over the five years that ended in 2018, Prologis generated core FFO growth of 9%, 400 basis points higher than the S&P 500 and 200 basis points higher than REITs as a whole. Like most ESG-focused companies, sound financials and stock performance are the byproducts of caring about things besides making a buck. As a result, PLD has achieved a lot of firsts in its industry including being the first logistics real estate company to issue green bonds on a global basis.The company's sustainability objectives include making its buildings as energy efficient as possible. To that end, 82% of its operating portfolio has efficient lighting with 40% of them operating cool roofs to reduce energy consumption. Perhaps that's why it's received 304 sustainable building certifications covering 112 million square feet. And I'm sure there are more on the way.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary E-commerce sometimes gets a dirty name for adding to the carbon footprint, but Prologis is doing its part to reverse the tide. That's great news if you own PLD stock. Stocks to Buy: Telus (TU)I couldn't help but save the best for last. I say this because Telus (NYSE:TU) is based in Vancouver and I'm Canadian. However, on a serious note, as telecom companies go, TU is a good one. It, too, makes Sustainability Analytics' top 30. Before getting into the ESG aspects of its business, I'm a fan of Telus stock because it's one of the few pure-play telecom companies left in North America, devoted entirely to wireless and broadband with no media interests to get in the way and slow profits. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) could take a hint. Telus has been a big proponent of sustainability for some years. Here's what one of its CSR analysts said in a 2013 company blog post:&quot;The true essence of sustainability is to ensure future generations have what they need. Unless we 'make the sustainability case' hand in glove with the business case, we can't truly be sustainable. I'd say that this is key for us to make change beyond our borders,&quot; wrote Dom Repta. &quot;While many people in business truly want to do something, they are challenged to know how to do so when they work within a conventional return on investment model.&quot;Actions speak louder than words. In 2018, Telus was named by Montreal-based non-profit The Finance and Sustainability Initiative as having the best sustainability rating in the Canadian technology and communications sector. Companies like Telus are recognized for having weaved ESG into their financial and investment practices. If you want to own a safe telecom company with an excellent yield to boot, Telus is your play.

2019-03-13,"Grocery stocks trade in a competitive, low-margin business. The average grocer sees a profit margin falling between 1% and 2%. Although that margin can rise as high as 6% for organic grocers, difficulties remain.Despite the struggles to profit, grocery stocks have attracted a great deal of interest. The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) purchase of Whole Foods spurred a great deal of interest in grocery stocks. Despite Amazon's struggles with grocery delivery and its desire to build a second grocery chain, that interest has not abated.This sector also poses challenges for many investors. Many prominent chains such as Trader Joe's have never launched an IPO. Others, such as Publix offer stock that does not trade on public markets. Hence, relatively few grocers trade on the exchanges, and others, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), derive most profit from other retail operations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners Despite this challenge, investors can find grocery stocks with profit potential. These stocks to buy trade at reasonable price-to-earnings ratios while posting the profit increases needed to boost stock prices over time. BJ's Wholesale (BJ)In the discussion of warehouse retail and grocery stocks, many often forget BJ's Wholesale (NYSE:BJ). Instead, attention often falls on Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which has led the warehouse retail sector for many years. Even Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, often receives more attention.Since BJ's operates warehouses primarily on the east coast, investors west of the Mississippi River often overlook the chain. Moreover, the company did not return to the public markets until its July 2018 IPO, giving investors further reason to ignore the warehouse retailer.However, the company operates 216 warehouses in 16 states, and it carries more grocery stock-keeping units (SKUs) than either rival.Moreover, BJ stock posts financials that would appeal more to buyers. The forward P/E ratio comes in at 15.5, lower than both Costco and Walmart. Wall Street also predicts a 10.5% increase in profits for the year. That almost matches Costco's predicted growth rate. For next year, analysts forecast 11.6% profit growth versus only 7.4% for Costco.BJ stock has challenges. High debt levels and negative stockholders' equity will likely slow expansion plans. Also, at a market cap of only $3.5 billion, it will remain a distant third behind its main rivals for years to come. Further, the investment thesis may fall apart if profits fall short of forecasts. However, as long as BJ's can keep growing its profits and improving its balance sheet, the future should brighten for BJ stock. Kroger (KR)Kroger (NYSE:KR) has long held a position as the nation's second-largest grocer. Due to Walmart's more diverse retail portfolio, Kroger stands as the largest pure-play grocer trading on the market today. The Cincinnati-based company operates 2,764 grocery stores across the country.Despite the massive footprint, investors sold off Kroger stock as fears of an Amazon takeover took hold. Most now believe investors overreacted to Amazon. Still, this threat has changed Kroger's strategy. Kroger spent $3 billion last year remodeling stores and on the &quot;Restock Kroger&quot; digital initiative. They expect that spending to grow to $3.2 billion this year.These changes have placed grocery stocks like Kroger in a position of transition. While unpopular, most analysts agree this spending has become necessary for Kroger to remain relevant. These sentiments became evident as Kroger missed earnings and revenue estimates in Q4. KR stock fell 9% on that news. Setbacks such as these have left KR trading at only 10.3 times forward earnings.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With High ESG Momentum Still, analysts expect 4.7% profit growth this year and 7.7% the next. Moreover, the annual dividend of 56 cents per share has increased for the last ten years. This takes the yield to almost 2.3%. KR stock may struggle for now as it makes its transition. However, the low valuation along with the fruit that Restock Kroger will likely bear should bring profits to long-term investors. Target (TGT)Like in the general retail sector, Target (NYSE:TGT) also competes with Walmart and others in the grocery business. It has also followed the lead of Walmart, Kroger and other grocers in introducing grocery delivery and leveraging its omnichannel presence to compete with Amazon.For now, TGT stock is riding high. In its most recent quarterly report, the company beat earnings and revenue estimates. It also saw its best traffic and sales numbers since 2005. Its Food & Beverage category has shared in these benefits.Target has struggled with groceries in the past. However, an emphasis on fresh and organic foods has helped to turn this category around. Target generally has tried to build a more upscale image than its archrival Walmart. Hence, an emphasis on somewhat pricier and more exclusive foods serves this image well.Despite its reputation, the multiple on TGT stock is anything but upscale. Target trades at a forward P/E ratio of 12.2, well under the 19.6 forward P/E of Walmart. TGT now trades around $76 per share, and this accounts for the 26% surge the stock has experienced since its Dec. 24 low. Analysts also forecast 8% growth this year and 6.9% the next for the Minneapolis-based retailer. Moreover, the annual dividend of $2.56 per share yields about 3.4%. It has also risen for 51 consecutive years.Target's multiple may still lag that of Walmart. But with the company showing robust growth numbers and its grocery segment gaining momentum, TGT should perform well compared to other grocery stocks.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-15,"On Thursday after the close, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat for the fourth quarter. The report and conference call was enough to vault Ulta Beauty stock higher by roughly 5% in after-hours trading. If the stock maintains those levels on Friday, ULTA will hit a new 52-week and all-time high.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr But those highs are a lot more important than making longs feel good going into the weekend. In fact, if Ulta stock can close around where it opens, up around 5% or so, it will have cleared multi-year resistance and give investors a chance to ride significant upside. Let's look at the charts first, then check out the quarter. Trading Ulta Beauty StockInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI don't care for two-year daily charts, but it's the best way to show the long (and painful) road Ulta Beauty stock has been on. After surging higher for years on the back of CEO Mary Dillon's leadership, Ulta came under intense pressure in 2017. The stock fell from $315 to sub-$200 in just a few months, cementing the former figure as resistance.  * 5 Undervalued Stocks to Invest In 13 months after bottoming in 2017, Ulta stock was again back at $315. Surprisingly, this was in November 2018, right as the broader market was struggling through a nasty Q4 correction. Ulta Beauty stock wasn't immune though, finally falling in December and bottoming near $230, down more than 25% from those highs.The bulls just won't give it up though. Lately, Ulta Beauty stock has been bumbling along between $305 and $315, itching for a big-time breakout. That's why Friday's rally is so important. If Ulta can hold Friday's rally -- which currently in pre-market trading has it priced near $328 -- then the breakout can officially begin.Most importantly, we need to see Ulta stock close over $320. It helps that the stock isn't wildly overbought at this point and that could allow the share price some room to run. A disastrous way to end the week would be for Ulta stock to end lower on Friday. If the gains hold, a push into the upper $330s to lower $340s doesn't seem unrealistic. Was the Quarter That Good?We really need to examine the most recent earnings report to get the best idea of whether Ulta Beauty stock will be able to maintain its recent gains. So how did the company do?Earnings of $3.61 per share came in 5 cents ahead of expectations and grew 31% year-over-year. Revenue of $2.12 billion topped estimates by $10 million and grew 9.3% year-over-year. In other words, it was a very solid quarter for Ulta, but one where the company squeaked by analysts' estimates.Under the surface though, this one was strong.Comp-store sales grew 9%, ahead of management's expectation for 7% to 8% growth, as well as consensus estimates of 8%. E-commerce sales blazed higher by 25% and gross margins expanded 90 basis points. Operating margins inched higher by 10 basis points, even after a 30 basis point impact from a change in accounting rules. Finally, full-year earnings guidance of $12.65 to $12.85 per share (midpoint of $12.75 per share) came in just ahead of consensus expectations for $12.73 per share.  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs Ultimately, Ulta's earnings remind me of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) from last week, and just look at how that one's done since its report. I'm not saying Ulta Beauty stock will do the same thing, but I wouldn't be surprised if we saw continued momentum over the next few sessions. The company didn't blow investors away with the quarter necessarily, but it showed that it's doing extremely well right now.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-15,"Mastercard's (NYSE:MA) battle with long-time archrival Visa (NYSE:V) continues, with a win in the bidding for fintech firm Transfast. Coming in the wake of losing out in an effort to purchase a similar company, cross-border payments network provider Earthport, MA stock investors can be confident the payments processor is doing all it can to remain competitive.Both Mastercard and Visa have seen their stocks rise as the world moves to cashless economies. With the evolution to digital money, the entire payments industry continues to benefit from double-digit profit growth.At the same time, it makes a decision to invest in MA stock or V shares more than a simple buy-or-sell question. In this industry, investors should not ask if they should buy Mastercard stock; they should find out if it or one of its peers would bring more profit?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips MasterCard Keeps Up Yet Falls BehindWith MasterCard buying Transfast and Visa presumably winning the bidding war to acquire Earthport, both firms get better access to bank accounts and ACH networks globally. Perhaps more importantly, both card processors expand their presence in peer-to-peer money transactions.So, as the world more toward a cashless society, the MA-Visa rivalry gets more heated. In nearly all cases, most merchants accept both types of cards. Yes, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) only accepts Visa, but such exclusive instances are rare.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% However, despite this parity, Visa dominates in terms of gross dollar volume, which covers all types of transactions. As of the third quarter of 2018, Visa controlled 61.5% of the market. This compares to only 25.2% for MA, and 11.1% for American Express (NYSE:AXP). Mastercard Benefits From Fintech GrowthHowever, where Mastercard lags in credit cards, it has compensated with its moves into debit cards and e-commerce. Thankfully for Mastercard stock bulls, these areas will see the most near-term growth in the fintech space.The benefit -- and the problem -- with this fintech sector is that every equity in the industry would probably bring profits. Even Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS), which holds only 2.2% of the market, should see double-digit profit growth this year. One could make an argument that MA stock would deliver higher returns than Discover. However, whether it can outperform its other peers is the bigger question. Should I Buy MA Stock?The MA stock price hovers near its 52-week high of about $228 per share. Still, it struggles to stand out even as it posts stellar numbers. In both profit and valuation, Mastercard and Visa appear similar. Mastercard stock analysts forecast profit increases of 16.3% this year and 18.4% in 2020. This barely exceeds the 15.4% rate for 2019 and 15.8% 2020 growth predicted for Visa. Moreover, the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio slightly exceeds that of Visa, 25.5 vs. 24.8.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio I like Mastercard stock better now than last year when I panned it for its high multiple and lower profit growth. Achieving near parity with Visa has changed the value proposition. However, it has not made MA stock more of a bargain than Visa.Moreover, if we evaluate these stocks purely on valuation, both American Express and Discover trade at single-digit PE ratios. Both have grown profits more slowly than Mastercard. However, with American Express set to overtake Mastercard as the second-largest processor of credit cards, AXP stock could become the equity of choice in this space. Bottom Line on Mastercard StockAlthough Mastercard stock remains a buy, the fintech sector appears to offer better options. The purchase of Transfast should enhance Mastercard's ability to conduct transactions. However, it continues to struggle to differentiate itself from Visa even as Visa achieves increasing dominance with credit card transactions.MA stock will continue to benefit from double-digit profit growth for the foreseeable future. Also, even though its 25.5 PE ratio exceeds its peers, most analysts would not call Mastercard stock &quot;overpriced.&quot; Still, for investors who intend to pursue a higher return, they might see a larger profit by buying AXP stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-15,"Whatever else 2018 brought to the U.S., it was a Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) Christmas.Source: Shutterstock The wholesale warehouse club's U.S. sales rose 7.4% for the quarter ending in January, with same store sales up a full 6%.   * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs The result was net income of $889 million, $2.01 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $34.628 billion. Profits even exceeded membership fees of $768 million.Regular members noticed. The parking lot of my nearest Costco this past Christmas looked like a Trader Joe's, and I had to go to another one. Investors were even bigger winners. The shares had hit a mid-December low of $194.50, but opened for trade March 12 at over $229 and are approaching last year's record high of $241.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Most Valuable RetailerAt its current price, Costco has a market cap of $101 billion, a price-to-earnings multiple over 29, and is worth 72% of its sales.Compare Costco's valuation to that of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), analysts' previous favorite. That company has a market cap that is 55% of sales, and its dividend of $2.12 per year yields 2.18%, while Costco's $2.28 per share represents a yield of just 1.05%.The only thing overpriced at Costco is Costco. No one has named their dog after it, but they're getting close. Costco caters to upper-middle class, suburban tastes. Its stores feature the finest wines, prime meats, extra virgin olive oil and store brand liquor that's equal to the best name brands. Its arrangement with Citigroup (NYSE:C) to handle Visa (NYSE:V) cards has proven profitable for both the company and its members (we're taking a weekend vacation on our dividend). Its growth rate in e-commerce is 24%. Within its niche, Costco is even more popular than Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Small wonder that, even at its current price, 12 of 27 analysts following the stock say buy it and none says sell.Costco does this while paying what workers consider reasonable salaries, with cashiers making almost half the salary of store managers.  The company recently hiked its minimum wage to $15 per hour.When you go there, people smile. How Long, How HighThe problem is that when you buy a stock you're paying for its yesterdays and buying its tomorrows. The price of Costco stock today is close to the price targets of Costco bulls.Costco is not growing as fast internationally as it is in the U.S., and it is starting to saturate the U.S. market, where it has 535 of its 770 warehouses. It can cost $100 million to build and outfit a new store, and the company is very careful to get the very best deals on them. Rumors of possible new store openings are big news, and when the company walks away there is often profound disappointment. Costco bears are left wishing and hoping that scan-and-go shopping, in which customers scan the items they want and get them delivered, mobile payments with installment financing, or warehouse fulfillment will deliver Costco's savings with greater convenience.  Trouble is, Costco is already doing some of these things. The Bottom Line on Costco StockCostco is running on all cylinders. It's not doing a thing wrong. Customers and analysts know this.This means Costco is a pricey stock. It can't make you rich because everyone is already in it. Its growth may be limited because it has already scaled.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Today But if anyone knows the future of upper-class consumption, it's Costco. I wouldn't bet against it. You may just want to wait for another market crash like last December's to buy it.A Costco shopper is always looking for bargains.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-17,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Shares of Costco Wholesale NASDAQ COST jumped 5 trading following the warehouse retailer s positive earnings news on March 7 But broader market pressure put a damper on COST stock,3 Reasons to Buy Costco Stock After Strong Earnings Show Business Strength
2019-03-17,"Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) jumped 5% trading following the warehouse retailer's positive earnings news on March 7. But broader market pressure put a damper on COST stock despite strong results. But it's because of those good results that this action caught our eye. After the big move, Costco stock continued to climb, leaving many investors to wonder what to do now.Is there still time to get long?Costco stock is setting up as a solid long for several reasons. Let's discuss three of them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Costco Stock EarningsFor the fiscal second quarter, Costco stock reported earning per share of $2.01, 31 cents ahead of expectations. That 18% earnings surprise pushed the performance up more than 40% year-over-year (YoY). However, revenue of $35.65 billion came up short by more than $250 million, despite growing more than 7.2% YoY. A bottom-line beat and top-line miss can spell trouble for a stock, particularly on a bad market day like the one we had on Friday.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash But that wasn't the case for COST stock and I think it's due to the strength in the business once we dig past the headline results. Forex and gas deflation weighed on revenue, as did the weather in some cases. Given the winter we've had, it's hard to deny that as a factor. If these issues caused the miss, investors were apparently fine with overlooking the sales shortfall. Further, U.S. comp-store sales jumped 7.2% YoY, but online sales were even more impressive. E-commerce comps jumped 25.5% YoY, showing just how well Costco is adjusting its business model for its customers.To be sure, the results could have been stronger, but it was still a pretty good showing for one of the market's premier retailers. Coupled with some of the catalysts below, the report is enough to help, not hinder COST stock. Trading Costco Stock  Click to EnlargeAfter a solid rally on Friday, March 8, COST stock followed up with an explosive move higher on the following Monday and Tuesday. All told, shares are now up around 8% since reporting earnings. However, according to the relative strength index, the stock price was overbought in the short-term. As shown in the chart above, over the past 12 months this type of condition has tended to put pressure on Costco stock in the short term.If we get that here, I would love to see a few days of sideways action and/or a slight pullback. It would be a very healthy way for Costco stock to digest the big rally. On a pullback, it would be bullish to see the $230 level hold as support and give its 20-day moving average a chance to catch up to the move.If COST stock starts to move higher again, $240 could be a reasonable upside target, with former highs near $245 as the second target. On the downside, I'm watching $230. If it doesn't hold, I want to see the 20-day or uptrend support hold. Below $225 and Costco stock will be concerning from the long side over the short-term.Overall though, it's hard to be too bearish after a rally like this. Analysts Are Boosting EstimatesWe're halfway through Costco's fiscal year and full-year estimates are impressive. Analysts now expect the company to earn $7.92 per share, up 11.7% from last year, with 7.7% sales growth. For next year, consensus expectations call for a deceleration in growth as analysts expect earnings and revenue to grow 7.4% and 6.9%, respectively.It's worth pointing out that current-year estimates of $7.92 per share are up from $7.76 just a week ago. Still, Costco stock trades at a premium, at 29 times this year's earnings. That's in-line with its five-year average, while its forward price-to-earnings ratio of ~27 is roughly in-line as well. However, COST stock is trading at a premium to some of its other metrics.  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs Is that premium deserved? Like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and other premier companies, Costco knows it won't dominate Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Because it collects an annual fee from its 52 million members and retains a high percentage of those members (with a retention rate above 90% last quarter), Costco has flexibility. Its online and same-day delivery show strong growth and Costco will be one of the companies that not only survives but thrives from e-commerce growth.When it comes to dividend yield, Costco is no Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), as it pays out just 1%. However, last April the company bumped this payout by 14%, which is roughly in-line with its five-year average of 14.5% annual dividend growth. That's a solid raise to receive each year, particularly considering how well COST stock has done in that span as well, up 105%.Costco stock isn't cheap, but it deserves its premium valuation as a blue-chip retailer.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-19,"Warren Buffett has a clear investing mantra: He likes value, and he likes holding on for the long term. The tactic has worked out well. Since Buffett took the reins of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) in 1964, through the end of 2018, his stock has delivered an annual return of 20.5% that more than doubled the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.Indeed, as the Oracle of Omaha famously told investors, his favorite investing period is &quot;forever.&quot; This message reappeared in the hedge fund guru's most recent annual letter. In describing the fund's current portfolio of stocks, Buffett wrote, &quot;In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.&quot;The 88-year old continued, &quot;My expectation of more stock purchases is not a market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will behave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities. Our thinking, rather, is focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price.&quot;That said, times change, and so do investing theses. Buffett has exited positions before, and will continue doing so when it makes sense - sometimes very quickly. For instance, Berkshire recently announced that it had exited its position in Oracle (ORCL) during the fourth quarter - a position it had initiated just one quarter earlier! That's an exception to the norm, but the point is some Buffett stocks are destined to be around longer than others.With this in mind, we delved into Berkshire's portfolio and found five Warren Buffett stocks that seem likely to stick around for the long term.

2019-03-20,"Investors have many different tools with which to judge companies. Most of these tend to focus on financial metrics, such as revenues or earnings. Sometimes, we analyze non-numerical things, such as a company's competitive moat, or the quality of its management team.However, investors rarely consider how content a company's employees are. And, arguably, that's a big mistake. At the end of the day, a company's workforce is one of its most vital assets. Particularly for businesses that interact heavily with the general public, having an upbeat and welcoming group of employees can be a hugely underrated asset. Happy employees are great for your brand. They also tend to cut down on more hidden costs, such as severance, employee training, compensation for safety accidents and other such expenses that pile up when workers are dissatisfied and frequently leaving your firm.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly With that in mind, here are five stocks to buy for happy employees. Our first stock gives a good example of the benefits of a content labor force.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Costco (COST)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Have you ever wondered why people rave about shopping at Costco (NASDAQ:COST)? It's a little strange that folks get so excited to buy large quantities of basic goods in rather drab industrial-looking buildings. What is Costco doing differently than less favored big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club? I'd argue that Costco's employees make the difference. Whereas employees in other big chain stores tend to seem aloof and unmotivated, Costco makes you feel more welcome. Presumably, employees have that extra drive thanks to generous renumeration from the company. Costco offers employees a $14-an-hour, company-wide minimum wage and pays more than $22 per hour on average. That's a huge figure for a retailing company.Indeed's recent survey of workplace satisfaction also showed employees appreciated other aspects besides the base pay. Costco is known for having great benefits including generous vacation pay, and it promotes heavily from within. You can make a good argument that Costco's superior team of employees has been a defining reason why its stock has crushed most other retailers over the past 25 years. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Source: Shutterstock The Indeed survey specifically mentioned Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) subsidiary Aflac as one of its best places to work. While Aflac is known for its humorous advertising, apparently it has also set itself apart from the competition by treating its employees well. That's a trait that runs broadly across the Berkshire Hathaway set of companies. Warren Buffett has built a reputation as a hands-off manager who likes to acquire private and family-run companies, and let them keep operating largely independently. Buffett values company culture, and unlike many buyers, Buffett doesn't gut companies to save money after purchasing them.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter This respect for employees has paid Berkshire Hathaway many dividends over the years. Buffett is often able to buy companies for less money than other suitors would have to pay, as potential sellers know they'll get a strong and trustworthy partner by selling to Buffett. It's a classic example of paying more in the short run to elevate your reputation to a far higher level over the long haul. The results for BRK.B stock over the decades speak for themselves. Capital One (COF)Source: Shutterstock Like Aflac, Capital One (NYSE:COF) is another large financial corporation that interacts with thousands of customers every day across its multitude of branches. In fact, Capital One is now one of the nation's 10 largest banks. In the competitive world of big banking, any edge can help in terms of attracting and retaining customers. Capital One has chosen to give its employees generous benefits as part of its effort to distinguish itself from rival banks. And the approach appears to be working. COF stock has reached new all-time highs after the financial crisis; that's an achievement that many other banks still haven't managed.What sets Capital One apart? According to Indeed, the company offers particularly generous health and wellness benefits. These include 18 weeks of maternity leave and assistance with adoption services, for example. One employee that Indeed quoted said that the most difficult part was, &quot;taking advantage of all the benefits.&quot; That's not a bad problem to have. With the stock trading at just 7x earnings, Capital One is clearly doing well enough to reward both its shareholders and employees generously. FedEx (FDX)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Trucking and transportation isn't the first area you'd probably think of when trying to find companies with particularly happy employees. But give FedEx (NYSE:FDX) credit for topping expectations. The popular conception of a truck driver is a lonely, difficult, and stressful life. Listen to someone like Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang talk about truckers, and you'd think it were one of the worst jobs in the world. Yet, FedEx is able to keep its employees happy. It has done so, in large part by offering generous benefits to its employees. Importantly, it offers these benefits even to its part-time staff. That's a huge motivation for workers in an age when so many companies intentionally refuse to give employees 40 hour weeks precisely to avoid paying benefits.  * 4 Unexpected Trade War Stocks That Will Benefit From an End to Tariffs As a potential shareholder, you might think this sort of largess would weigh too heavily on the bottom line. But it hasn't. Over the past 10 years, FedEx has managed 8% annualized revenue growth, and incredible 21% EPS growth. It turns out that treating your employees well can in fact be a win-win for both them and stock owners. Apple (AAPL)Source: Shutterstock This last one probably doesn't come as a surprise if you've shopped at their stores. But yes, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also made Indeed's list of the 10 companies with the happiest employees. This is a natural achievement for Apple, as it fits so very well with their status as a luxury brand. Apple is able, in large part, to charge higher prices for its products because of the brand. An Apple product is an aspirational one. People keep buying Apple phones habitually, regardless of the cost and comparisons to competitors' products, in large part due to this effect.And a big part of that comes from keeping Apple's reputation spotless. Apple helps achieve this by making sure its employees are delighted to work there. Like others on this list, Apple offers extremely generous benefits, the most appealing of which may be its policy of giving nearly a month of vacation days every year. American companies are notably stingy with vacation days, as opposed to European and Japanese firms. This difference gives Apple a key competitive edge in finding and retaining the best employees against stiff competition across the tech industry.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned BRK.B and FDX stock.

2019-03-20,"E-commerce data analytics firm Marketplace Pulse recently conducted in-depth research on private label brands on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The conclusion seemed unfavorable for Amazon stock. According to the firm, Amazon's private-label brand portfolio actually has more duds than studs.Source: Shutterstock The research  suggests that Amazon's private-label business isn't growing. That could be the reason why Amazon's e-commerce growth machine has cooled rapidly. Indeed, over the past several quarters, Amazon's e-commerce business has gone from a 20%-plus grower which dominated the digital retail world to growing just above 10% and ceding market share to other digital retailers.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly But there's another big takeaway from Marketplace Pulse's report,  one that is bullish for Amazon stock. Namely, the report included a quote from an Amazon spokesperson who said that Amazon's private-label products represent less than 1% of the company's total sales.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's tiny. At other large retailers, the private-label business represents 30% or more of total sales. Thus, the bullish takeaway from the report is that Amazon's private-label business, with the right execution, could grow by leaps and bounds over the next several years.That would be big for Amazon stock. Most importantly, it would wake up the Amazon e-commerce- growth machine, reinvigorate investors' enthusiasm about Amazon stock, and spur more investors to buy AMZN stock. Furthermore, it would boost the company's margins, add firepower to what is already turning into a robust profit-growth outlook, and help AMZN grow into its valuation.Overall, a private-label surge could turn into a big deal for Amazon stock. Here's a deeper look. Amazon's Private-Label Business Is TinyAmazon is a big company. With over $230 billion of sales last year, Amazon is the second-largest retailer in the world, behind only Walmart (NYSE:WMT).But, for such a big retailer, Amazon's private-label business is really small. Amazon's private-label business represents less than 1% of its total sales. That means that Amazon's private-label business generates less than $2.3 billion of annual revenue.That's small. Over at Costco (NASDAQ:COST), the Kirkland  brand alone represents nearly one-third of its total sales, or about $40 billion. Similarly, one-third of Target's (NYSE:TGT) total sales in 2018, or about $25 billion, were from owned and exclusive brands,. At Kroger (NYSE:KR), private-label -brand-unit share hit 30.5% in the fourth-quarter, which, at an annualized rate,  represents about a $34 billion business.At many other big retailers, the private -label business runs anywhere from 15%-30%-plus of total sales, equating to $15 billion-$40 billion-plus of annual revenue.Next to those figures, Amazon's sub-1% private label penetration rate and  roughly $2 billion private-label business are tiny. Amazon's Private-Label Business Could Be Really Big One DayAmazon's private label business could be really big one day.The math is pretty simple. An average private-label penetration rate of 25%  on all of Amazon's 2018 revenue, excluding the sales of its cloud business,  implies a private-label business of nearly $52 billion, versus its private-label business of about $2 billion today. That represents a 25-fold increase in private label sales. That's huge. Furthermore, it equates to an additional $50 billion revenue opportunity, for a company that reported $232 billion of sales in 2018. That means that AMZN could grow its top line 20%-plus by expanding its private-label business.Private-label products are made and sold by the company itself, reducing the role of middle men. Thus, private label sales increase margins. That means that, if AMZN increases its private-label business to 20% of its revenue, its bottom line would get a favorable bump of much more than 20%.In other words, this isn't small peanuts. It's a big deal.Now, the big question is: can AMZN do it? Can it turn a relatively small private- label business into a $50 billion-plus behemoth? The short answer is: yes. AMZN has done it before with other businesses, and it will do it again.The company has the data, reach, reputation, and brand equity necessary to sell Amazon-branded products on a large scale. The Marketplace Pulse research report partly corroborates this thesis. Although many of Amazon's private-label brands are duds, the ones with the name &quot;Amazon&quot; attached to them are doing very well, the report stated. That speaks volumes about this company's brand equity and reputation.Meanwhile, AMZN hasn't yet figured out a way to consistently utilize its wealth of consumer preference and shopping data to help it sell private-label products. But it's only a matter of time before the company does so. When it does, the company's private-label business will boom, especially considering that AMZN can put those products in front of millions of shoppers.So it does seem like only a matter of time before Amazon executes on its tremendous opportunity to create a huge private-label business. The Bottom Line on Amazon StockAmazon stock is a long-term winner, mostly because of this company's multiple, large growth levers. One underappreciated big growth lever is Amazon's opportunity in the private-label business. AMZN currently has one of the smallest private label businesses of any major retailer. With the right execution, that relatively small private-label business could become very large and raise the company's top line by 20%-plus and add far more to the bottom line.All in all, investors should stick with Amazon stock for many reasons, including its $50 billion private-label opportunity.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, COST, TGT, and KR.

2019-03-21,"Costco (NASDAQ:COST) continues to appeal to those who like extraordinarily large food items with massive lobster claws, with a single one weighing as much as a newborn baby.costco stock costSocial media has been buzzing with the new products from the Wash.-based retailer, which now carries Kirkland-branded giant lobster claws.

Costco said on its website that a six-count of live Maine lobsters that weighed about 1.25 pounds apiece would set you back $129.99.This isn't the first supersized product that Costco has sold recently as back in January, it sold out of its Chef's Banquet Macaroni and Cheese Storage Bucket, which has 180 servings of the food, coming in at 27 pounds.COST stock is up about 0.8% on Thursday.

2019-03-21,"Between Dec. 24 and Mar. 20, Target (NYSE:TGT) stock staged an impressive rally and went from a low of $60.15 to a recent high of $78.77. The Minneapolis-based retailer with 1,845 stores across the U.S. has shown strong growth in recent quarters and I expect the positivity to continue for Target stock.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Therefore, I suggest that long-term investors consider adding Target stock into a diversified portfolio. Here is why. Target Has Strong FundamentalsOn Mar. 5, TGT released its fourth-quarter financial results and posted its best sales numbers since 2005. Revenues came at $22.98 billion. The Street cheered both the better-than-expected Q4 earnings report and the 2019 earnings-per-share guidance of $5.90, which beat the consensus of $5.70.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter These results follow an already strong November and December trading update that the group released in January when it reported that its holiday period comparable sales had increased by 5.7%.One of the factors behind the impressive numbers has been the strength of the U.S. economy and the resiliency of the consumer despite the continuing U.S.-China trade war rhetoric. In addition, Target has been taking steps to win the confidence and patronage of consumers. For example, over the past year, the retailer has improved its supply chain and logistics operations, leading to cost and time savings in delivery and fulfillment practices.About 90% of retail sales still take place in stores nationwide. And Target has been investing in its stores by remodeling them as well as opening smaller-format stores in residential areas and on college campuses to bring in the foot traffic. According to the company, &quot;Three-quarters of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target store.&quot; As part of its plan is to emphasize ease and convenience, Target has also introduced same-day delivery as well as curbside pickup at many locations.Its efforts to become a respected player in today's digital market are also paying off. After the data-breach incident of 2013, where information on over 40 million Target consumers was compromised, the retailer started investing heavily in the digital space and its e-commerce channel.  For example, it has recently announced an upcoming partnership with Pinterest to integrate Lens, the visual search offered by Pinterest, to its online store. The 31% increase in digital sales that was announced in the quarterly results is now cementing Target's claim to have become an omni-channel retailer.TGT currently trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 14.3 and many investors may find value in that number. If the company continues to offer robust top-line growth and improving margins, Target's stock price could justify a higher valuation, too. For example, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has a trailing P/E of 44.3 and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) 31.3. Therefore I am quite comfortable with the stock's valuation despite the run-up in TGT stock's price. Technical Charts for TGT StockOver the past few weeks, both long-term and short-term technical indicators for Target stock have broken their 2018 downtrends, moving steadily higher. As such, many of the widely watched technical indicators now suggest a bullish momentum heading into the stock.However, most retail stocks may be volatile in the coming weeks as we get updates on the state of U.S.-China trade negotiations. Also, there could be some short-term profit-taking following the strong gains in 2019.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find Target stock to be a compelling buy candidate and I'd regard any potential dip in the price as an opportunity to grab the shares for the long term. Within a year, I 'd expect the shares to trade at $90.  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens Therefore, if you already own Target shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may want to protect your portfolio with a covered call or possibly a put option spread with a three-month time horizon. If you do not yet hold TGT, you may want to wait several weeks to buy into the stock at the next dip. The Bottom Line on Target StockI believe that the rest of this decade could see new highs for the TGT stock price thanks to the growth tailwind in the business and execution by management. And anyone who buys can also enjoy dividend income, which now stands at a yield of 3.2%.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

CyberArk Software (CYBR)Source: Shutterstock  CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) is a cybersecurity company that's based out of Israel but has clients all over the globe. Its claim to fame is its privileged-access security software. Privileged accounts are the most secure properties that exist in most organizations. And when those organizations are storing very critical data like financial institutions, healthcare companies, utilities and other enterprise organizations that have significant amounts of these types of accounts, it's crucial that they're secure internally and externally.And this is CYBR does. It also offers other products, but this is the hub of its cybersecurity wheel.As we see bigger and more sophisticated hacks of major databases and the information inside those databases, more and more companies are doing their best to avoid being the next embarrassing headline.The A-rated stock is up 138% in the past 12 months, which is testament to the growing global demand for CYBR's platform. Lululemon (LULU)Source: Shutterstock  Lululemon athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) is an upscale sportswear company that pretty much coined the term 'athleisure'. What LULU has done very well is know its customers and maintain control of its brand. Its products are not cheap. But that's the point. They're well made, and by not distributing them outside of its own retail shops and e-commerce site, it has been able to keep prices where it needs them to be.Bigger brands in the market have massive distribution networks, which means pricing premiums are harder to maintain and that makes it tough to control margins.LULU has built a great and growing customer base and has patiently expanded its market in to menswear.  * 7 Retail Stocks That Will Continue to Rebound in 2019 LULU stock is up more than 80% in the past 12 months, yet it still trades a trailing P/E of 51.

First BanCorp (FBP)Source: Shutterstock  First BanCorp (NYSE: FBP) is a Puerto Rican bank that has been in business since 1948. It also has operations in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. While the recent devastating hurricane is still fresh in our minds and the Caribbean -- in particular Puerto Rico -- is still recovering, the fact is that redeveloping the island is underway. And that redevelopment means money has to start flowing in.That's why being one of the top local banks is a great position to be in right now. Also remember that other islands were affected by the hurricane and Puerto Rico is a big financial hub for other Caribbean islands.This increase in rebuilding and redevelopment has certainly been reflected in FBP's stock price. The stock is up more than 80% in the past 12 months. That's pretty spectacular for a financial stock.And there's plenty more to come, given the fact that this A-rated stock is still trading at a trailing P/E of 12.

It also owns QuickBooks which is a suite of financial and business tools geared toward small businesses. It allows small business owners a place to do payroll, sort out taxes, integrate all the accounting inputs and even market and hire.INTU's other division sells similar products that are focused on professional accountants and larger businesses.But the real growth potential is in the products focused on small businesses and consumers.

Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock  Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is the Land of Giant Portions and a great favorite for small businesses and consumers alike. Last year, Costco was doing well. It tends to reflect the broader economy, so when the economy is chugging along, so is COST. But in December, it hit the same wall most consumer stocks did.Worries about growth moving forward and all the feel-good valuations up to that point disintegrated.However, COST came roaring back like it was a beaten down semiconductor stock.At this point, its 12-month return is 32% and its trailing P/E is 31. COST should have a strong year, with decent growth ahead and wages improving. That means more people shopping and spending.

Now, a decade ago, I would have likely called it a credit card company. My how the world has changed. Granted, MA got started as Interbank in 1966 and landed on its current incarnation in 1979. Remember, back then, if you were traveling, you couldn't just whip out a card and buy things. Banks and their merchants needed to be interconnected so that your card could charge a dinner at a California restaurant even though your bank was in Kansas.The credit card was a revolution at the time. Just as electronic payments are today. And now that national transaction has given way to international transactions that are all done without cards at all.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course This history and brand recognition is what has propelled MA in this new financial services transformation. It's up 35% in the past 12 months, but this new financial digital world has only just begun. Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL)Source: Nicolas Henderson via Flickr  Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE: TPL) has been around since 1888, when the Texas and Pacific Railway went belly up. Obviously, at the time, railroads owned huge amounts of land so they could develop their lines. And the Texas and Pacific was no different. Also, given its name, most of this land was in west Texas on the way to the Pacific.At the time of its demise, the railway owned 3.5 million acres that was transferred to TPL. Today, TPL still holds about 900,000 acres of this land, which still makes it one of the largest landholders in Texas today.Fundamentally, TPL leases the land to companies that are either energy firms (not just oil and natural gas but wind and solar farms as well) or water companies and it takes those rents as its revenues.This is a solid business in slow times. But in good times -- like now -- it promises some big gains. TPL is up 47% in the past year and 71% in just the past 3 months, so momentum is growing significantly in 2019.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-03-25,"Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) stock is having a great fiscal 2019, and the reason is Olive Garden.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Olive Garden, an Italian-restaurant chain found outside many suburban malls, represents about half of Darden's revenue, and is its fastest-growing brand. In the third quarter, its revenues were up 5.3% year-over-year to $1.13 billion, and its profits rose 9% to $247 million. Olive Garden accounted for about half the company's revenues, which came to $2.24 billion, and more than half its profit.   * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend The great numbers led the stock to a rise of nearly 7% on March 21, to $116, but even that price may be reasonable for a middle-aged investor (who is, by the way, squarely in the Olive Garden market) who wants both capital gains and dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOlive Garden's growth and profitability have helped make DRI stock one of the better investments of the decade. Over the last five years, DRI stock is up 156%. Compare that to Costco Wholesale's (NASDAQ:COST) gain of 114%. The quarterly dividend of Darden Restaurants stock has risen about 35%, from 55 cents per share to 75 cents. Room to GrowOlive Garden is middle-class dining that feels like fine dining, with menus that feature low-cost food items like bread sticks and pasta. But DRI has a second chain that's now doing just as well, the fine- dining restaurant called Capital Grille, where same-store sales for the third quarter were up 4.3%, in-line with Olive Garden's gain.Not everything is working for DRI stock. Same-store sales at DRI's Caribbean-themed Bahama Breeze chain fell 3.7% YoY. The SSS of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, a casual-dining chain featuring hamburgers and other comfort foods, were down 2.7%.A bear might say DRI stock has trouble. A bull would say it still has room to advance. The company's net earnings -- $223 million or $1.79 per share fully diluted -- cover its dividend more than twice over.TV analysts have long sung the praise of DRI, and for good reason. That dividend of Darden Restaurants stock represents a respectable yield of 2.76% for current investors, and the stock's performance over the last five years is nearly double that of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which gets most of the industry buzz, and is up &quot;just&quot; 96% in that time. Listing to StarboardDarden wasn't always a big winner.Five years ago, activist investor Starboard targeted the company, criticizing the food at the Garden, and eventually gained control of DRI. Starboard brought in a new CEO, Gene Lee, who simplified the menu, stripping it back to its Italian roots, added higher-priced wines and improved its service. Starboard then took its profit in DRI stock in 2016. The success of Olive Garden and Capital Grille is now in the process of being replicated at Longhorn Steakhouse. which DRI acquired in 2007.If Cheddar's and Bahama Breeze can get the same attention that Starboard has lavished on Olive Garden, DRI could be on the path to even faster growth. That's why, even at its current price, 14 of the 26 analysts following Darden Restaurants stock have it on their buy lists. The Bottom Line on DRI StockWhat the success of Darden's indicates is that middle-class American dining tastes are becoming further upscale as the economy continues to grow.A focus on youthful exuberance, boozy drinks and simple fare like hamburgers is being replaced with a focus on white tablecloth experiences, albeit at an affordable price. Darden's success gives management room to hike the dividend of DRI stock after it reports its fourth-quarter results this summer.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-26,"My first assignment as a freelance writer, in 1983, was writing the annual report for an Atlanta tech company called Intelligent Systems (NYSEAMERICAN:INS). I forgot all about Leland Strange until today, when I learned that ISC's CoreCard payment processing software will be at the heart of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Card, announced on March 25.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) licensed CoreCard to back the Apple Card. It's a small part of the deal, but it illustrates an important point. While most banks completely manage the technology for cards of affiliates, as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) does for Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Citicorp (NYSE:C) does for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Goldman is letting Apple handle the technology on Apple Card.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis will make all the difference. Unique FeaturesDifferences between Apple Card, which is badged to Master Card (NYSE:MA) rather than Visa (NYSE:V), and every other bank card will only become apparent this summer when iOS 12.2 is released with a new version of Apple Wallet.Through Apple Wallet, Apple will be able to identify merchants using maps so workers get full reimbursements when they travel, without paging through complex strings of letters and numbers on bank statements, or even waiting for those statements to arrive. Apple Pay will also automatically track spending across categories, simplifying personal budgeting, and that feature won't be available to other banks.  * 10 Tech Stocks With Key Products That Face an Uncertain Future There will be a physical credit card. It will be chip-based, with only the cardholder's name, not the card number, CVV number and signature that make most cards easy prey for thieves.But that's a side issue. Most transactions will happen entirely in the phone, using Near Field Signaling, which Apple got banks and payment technology companies to support on the belief it wouldn't compete with them. The Bank of AppleThe Apple Card itself carries no fees but modest rewards, 1% on most purchases, 2% on Apple purchases. All rebates, however, come back daily in the form of Apple Cash, which is integrated with the Apple Pay wallet. Most card rewards come just once a year.The modest rewards are leading banking analysts to think Apple Card won't be competitive. They're missing the fact that Apple will be getting paid for its own new services through the card, giving iPhone owners daily access to the credit card's features.They're also ignoring Apple's marketing machine, where it's emphasizing simplicity, transparency and privacy rather than terms and conditions. By giving people a running total of their spending, and daily access to all rebates generated by the card, Apple is trying to grab customers' entire banking relationship, not just their credit card account.To its customers, Apple will be their bank, not Goldman Sachs, even though Goldman is running interference on the card for regulators and taking on the credit risks. This is also why the direct rebates on the card are modest. Apple won't just be looking at the high end of the credit market.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy Now All this will be initially available only in the U.S., where Apple has about 44% of the mobile phone market. But because Apple signed its deal with a global bank, Goldman Sachs is already exploring how it can get the card into other countries. The Bottom Line on the Apple CardWhile Apple spent most of the time at its March 25 event highlighting its competition with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), that's the financial sizzle. Apple Card is the financial steak.Apple Card is going to show Cloud Czars like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon just how much power they can have by seizing the technology side of banking relationships.As our Luke Lango wrote last month, this is a very big deal for Apple stock.Dana Blankenhorn http://www.danablankenhorn.com is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-28,"The rhetoric in the media this week has been bearish even when markets rallied on Tuesday. So there is trepidation on Wall Street and traders have one foot out the exit door. But there are a few exceptions and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) is one that continues to shine. LULU stock is headed higher, even from here.Source: Shutterstock Last night, management reported earnings and investors loved what they saw. LULU stock is up 12% on the headline as they delivered an excellent report card. Moreover, the stock came into earnings day already up 20% year-to-date. This was already ahead of the S&P 500 and the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) by 9%.So, did they beat expectations? The answer is an emphatic YES! They clobbered both the sales and earnings expectations. Long gone are the days of the see-through pant debacle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat makes this more impressive is that they had already raised the range for the quarter. Not only did they crush the sales estimates with 16% comparable sales, but they increased their bottom line 87% from last year. LULU Chief Executive Officer said that the company had its best year ever behind system-wide strength in their business.  * 10 F-Rated Stocks to Sell in This Narrow Market What makes this more impressive is that even as LULU stock is almost at its all-time highs they committed to a $500 million buyback program. This confidence from the management team eliminates all doubts that they can continue to perform this well.LULU has figured out the right mix of product lines. They are growing new areas like shoes and men's lines. This way they can leverage their sales infrastructure to flow stronger margins to the bottom line. To that point, margins are already strong, especially in e-commerce and they rarely discount.Fundamentally they steered away from the athleisure pin. For the longest time investors deemed it a fad. But lately it morphed into a way of life-wear and it definitely stepped out of the yoga studios.Lululemon stock is not cheap. It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 44, which is expensive in absolute terms say relative to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which sells at a P/E of 18. But it's in line with retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) or Walmart (NYSE:WMT).For as long as LULU continues to deliver on growth as they have been doing, I will give them a pass on valuation. I'd rather pay 44 times for LULU than risk the same P/E on Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or Costco (NASDAQ:COST). LULU is clearly executing on plans almost flawlessly and it is not shackled like these two traditional brick and mortar chains. How to Approach LULU StockLULU still has a clear road to exponential expansion. CEO Calvin McDonald also confirmed that they had strength in the Chinese markets. So the growth there is exploding and it's just getting started. This leaves little room to fade the rally. Shorting LULU stock here is the equivalent of shorting equity markets in general. Strength in Asia more than offset whatever weakness comes from Europe.This is a stock that is defying gravity and in the face of tremendous unease on Wall Street. After all, we are still facing headwinds from geopolitical headline risk from Brexit and the global tariff wars. So as LULU stock approaches its all-time highs it becomes crucial that it slices right through it.  * The 7 Best Bond Funds to Buy for a Shift in Interest Rates Those already long LULU can stay in it and set trailing stops based on portfolio balance and preferences. But for those looking to buy the stock, this is not an obvious entry point. However, LULU is a momentum stock so it won't give us a clear signal to enter. It's going to be a case of buy high and sell higher.Nevertheless, it won't be a bad idea to see the bulls actually close above the all-time high before chasing it. In short, if the markets are higher this year, then so is Lululemon stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.9 could draw some investors by itself. Seeing SIG stock trade at 0.22 times sales and just 1.07 times its book value adds to the perception of its reasonable valuation.  * 15 Stocks to Buy Leading the Financial Charge Moreover, the company pays a generous dividend. The annual payout of $1.48 per share amounts to a yield of around 5.3%. This dividend has also increased every year since the company first initiated payouts in 2011.However, beyond these attributes, more concerning trends have appeared. As mentioned earlier, analysts expect both revenue and earnings to come in lower. Unfortunately for SIG stock bulls, the revenue slide began in 2016 and earnings peaked in 2017 before moving the other direction. Analysts predict that these trends will continue through at least fiscal 2020. The Years of Struggle for Signet ContinueThis also adds to a SIG stock downtrend which began in late 2015. At that time, the share price briefly exceeded $152 per share. Now, in the $28 per share range, SIG trades at levels it first saw in 2003! This has occurred in an environment where archrival Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) continues to grow amid competition from the likes of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) or small jewelers who sell on sites such as Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY).Moreover, the company has reported some disappointing news in recent months. On Jan. 17, SIG stock plunged by 24.7% as the company warned that same-store sales fell by 1.3% from levels of the previous year. Following that report, analysts predicted a drop between 1.6% and 2.5% for the fourth quarter.During that report, they also guided lower on profits. The new guidance of $3.77 to $3.92 per share came in much lower than previous estimates of $4.46 per share. For the fiscal year, earnings estimates fell from $4.25 per share to a range between $3.53 and $3.69 per share.Then in February, SIG announced they had pushed back their earnings date to April 3. They cited the need for more time to research a non-cash impairment charge related to both goodwill and intangible assets.SIG stock beat estimates in each of its four previous reports. Since the company already reduced expectations, I would assume higher revenues and earnings than analysts expect. Still, with investors used to the company beating estimates, inspiring a turnaround will take more. The Bottom Line on SIG StockGoing into earnings, SIG stock remains dead money until signs of a sustained turnaround emerge. The company's low P/E ratio and high dividend yield could draw investors. However, with Signet stock in a long-term downtrend that has erased more than 80% of its value, many could still remain wary until they see increases in Signet stock.At some point, the low P/E ratio and the increasingly generous payout will make SIG a buy. The five-year profit forecast predicts average growth of 7% per year over the next five years. Also, at least one analyst predicts an increase in profits for 2021. Perhaps investors should buy SIG stock at that time.Still, I do not see the stock recovering for now. Until the company shows signs of reversing its revenue and earnings declines, Signet stock should stay off investor buy lists, both before and after earnings.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-03,"Shares of Kroger (NYSE:KR) have already started coming under fire in 2019. While the S&P 500 is up 14.5% on the year, Kroger stock is down 11%. That's not exactly a good way to start 2019 after a horrendous end to 2018.Source: Shutterstock Five years ago, KR stock seemed like a lay-up. It had a decent dividend, reasonable valuation and steady growth in a constantly in-demand industry.Everyone needs food and therefore a well-run grocery outfit was seemingly a no-brainer investment. But come to find out, that doesn't always pan out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally Here are three reasons to consider avoiding Kroger stock. Secular ShiftsKroger is doing its best to keep up with the technology disruption in the grocery industry. This should help keep it defensible as other competitors also increase tech-friendly approaches to grocery stores.But Target (NYSE:TGT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and now Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) via its regular business and its Whole Foods acquisition have seemingly done a better job at moving faster. Throw in increasingly faster delivery options, meal-prep startups and a slew of other options, and KR stock is being left by the wayside.Kroger is a really tough one for me, because on paper it's a great investment. But the stock price is telling us something and as others innovate faster and as a lack of food inflation hinders its margins, it's clear that Kroger is struggling to keep pace. Valuation Isn't EnoughKroger stock may trade at 11 times earnings and yield 2.2%, but is it enough? 11 times earnings is pretty cheap, but Target has a stronger dividend and better growth with a reasonable valuation. Cheap doesn't always mean better and we don't have to look much further than the automakers to make that case.While some gravitate toward low-valuation stocks, I only use as one part of the catalyst. In fact, many other better performers trade at a higher valuation. For instance, Costco, Target, Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) all have a higher valuation than Kroger stock, and all of them have out performed KR over the past year.In fact, Kroger's 1.7% gain over the past 12 months badly lags even the second-worst performer, Walmart, and its 10.3% gain. Costco is up almost 30% in the last year. None of these stocks except for Kroger are negative year to date, while Kroger is also last on the six-month, three-year and five-year timeframes.Simply put, a low valuation is not reason enough to own Kroger. Trading Kroger Stock  Click to EnlargeKroger has perhaps been one of the biggest warning signs in this whole debacle. After a late-2014 surge, KR has been nothing but trouble. And keep in mind, that's almost five-years in the making!At some point, the stock is bound to rally. It's too good of a company to be left behind forever. And unlike the low-valuation automakers, consumers need to buy food every week to stay alive. This gives some &quot;survival&quot; demand for a company like Kroger.That said, I'm struggling to get bullish based on these charts. Kroger stock is about $1 above its 2018 highs. If this level fails to support KR stock, then $20 is back on the table. I don't think Amazon will ruin Kroger's business model overnight, but it's not making life easy when it comes to the stock price.Amazon's announcement last month on a private-label grocery concept blasted Kroger stock below $27, a key level on the long-term charts. The 200-week moving average is rolling over and acting as resistance, while Kroger clings to the backside of prior downtrend resistance.A bounce could ensue and while a run to $29 would be a healthy return, I think that about caps the upside.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-16,"It seems overly anxious to argue that American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock needs big first-quarter results. After all, American Express stock is doing just fine, even if it's been quiet.Source: Shutterstock AXP stock did dip sharply in December, but it's recovered those losses. Over the last year, American Express stock has gained nearly 17%, and it has more than doubled in the last three-plus years.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Still, AXP earnings, due to be reported on Thursday morning, do look reasonably important. The outlook of AXP stock still seems somewhat skeptical, if not outright bearish. Investors are worried about its growth and market share. Its Q4 earnings were disappointing, but the market quickly moved on and kept pushing American Express stock higher. Investors may not be so forgiving if AXP earnings are disappointing again on Thursday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAXP stock has twice failed to break through resistance at about $113, and the average Street price target for American Express stock of $118 suggests an increase of  just 6% from its current level.A &quot;beat and raise&quot; Q1 would likely cause analysts to raise their price targets on AXP stock, leaving AXP well-positioned to reach new highs. If AXP earnings miss expectations, however,  investors may have concerns  about AXP's growth, causing American Express stock to at best trade sideways, as it has for nearly seven months now.As a result, Thursday's earnings do seem to be important for American Express stock,  and investors should review them closely. Expectations for AXP EarningsWall Street is expecting a moderately slow start to the year for American Express. Analysts' consensus revenue estimate projects just 7.6%  year-over-year, top-line growth, below the company's full-year guidance of 8%-10%. The company's margins are expected to be pretty much flat, and analysts on average expect its earnings per share to come in at $1.98, up 6.5% year-over-year.That, too suggests improvement over the rest of the year. Consensus for 2019 as a whole is modestly above the midpoint of the company's guidance, and projects 11% EPS growth.That's good news for AXP stock. AXP is not exactly in a &quot;no-lose&quot; situation, but analysts already expect its growth to accelerate as the year goes on. An in-line quarter, or even a modest miss, won't necessarily endanger that outlook.On the other hand, if AXP results solidly beat expectations, its outlook may get more interesting.  Under that scenario, American Express will have started the year strongly, and will still have the same room for improvement during the rest of the year. Full-year growth estimates may well get raised, and the earnings multiple assigned to American Express stock can also rise. If that occurs, AXP  can reach new highs. AXP Stock and the Post-Earnings CallThat said, the numbers aren't going to be the only aspect of the release to which investors will pay close attention. American Express re-upped its partnership with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) earlier this month. That was a big win for AmEx, which already had lost co-branding agreements with Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU).But American Express had to pay up for the win. It was Delta stock that soared on the news, given that its payments from the deal will double in five years. The end results of that negotiation certainly suggests that American Express' edge over rivals Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has narrowed.So investors will have concerns about AXP's cost and market share  Visa and Mastercard simply are growing faster than AmEx. And the main concern about American Express - and the reason AXP stock is so much cheaper than V and MA - is that at some point, its earnings simply are going to stall out. The entrance of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) into the space only adds to those worries.There likely will be some questions about the Delta deal  and the kind of returns American Express expects on the resulting $3 billion-plus increase in annual spending. Analysts will want management's take on the Apple Card as well. AmEx needs to answer those questions well, and it needs to convince analysts and investors that its place in the credit-card industry is secure. Be Careful With American Express StockAll told, AXP's Q1 results do seem  poised to change the outlook of AXP stock. A beat-and-raise quarter will suggest that AXP's growth remains intact, making the 12.4  forward, price-earnings multiple of AXP stock seem awfully cheap. Any weakness - whether in the company's results or its guidance - will cause investors to ask if fears about AXP's growth are reasonable.That doesn't mean AXP stock is going to move 10% or more on Thursday; AXP simply isn't that type of stock. Rather, AXP's Q1 earnings could shape how American Express stock trades over the next two months  and determine whether AXP stock can finally break through resistance.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-18,"Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) move into the online space continues. Its latest partnership includes an alliance with Kidbox. Kidbox's assortments will bring many upscale clothing brands into Walmart and expand its omnichannel presence. Walmart stock rose slightly higher on the news.Source: Shutterstock Still, investors should take a closer look at how much this will affect WMT stock. Even with the increase in online and upscale options, many of the same problems that have overshadowed the company remain.Once investors take a closer look at WMT overall, they will likely find that Walmart stock already prices in any boost the equity has received from its online and tech-related improvements.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth  Walmart Quality ImprovesUnder terms of the agreement, Walmart and Kidbox will provide personal, stylized boxes. Each box will cost $48 and deliver four or five items chosen from more than 120 premium brands. This should make Walmart more active in the children's clothing business and will provide a way for parents to benefit from more exclusive brands at a lower cost.Walmart had long struggled with a reputation for selling more downscale items. The Kidbox partnership along with its Jetblack, its members-only personal shopping service, should help change this perception.Moreover, it has stepped up its competition with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Not only has Walmart expanded its online presence, but it has also begun to build an online-ad business on its ecommerce site. This has helped take the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio on Walmart stock to about 20.7. Has Walmart Changed?Still, investors have to wonder how much trying to beat Amazon at its own game will help Walmart. Yes, ecommerce sales for Walmart increased by 40% in 2018. However, omnichannel peers such as Target (NYSE:TGT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) have also seen massive online sales growth.Moreover, WMT management also mentions the word &quot;eCommerce&quot; 125 times in the 2018 annual report. Yet for all of this focus, they did not disclose a specific ecommerce revenue figure. One analyst estimated $20.91 billion in U.S. ecommerce sales. Whether or not that is exact, it shows that online sales still constitute a small fraction of the $514.4 billion of Walmart's revenue in the previous fiscal year.WMT has made strides with online and upscale product lines, and this has boosted Walmart stock. However, in other areas, Walmart remains little-changed. While ecommerce registered high-growth, revenues rose by only 2.8% in fiscal 2019. Hence, for all of the focus on online sales, most revenue still comes from its traditional stores. Overriding ConcernsMoreover, many of the complaints that dogged Walmart for decades remain. The company has begun to deploy robots to clean floors and scan shelves. This brings the focus back to working conditions at Walmart stores. It has also drawn the ire of labor advocates who believe this will destroy jobs.Furthermore, Walmart store expansion has slowed to almost a standstill. The company operates 11,766 stores worldwide, up from only 11,718 locations in 2018. This low growth level may make sense in the saturated U.S. market. However, it also speaks to the failure to export its retail strategy outside of North America.Holders of Walmart stock had held out hope for offshore successes in ecommerce. Walmart purchased Indian ecommerce company Flipkart last summer in hopes of a success overseas. However, changing government policies may have effectively dismantled that business. As a result, many have floated rumors of a market exit. The Bottom Line on Walmart stockThe Kidbox alliance could give a short-term boost to Walmart stock, but most of the company's long-time problems remain. Partnering with Kidbox stands as the latest step WMT has made in improving product quality. Moreover, its online venture and move into online ads show that Walmart can compete with Amazon.However, below the surface the Walmart known for labor issues and failure outside of North America intact. Store growth has come to a standstill, and the Flipkart venture appears headed for failure.Despite the optimism surrounding Kidbox, Walmart will probably see little long-term growth until it can succeed internationally.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

While analysts are divided as to whether many global economies including the U.S. could be headed toward a recession in the near future, investors could benefit from thinking about how to recession-proof their portfolios.Are we almost at the tail end of nearly a decade of economic growth? Although there have been a few short-lived downturns over the past 10 years, most economies have enjoyed stable growth since the recession of 2008-09.However, in March as well as earlier in December 2018, fears of a U.S. recession that could also spread to other countries hit the headlines as analysts highlighted the inverted yield curve in the U.S. This signal occurs when U.S. short-term treasury notes yield more than longer-term instruments. Many analysts warn that an inverted yield curve may be a sign of an upcoming recession.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt We will not know when the next recession has exactly started until we are in it, but generally, the economy and investors' sentiment can change rather quickly. What looks like a bull market today can become a bear market the next month.Therefore, if you are of the opinion that an economic slump may be almost upon us, you may want to reconsider your portfolio diversification strategies. Certain industries and stocks tend to do better in times of slower economic growth. Costco's Business Model Makes It a Resilient StockA defensive company usually has a constant demand for its products or services and isn't typically correlated to the rest of the business cycle. Costco operates in the warehouse club (or wholesale club) space within the retail industry. Due to the low-cost and high-value products offered by warehouse clubs, this sector usually performs well regardless of macroeconomic conditions. In this segment, Costco's main competitor is Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and both companies are thriving in this competitive environment.Costco runs on a &quot;subscription business model,&quot; whereby customers pay an annual membership fee to have access to its bargain-priced bulk goods.Costco offers three types of membership: Executive, Business and Gold Star. In total, Costco collects over $3.1 billion in membership fee revenue, which is almost entirely profit. The membership service has a renewal rate of 90% as the group scores high on customer satisfaction surveys.By using a membership-only system, Costco is able to book nearly all of its profits one year in advance. In other words, the annual membership model contributes to its operating income and gives Costco stock immense earnings stability. Costco sells merchandise at bargain prices, across six main categories:  * Foods (such as dry, packaged and groceries)  * Sundries (such as snacks, beverages and cleaning supplies)  * Hardlines (such as appliances, electronics and health products)  * Fresh Foods (such as meat, produce, deli and bakery)  * Softlines (such as apparel and small appliances)  * Ancillary (such as gas stations and pharmacy)These ancillary businesses provide a range of products and services that aim to encourage members to visit Costco stores more frequently. Coupled with strong customer loyalty, the retail giant has pricing power, too.In other words, the membership structure has become a source of much of Costco's competitive advantage. Price-sensitive members are visiting the store regularly. No matter how the economic climate changes over the years, the retailer is likely to put up steady growth. COST Stock Has Robust FundamentalsIn 2018, Costco's comparable sales adjusted for fuel prices and currency rose 7% and total sales reached $138.4 billion. On March 7, the retail giant announced revenues of $35.4 billion, thanks to the growth in membership fees. For fiscal Q2, Costco reported earnings per share of $2.01, 31 cents ahead of expectations. In 2019, analysts now expect the warehouse chain to earn $7.92 per share, up 11.7% from last year, buoyed by new store openings and strong same-store sales growth. Wall Street is also applauding its low-cost structure, one of the lowest in the retail industry.Furthermore, the company has a burgeoning e-commerce operation. E-commerce comparable sales (comps) jumped almost 26% year-over-year (YoY). Its online and same-day delivery show strong growth and is likely to add to Costco's bottom line for years to come.In short, investors have been approving of the steps, including customer and employee satisfaction, favorable job scene and opening of new warehouses globally, that Costco's management has been taking over the years -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet in the rest of the decade.Asia, including Japan, Korea and Taiwan, is a key market for Costco. The company sees increasing membership signups on the opening day of Asian stores. It is also about to open up its first store in China. The opening of new warehouses in Asia could accelerate the company's current growth rate. What Could Derail Costco Stock?Year-to-date, COST stock is up 21%. So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking in the stock. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Costco's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot; In the next few weeks, COST stock could trade sideways for several weeks, and even have a pullback toward the low-$230's or even mid-$220's level, where the stock is likely to find major support. However, if the stock price were to go below $225, there could be further profit taking and the stock could go down to low $200's.COST stock's beta is 0.96, which means its volatility on average mimics that of the broader market. Therefore if the industry or the broader market declines as other companies, especially competitors, release earnings, the Costco stock price may also be adversely affected. In other words, investors should watch for market corrections.  * 7 Small-Cap Growth ETFs For Adventurous Investors If you already own Costco stock, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to-date. The Bottom Line on COST StockQ2 may bring further volatility to the stock market, and I would not advocate bottom picking; however, I'd regard any price dip in COST stock as a buying opportunity for long-term shareholders. Due to its membership-only system, Costco is a unique warehouse stock with attractive high margins and downside earnings risk. I believe Costco will continue its long track record of strong performance and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $275. Finally, investors who buy into the COST stock price can enjoy a dividend yield of 0.93%.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-24,"Shares of big-box retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) have been on a tear over the past few months. Since bottoming out on Christmas Eve 2018, Costco stock has rallied nearly 30% to fresh all-time highs.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)There have been a few catalysts for the rally of COST stock. Most importantly, macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. have improved, global financial markets have stabilized, and Costco's numbers have remained strong in 2019, even though many expected COST to do poorly this year. Oil prices have also moved materially higher this year, providing a nice tailwind to Costco's gas business.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Give Back 2019 Gains Overall, Costco has simply stayed the course in 2019, and that's a good thing, considering many expected macroeconomic weakness to take this company off its winning course. That hasn't happened, so Costco stock has stayed in rally mode.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the current rally of Costco stock seems slightly overdone. While the economy isn't on the verge of collapse, it is slowing, and it does appear like it's only a matter of time before things do get ugly. The U.S. may be just one to three years away from a recession. Heading into this slowdown, Costco stock is trading at an above-average valuation with a below-average dividend yield. That doesn't make sense. It especially doesn't make sense, considering Costco's growth rates have slowed as the economy has slowed over the past few months.In other words, Costco stock is currently priced for perfection, and perfection isn't going to happen. Instead, there will be some bumps in the road over the next few months, and those bumps will cause material weakness in COST stock, given its perfect valuation. Costco's Growth Is SlowingTo be clear, Costco is a great company with a genius business model, and the company is essentially the offline version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This &quot;offline Amazon&quot; business model has long-term staying power, and over the next five to ten years, Costco's sales, margins, and profits will rise. That will ultimately cause Costco stock to rise.But COST stock will experience some turbulence in the near-term.Right now, Costco's growth is slowing. In late 2018, this company was rattling off 8%-plus comparable-sales growth months in the U.S., and 7%-plus comparable-sales growth months across the globe. From December 2018 to February 2019, Costco's growth trajectory slowed meaningfully. U.S comparable sales growth slowed to just over 7%, while global comps fell below 7%.Things got even uglier in March. U.S. comps ex fuel rose just 5.5%, while they rose just 5.9% globally. Moreover, COST's March 2019 numbers got a 1%-plus boost from a shift in the Easter holiday in 2019. Excluding that one-time boost, U.S. comparable sales growth ex-fuel in March was 4.5%, at best. That was down from over 10% in November 2018.Not surprisingly, Costco's slowdown has coincided with a broader economic slowdown in the U.S. On a positive note, most analysts and investors expect this slowdown to end soon, and they predict that the economy will improve over the next few months, thanks to low rates and a potential resolution of the trade war between the U.S. and China.Nonetheless, U.S. economic growth is still weaker than it was a year ago, and that's showing up in Costco's numbers. Consequently, Costco's numbers over the next few quarters likely won't be as good as they have been over the past few quarters, and that's bad news for Costco stock. Valuation Is HighDespite the company's slowing growth, the valuation of Costco stock suggests that the company's growth is accelerating.The forward earnings multiple of Costco stock is 29. Over the last five years, the average forward multiple of Costco stock has been between 26 and 27. Thus, COST stock currently trades at a premium to its historical average valuation. Further, Costco stock currently has a dividend yield of under 1%, versus a historical average yield north of 1%, so the stock currently features a below-average yield, too.Yet, the economy is slowing, and Costco's comparable-sales growth trajectory is flattening. That doesn't make sense. Usually, above-average valuations are given to stocks with accelerating growth trajectories and below-average valuations are given to stocks with flattening growth trajectories. But,Costco stock has an above-average valuation, even though its growth outlook is flattening.That isn't an attractive combination. Ultimately, it's a recipe for a pullback unless the company's growth improves dramatically. I don't think the latter scenario will materialize anytime soon. Thus, a pullback of Costco stock over the next few months looks likely. The Bottom Line on COST StockCostco stock is a long-term winner, but its current valuation implies that the near-term outlook of the stock is unfavorable.As long as slowing growth trends persist, the valuation of COST stock is not supported by the company's fundamentals.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN.

2019-05-01,"Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will not sell its United Kingdom-based Asda supermarket chain to Sainsbury's. Regulators in the U.K. blocked the proposed merger on antitrust concerns. Walmart stock fell by almost 2% in Friday trading following the failed union.Source:  Mike Mozart via FlickrWalmart could easily find other options. However, this speaks to a bigger problem the company must address: its strategy abroad.Since opening stores outside of North America, the company abandoned markets as it faced regulatory setbacks, cultural clashes, and unexpected competition. Now that it remains the owner of Asda, the company can begin again to try to find an effective strategy for competing abroad.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares  Walmart and AmazonContrary to popular belief, Walmart's biggest competitive threat does not come from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Over the last few years, Walmart stock has swooned over the threat of Amazon. However, it has also made a significant comeback on the company's successes as an omnichannel retailer.Nor do its issues lie with the sale of Asda itself. Yes, the failed merger presents a temporary setback. However, Walmart could still spin off the company by launching an IPO. It could also sell Asda to a private equity firm. Walmart International WoesHowever, the issues with Asda point to the most significant long-term challenge Walmart stock faces--Walmart itself. Specifically, the problem lies with Walmart International. The company has consistently failed to compete outside of North America.When Walmart first opened stores in the U.S., it found success in both Canada and Mexico. However, attempts to sell outside of these markets have led to numerous failures.In 2006, Walmart exited Germany as its regimented culture did not fit well in that country. Last year, the company sold an 80% stake in Walmart Brazil amid operational failures.Also, Walmart became one of the first American companies to enter the Chinese market. Despite the first-mover advantage, it only operates about 400 stores, a relatively small number for a country with 1.42 billion people.Lately, the news has focused on store closures and strategic pivots rather than expansion.In fairness, WMT has surpassed Target (NYSE:TGT) in this area. Higher prices and an aggressive move to expand led Target Canada to shut down just two years after opening its first store. However, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon have not encountered the same cultural issues in their moves abroad.This bodes poorly for Walmart's future as it has largely saturated the U.S. market. Although successes with online sales garner headlines, overall company growth remains in the single-digits. In the long run, it has nowhere to grow without succeeding abroad. Final Thoughts on Walmart StockThe failed attempt to sell Asda to Sainsbury's highlights Walmart's failure to export its retail model abroad. Antitrust authorities have determined that Asda and Sainsbury's must remain separate. This changes the game for Walmart. They must now find a new buyer or try again to succeed with Asda.This failure speaks to the biggest threat to Walmart stock, the lack of success at Walmart International. Headlines of the company's online success will boost WMT stock for a time. However, longer term, the saturated U.S. market will force them to again look abroad for growth.For this reason, I think Walmart needs to treat the canceled merger as an opportunity to try again to succeed with Asda. Their peers have shown that companies can overcome such differences.Now Walmart must find a way forward. Unless they can solve this problem, Walmart stock could become a stagnant equity supporting a single-digit multiple. The choice is theirs.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-05-10,"Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) have been on fire, climbing more than 31.5% from its December lows to its recent highs. However, Costco stock is starting to come down amid the recent stock-market pullback. As a result,  interested investors have a chance to load back up on COST stock. The question is: should they buy Costco stock and at what price should they do so?Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)I love Costco stock because COST is a high-quality company with a strong business model and an excellent source of recurring high-margin cash flow - its membership fees. Those fees help the company offer an experience to its customers that not many of its competitors can rival. All of that, in turn, makes Costco stock a great long-term investment,  but not any price.For all of the positives surrounding COST stock, it's not a cheap stock by any means. I love Costco. I've been a member since I was stocking shelves at a Costco store at 4 a.m. as a teenager. And I love the company's  management team and culture. But that won't cloud my judgement when it comes to investing in Costco stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Valuing Costco StockCostco's  sales are expected to rise  7.6% this year and another 7% in 2020. On the earnings front, analysts, on average, estimate that Costco will grow its bottom line by 12.3% to $7.96 per share in 2019. In 2020, the consensus estimate calls for 7% growth to $8.51 per share.Based on this year's expectations, COST stock trades at just over 30 times this year's average earnings estimate. That's a higher valuation than high-quality growth companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). But here's the thing that all three companies have in common: They're all blue-chip name.Blue-chip companies should be given higher valuations than other stocks with similar financials. Moreover, sometimes companies should be given premiums because of their outstanding strengths.  For Costco, those include things I've already mentioned, like its incredible cash-flow generation and its strong management. Its superior customer experience makes its business more valuable, as does its long track record of impressive results.For instance, just a few weeks ago management authorized a $4 billion buyback of Costco stock. That's almost 4% of the company's market cap at the current Costco stock price. Management also bumped the dividend by 14%, although Costco stock still only yields a little over 1%.As with any great company, we have to pay a premium to own its stock. But that doesn't mean we have to pay top dollar. Often, the best time to buy blue-chip companies that trade at premiums is on big pullbacks. Not only because we're getting a great price, but because they tend to rebound more quickly, too.Let's look at the charts. Trading Costco StockWe can see that Costco stock price is about $10 per share off its highs near $250. It's trading right near  its 10-week moving average. Aggressive bulls may consider this enough of a dip to buy. Some may prefer waiting for a further correction down to the $230-$235 level, which was a solid level of resistance in the second half of 2018.However, I have my eye on slightly deeper corrections. A decline to the $220 to $223 level would be attractive. That would put Costco stock price stock 10%-12% below its highs and land it near a few notable levels. Around $223 is the 50-week moving average, while $220 was previously resistance and then  turned support.I don't know if such a drop will occur, but a drop down to the 200-week would be the best spot to buy Costco stock.Why may such a drop not materialize? At current prices, it would require a 20% decline from the stock's highs, to $200.  If that happens, it will only likely occur if either Costco stock slowly stumbles lower after bouncing at several support levels first or the market goes into irrational selloff mode.The 200-week has been a great place to buy  Costco stock over the last four years. Given the uptrend of Costco stock price, I suspect this will remain the case going forward, too. So that's my perfect buy spot, whether it's in a few weeks or six months from now.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-13,"British Columbia-based Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) announced plans May 8 to increase the production and manufacturing footprint at three of its Canadian facilities. The additional 203,000 square feet increases its total footprint by nearly 20% to 1.3 million.Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat should have done wonders to Tilray stock did absolutely nothing for the cannabis stock, as it lost 2.5% on May 8. As I write this mid-afternoon on May 13, it's down more than 9.1%. Of course, it didn't help that it announced at the same time the U.S.-China trade war was heating up. Tilray delivers its quarterly earnings tomorrow (May 14). While there won't be any effect in the near-term from its additional production space, the long-term benefits could be significant. Here's why.  Bigger Might Be BetterAdding 20% production space to a manufacturing company's footprint is generally a big deal. The more square footage that is devoted to producing products, the greater potential there is for higher revenues. If profitable, more money flows to the bottom line, delivering a return on its capital.   * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites In the cannabis business, it's not quite as simple. Because so few cannabis companies are profitable, any addition to top-line revenue doesn't immediately result in a return on capital. In the near term, the increase in square footage at Tilray plants in Leamington and London, Ontario, as well as Nanaimo, B.C., will be a $32.6 million drain on its capital with a negligible return on investment. It's not the same as Tilray's acquisition of Manitoba Harvest in February for $316 million, a deal that will see the company selling its hemp-based food products in more than 13,000 points of sale in the U.S. including Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and most of the other big food retailers. &quot;Retailers are seeing hemp mania, it's one of the fastest-growing products right now,&quot; said Bill Chiasson, chief executive officer of the Winnipeg-based company. &quot;All of them are looking at bringing on products that contain CBD into their portfolio and every one of them has come to us and said they see us as a natural partner.&quot;In 2018, Manitoba Harvest had annual sales of C$94 million. Let's assume that 5% of those sales flow to the bottom line. Tilray paid C$277.5 million in cash and stock up front, another C$92.5 million at the end of August and potentially another C$49 million in Tilray shares at the end of 2019 should Manitoba Harvest hit specified financial targets. Tilray's return on capital for the Manitoba Harvest acquisition started on day one after the deal closed and will continue to reap dividends as it makes further inroads into the North American retail market.Furthermore, it helps beautify Tilray's income statement.  Long-Term Plans Good for Tilray StockIn 2018, Tilray had sales of $43.1 million and a net loss of $67.8 million. By adding Manitoba Harvest, it increases the company's top-line revenue by 162% while reducing the net loss slightly. More importantly, it helps diversify the company's revenue streamsIn January, before the Manitoba Harvest deal, I said CEO Brendan Kennedy's acquisitions had done little to move Tilray stock. That hasn't changed. TLRY is down 34.7% year to date through May 8. I've said on several occasions in 2019 that my three favorite cannabis stocks are Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), and Hexo (NYSEAmerican:HEXO). I've yet to add Tilray to the list, but announcements like the one it just made show that Kennedy is sticking to a game plan that includes medicinal and recreational pot, hemp and hemp-based foods -- and anything else that can provide a strong foundation on which to grow internationally.  * Tilray Stock Is Heading Higher With a $70 Price Target It's not flashy, but the long-term results could be worth the wait. Just don't expect a bump from the 203,000 additional square feet until sometime in late 2019 or early 2020. We'll know more on May 14.

2019-05-15,"If regular dividends are the bread and butter of income investors, then special dividends are the icing on the cake, making the investment that much sweeter. These &quot;one-time&quot; payouts are used for several reasons ... and occasionally, they are paid out more than just one time.Companies sometimes pay special dividends to share windfall profits, either from exceptional earnings or a gain on an asset sale, with investors. However, other stocks will use special dividends consistently as a way of supplementing a modest regular dividend with income based on their operational results. These distributions can swell in boom times and recede during tighter years.Special dividends frequently fly under investors' radar because financial databases don't track them well. They're not included in calculating dividend yield, because they're not regular programs. But these payouts are cash all the same and can add significantly to shareholder wealth - in some cases they increase the annual yield several times over.Here are 14 stocks with special dividends to watch. Not all of them are buys at the moment. But given past precedent and current financial standing, the potential for more special dividends is in the cards, making them all stocks to put on your radar. In many cases, these stocks pay regular distributions as well. SEE ALSO: 33 Ways to Get Higher Yields (Up to 12%!)",14 Stocks With Special Dividends to Watch

2019-05-16,"Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reported earnings last night and so far WMT stock is holding a rally on the headline.Source: Shutterstock WMT beat earnings even though they were lower than last year's this time. Revenues were higher than last year's but the company missed its forecast. Management cited currency headways that may have interfered with this report card. WMT had some good news on comparable sales, especially in the U.S. which beat estimates.In summary, Walmart delivered more good news than bad so the bulls have the upper hand … for now. So that brings us to the big question: is Walmart stock a buy here?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe answer, for the most part, is yes. I would suggest holding onto your longs, but don't chase it unless the investment time frame is long term. This is not a knock against the company's prospects as I am a fan of it. But it's a concern with the price action at these levels.So let me justify my answer: The stock market is still suffering from a massive trade war between the U.S. and China so they do have a host headwinds. This is a big unknown. WMT will probably pass the costs along to the consumers, but since margins are already thin there they will probably need to negotiate better sourcing terms if possible.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Tank Your Portfolio So it is not the time to get aggressive chasing Walmart stock up 3%.Walmart's management team is a proven winner. They are making many correct moves to adapt to the changing retail environment. They are pursuing e-commerce aggressively; for example, they just announced next-day shipping and beat Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to the punch. Their advertising segment is also growing. These are hot topics for AMZN and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to name two.Some of these changes until they mature will be a drag on profitability. This includes e-commerce as it becomes a larger portion of the total business. It's not cheap to enter and grow a business that is so competitive already.I am not bearish on the stock. In fact, if you own it, I would suggest keeping it. It's a good defensive position in a jittery stock market. But its valuation is close to full as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 42X. This is 25% more expensive than Costco (NASDAQ:COST). I don't see the panic to build a new big position now.Short-term traders could try and scalp momentum moves. Above $104, it could catch a second leg higher as it would invite momentum buyers. But for that purpose there are better vehicles.This morning, management delivered a report that confirms that they are executing well on their plan. But there are still risks that loom. This week Macy's (NYSE:M) sold off hard on its earnings results. I believe that most brick-and-mortar retailers are still struggling to survive the AMZN effect. Some of them will not make it, but Walmart will is not one to struggle. WMT will thrive in spite of Amazon. Bottom Line on WMT StockWalmart has become more aggressive in its fight against AMZN. Just this week it announced free overnight delivery for orders? AMZN had announced a similar benefit, but WMT beat them to the market. Clearly, they know that it's a fight that they need to win.Not many retailers can do this to AMZN. WMT built its empire by growing with very thin margins. It has been the low price leader for decades. So when Amazon came to the scene, WMT was best ready for the fight. The only other major retailer with a similar advantage is Costco. So it's no coincidence that these three stocks are thriving.  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week So the bottom line is that the fundamental opportunity for Walmart has never been better. They have the new technology to streamline their business even further and the money to make it happen. So, long term it's a stock to own as it will be higher … I just don't see the reason to chase it until it breaks out from $104.These are turbulent times for as long as the U.S. and China are in a full-blown economic war and they are fighting it in the social sphere. Stocks will whipsaw by tweets and state media blurbs. This is likely to linger for at least late June when the two presidents can meet during the G20 meetings.But the resolution is most likely not possible for months to come. So I should be cautious when taking on new bullish positions. I should start with partials so I'd have room to add in case gthe price goes against the thesis.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-17,"As should be no surprise, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has logged a nice gain for the year, up about 20%. Part of this has been due to the strength of the consumer as well as the overall bullishness of the markets. But then again, Costco stock tends to do well regardless of the environment.Source: Shutterstock The fact is that the company is highly disciplined and focused. For the past decade, the average annual return on Costco is an impressive 19.51%. To put this into perspective, the gain for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is about 15.59% during the same period!Now it's true that the valuation of Costco stock is pricey, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at a steep 28.5X. Yes, for a retailer, this is really a stretch. However, Costco is no ordinary retailer. The company has several major competitive advantages that should help keep up the performance. If anything, Costco stock is likely to remain fairly resilient if the recent market volatility continues.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal So then, what are the key drivers for the company? Well, let's take a look at three: Costco Stock: Business ModelThe business model for Costco is very simple - but quite powerful. By requiring an annual fee, the company is able to essentially guarantee its profits. This is why Costco is often called the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime for the brick-and-mortar world.With recurring revenues as a cushion, the company can then focus its efforts on finding ways to provide low prices and quality merchandise for customers. The result is that Costco has built significant loyalty. For example, the renewal rate in the U.S. is an impressive 90%. In fact, the total number of cardholders is 96.3 million.For the most part, the Costco business model would prove extremely difficult to disrupt. Consider that there are 772 warehouses and an extensive supply chain for thousands of products. Costco has also been able to provide many benefits for its members, such as with cruises, hotels and even car purchases. Costco Stock: GrowthEven with its massive scale (it's the No. 2 retailer in the US) Costco is still able to gin up growth. During the latest quarter, total revenues increased by 7.2% and the comparable sales were 6.7%.Furthermore, the company continues to generate substantial cash flows (they were about $2.7 billion for the past year). This allows Costco to have a strong buyback program - which is at $4 billion - and to periodically pay special dividends.The company has also been investing heavily in its ecommerce platform and same-day delivery system. In the quarter, the sales from this unit jumped by 25.5% (the company does not disclose the totals).There have also been other investments in technology. For example, Costco has introduced self-checkout registers and kiosks. There is even a plan to develop a key fob to pay for gas with a single swipe. Costco Stock: Private-Label StrategyThe Kirkland Signature brand is Costco's private-label products. They generally have lower prices as well as higher margins.The Kirkland Signature has certainly become a big part of the business. Last year, the revenues from this segment came to $39 billion, up from $35 billion in 2017.Keep in mind that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) considers that the Kirkland Signature business is the most important competitive advantage for Costco.In a CNBC interview, he noted that the packaged-goods products are taking share away from major operators like Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC).  In other words, The Kirkland Signature brand is probably only in the early phases of the market opportunity.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-05-22,"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is back where it was in more ways than one. The Costco stock price has reached new all-time highs of late, eclipsing levels reached last September. And once again, COST stock, as impressive as it has been, looks like it might be getting too expensive.Source: Shutterstock It's a replay of where COST sat last September. As I wrote at the time, just a few sessions after those all-time highs, analysts had turned cautious on Costco stock. The earnings multiples driving the Costco price were at decade-long peaks just two weeks ahead of earnings.Those earnings would be solid, but COST stock sold off anyway. By mid-December, amid a market rout, it had lost a quarter of its value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt seems unlikely that history will repeat to that extent, barring another market-wide sell-off. But COST does seem to be in a precarious position with earnings on the way next week. The reaction to the report seems likely to focus on one key metric, and the Costco stock price already is assuming quite a bit of success.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential  Here We Go AgainThere's little question that Costco's business is one of the best in all of American industry. It's one of the few companies seemingly immune to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), as I wrote last year. Sales growth continues to be impressive: Costco already has reported comparable sales, which included 5.4% growth in April and 6.6% through 35 weeks YTD.The question comes down to valuation. Certainly, investors so far have been rewarded for paying up for COST stock, which has tripled over the past seven years or so. But even by past standards, Costco stock is expensive, trading at 29x next year's EPS. Even historically bullish analysts haven't been able to keep up: the average target price of $250 is just a dollar above Monday's close.Again, this is pretty much exactly where COST stock sat eight months ago. And it didn't turn out well. Will this time be different? Margins and COST StockWhat will determine the answer to that question likely will be one metric: margins. Again, Costco already has disclosed same-store sales growth, so there will be little in the way of surprises on the top line. As such, it's the earnings number on which investors will focus.And margins have been a bit volatile of late. Costco beat EPS expectations by a whopping 31 cents with its Q2 report, which led COST stock higher the next day and for several weeks after. But the stock tumbled after a modest Q1 miss with analysts focusing intently on margins on the post-earnings conference call.In the current environment, that focus may only heighten. Rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is raising prices because of tariffs. Will Costco have to do the same? Will it be able to do the same? Or does its hyper-efficient model mean that tariff troubles at Walmart, pricing pressure at Kroger (NYSE:KR), and spending concerns at Target (NYSE:TGT) all will work to the company's advantage? Watching Costco Stock After EarningsTo be sure, it's exceedingly unlikely that the report is going to lead to a major move in Costco. Options markets at the moment price in just a 4% move between now and next Friday. Again, this is a wonderful business, and the argument will come down to valuation.But in this market, at least from a short-term standpoint, Costco does look a bit dicey. There's going to be some disruption to the company from tariffs. Walmart posted a blowout quarter and yet trades modestly below pre-earnings levels. And at nearly 30x next year's earnings, valuation may be at or near a ceiling.Longer-term, admittedly, investors still can't go wrong with Costco stock. But for even the best stocks, valuation matters. COST itself proved that back in September. And while history may not repeat, investors should remember that even a very strong quarter looks priced in.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-23,"Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is still the world's largest retailer, by a wide margin, but it wants investors to see it as finally beating Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Walmart stock earnings were last week, and while the numbers were good, the narrative was definitely constructed so that WMT investors came away with the impression management wanted.Source: Shutterstock Walmart reported net income of $3.8 billion, $1.33 per fully diluted share, on revenue of $123 billion for the quarter ending in April. But the number it wanted investors to see was 37%. That's how much its &quot;eCommerce&quot; efforts were ahead of last year.Instead of looking at the 11 cent per share beat on earnings investors might want to look instead at 3.4%. That's how much same store sales rose over the previous year. Bears might look at 1.1%. That's how much Walmart's total sales grew, as international sales declined and those at Sam's Club barely moved. Revenue was short of analyst estimates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend The point Walmart wants to make is that its effort to overtake Amazon is succeeding.But is it? Define eCommerceWhen you drive to Walmart and a clerk brings your online order to the car, Walmart counts that as eCommerce.  Fewer than half its stores today are doing grocery delivery.What Walmart is trying to do is generate headlines like this, claiming it's beating Amazon. Amazon stock is three times more valuable than  Walmart stock despite having half Walmart's sales.The fact is Walmart is moving its own sales from in stores to electronic orders. It is not grabbing market share from Amazon. Walmart is grabbing market share from Walmart. You can't have a 37% increase in eCommerce and only 3.4% comps unless most of your eCommerce sales were your own sales to begin with.While Walmart focuses on Amazon, it's still getting killed by Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), which keeps grabbing share from Sam's Club. Walmart is also losing urban market share to Aldi, the no-frills German chain that rents shopping carts, has wafer-thin margins and only stocks store brands. Still Not AmazonCEO Doug McMillon is painting Walmart's image as a family-friendly Amazon alternative, with a new headquarters campus, Fire-like tablets, growing ad sales and innovative supply deals.But Walmart remains a chain of big box retail stores. In many areas it's the replacement for downtown, and that means downtown problems, like using up public resources. Walmart also employs 1.5 million Americans, who continue to agitate publicly for better treatment.That decline in international business, by the way, includes India, where Walmart put $16 billion into Indian e-tailer Flipkart and has yet to see a return.While over half of Amazon's online sales are on behalf of third parties, meaning it takes no inventory risk, Walmart is still buying its merchandise directly, making it far more vulnerable to rising prices from China tariffs than Amazon is. The Bottom Line for Walmart StockWalmart stock has been fighting to hold $100 per share since April and had a market cap of $290 billion as of this writing. While WMT shares are up 8.7% so far in 2019, shares of Amazon are up 23.5%.When Walmart raises prices, as it will need to due to the trade war, its revenues will increase because Walmart shoppers will be paying tariffs. But that doesn't mean Walmart earnings will increase.The most important takeaway is that Walmart is not Amazon. Half its sales are from groceries. The rivals it should be focused on are Aldi, Costco and Kroger (NYSE:KR), whose stock was recently upgraded.Since becoming CEO in February 2014, Doug McMillon has delivered a 35% gain in the stock while increasing the dividend just 4 cents per share. That's behind the 53% average gain in the S&P 500.  * The 7 Best Stocks to Buy From the IPO ETF Yes, Walmart is moving its sales online, but that doesn't mean it's taking down Amazon.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-24,"Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock continues its march higher. With stockholders having recovered all of their losses from last fall's sell-off, many might wonder where Costco stock goes from here. Amid the company's successes, valuations remain higher than that of most peers.Source: Shutterstock Moreover, with the stock price returning to the highs of last September, investors may want some assurance that COST stock will not see a double top. However, given the company's past growth and prospects for future expansion, I see COST stock as a buy on any pullback. Costco Stock Is Expensive, but Worth ItThose wanting Costco bargains should look inside their warehouse instead of at Costco stock. COST currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 29.4. Although one can argue that that comes in lower than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Amazon derives most of its profit outside of retail. Either way, Costco trades at a valuation premium above that of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), and its peer on the eastern seaboard, BJ's Wholesale (NYSE:BJ).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 12 Reasons Facebook Stock Will Likely Sink 25%-35% Over the last five years, Costco's PE has averaged around 29.4. Hence, Costco stock has not moved far ahead of its average. Moreover, it benefits from a high degree of customer loyalty. This shows in a renewal rate of around 90% and its profit growth. Yes, customers pay a membership fee that amounts to pure profit for Costco. But in exchange, they pay little more than the cost of goods sold plus overhead for items. That may help explain why analysts have forecasted that earnings will increase 12.3% this year and 6.9% in fiscal 2020. Costco Can Keep Expanding for DecadesI also like the prospects for expansion. Yes, they currently operate in 44 states, and they cover most of America's large metros. However, tremendous potential exists in somewhat smaller markets. For example, in Texas, Costco operates only three warehouses located outside of the San Antonio, Austin, Houston, and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas. Moreover, the company only operates two warehouses in Georgia outside of metro Atlanta. Hence, domestic saturation remains years away.Moreover, Costco has succeeded with international expansions. It has avoided the high-profile failures such as Target Canada or the pullouts like Walmart experienced in Germany and Brazil. In addition to Canada and Mexico, the company continues to add warehouses in Europe, East Asia and Australia. When to Buy Costco StockThe question for investors revolves around when to buy?  Those holding out for a forward PE like the current 11.5 on Target will likely end up disappointed. However, Costco stock goes on sale periodically. During last fall's stock sell-off, COST fell as much as 22% before it began to recover. COST also saw corrections during the middle of the decade, as investors feared an &quot;Amazon takeover&quot; of retail. Anytime Costco has offered a 10-20% discount from its 29 forward PE, investors have profited by buying. I do not expect that to change soon. The Bottom Line on Costco StockInvestors should consider Costco stock a buy on any significant pullback. At just under 30 times forward earnings, some buyers may balk at paying such a multiple for a retailer. Moreover, with the stock trading at levels from which it previously fell, some might want to buy COST stock at this level.However, Costco stock has traded at PE in the high 20s or low 30s for several years. Moreover, for most of that time, profits have maintained a double-digit growth rate on average. Further, outside of North America, Costco has succeeded where Walmart and Target have failed. This ensures that the company can continue to add new warehouses for decades.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend The stock trades marginally above its average historical multiples. For this reason, I see it as a buy only for long-term investors. However, industry or macroeconomic conditions often lead to corrections in COST. If Costco stock falls to a PE ratio in the mid-20s or lower, investors should buy in bulk.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-28,"I come across good stocks to buy in all sorts of places. Recently, I read about the Wisconsin Retirement System, the eighth largest public pension fund in the U.S. and the 25th largest public or private pension fund in the world. &quot;Wisconsin by the numbers is among the five best funded systems in the country, but what sets it apart even further is just how thoughtful the state has been on paying what has come due, and in laying out policies that plan for the future,&quot; said Greg Mennis, who is the director of public sector retirement systems project at the Pew Charitable Trusts. &quot;In that regard, it's as good as it gets for a state-run public pension system.&quot;So, who would you want to look to for investment ideas? One of the best pension funds in the world or from one that's not able to meet its obligations?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement Using careful planning and a commitment to meeting its obligations, Wisconsin's been able to create the prototypical pension fund. Here are seven stocks to buy that represent its top holdings. Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)Source: Shutterstock The two things you'll notice about all of the names on this list is that they've been chosen alphabetically and by the size of the holding. In the case of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) owns $907 million of the company's stock with $484 million in the Class C shares and $423 million in Class A. This represents about 2.6% of the $35.2 billion in equity investments held by SWIB. That might not seem like a big bet on the parent of Google, but considering SWIB owns 1,537 securities, 2.6% is plenty. In fact, behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at $1.1 billion, Alphabet is the fund's second-largest holding.It's not that I'm not recommending MSFT, but if you want to know more about why I like Alphabet, read this. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B)Source: Shutterstock Holding close to $300 million in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), I haven't calculated where Warren Buffett's company stands in SWIB's $35-billion portfolio. I'd guess it's in the latter half of the pension fund's top 10 holdings. If not, it's easily in the top 25.It would be interesting to see how closely SWIB's holdings track the major indexes. But that's a story for another day. Berkshire Hathaway continues to attract detractors despite its long-term track record. Canada's Globe and Mail recently ran a story about Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields, who has covered Berkshire for 10 years and has never considered it a buy. &quot;By analyzing the company's reported month-end holdings over the past 20 years, Mr. Shields generated an approximate performance history for Berkshire's equity portfolio, which holds more than US$200-billion in stocks,&quot; The Globe's Tim Shufelt wrote May 20. &quot;In the 10 years up to the end of 2009, Mr. Buffett's portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 index by a remarkable 119 per cent. Since then, however, the S&P 500 has come out slightly on top.&quot;  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer What the analyst fails to mention is that Berkshire's equity portfolio generates more than $3.8 billion in dividends annually, money that can be used to buy back its stock. In 2018, Berkshire bought back $1.3 billion of its stock. Buffett would have to spend three times that amount to meet its cash flow from its equity portfolio. From where I sit, that's a desirable proposition if you're a BRK shareholder.   Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock I live in Canada, where Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is even more popular than in the U.S. One of the reasons this is the case is Costco doesn't have a competitor here like Sam's Club to take market share. Add to this the reality that our standard of living is slightly lower than in the U.S. and Costco can't help but attract price-sensitive Canadians to the deals it provides. I should know. When my wife and I moved out to Halifax from Toronto in February 2018, we got new home and auto insurance through Costco. Even with a 10% increase for 2019, it's still a lot cheaper than what we were paying in Toronto. SWIB only holds $117 million of Costco stock, but that likely has less to do with not liking the discount retailer and more to do with an overall negative sentiment surrounding the retail industry.Where does Costco turn for growth? E-commerce, naturally. In February, Costco emerged as the favorite e-commerce company based on the annual American Customer Satisfaction Index. In Costco's latest quarter its e-commerce sales increased by 25.5% on an adjusted basis, proving naysayers wrong that it couldn't win in the online game. Costco's business model is simply one of the best in retail. Disney (DIS)Source: Baron Valium via FlickrDisney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger is in the middle of a transformation that will make it far more competitive in the TV marketplace than it has been in the past, adding three streaming services to the fold: ESPN+, Hulu and Disney+, the last of which will launch later in 2019. Five years ago, it didn't have any. Now it's got three. If you're a cord cutter, Disney's got to be at the top of your list. How's that?Disney+ provides the family content necessary to be successful in a country with so many young children. Hulu gives viewers edgier, broader content, and of course, ESPN+ helps sports lovers with their addiction. It's a mighty trifecta of growth that didn't exist in 2017. And then, of course, there are all the other Disney divisions generating plenty of goodwill with consumers around the globe.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend I'm not going to say much else other than Disney is one of the top three entertainment stocks in the U.S. because of its diversification into streaming. Without it, it would still be a great group of businesses. With it, it's an 800-pound gorilla.Perhaps that's why SWIB owns $228 million of its stock. Gilead Sciences (GILD)Source: Shutterstock Of the seven stocks to buy listed in this article, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is SWIB's smallest holding at $103 million. In 2018, Gilead generated $7.5 billion in free cash flow, which accounted for 34% of its overall revenue. Historically, that's not the best performance from Gilead when it comes to converting sales to free cash flow, but it's still pretty darn good.  If there's one thing I tend to look for in a business, it is strong free cash flow generation. It's a sign of healthy finances. Gilead's got it in abundance. Why the relatively little exposure? The company's facing a lot of bad PR on its Truvada HIV prevention drug. Individually, Truvada costs $6 per month to make. It sells the drug for up to $2,000 per month, which explains why the company's free cash flow is so healthy. &quot;For the same cost the American health-care system currently spends on Truvada alone, we could provide free generic drugs and clinical care to all 1.2 million Americans who need PrEP and still have half a billion dollars left over to pay for support services including transportation, counseling and housing,&quot; stated a May 21 opinion piece in The Hill. Clearly, SWIB is hedging its bet on GILD, or you could be sure the weighting would be much higher. I wouldn't invest in it, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock Depending on which media outlet you turn to, Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) Q1 2019 results were either excellent, mediocre or disappointing. Canada's Financial Post ran the headline &quot;Home Depot posts strong profit, revenue,&quot; on May 21. Yahoo Finance ran the headline &quot;Home Depot earnings beat, same-store sales misses,&quot; on May 21.Finally, Benzinga's headline read &quot;Home Depot Analyst Says Renovation Cycle May Be 'Petering Out.'&quot;Unless I'm mistaken, HD stock is SWIB's largest retail position at $273 million. Given 13-F holdings reports are historical accounts of a portfolio and not a real-time picture, almost two months have passed since investment manager filed its Q1 2019 report, so it's impossible to know if it still feels as strongly about the home improvement retailer. I guess we'll find out in early August when it files the second-quarter report. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, had this to say about Q1 2019:&quot;The consumer economy was also more unfavorable than last year, when tax cuts, good tax refunds and generally high confidence were all boosting spend. While shoppers are far from being in the doldrums, the prevailing attitude now is more cautious and careful.&quot;  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors While same-store sales grew by 2.5% in the first quarter, short of the consensus estimate of 4.2%, both the top- and bottom-line beat analyst expectations during the quarter.Come summer, look for Home Depot to deliver better same-store sales growth. As retailers go, HD stock is one of the best. iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG)SWIB, like any investment manager worth its salt, has some exposure to emerging markets.To get exposure, it's invested $244 million in the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:IEMG), an ETF that tracks the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index.   Charging 0.14% annually, SWIB's paying less than $342,000 (0.14% MER) in fees for this position. If it's good enough for a large investment manager, it ought to be perfectly acceptable to the regular investor. If you're a DIY investor, you can figure out how much you want to invest outside the U.S. for both developed and emerging markets, and then focus on U.S. companies for buying individual stocks. While it's gotten knocked around in the first five months of 2019 thanks to the U.S./China trade war, it is still up 3.6% through May 21. China, South Korea, Taiwan, and India account for 65% of the fund's $56.3 billion in total net assets. Four sectors have weightings of more than 10%: Financials (23.2%), IT (14.3%), Consumer Discretionary (13.3%), and Communication (11.2%).Add to this the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSEARCA:IEFA), which focuses on developed markets outside the U.S. and Canada, and you're good to go.      At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-30,"Although it feels bearish, so far 2019 has been bullish as the S&P 500 is still up 11% year to date. And quality stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are still thriving -- a lot of them are near their all-time highs. Today I will discuss going long Costco stock, which is a retail winner.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The sector is falling off a cliff this week behind a heap of trouble from earnings from stocks like PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), Abercombrie (NYSE:ANF) and Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS). Wednesday's retail drubbing caused even past winners like Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) to fall hard in sympathy.At the heart of the problem is the fear of the tariff war and its impact on retail businesses. Consensus now is that the U.S. and China will not come to a deal, so the 25% tariffs will linger and most likely add the rest of $320 billion to the list. So input and resourcing costs will hamper the retailers for months to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven though they've had ample warning of this impending situation, they still find themselves playing catch up. This is a bad habit in retail, since they did the same with the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). They ignore its threat for 10 years … until it hit them like a bus. Many major companies folded and still more won't likely survive. So What About Costco Stock?But today's opportunity in COST stock is that there are exceptions to the retail curse. AMZN, COST and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are three obvious winners now and for the long term. Dips are opportunities to go long.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War Tonight Costco management will report earnings, so the open tomorrow morning is completely binary. First, we don't know what they will deliver and second, we don't know how traders will react to the information. The short term reaction has little to do with the quality of the report.I am confident that management will not deliver a disaster, but this won't matter for tomorrow's price action. With how bad sentiment is around retail, it will take a small miracle to make Wall Street buy tonight's earnings headline.So how do I trade Costco through the event?If I own the shares for the long term then I don't worry about them here until the results change my thesis.If I am looking to start a new position, then I have a decision to make. I can buy half now and half after the earnings just in case they sell the event. Or wait the whole thing out at the risk of missing out on a few upside ticks. This depends largely on personal preference and risk tolerance level. So the right answer varies based on time frame.COST stock sits on solid fundamentals. It sells for 30 price to earnings ratio which is in line with WMT. It's twice as expensive as, say, Target (NYSE:TGT), but half as expensive as AMZN. So it fits perfectly with my thesis that WMT and COST are best of the rest behind AMZN.It is important to note that we are still in a middle of a market swoon, so I have to stay cautious. I don't take full positions all at once, especially not ahead of earnings reports. So caution is a virtue when price action is so binary.Luckily, this set of worries is different from what we had in December. This time the U.S. Federal reserve is our friend not a foe. They will not likely allow the yield curve to invert. So this week's macroeconomic fears are more mongering than a legitimate concern. If I am right then good stocks like COST still have upside ahead of them this year.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

How will Costco handle the trade war and constant increase in tariffs?Source: Shutterstock That said, Costco did beat earnings expectations with $1.89 per share in profits. That came in six cents ahead of estimates, while revenue of ~$34.7 billion also topped analysts' expectations. E-commerce sales flew higher by almost 20% and same-store sales jumped 5.6%, with the latter again beating estimates.Given the move we're seeing in the stock market -- with the S&P 500 down about 1% -- after President Trump tweeted about hitting Mexico with monthly tariff increases, it's surprising COST stock is only off ~1.7%. Of course, those losses could be exacerbated throughout the session, but will these tariffs impact Costco even more?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Costco vs. TariffsThe company is already being impacted by the tariffs that the White House is levying against China. Obviously, Costco is far from alone. I've listened to quite a few conference calls over the past week from retail. The trade war and/or tariffs are something we're hearing from a lot of companies.  * Ranking the Top 10 Stock Buybacks of Last Year PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) said tariffs are hurting the consumer. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) warned investors that it's &quot;working through&quot; the recent tariffs and hasn't included their impact in the guidance. Luckily, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) moved most of its supply chain away from China, helping it to sidestep much of the current tariffs. Shares were rewarded with a 7% post-earnings rally as a result.Perhaps that will be the blueprint for Costco and other retailers. Costco said it will look to source its products from other countries when it can. When it can't, price hikes are on the table.The situation is &quot;pretty fluid,&quot; CFO Richard Galanti said on the conference call. Costco is getting its products shipped sooner in the hopes of missing the latest round of tariff increases. But that's only a short-term answer, not a long-term solution. Realistically, the company can only shift its sourcing so much without causing too much of a disruption. &quot;At the end of the day, prices will go up on things,&quot; Galanti said.Of course, the move against Mexico was not accounted for by Costco management. At least when it came the recent report. One might assume Costco gets more product from China than it does from Mexico, but either way, the move is creating a multi-headed issue that management will have to combat. Shifting supply chains from Mexico may be just as hard, if not harder, and that may mean more price hikes. That may not be good for revenue. Trading Costco Stock PriceSo far, Costco stock price is holding up pretty well to earnings and amid the broader market selloff. But there's a worry that the tariffs could start hurting COST stock going forward. Earlier this month, I outlined a few &quot;pullback levels&quot; that Costco stock would look interesting at. Some investors balked, saying COST is a blue-chip retailer that deserves a premium. I love Costco and don't disagree. But that doesn't mean we can't wait (and hope) for lower prices.Ahead of earnings, the stock lost its 50-day moving average and couldn't reclaim it. Short of a Friday reversal and rally, Costco stock could very well end May at its monthly lows. If it does, it increases the odds of lower prices. Particularly if the stock market selloff accelerates.Should Costco stock close below $241.80 on Friday, it will lose its 10-week moving average. It opens up COST stock to a decline down to the 50-week moving average now at $224.50 (not shown above, but in the prior link). Keep in mind, the 200-day moving average (as shown above) comes into play near $226.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth So that's what I'm looking for: A drop down to the ~$225 level to be a good buying opportunity. I still believe a great buying opportunity is in the $200 to $205 level, where Costco stock has long-term uptrend support (again highlighted in my prior link) as well as the 100-week moving average.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-04,"By now, most investors are aware that President Donald Trump has threatened to collect a 5% tariff on Mexican exports to the U.S. starting on June 10. That increases to 25% in October if the Mexican government doesn't do a better job fighting illegal immigration. And the tariffs are a terrible idea for Dow Jones stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock.Source: Sam's ClubInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhy? It's easy -- WMT stock imports vegetables and other products from Mexico and is already getting hurt by the China tariffs in place. &quot;Produce is a key traffic driver into stores, and higher input costs could force retailers to either absorb higher costs to preserve a competitive stance or pass through prices to customers,&quot; stated Bloomberg Intelligence's senior industry analyst Jennifer Bartashus.  In mid-May, Walmart's CFO Brett Briggs stated in the company's earnings call that it does have mitigation strategies in place to help minimize the cost, but ultimately, the tariffs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.   Add Mexican tariffs to the mix, and you've got a recipe for a recession, possibly a nasty one. However, if you own Walmart stock, there's still hope that the two sides will reach a deal that addresses immigration without resorting to tariffs. Mexican officials are set to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the man behind negotiating the USMCA trade agreement between Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. How Much of an Economic Blow for Walmart Stock?According to Perryman Group, a Texas-based economic research firm, the job losses in Texas and California from Mexican tariffs could hit 117,000 and 50,000 respectively with the entire country losing as many as 400,000 jobs from Trump's border battle with Mexico.  * 6 Stocks to Buy That Are Bucking the Retail Selloff A loss of 400,000 jobs would be the equivalent of two months worth of recent job gains.The hardest hit industry would be the retail trade, which could expect to lose almost 140,000 jobs were the 5% tariff to stay in place for an entire 12-month period. In terms of gross domestic product, the 5% tariff would result in a $42 billion hit to the economy. What it doesn't say is how much of an effect a 25% tariff would have on the economy. However, it's fair to say that it would reduce GDP by at least $210 billion (five times the 5% tariff) if enforced for an entire year. &quot;Mexico has long been a top trading partner for the United States,&quot; said Perryman Group CEO Ray Perryman about the report. &quot;In fact, Mexico recently passed China to become the largest, due in part to trade issues with China, which has reduced the volume of U.S.-China trade. To impose a tariff on all goods from our largest trading partner will cause significant cost increases and other harms to the economy.&quot;I wouldn't think Walmart's customer base would be nearly as able to withstand price increases as a result of tariffs compared to, say, that of Costco (NASDAQ:COST), whose target customer is significantly wealthier both in terms of annual income and net worth.A prolonged tariff war on two fronts (China and Mexico) would be devastating for Walmart and its customers. The Republicans and Democrats must figure out how to bring the President down from his perch before a recession gets underway as a result of these tariffs.  The Bottom Line on WMT StockThe U.S. gets approximately 40% of its fruits and 70% of its vegetables from Mexico. These are items that can't sit around for a long time before being exported. Therefore, Walmart isn't going to be able to do much to mitigate many of the costs of the Mexico tariffs. Should these tariffs carry on for more than a few months, Walmart's grocery business could suffer more than most given its demographic.With less than a week to negotiate a way out of the tariffs, Walmart stock shareholders better hope politicians care about the common man because the Mexico tariffs would be an insult to injury given what's already in place for Chinese goods.  Until this sorts itself out, I'd be wary of buying Walmart stock.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The owners of NBEV stock should focus on the deal's strengthening of New Age's distribution and logistics infrastructure, rather than the company's  acquisition of the rights to more brands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Willis had this to say about Brands Within Reach:&quot;Even though this comes with these globally recognized brand licenses, the bigger play is the whole infrastructure of people and warehousing and logistics and distribution footprint that we can drive our brands through,&quot; Willis told BevNET. &quot;It's a much stronger organization. It's the foundation for putting more things through that *marketing) funnel,&quot; he added. However, while the acquisition is more about the talent NBEV is acquiring than the products it's getting, these new brands widen the number of better-for-you functional beverages it can offer its food service and retail customers. Over the long-term, that's positive for NBEV stock.In addition, it's important to point out that Nestea has brand awareness of 89% in the U.S. That high level of brand awareness is going to open a lot of doors for the rest of New Age's lineup of products at big chains such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) where Nestea is already a popular drink What Did It Cost NBEV?New Age paid $500,000 in cash and 700,000 shares of NBEV stock, while assuming $2.5 million in debt, for an enterprise value of $6.4 million based on a  price of $4.85 per share for NBEV stock. The deal brings New Age's annual revenues to over $320 million and will raise its bottom line. It's not a big deal, and under normal circumstances, New Age would likely have passed on the transaction because it's still integrating Morinda, the direct-selling juice company it acquired for $85 million in December.  &quot;I told our board at our March meeting that we would probably go on an acquisition moratorium for a year while we're integrating Morinda, building these businesses, launching CBD, launching our Health Sciences division,&quot; Willis said after buying Brands Within Reach. &quot;I told them we were going to focus on pure execution -- that lasted about 45 days. But this is just financially too good of an opportunity for us to pass up.&quot;The best acquisitions are often the ones that almost weren't made. This latest acquisition cost less than 2%of the market cap of NBEV stock. Most investors probably didn't hear about the deal. However, any deal that strengthens a company's distribution network and logistics is worth making. Kudos to Brent Willis for pulling the trigger.  Future Growth Although New Age's Q1 results missed analysts' average expectations on both the top and bottom line, there's a lot to like about the company's financials.In Q1, New Age had a net loss of $1.62 million on $58.3 million of net revenue, 83% of the company's top line came from Morinda. On a year-over-year basis, NBEV's sales surged 404%. But excluding Morinda's revenues, its sales fell by 13% YoY. However, the launch of the company's CBD beverages portfolio in the second half of the year should help reignite its sales. While there's a lot of work to be done before New Age's portfolio of brands becomes household names, it's headed in the right direction. From a financial perspective, New Age went from negative free cash flow of $191,000 in Q1 to positive free cash flow of $11.2 million, and that doesn't include a $31.4 million gain from the sale of property. NBEV is still technically losing money, but the fact that it's generating positive cash flow is good news for the owners of NBEV stock.  The Bottom Line on NBEV StockBrent Willis and the rest of the New Age team continue to make the moves necessary to build a national beverage company. Focusing on being a one-stop-shop for healthy beverages is a smart way to grow the company until one of its products becomes a hit. I continue to believe only speculative and aggressive investors should own NBEV stock. Once NBEV becomes profitable and one or more of its products takes off, then I think it's okay for less risk-averse investors to jump into New Age Beverages stock. For now, if you want to play the beverage game, Monster Beverages (NASDAQ:MNST) is still a better choice than NBEV stock.

2019-06-06,"Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) rose overnight after earnings beat expectations. The e-commerce clothing company said it earned $7 million -- or 7 cents per share -- for the quarter ending in April. The earning comes on net revenue of $408.9 million, a 29% increase year over year. SFIX stock opened this morning up 24%, which has since settled to a more 'modest' 16% gain from yesterday's close.Source: Stitch FixThis monster SFIX stock rally comes after analysts had been worrying about whether the company had enough cash, and the stock had been falling since its previous earnings announcement in March took the shares as high as $34.The latest news, demonstrating those earlier numbers were not a fluke, should send the shares back to its highs once trading opens June 6.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Stitch Fix Does RightStitch Fix's business may not seem like the most in-demand idea. SFIX has customers take a style quiz and then sends them clothing based on their size and preferences. Customers can then send back what they don't want and buy what they do.  * 7 Ways to Make Berkshire Hathaway Stock More Attractive But there's a real demand here. Millions of women find they have no time to shop around and develop their personal style. This is the problem CEO Katrina Lake tries to fix through personalization technology and real stylists, examining not just what customers buy, but what they return.  Customers answer some questions and pay a $20 &quot;styling fee&quot; to start. The data is matched with a company database, which then sends 5 items that can be bought or returned.The big story for the company in 2019 is its expansion into men's wear, children's wear, plus-size wear and the UK market, the success of which drove earnings in the most recent quarter.In her analyst call ,Lake also credited Style Pass, launched last year, a subscription service that lets regular customers pay $49 per year and get more personal style services. They Didn't Believe ItClothing is a tough e-commerce market, because everyone is different. It's especially difficult because tastes keep changing.Online retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can fill this market, but the vast number of choices offered there make it difficult for people to find clothes unless they go in knowing specifically what they want and what looks good on them. Those customers who don't know exactly what they want or how things will look, still have to head to a department story like Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) or similar. Even then, many are on their own when it comes to finding what looks best on them.Stitch Fix seems to have cracked the code. Some 62% of its roughly 5,500 employees are listed as stylists, meaning they work directly with about 3.1 million clients.At the company's present run rate of about $1.6 billion in fiscal 2019 revenue, the $2.3 billion market cap gives it a price-to-sales ratio of just 1.5. That's high for a retailer but very low for a technology company. Retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) sell for about half their sales. SFIX stock's ratio is close to that of IBM(NYSE:IBM), which has a $116 billion market cap on about $80 billion in sales. (At the moment, I'd rather own Stitch Fix.) The Bottom Line on SFIX StockCo-founder Lake owns 16% of SFIX stock, but institutions own 66%. Benchmark Capital and its CEO, Bill Gurley, were early backers and Gurley sits on the company's board.Having proven its business model works, Stitch Fix would seem to be ripe for acquisition and scaling. Walmart, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Amazon are the most likely acquirers.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets If you're interested in owning SFIX stock, buy your shares before the sale.Dana Blankenhorn http://www.danablankenhorn.com is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-06,"Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been going through some turbulence lately. Issues with its 737 MAX led to a global grounding of the aircraft. Worse, Boeing's best-selling aircraft saw its orders completely dry up, leaving Boeing stock floundering amid a market correction.Source: Shutterstock However, many investors realize that the issue can be fixed. While it's a short-term bump, it won't hurt Boeing's long-term trajectory. Case in point? The aircraft maker is in talks with Chinese airlines for a jet deal that is valued in the tens of billions. The DealAccording to reports, Boeing and Chinese airlines are in discussion for about 100 new 787 Dreamliner and 777X jets. Specifically, the two sides are in discussions for Boeing's newest long-range jet, which is the 777-9. The latter is also Boeing's most expensive, ringing in at $442.2 million before discounts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat said, there are some complications.The airlines are waiting for guidance from the Chinese government, as the U.S. and China remain locked in an ongoing trade war. While the discussions between Chinese airlines and Boeing may look like a positive for the trade war, that's not so much the case. The deal is not imminent and while it seems unlikely that it will fall apart unless the trade situation deteriorates immensely, it could certainly be on hold for a while.The trade war is inflicting pain on both sides. U.S. farmers are being compensated, China's economy is seeing some waves and how many retailers did we hear from regarding the trade war? PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) are just a few that come to mind.A delayed deal for Boeing may not result in the same impact retailers feel. But make no mistake, dragging out this deal doesn't help. At the end of the day, China needs aircraft and is almost a decade away from its own production. That leaves Boeing and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY). Before discounts are taken into consideration, the deal is said to be north of $30 billion. Boeing wants to land it -- of course -- and Chinese airlines need it. But until the trade-war tensions ease, it may not come to fruition for a bit. Trading Boeing Stock Price  Click to EnlargeEventually though, the deal should go through and Boeing will go back to what it does best: generating massive cash flow. If it also clears its 737 MAX issues, investors will have two sighs of relief and even more reason to back the company. Will that cause Boeing stock to rally? Most likely. But it still has some short-term issues.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets On the chart above, notice how $360 buoyed the name for a while (orange arrow). At the same time though, notice how BA stock was not able to push through its 10-week moving average. The same goes for its 50-day moving average, which isn't shown on this weekly chart.Eventually, $360 -- which was prior range resistance -- gave way and is again acting as is resistance. So are the 50-week and 200-day moving averages. With prior range resistance no longer acting as support, we have to put prior range support down near $320 back on the table.That doesn't mean Boeing stock will fall that far necessarily. But if the markets begin to selloff or BA stock slips on negative headlines, this area will be on watch. Over $360 negates a lot of the negativity and puts a move back to $400 on the table.I think eventually Boeing stock will get back to $400 and eventually back to that prior high near $443. Maybe that comes on the back of a 737 MAX fix. Perhaps a mega deal with Chinese airlines helps drive there. More than likely, it will need both catalysts. That said, a flush lower may still be in the cards before BA stock gets there.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-10,"In recent weeks, New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) has deeply expanded its reach. It has attracted a key retailer and acquired new products as well as a distribution network. However, NBEV stock continues to fall despite these developments. The shares are down more than 14% in the last month, compared to the S&P 500 index, which is off 1.3% in the same period.While these deals show progress in one sense, NBEV will remain a high-risk play until it can deliver results in the CBD-infused beverage market.At the beginning of the year, I described NBEV stock as a &quot;plausible, but risky&quot; path to CBD-related gains. It appears that the more time passes, the more that description comes true.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Deals Bring Benefits and ChallengesThe deal to bring its Marley+CBD Mellow Mood into Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stores carries with it both opportunity and risk. Yes, attracting shelf space in Walmart will boost sales by game-changing levels. However, if it fails to connect with shoppers, Walmart will not hesitate to remove it. Moreover, Walmart's obsession with cutting costs could make it a challenging client.The same holds true with its recent acquisition of Brands Within Reach (BWR). The deal carries with it licensing rights and distribution infrastructure. They happen to distribute well-known brands such as Nestea, Illy ready-to-drink coffee beverages, and Evian water. Analyst Michael Grondahl of Northland Securities agreed, saying this deal likely cost NBEV less than 1x revenue. According to Grondahl, BWR also appeared strong at stores such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Publix.This deal solidifies NBEV's identity as a beverage company, bringing a diverse array of products under its umbrella. Moreover, the distribution network that comes with it leaves it better able to serve Walmart and later, bring its CBD-infused beverages to stores.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far However, becoming more of a beverage company makes NBEV stock arguably less of a &quot;marijuana equity.&quot; Hence, it could struggle more to attract the outsized multiples of a Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) or Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB). Little's Changed for NBEV StockEven more than that is the viability of NBEV stock itself. In my previous article, I argued that buying NBEV could lead investors to find the next Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). It could also become the next Jones Soda (OTCMKTS:JSDA), a once-promising soft drink company which saw its fortunes almost completely fizzle out.Only time will answer that question. Still, the latest deals have done nothing to change that dynamic. Hence, the &quot;plausible, but risky&quot; description applies as much as ever.Hence, I do not recommend NBEV stock for a retirement account, but I see enough promise here for a speculative play. Like Monster before it, New Age Beverages also brings a new category to the market. Additionally, Wall Street forecasts that the company will turn profitable in the third quarter of this year.Analysts also believe that will translate into a yearly profit of five cents per share, taking the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio to just below 48x. That PE ratio appears reasonable given the predicted earnings growth of 113.2% this year and 80% next year. Competitive Threats Hamper NBEV StockHowever, the real worry lies in outside threats. It appears New Age Beverages stock will benefit from a first-mover advantage. The question becomes what happens when larger players respond. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has so far denied interest in this cannabis-related market, even as the rumor mill speculates otherwise.However, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) has partnered with Canopy Growth. Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) has allied with Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). These multi-billion dollar companies have the needed resources to outspend this much smaller $325 million New Age Beverages, How NBEV stock holds up when these companies offer their CBD-infused beverages will determine its future. Bottom Line on NBEV StockNew Age Beverage's progress will not translate into significant gains for NBEV stock until it proves itself. Without a doubt, the Walmart deal and the Brands Within Reach purchase adds to the cache of New Age Beverages stock. However, this changes little for NBEV stock holders. No matter what the company does, it cannot shake the perception that it remains a high-risk play. New Age remains a small company that so far holds the lead in the CBD-infused beverage market.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets However, investors know that the largest beverage companies will eventually respond with their own offerings. This could return New Age Beverages to obscurity, or it could make it the next Monster Beverage. NBEV stock will not gain much traction until the public can see both sales and market share numbers.Still, if the Marley Mellow Mood beverages succeed, investors could see massive gains. This possibility makes NBEV stock a speculative play if nothing else.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-06-11,"Everyone hates Kroger (NYSE:KR). This is a company with over $120 billion in sales and a market cap of under $20 billion. That's a price to earnings ratio of 6.5, half that of Ford Motor (NYSE:F). The dividend today yields 2.4%, against 2.16% for the U.S. 10-year bond.Source: Shutterstock What market watchers want to talk about is the dance among Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) that currently defines U.S. retailing. Kroger's grocery stores and (worse) department stores are thought to be stodgy, staid and old-fashioned. But Kroger is the fourth largest retailer in the U.S., and it's not going away.Kroger hasn't been passive. Kroger does curbside delivery just like Walmart. Kroger has house brands just like Amazon. Kroger will sell you vast quantities just like Costco. Kroger also has upscale markets filled with prepared foods like Amazon's Whole Foods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Kroger Stock Partners With OcadoKroger also has something those other companies don't have -- an alliance with Ocado (OTCMKTS:OCDGF).Ocado isn't huge. Its annual sales are about $2 billion and its market cap around $8 billion. Ocado is all about making internet retailing profitable, and its automated warehouses make those of Amazon look primitive.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Kroger signed its alliance with Ocado a year ago and has already built one of its warehouses near Kroger's home office in Cincinnati, with plans to build two more in Florida and the mid-Atlantic region, both hot for grocery delivery. Each warehouse or &quot;shed&quot; costs about $55 million, about half the cost of a Costco store, and 20 are in the planning stages.Kroger is also working with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on a new system that brings promotions right to the store shelf and does inventory through the cloud, meaning it can also get advertising revenue from the brands it stocks.  They're launching a fleet of unmanned delivery vehicles. Progressive Grocer named Kroger its &quot;retailer of the year&quot; for 2018.  Wait, There's MoreKroger has long produced much of its own product and run its own house brands. Through Ocado, that may also mean growing its own fruits and vegetables, using &quot;vertical farms&quot; the British company has just put $20 million into. Ocado has invested in a company that already does this profitably with herbs. It has a joint venture with other vertical farmers, including U.S.-based 80 Acres, to do the same thing with other produce.A lot of Kroger's leading-edge work involves pilot projects, or one-offs. The whole Kroger ecosystem, which operates under 17 different store labels including Dillon's, Fred Meyer, King Soopers and Ralphs, as well as Kroger (don't get me started on that) isn't being transformed all at once.But it is being transformed. Kroger isn't falling behind in the retail technology arms race. It's just going about things in a different, quieter way. The Bottom Line on KR StockSadly, no one seems to care.Kroger had net income of about $3 billion last year while Walmart had net income of $7 billion. Amazon basically broke even on retailing last year, its $10 billion in profit coming from its cloud and Prime Memberships.It is useless to write that a company &quot;should&quot; be worth more when it consistently isn't. Kroger had a vogue in 2015 when it traded near $40 per share, but for the last two years it's been in a trading range of $20-$30. It was trading at $24.40 early on June 11.I keep hoping Kroger would be more open about its ambitions, unify operations under a single Kroger brand and go toe-to-toe with its larger rivals.Until then, they're a defensive play with an affordable dividend.

2019-06-12,"The U.S. is currently operating in one of the tightest employment markets in the history of corporate America. To attract and retain talent in this challenging HR environment, Target (NYSE:TGT) is providing additional benefits to its employees so that they can be more productive and happy at work. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's excellent news if you own Target stock. Here's why.  The Sandwich GenerationIf you're in your late 40s or early 50s, it's possible that you are taking care of  kids and aging parents. possibly all under one household. The strain that takes on people's physical and mental well-being is highly documented.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession The Washington Post published a guest column in May by a woman named Aimee Christian, who wrote about what self-care looks like for people in their late 40s and early 50s.  Christian is married with two kids, one of whom has a significant disability; not only does she work full-time, but she also helps her mother deal with her father's various ailments, both in and out of the hospital. That's not an unusual situation these days. So, when a country finds itself in one of the tightest employment markets it's ever experienced, companies either step up and meet the needs of their employees or they risk losing them to companies that will.  Target's Bid to Keep Employees HappyTarget recently rolled out several benefits for its employees that will make it easier for its staff to take care of their loved ones. As an investor, you might not think that these things are an essential part of your decision-making process, but they ought to be because if companies don't take care of people working on their front lines, they're bound to lose market share to those that will. Many retailers, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) have already tried to help their workers by raising their minimum wage to $15. Others, like TGT, are in the process of raising it.  Target's minimum wage is currently at $13 and will hit $15 by 2020.While Target's wage hikes are a good start, the fact that it's fallen behind Costco and Amazon in this area is troubling. If you own Target stock, I wouldn't sell the shares, but you might want to write a letter to the company's  investor relations department if you feel it's not doing enough on the minimum wage front.   A Bigger IssueThe biggest issue for corporate America isn't the minimum wage, but gender equality. Until women are paid the same wages as men, from the bottom rung to the top, and are given an equal opportunity for career advancement, American companies are going to have trouble attracting and retaining employees. The fact that Target won the Network of Executive Women's William J. Grize 2019 award for gender diversity and inclusion is a sign that TGT is working hard to level the playing field. &quot;Today almost half of Target's store managers are female, each overseeing up to 500 employees and responsible for maximizing profitability, guest experience and sales. Women make up 36 percent of Target's board and 45 percent of its executives,&quot; stated the January press release announcing Target's win. In 2016, Target signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge, showing its commitment to ensuring women working at the company are equal in every way. While TGT has a ways to go on the minimum wage, in most respects, it's doing a pretty decent job taking care of its employees.  The Bottom Line on Target StockIf this seems like a commercial for TGT, it ought to. Every time the American economy heats up, companies get serious about benefits. Then, as in 2008, when unemployment spikes, companies forget that people are what makes them successful. If you own Target stock, you can feel good that you don't hold Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shares; WMT only pays $11 an hour to start for its front-line staff.  As long as the economy remains strong, Target's efforts to help its employees cope will be positive for its top-and bottom lines, and good for TGT stock, over the long-term.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-12,"Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced it would offer a credit card to those with bad credit and credit services and electronic payment firms barely noticed. Visa (NYSE: V) shares closed recently at a new high as did MasterCard (NYSE:MA). But Amazon.com's card issuer, Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF) fell on the news. Still, both Synchrony and Amazon stock stand to benefit from this initiative and shares for both companies will react positively as customers sign up for this credit card.Source: Shutterstock The rewards card, called Amazon Credit Builder, will target those who want to build their credit history. These include customers who either want to establish new credit or are recovering from a bad credit rating.Amazon.com is no stranger to the credit card business. Two years ago, it offered a Visa card with 5% cash back. With this new card, Prime members get the 5% back on purchases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Credit Builder also gives the cardholder the ability to track their credit score. The credit details are displayed on a TransUnion CreditView Dashboard at no charge. By showing score changes over time, Amazon is helping the cardholder learn how to improve the credit score. This removes the need to rely on Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX) and more importantly, the service has no extra costs. Prime Subscriptions and Amazon StockThe new credit offering gives customers another incentive to have an Amazon Prime subscription. But the online retailer offers bigger reasons to be a member. For the current second quarter, the company is working to turn its Prime free Two-Day Shipping into a free One-Day Shipping program.This feat is possible because of the company's back-end fulfillment and logistics network. Still, Amazon needs to invest in this area to achieve this same-day delivery goal. It plans to spend $800 million in the second quarter.So, if one day Amazon brings One-Day shipping down to one or two-hour shipping, it will have a huge advantage over retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT) or Walmart (NYSE:WMT). In the last holiday season, Target could not offer more than getting online shoppers to drive to the store to physically pick-up the order.But even though Walmart is planning to launch in-home grocery delivery in three cities this fall, the food business something Amazon will build through its Whole Foods division. For now, growing the Whole Foods business depends on developing the physical storefront experience. Prime Subscriptions GrowJust as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) enjoys high profit margins through membership fees, Amazon Prime is of strategic importance. Last year, more people signed up for Prime than any year before. The more time people spend watching videos and listening to music, the more they are likely to renew their membership year after year. Telling friends about the great service encourages more people to sign up.When Amazon Web Services brought in an astonishing $30 billion in annualized revenue, the company's credit card initiative appears insignificant at best.Yet everything counts; the operating margin grew by 320 basis points. It may re-invest the cash to fulfill infrastructure needs while finding further efficiencies. The more profitable the business becomes the better programs like Prime get. And the more incentive there is, the more likely Amazon may win customers who happen to have bad credit and need to rebuild their credit score. Price TargetAnalysts on Wall Street have an average price target that is 20% above the recent $1,860 share price. Per Tipranks, the average price target is $2,242. Supporting this price target is a 10-year DCF Growth Exit Model. If Amazon keeps growing revenue by at least 10% annually, the stock has plenty of upside for investors.Amazon's high valuations do not make much sense to the conservative investor but the market knows better. In every type of business, the online retailer enters, it re-defines the business process and eventually dominates the sector. Your TakeawayShares of Amazon stock are already up nearly 10% in the last week thanks to a rebound in the stock market. Though the growth prospects suggest the stock may run higher, investors may still want to wait for a dip in the stock before buying.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-13,"Shares of Kroger (NYSE:KR) have been struggling over the longer term, but have seen a boost over the past few weeks. Coming off a late-May low of $22.44, we've seen a quick 10% rally in Kroger stock.Source: Shutterstock There are a number of concerns tied to Kroger at this point, most of which all point to growth. Essentially, there are concerns about whether the company keep up with not only ecommerce pressures like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but also bricks-and-mortar competition like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Target (NYSE:TGT) and again, apparently Amazon in the future.Further, with inflation remaining stubbornly low, Kroger loses pricing power, which stifles revenue growth. The grocery game is a tough business, despite everyone needing to eat. That said, maybe Kroger can get its growth from somewhere new: Cannabis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10  Kroger Stock and CBD ProductsWhen you can't find growth from traditional outlets, it's time to find new ways to generate sales. That becomes even more important when it involves products that consumers are interested in.As a result, Kroger will reportedly start selling CBD products in its stores. Keep in mind, Kroger is no small operator. The country's largest grocery chain now plans to sell CBD lotions and balms in its 945 stores across 17 U.S. states.The company joins CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) as retailers begin to embrace CBD and cannabis products. That's interesting for CVS, given that the company stopped selling cigarettes a few years back.In any regard, CVS, Kroger and other retailers are seeing that there are health and pain-management benefits to these types of products. Management is also recognizing that demand and discussion around these products from their customers are heating up, and therefore it makes sense to carry them in the stores.While there are still regulatory concerns about CBD products as cannabis is not legal at the federal level it's clear that we're moving toward a more welcoming environment. Should that trend continue, more retailers like Kroger and CVS will likely embrace the products too.It's also more likely that big consumer brands will partner with cannabis players like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV), Cronos Group (NYSE:CRON), etc. to create and market new products together.That may be another boost for Kroger stock down the line. Trading Kroger Stock  Click to EnlargeThe question ultimately boils down to whether selling CBD products will help KR stock. The answer in the short term is, probably not. At least from a fundamental perspective.If Kroger were to perform a quick rollout to all of its 900+ stores, it's possible we would see a flood of demand. But until it becomes more than just lotions and balms, the effect will likely be limited on its top and bottom line.That's not so much due to a lack of demand from consumers, but more because KR is already forecast to generate $123 billion in sales this year.Estimates call for a 1.6% revenue boost in 2019 and a 2.7% increase in 2020 to $126.4 billion. Perhaps that 2020 number can inch higher if Kroger really kicks CBD sales into high gear.As for the charts, KR stock is trying with all its might to stay above the 50-day moving average and the 10-week moving average near $24.50. If it can, perhaps Kroger stock can make a push north of $25 and potentially send it back to the Q2 highs near $26. Just above is the 61.8% one-year retracement at $26.19.This $26 to $27 area has been significant for a number of years, as the chart above shows. While Kroger stock would still face an uphill challenge, clearing this level would be an important hurdle for the bulls.On the downside, losing the 20-week moving average likely puts $24 back on the table. If this level fails to buoy KR stock, then a retest of $22.50 and channel support is on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The changing nature of food retailing was laid bare on Thursday with lower-than-expected U.K. sales growth at Tesco Plc and Amazon.com Inc. expanding its partnership with the smaller British chain Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc.Amazon’s agreement with Morrisons, while still fairly small right now, shows the ambitions of the online giant toward the U.K., already one of the world’s most competitive retail sectors. That will strike fear into the hearts of supermarket behemoths such as Tesco, Britain’s grocery leader. Tesco has been trying to bolster its defenses, and a slowdown in growth in the three months to May 25 shouldn’t be too surprising. All retailers face extremely difficult comparisons with the same period last year, when Britain was basking in sunny weather and enjoying a royal wedding. The company’s CEO, Dave Lewis, remains on course to hit his target for an operating margin of 3.5% to 4% by February next year.Still, the first-quarter slowdown doesn’t exactly inspire confidence about what happens once that margin target is reached. The company updates the City next week on how it can find ways to bolster sales and profit. It’s staying tight-lipped for now, but making more of its use of customer data — including through its Clubcard loyalty scheme — might be on the agenda. Lewis has talked before about developing the property around its stores. That could become a bigger part of cash flow, too.Tesco could also work more closely with Booker Group Ltd., a recently acquired food wholesaler. It’s experimenting already with putting cash-and-carry outlets in Tesco stores and introducing dedicated bulk-buy areas, with one eye on becoming Britain’s answer to America’s Costco Wholesale Corp. Wisely, it has also set up a purchasing alliance with Carrefour SA, the French supermarket chain.But as the quarter showed, life isn’t getting any easier for Tesco. Aldi and Lidl, the cutthroat German discount grocers, are still powering ahead in Britain, putting enormous pressure on the traditional giants.That makes Amazon’s advances all the more fraught. Morrisons, the U.K.’s fourth-biggest supermarket group, said on Thursday that it was expanding its super-fast grocery delivery service for Amazon customers. Nine regions in England and Scotland will now offer this, up from four. The aim is for nationwide coverage.The rapid roll-out of the Amazon partnership has been facilitated by another smart move by Morrisons chief executive David Potts, who started his supermarket career on the shop floor. He has negotiated an end to his company’s exclusive relationship with Ocado Group Plc, the specialist online grocer. That has opened the door to closer ties with Amazon.Beset by price-slashing German rivals on one side and savvy online operators on the other, Tesco and its ilk are going to have to work hard to keep food in their investors’ mouths.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-06-17,"In a frothy market you can get a mighty high multiple if you're in the right niche. Like marijuana. That's the story of New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV). NBEV stock tripled last September after announcing a drink containing CBD.  Its drinks even have a picture of the late Bob Marley on them.But pot isn't NBEV's real business. Canned beverages are its business. Things like coffee, tea and kombucha. Sodas with strange combinations like watermelon and coconut, the kind of stuff you'll try at a soda ranch on Route 66.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince that September explosion, where it briefly traded at almost $9, NBEV stock has lost its fizz, settling into a trading range of between $4-6 per share. But its market cap, $350 million, remains impressive for a drinks company with March quarter sales of $58 million, and no profit.But still. Pot! What NBEV Is Up ToNew Age Beverages has used its moment in the pot limelight to bulk up the product line. The highlight was this month's purchase of Brands Within Reach, for $6.4 million, only $500,000 of it cash.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Brands Within Reach has brand licensing and distribution rights for some mainstream beverages, like cold Nestea and Illy coffee. The idea is that this gets New Age in the door at mainstream retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), which then might look at its more esoteric brands.This came just six months after buying Morinda Holdings, another small company but with distribution in 60 countries.  The idea there was to expand the market for its CBD products.The Morinda combination is already in the numbers due to be reported August 8, where sales of $70.8 million are expected. Following on the first quarter take of $58 million, that's good growth and, if the pattern persists through the year, it could lead to sales equaling the stock's current market cap by this time next year.That's important, because New Beverage CEO Brent Willis knows he's in the drinks business, not the pot business. He promised to focus on execution after buying Morinda, but the chance to buy into serious beverages with just stock was too good to pass up. What Next for NBEV Stock?Some analysts got very bullish on New Age after the Morinda buy, predicting imminent profits and a steady rise to $9 per share, which would be double its current level.InvestorPlace's Josh Enomoto disagrees. He sees the Brands Within Reach acquisition as a turn away from CBD, the source of its frothy valuation. He also sees the current brands as nothing special.Personally, I like the Brands Within Reach deal. NBEV now has both brands that can get it into the door of big retailers and global distribution for its CBD products. But drinks remain a risky business, a land of giants in which NBEV is a mouse. If Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsico (NYSE:PEP) or even Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) decided there was something to this CBD thing, they could blow NBEV out of the water quickly. The Bottom Line on NBEV StockI think the owners of Brands Within Reach know all this, so there's an overhang of almost $6 million in stock, itching to be sold right now.Much of the rest of the common stock is held by speculators looking for a quick payout. Institutions hold just over 13% of the common, against almost 26% held by insiders.  I think they will bail, too, at the first sign of bad news.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today In other words, NBEV stock has a sell-by date, and execution alone won't stave it off.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Carrefour SA, Europe's largest retailer,  may be the latest Western company to pull back from China. It’s unlikely to be the last.On Monday, the hypermarket operator said it would sell 80% of its China business for 4.8 billion yuan ($699 million) in cash to Suning.com, the Chinese retailer backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Carrefour will retain a 20% stake. Over the past few years, the French company’s plans to shrink its China footprint has been one of the worst-kept secrets in banking. Though Carrefour sold the business pretty cheaply – with a valuation of 0.2 times 2018 sales, compared with the industry average of 0.84, according to Citigroup Inc. – loosening its ties to the mainland may be a smart move, whatever the price. With sales in the country flagging and losses piling up, the deal comes as China’s macroeconomic picture is also darkening.Yet the key challenge for Carrefour preceded the trade war. In recent years, online-only players such as Alibaba have been piling pressure on brick-and-mortar operations, with Tesco Plc, Best Buy Co. and Marks & Spencer Plc each announcing plans to pull back from the mainland market. Carrefour’s share of the country’s hypermarket segment fell to 4.6% last year from 8.2% in 2009, Citi writes.(1)   That’s a problem in a country with one of the world’s biggest rates of e-commerce penetration. China's online retail sales reached 3.86 trillion yuan in the first five months of this year, accounting for more than one-fifth of the country's total purchases of consumer goods, according to a recent report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. To make matters worse, foreign brands no longer have the cachet they once enjoyed – at least in low-end consumer goods. In a survey last year, Credit Suisse AG said that Chinese consumers preferred domestic purveyors in categories like food and drinks and home appliances. With the trade war whipping up nationalist fervor, that trend may accelerate: The bank's latest poll of shoppers 18 to 29 years old showed that 41% preferred phones made by Huawei Technologies Co., up from 28%, while interest for Apple Inc.’s products fell to 28% from 40%.For many firms, ceding control to a local partner is probably the best way forward. Carrefour appears to be borrowing a page from the playbook of McDonald’s Corp., which sold 80% of its China business in 2017 to a tie-up between state giant Citic Group Corp. and private equity firm Carlyle Group LP.Or consider Walmart Inc., which sold its e-commerce delivery site to JD.com Inc. in 2016 in exchange for a stake in the Chinese retailer. The U.S. firm now aims to open 40 of its Sam’s Club stores in China by 2020. Costco Wholesale Corp. is also betting on China’s appetite for bulk buying, with plans to open its first bricks-and-mortar store in August. Whether Costco can pull this off without a local partner remains unclear.What is clear is that Carrefour won’t be the last retailer to rethink its China strategy. Germany's Metro AG is also looking to sell its $1.5 billion Chinese business. At a time when Chinese acquisitions overseas have dried up, bankers at least can thank Western firms for managing to drum up some business from the mainland. (1) The bank citesEuromonitor International research.To contact the author of this story: Nisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2019-07-01,"Target (NYSE:TGT) is growing more quickly than rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and sports better profit margins than Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). Yet, Target stock is valued like a utility holding, while the shares of Costco and Walmart are priced as if they were top-tier technology names. That doesn't seem to be fair.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The explanation isn't all that elusive, although the market may not even consciously realize why it's keeping Target stock in check. Stuck in the MiddleThe price-earnings ratios of Target stock are lower than Costco and Walmart  because shares of Walmart are less volatile, while Costco is growing much  more rapidly than TGT and Walmart. Both Walmart and Costco also have delivered more consistent results.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Same Price as Beyond Meat Target, in short, isn't reliable enough for Target stock to command a premium.The table below tells the tale, as it compares each company's trailing and forward-looking P/E ratios to each stock's &quot;beta,'&quot; which measures volatility compared to the S&P 500. The number of earnings misses of each outfit over the course of the past three years also suggests investors aren't interested in paying up for names that run the risk of coming up short on quarterly earnings,  unless they offer a compelling reason to do so. Costco fits in the latter category because its sales regularly jump  7% year-over-year. Given that pace, investors will tolerate an occasional earnings miss by COST.As you can see, margins aren't an important determinant of stock price in this sector,  Target has usually had the highest margins of the three companies, but that advantage has not been reflected in TGT stock in a long, long time. The other criteria simply are more important. The X-FactorThat being said, even if all of Target's relevant numbers were more competitive with those of WMT and COST, there's little assurance that the valuation of Target stock would be higher.That's because TGT has a perception problem. Not only do investors assume its smaller size prevents it from competing effectively against Walmart, Costco and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the retailer has stumbled into at least one too many gaffes that keep investors -- as well as shoppers -- suspicious about it.For instance, the echoes of the 2013 data breach that exposed the credit-card information of 41 million Target customers are still ringing. Indeed, the volume of those echoes was turned up again in mid-June when TGT struggled to ring customers up at its cash registers for an entire weekend. It wasn't a data breach, but it was a reminder that the company's technology may be fatally flawed.Then there's the 2016 decision to permit transgender individuals to use the bathroom and fitting room of their choice, resulting in a boycott that's still underway. Even before that dust has fully settled, the company kicked it up again just a few days ago by officially telling new mothers to &quot;nurse wherever and whenever you like.&quot;In both cases, controversy could have been averted by refraining from announcing an official policy.By permitting each store to handle such delicate matters on a case-by-case basis, Target could have steered clear of public and media scrutiny. By bringing sensitive matters front and center- something Costco and Walmart mostly haven't done -- Target set the stage for backlashes. Such controversies makes Target stock less appealing to investors. The Bottom Line on Target StockThe great irony in all of this is that Target continues to perform on par with its rivals. The issue is entirely TGT stock and how much investors are willing or unwilling to pay for it.But investors' reticence about Target stock has still been enough to suppress the shares in a way that's proven frustrating.Don't expect things to change in the foreseeable future. The volatility of TGT stock that's keeping its P/E ratio in the teens is being caused by the same investors who are in a position to fix it. If those investors haven't yet gotten past the fact that the retailer has embraced the idea of being in the political and cultural fray, it's unlikely they will anytime soon. Likewise, if they don't yet care about superior margins, they're not going to care about them going forward.In other words, fair or not, Target stock isn't likely to be seen as undervalued and ripe for substantially higher prices anytime in the foreseeable future.As of this writing, James Brumley held no position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The question now for investors is if investors can still buy at a low price?It seems the lack of respect that has plagued Target stock has begun to go away. TGT remained a bargain long after traders and consumers figured out that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would not force all other retailers out of business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Finally, investors began to buy after the company beat earnings expectations in late May. This steady buying paused after IT-related issued emerged, but TGT stock recovered quickly and since has added another 23%. Target Capitalizes on OpportunitiesThis stands in stark contrast to the 2014 data breach which took down the CEO and made Target stock dead money for most of that year.The new-found respect for TGT brings with it a somewhat higher stock price. The forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio that was 11.7 in January has risen to 13.9.Likewise, the dividend produced a yield of 3.9%dividend produced a yield of 3.9% at the beginning of this year. The rising Target stock price has taken that yield to 3.1%, and that factors in the recent two-cent per share payout hike.The good news is that Target stock still compares well to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) which trades at a 22 forward PE. It fares even better to Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which trades at about 31 times forward earnings.Target also comes in well ahead of its two principal peers on profit margins and dividend yield. The 48 years of annual dividend increases appear set to continue. Will Growth Continue to Drive Target stock?The Minneapolis-based upscale discounter also beats Walmart in another area, growth. Analysts predict that profits will grow 10% this year and 6.4% the next. Walmart will not match that, and Wall Street expects it will see earnings shrink this year. Unfortunately, TGT still lags Costco in earnings growth.Target operates more than 1,850 stores across the U.S. This naturally leads investors to wonder how much longer the company can maintain the growth rate at home.Moreover, the bizarre and costly failure with Target Canada exacerbates that concern. After all, if it cannot succeed in a country where even Walmart has prospered, where can they expand?Fortunately, management has answered that question (at least for now) without leaving the borders of the United States. Target has turned to small-format stores in large cities.Historically, the company has operated 135,000 sq. ft. stores designed for suburbs. Now, the company has begun to open small-format stores. With more people living in the central city, the company has targeted this demographic with a store called CityTarget.In other areas, they operate TargetExpress, which sells smaller items and focuses on people who use public transportation. The company will also continue to benefit from the success it has enjoyed with omnichannel retailing.These moves helped to produce the stellar numbers from the previous quarter. Online sales grew by 42% on a year-over-year basis, while comparable store sales increased by 4.8% over the same period. Should Investors Buy Target stock?Given the performance of omnichannel and the new store formats, the short answer is that yes, Target stock remains a buy. Yes, investors could have bought TGT at a lower PE and a higher dividend yield early this year. However, it still trades at a huge discount to Walmart and Costco while paying a higher dividend yield.The 20%-plus move in about a month could indicate a near-term pullback will come soon. Still, for now, investors can profit from a still-generous dividend. Although traders may need to exercise patience, I think the journey higher has only just begun for Target stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Trading the Nasdaq  Click to EnlargeIt would be very beneficial to see the Nasdaq hold the 8,100 level as support moving forward. Given that this is just over 1% away from current levels though, it's not really a realistic request.Bulls would love to see a rally over the next two to five days, before the index takes a break and consolidates. That's when a slight pullback into the 8,100 level would be a great test. Of course, we get some of the largest names in tech reporting earnings in just a few weeks, along with an interest rate decision with the Fed.So as &quot;ideal&quot; as investors would like the setup to be, it's almost certain to be anything but. I'll of course be watching the 8,100 level, as well as the 8,050 area that's been buoying the Nasdaq all month. It's possible that we see a gap-fill down to ~8,000, while the 20-day is sitting at 8,012. Heard at the Nasdaq TodayCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) hit a new all-time high on Wednesday, as the retailer continues to grind out higher prices. Oppenheimer analysts named Costco stock a top pick and assigned a $295 price target to the name. After Wednesday's rally, that target implies roughly 9% upside. Further, the analyst speculated about a potential special dividend in the range of $10 to $15 per share.Speaking of top picks, Goldman Sachs analysts put Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) on its conviction list. That came alongside an upgrade from neutral to buy and a significant bump in its price target from $44 to $54. The new target implies more than 23% upside.

Spending and hiring are still very good in the U.S., and discount retailers like COST or Target (NYSE:TGT) give us exposure to both sectors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLate last month, we recommended a trade on TGT. We collected profits on that trade in just 11 days, and if COST trends flat or continues rising in the next month, we may be able to roll this trade out just as quickly. Protection From Earnings SeasonEarnings season is starting next week. The big banks, tech companies and industrial stocks will start reporting, and we generally don't like to hold positions through earnings. While a positive report can send a stock soaring, which is good for a put write position, counting on earnings increases uncertainty surrounding a trade, making it riskier.Retail companies like COST report very late in the season compared to companies in other sectors. In fact, COST doesn't report until October 3, 2019.If we pick an expiration sometime before then, we can collect income without worrying too much about dramatic movements in the stock. To see why, we need to look at COST's chart. Resistance at $267.50 Could Become SupportFrom a technical point of view, COST's price trend still mirrors its fundamentals. The company has reported a positive earnings surprise in both of its 2019 reports, and the stock has been rising accordingly. It doesn't show any signs of slowing down.Daily Chart of Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) -- Chart Source: TradingViewCOST has short-term support at just under $264, and it just broke above resistance at $267.50.If resistance at $267.50 becomes support, it could head even higher. That makes the former resistance level a good strike price in our trade. Even if the stock dips below $267.50, there is enough premium in COST options to make the risk/reward picture for a put write appealing.To find out which COST puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

While the stock continues to trade a lower valuation than its peers, investors have more confidence in its future prospects.Source: Shutterstock Regarding the future, Target faces many headwinds. The never-ending growth of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), threatens the &quot;big box&quot; retail model. Within the big box realm, competition from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) also threatens Target's long term prospects.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond But do not take the low valuation of TGT stock to mean weak prospects. Read on to find out why Target may still be a buy after a 35% rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Target's Strategy Is Paying OffPressure from Amazon has prompted Target and Wal-Mart to invest billions in order to stay relevant. As stated in their March 5, 2019 CFO presentation, after sales declines in 2016, Target was motivated to change course in order to resume growth.Unlike Wal-Mart's acquisition-driven strategy (Jet.com, Flipkart), Target focused on store reinvestment. The company remodeled stores, expanded their selection of owned and exclusive brands, and adapted to Amazon-related &quot;same day delivery&quot; pressures.In late 2017, Target acquired delivery service Shipt for $550 million. The Shipt purchase provided the infrastructure to offer same-day delivery in the majority of their stores. The success of this deal highlights Target's ability to remain relevant in an Amazon-dominated retail environment.Target's strategy has paid off. Comp sales and traffic were both up 5% in 2018. This indicates Target is making the right moves to protect their market share. Solid Future Prospects for TGTTarget's guidance calls for low-single digit sales growth in the next year. While this is not too exciting, it does indicate confidence Target can at least keep up in an increasingly e-commerce-driven retail environment.Target continues to expand in the e-commerce realm. Digital sales are up from $3.9 billion in 2017 to $5.3 billion in 2018.For brick and mortar stores, Target's &quot;small format&quot; strategy helps maintain market share. Opening smaller locations in affluent, densely populated areas maintains Target's image as the cosmopolitan big box store.Based on the Target CEO's presentation in March, Target has the highest concentration of small-format stores in the New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco metro areas. Heavy presence in America's most affluent areas continues to be a positive factor in Target's future growth and profitability. Valuation: Target Stock Trades at a Discount to PeersTGT stock trades at lower earnings multiples than competitors Wal-Mart and Costco (NASDAQ:COST):  * Forward P/E: TGT trades at 14x forward earnings. WMT trades at 22.5x forward earnings, and COST trades at 32.7x forward earnings.  * EV/EBITDA (trailing 12 months): TGT's EV/EBITDA ratio is 8.4, while WMT and COST trade at EBITDA multiples over 10 (12.2 for WMT, 19.5 for COST).Despite this valuation discrepancy, TGT has higher EBITDA margins (10.1%) than both WMT (6.8%) and COST (4.2%), and has a net income margin of about 4.5% (compared to 1.6% for WMT, 2.4% for COST).The TGT stock discount continues to be a mystery. In a recent article, InvestorPlace contributor Will Healy pointed out a strong reason behind the discrepancy. With the failure of their Canadian expansion a few years back, Mr. Market still lacks confidence the company can continue to grow.But what Target lacks in &quot;growth story,&quot; it makes up for in value. Not only is TGT stock undervalued relative to its peers; Target stock is a solid dividend play. TGT Continues to Be a Dividend AristocratTarget stock has paid a dividend since 1971. Not only that, the dividend has a 5-year CAGR of 9.79%.Compared to peers, TGT stock pays a higher dividend. Target's yield of 3% beats out WMT (1.8%) and COST (0.96%).Despite plowing billions of dollars back into the business, Target continues to make return of capital a high priority. In 2016 and 2017, the company bought back $3.2 billion worth of TGT stock. These buybacks helped boost EPS by about 8% (TTM EPS of $5.74, versus EPS of $5.32 in 2018).As stated in the CFO presentation, Target is committed to returning excess cash within the limits of their middle-A credit rating. This highlights Target's continued prudent capital allocation beneficial in the short-term (buybacks/dividends) and the long-term (store reinvestment). Bottom Line: TGT Stock Has Risks, But Is Still a BuyThe Amazon-driven &quot;retail apocalypse&quot; is a long-term risk to Target stock. But strategic moves are helping Target keep up in a tough retail environment.Despite solid earnings, TGT stock is still a bargain relative to peers. Add in a healthy buyback policy and high-yielding dividend, and Target stock offers investors a strong opportunity.Target's next earnings call is in August. Investors buying the stock today face the risk of priced-in expectations, and could see declines if earnings fail to excite investors.This makes Target stock a cautious buy. There may be better value purchasing shares down the road, but investors today may still want to initiate a position at the current price.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-12,"Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) have long set the tone for what we should expect from big box retailers. But are investors better off buying or selling these retail stocks in today's market?It has been a gift of a year in 2019 for TGT, WMT and COST stock investors. Coming into Thursday's session, shares were up roughly 21%, 30% and 33%, respectively, and well ahead of a spirited 17.5% return in the large cap VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:RTH).But if we're to believe formidable investment house Goldman Sachs, the good tidings for these retail stocks aren't over either.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares zipped ahead by roughly 0.75% to nearly 2% following a bullish analyst note from the firm's Kate McShane. Ms. Shane initiated buy recommendations on the trio and a spot on Goldman's Conviction Buy list for Target, citing favorable company-specific catalysts and each retailer's ability to continue taking market share from weaker players.  * 10 Stocks Driving the Market to All-Time Highs (And Why) Still, while existing shareholders have been happy shoppers in these big box stocks, with price targets of $102 for TGT stock, $123 in WMT and $290 for shares of COST, are the price charts telling today's investors to shop, take profits or browse the inventory and wait for a markdown? Target (TGT)  Click to EnlargeTarget is the first of our three big box retailers. According to Goldman Sachs, TGT stock has the most upside potential. The firm sees the company's sustainable same-store sales growth, sustainable operating income and room for additional upside profits backing its price target of $102, which implies a return of about 17%.On the monthly price chart, our assessment of TGT stock is similarly bullish. Shares are currently trying to break out to new highs from a fairly common V or cup-shaped correction following the market's broad-based sell-off in late 2018.What I like about Target's technical situation is this year's comparatively smaller correction relative to others over the past decade and relative weakness over that period potentially sets up a more bullish change of character and above-market returns going forward.TGT Stock Strategy: With the monthly stochastics neutral and trending higher, the only item I'd wait on before purchasing TGT stock is a confirmed breakout of a five-week flat base through $89.41. Walmart (WMT)  Click to EnlargeWalmart is the second of the big box stocks to watch now. For Walmart, Goldman sees upside potential of around 7.5%. The outlook is based on the company's massive and well-positioned brick-and-mortar sprawl as smaller competitors close their doors.Additionally, the firm is also positive on Walmart's proactive and aggressive omnichannel strategy that it has put in place to successfully fend off the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Technically, our view is WMT's monthly uptrend looks prone to profit-taking. Shares are marginally above a several year-long resistance line with stochastics in overbought territory and starting to turn lower.  * 7 Companies Apple Should Consider Buying WMT Stock Strategy: Buy shares on a pullback. As the illustrated monthly view shows, I see the color of money for WMT stock investors nearer $100, which offers some trend-line and whole-number psychological support, as well as the opportunity for a reset in the stochastics indicator. Costco (COST)  Click to EnlargeCostco is the final retail stock that I think is worth watching right now. Goldman estimates COST stock has roughly another 4% to 5% upside based on its price target of $290. The firm believes there's bullish earnings risk due to the company's solid management and loyal customer base, which has resulted in consistently exceptional returns within the retail sector.On the COST stock price chart, bullish momentum is in play. As most investors are aware, momentum is great for quick profits, until it's not. And with monthly stochastics backing today's bid and the psychologically attractive $300 level about 8% above current levels, I see this price enthusiasm and bullish trend continuing.COST Stock Strategy: Shares of COST are in position to be purchased today for a targeted move into a price range of $300 - $315. This entry is based on momentum continuing to prove itself. As such, I'd be quick to exit with a tight stop beneath $270. This minimizes risk to under 3% and avoids holding shares that could reasonably trade quickly down toward $250 under less-enthusiastic conditions.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. shoppers are snatching up potato chips, crackers, toilet paper and other non-perishable grocery store items to take advantage of the online retailer’s Prime Day deals, which could be bad news for Costco Wholesale Corp. and Walmart Inc.Sales of consumable products on Amazon during the first nine hours of Prime Day -- a two-day sale that began Monday -- are about triple what they are on a typical sales day, according to CommerceIQ, which helps hundreds of consumer brands sell products on the e-commerce site.The results show Prime Day’s appeal stretches beyond electronics, appliances and other big-ticket purchases shoppers usually put off until there’s a big promotion. Sales of car seats, appliances and toys were up four to five times a typical day, according to CommerceIQ, which is about the usual rate for a sales event.Shoppers will spend $5.8 billion on Amazon over the two days, according to an estimate from Coresight Research. That’s an 11% increase from last year’s 36-hour sale when converted to spending per hour. Amazon launched Prime Day in 2015 as a way to lure new Prime members, who pay monthly or yearly fees in exchange for shipping discounts and other perks like video streaming.The uptick in spending shows Amazon Prime Day continues to have strong appeal to shoppers despite competing sales events offered by rivals from Walmart to Target Corp. and EBay Inc.Amazon doesn’t disclose specific sales information about Prime Day. Some companies are able to gain insights through their own sales on the site or estimations based on sales rankings and other information Amazon discloses.To contact the reporter on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Shoppers Snatch Up Deals on Potato Chips and Toilet Paper

2019-07-15,"Arguably the single biggest theme and driver of the record 2019 stock market rally has been the plunge in interest rates. In short, as interest rates rose in late 2018, stocks fell off a cliff, and as interest rates have plunged in 2019, stocks have come roaring back.Why have interest rates and stocks been inversely correlated? In depth, it's a complicated conversation. But the high level ideas are easy to digest.There are two things at play here. One, bonds and stocks are competing investment vehicles. Money all around the world has to constantly decide whether to be invested in stocks, or bonds. When interest rates drop, bond yields drop and the return on bonds becomes less attractive relative to stocks. Thus, money rushes into stocks. Further, because bond yields are lower, that gives wiggle room for stock yields to go lower, too, so the multiple on stocks can and should move higher in a low rate environment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwo, the theoretical present value of a stock is the net present value of its future profits, discounted back by a certain discount rate. One of the principal components which influences that discount rate: the risk free investment rate (which is a byproduct of current interest rates). Thus, as interest rates drop, the risk free investment rate drops, the discount rate on future profits drops and the present value of equities rises.Consequently, it is reasonable to say that low rates today are inflating equity valuations everywhere.This is especially true for certain stocks which seem a too inflated by low rates. For these stocks, if/when rates rise, their present valuations could crumble, and the stocks could fall off a cliff.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy With that in mind, let's take a look at 7 stocks that seem overly inflated by low interest rates. Stocks Being Inflated By Low Rates: Proctor & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)YTD Gain: 24%Forward P/E Multiple: 24Long Term Projected EPS Growth Rate (sourced from YCharts, for all stocks): ~7%Consumer staples giant Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has rallied 24% year-to-date, generating 4 points of alpha on the S&P 500, mostly thanks to the plunge in interest rates. In short, PG is a defensive story with a big yield. Defensive stories tend to have low multiples, so when rates fall, these defensive stories can benefit from big multiple expansion. At the same time, big yield stocks become relatively more attractive in low rate environments, since healthy risk free yield is hard to find.But at current levels, PG stock has nearly the same forward earnings multiple as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook is a 20%-plus revenue grower. Proctor & Gamble grew revenues by 1% last quarter (5% on an organic basis). Over the next several years, this company projects as a mid single digit profit grower. A 24 forward multiple is simply too steep for mid single digit profit growth, especially considering the entire consumer staples sector trades at less than 20-times forward earnings for a similar long term earnings growth rate.Net net, PG stock has been overly inflated by low rates, and if/when low rates do creep higher, PG stock could drop in a big way as the multiple compresses to more reasonable levels. Stocks Being Inflated By Low Rates: Match Group (MTCH)YTD Gain: 67%Forward P/E Multiple: 40Long Term Projected EPS Growth Rate: ~15%Shares of global internet dating behemoth Match (NASDAQ:MTCH) have rattled off a near 70% gain through the first six months of 2019, as low rates have supported multiple expansion on the stock while the company has continued to report strong subscriber growth numbers which underscore that online dating is a growing global phenomena. This is nothing new for MTCH stock. Over the past three years, the stock is up nearly 400%.The secular growth narrative here is healthy. Dating, like shopping and TV watching, is moving to the online channel. Match is the dominant player in this market, having bought up pretty much all the competition and controlling a suite of dating apps which together comprise the lion's share of the online dating market. This dynamic of leadership in a secular growth market implies that Match will continue to report robust subscriber, revenue, and profit growth for the foreseeable future.But robust here needs an asterisk. Subscriber, revenue, and profit growth growth were all in the low to mid teens range last quarter. Going forward, analysts project this as a mid teens profit grower. MTCH stock trades at 40-times forward earnings. That's a steep multiple for 15% profit growth. The info tech space broadly trades at half that multiple for roughly the same long term profit growth rate.  * 5 EV Stocks to Buy for Big Gains Over the Next Decade Consequently, MTCH stock -- while supported by secular growth tailwinds -- seems to be overly inflated here by low rates. Stocks Being Inflated By Low Rates: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)YTD Gain: 71%Forward P/E Multiple: 57Long Term Projected EPS Growth Rate: ~20%Year-to-date, Mexican fast casual eatery Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has been one of the S&P 500's top stocks, rising more than 70% through the first six months of 2019. The catalyst behind the rally has been acceleration of Chipotle's operational recovery. Expansion of the digital business, new menu additions and aggressive health-oriented marketing have driven Chipotle's recovery into the next-gear, with comps and margins flying higher. Investors keep buying into this recovery narrative, and Chipotle stock keeps moving higher.But the valuation on CMG stock now makes no sense, unless interest rates remain depressed forever. CMG stock trades at nearly 60-times forward earnings, roughly three times the projected long term EPS growth rate of 20%. Realistically, I actually think Chipotle can do better than 20% EPS growth, and think EPS can land around $40 by 2025 (nearly 25% annualized growth). But based on a restaurant average 27 forward multiple and 10% discount rate, $40 EPS by 2025 supports a 2019 price target for CMG stock of just $670.Chipotle stock trades hands today north of $700. Thus, this stock appears to be overly inflated by presently low interest rates. Stocks Being Inflated By Low Rates: Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 38%Forward P/E Multiple: 32Long Term Projected EPS Growth Rate: ~15%Shares of coffee retail giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have rallied 38% in 2019, nearly double the return of the S&P 500, as investors have grown more optimistic regarding the company's long term growth trajectory in China and as operations domestically have shown signs of improving.But traffic trends in the U.S. are still negative, competition is still ramping, traffic trends everywhere else are slowing, overall comparable sales growth is slowing from its multi-year trend, margins aren't moving higher, and -- despite all that -- SBUX stock now trades at its biggest forward earnings multiple (32) since 2015, when the company's internal growth rates were much higher.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Indeed, 32-times forward earnings seems like a steep price to pay for low to mid single digit comparable sales growth, mid to high single digit revenue growth, flattish margins and mid teens profit growth. As such, it is reasonable to say that the current valuation underlying SBUX stock is sustainable if and only if interest rates remain low. As soon as they move higher, the multiple will compress and the stock will drop. Stocks Being Inflated By Low Rates: Under Armour (UAA)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 49%Forward P/E Multiple: 77Long Term Projected EPS Growth Rate: ~30%Athletic apparel company Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) has been one of the market's hottest stocks in 2019, rising nearly 50% through the first six months of 2019 as athletic apparel demand trends have remained favorable, and Under Armour's growth and margin trends have improved against the backdrop of falling inventory (which is usually a solid leading indicator in the retail space).But UAA stock now trades at nearly 80-times forward earnings. Sales growth last quarter was 3%. The quarter before that it was 3%. Sure, margins are moving higher here, and top-line growth rates may improve as Under Armour pushes a more relevant product line-up over the next few quarters. Still, at best, this is a 20-30% profit grower over the next few years. Extrapolating that out, Under Armour will probably wind up with around $1.50 in EPS by fiscal 2025. Based on a long term average Nike-type forward multiple of 25 and a 10% discount rate, that equates to a 2019 price target for UAA stock of $23.Under Armour stock presently trades hands around $26. Thus, the current valuation seems overly inflated by low rates. Stocks Being Inflated By Low Rates: Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 35%Forward P/E Multiple: 34Long Term Projected EPS Growth Rate: ~10%Shares of warehouse retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) have marched higher in 2019, to the tune of a 35% year-to-date gain, as the company has benefited from continued strong domestic consumer spending trends, especially in the discount segment, and as low rates have helped support multiple expansion in COST stock.At the present moment, both of those tailwinds will continue. Consumer economic fundamentals remain healthy, characterized by low unemployment, big wage gains, low consumer debt levels, and good credit. Meanwhile, rates project to remain low for the foreseeable future, as the Fed has embraced a rate cut mentality. The combination of those two dynamics should allow COST stock to keep moving higher.  * 3 Breakout Stocks to Buy But it's also worth noting that the stock is trading at a decade high valuation despite the growth profile remaining largely unchanged. That dynamic is sustainable only if rates remain low. As soon as they start creeping higher, COST stock could feel some pressure. Stocks Being Inflated By Low Rates: Wingstop (WING)YTD Gain: 48%Forward P/E Multiple: 130Long Term Projected EPS Growth Rate: ~20%One of the hottest stocks in the market both this year and over the past several years has been chicken wing restaurant operator Wingstop (NYSE:WING). Year-to-date, WING stock is up nearly 50%. Over the past three years, the stock is up 270%. The big rally can be attributed to Wingstop's consistently positive comparable sales growth trajectory, which has coupled with huge unit growth rates and healthy margin expansion to produce second-to-none profit growth in the restaurant industry.But despite the company's strong growth track record, promising future growth potential, and tasty chicken wings, valuation is a serious issue for WING stock. The stock trades at 130-times forward earnings. That's is the most expensive multiple I have ever seen in the restaurant category. Further, Wingstop isn't growing that fast. Revenue rose 16% last quarter, and EBITDA rose 11%. Those are tiny growth rates next to a triple digit forward earnings multiple.As such, it is very reasonable to say that WING stock's present valuation is being overly inflated by low rates. Once rates start creeping up, WING stock will likely drop in a big way.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB.

2019-07-15,"Retail stocks have been a tough trade in 2019. While the S&P 500 is up nearly 20% year-to-date, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) is up just 3%, as retail stocks have been weighed by sluggish consumer spending in early 2019 and overarching trade conflicts. The sum of those headwinds has weighed on revenues and margins, and profit growth rates in the consumer discretionary sector actually dropped into negative territory in the first quarter of 2019, while S&P 500 earnings rose 4%.But, Goldman Sachs thinks things are about to get a whole lot better for a whole lot of retail stocks.The thesis?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoldman Sachs believes that: 1) the macro consumer economic environment is improving, supported by low unemployment and strong wage gains, and that such improvement will re-accelerate retail revenue growth rates; 2) trade issues are being overblown in the near term and have a chance to cool off in the medium to long term; and 3) after years of investing into their e-commerce operations, big box retailers are ready to reap the operating income growth rewards of those investments.  * 10 Stocks Driving the Market to All-Time Highs (And Why) Owing to these three core beliefs, Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating on several retail stocks. Which stocks made the cut? And will those stocks actually outperform from here? Let's take a closer look at nine retail stocks that Goldman thinks are ready to rally. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The Bull Thesis: Goldman's top pick is Target (NYSE:TGT), and the thesis here is pretty straight-forward. Target has invested big into its e-commerce and omni-channel business over the past few years. Now, the company's e-commerce business is the fastest growing online retail business among big name retailers, and Target's comparable sales growth has also been among the best in the business over the past few quarters. Thus, these investments are paying off in the form of supercharged top-line growth. Over the next few quarters, the cost base from these investments will start to moderate, too, and supercharged revenue growth will be accompanied by supercharged profit growth. That profit growth will converge on a reasonable valuation (14-times forward earnings) to spark a nice rally in TGT stock.Does It Hold Water? Yes. TGT stock is one of my favorite retail stocks for the foreseeable future, too, because this company is firing on all cylinders, continues to be relentlessly innovative, has big profit growth potential in the medium term, and continues to trade at a relatively discounted valuation. That combination ultimately implies that Target stock has runway to move higher over the next few quarters. Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock The Bull Thesis: Another big box retailer that Goldman is bullish on is Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Much like Target, the bull thesis on COST stock is pretty straightforward, too. With Costco, you have the offline version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has leveraged low price appeal to create a huge base of loyal Costco members that shop at Costco often and in heavy volume. That loyal membership base will continue to power healthy results for the retailer for the foreseeable future, so long as consumer economic conditions remain favorable. If they do, those healthy results will in turn continue to drive COST stock higher.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Does It Hold Water? Yes. But, with one important catch: valuation. Unlike other retail stocks on this list, COST stock isn't dirt cheap. Instead, it's the opposite of dirt cheap. It's an expensive stock, at 34-times forward earnings for what projects as a 10% profit grower over the next several years. That isn't a terribly attractive combination, so in the the near term, valuation friction may limit further gains in COST stock. Walmart (WMT)Source: Shutterstock The Bull Thesis: Goldman is also bullish on the 800 pound gorilla in the retail world: Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The Walmart thesis is very similar to the Target thesis. Walmart has aggressively reinvented itself over the past several years as an omni-channel retailer with a red-hot e-commerce business, enhanced in-store presentations and multiple omni-channel capabilities like &quot;buy online, pick up in store&quot;. This reinvention has powered decade-best comparable sales and traffic growth at Walmart over the past few quarters. But, this reinvention has also been expensive, and weighed on margins. Going forward, the cost base from these investments should moderate, and robust profit growth should come back into the picture. As it does, WMT stock should trend higher.Does It Hold Water? Yes. Much like TGT stock, WMT stock will head higher over the next few quarters as robust revenue growth and margin improvement will converge on a still reasonable valuation (23-times forward earnings) to drive share price out-performance. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock The Bull Thesis: In the home improvement space, Goldman is bullish on shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Home improvement market fundamentals are favorable, driven by low rates, low unemployment, strong wage gains and good credit. Home Depot is the leader in this market, and has been for some time. As such, as home improvement spend increases over the next few quarters, Home Depot's growth rates should move higher. As those growth rates move higher, HD stock should trend higher, too.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy Does It Hold Water? Yes. The valuation supporting HD stock remains reasonable, as the stock trades at just 21-times forward earnings for what projects as roughly 10% profit growth over the next several years. That favorable valuation, coupled with favorable market fundamentals and continued strong numbers, will keep HD stock on a healthy uptrend for the foreseeable future. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)The Bull Thesis: Goldman likes home improvement retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), too, for the same reasons they like Home Depot. The home improvement market is supported by strong fundamentals at the current moment. Over the next few quarters, those strong fundamentals should drive higher home improvement spend. Some of that spend will land at Home Depot. Some of it will land at Lowe's. As such, Lowe's growth trend should improve into the back half of 2019. As it does, LOW stock should move higher.Does It Hold Water? Yes. LOW stock was unfairly beaten up in May on margin concerns in its Q1 earnings report. But, those margin headwinds are ephemeral, and should ease going forward. As they do, that easing will couple with strong top-line momentum (Lowe's also reported its best comp in recent memory last quarter) to produce robust profit growth. Simultaneously, LOW stock trades at a discount relative to HD stock (19-times forward earnings for LOW, versus 21-times for HD). This relative discount plus strong profit growth should equal big returns for LOW stock in the back half of 2019. BJ's (BJ)Source: Shutterstock The Bull Thesis: In the smaller cap retail world, Goldman is bullish on BJ's (NYSE:BJ). The bull thesis on BJ stock rests on two things. First, the macro consumer economic environment is improving, and supports strong consumer spend in the back half of 2019. Second, BJ's is a wholesale club retailer, and the club model of leveraging low price appeal to create a loyal membership base (from which you generate substantial revenue) is a winning model -- see Amazon and Costco. Thus, BJ's has a winning strategy in a market gaining momentum, and that implies healthy growth potential for BJ stock going forward.  * 7 Companies Apple Should Consider Buying Does It Hold Water? Yes. BJ's is basically like a mini-Costco with an East Coast focus and very low prices, meaning that this warehouse retailer has cut out a sustainable niche for itself in the discounted retail segment. Further, BJ stock trades at just 15-times forward earnings (versus a 34-times forward multiple for COST), so there's substantial room for multiple expansion here in the event that BJ's continues to report healthy numbers (which it should). O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)Source: JJBers via Flickr (modified)The Bull Thesis: Goldman also has a buy rating on O'Reilly Automotive (NYSE:ORLY). O'Reilly Automotive is an auto parts retailer which has grown revenues at a fairly steady mid-single-digit rate for the past several years, during which the auto parts market in the U.S. has grown at a low-single-digit rate. Because of this track record of above-market growth, Goldman likes ORLY stock in the back half of 2019, when the auto parts segment should benefit from increased demand as rates drop and the auto market rebounds.Does It Hold Water? Yes. So long as the U.S. consumer economy remains healthy and stable (as it projects to for the foreseeable future), then you can count on O'Reilly to deliver stable mid-single-digit revenue growth alongside gradual margin expansion. That combination on top of a 22-times forward multiple should produce healthy returns in ORLY stock going forward, especially with depressed interest rates broadly inflating equity valuations. Tractor Supply (TSCO)The Bull Thesis: Back to the home improvement world, Goldman also likes home improvement and agricultural goods retailer Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO). The bull thesis on TSCO is simple. Macro conditions in the home improvement and agriculture markets are favorable, and Tractor Supply's retail locations are largely rural and insulated from being disrupted by the big-box same-day-delivery push. This insulation coupled with favorable market conditions should drive sustained healthy profit growth over the next few years, and keep TSCO stock on a winning path.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for Less Than Book Does It Hold Water? Yes. The valuation on TSCO stock, while not cheap, is certainly reasonable, at 23-times forward earnings for what projects as double-digit profit growth (comprised of mid-single-digit revenue growth and gradual margin expansion). So long as interest rates remain low, this combination of a ~20 forward multiple and ~10% profit growth should work for TSCO stock. Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrThe Bull Thesis: Tariff concerns have been a huge headache for Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), but Goldman thinks that the kitchenware and home furnishings retailer is ready to bounce back. Trade tensions are cooling, and with a truce on new tariffs between the two countries, it seems the worst of the trade war damage has already been inflicted. Going forward, the numbers here should get better, especially as buying conditions in the U.S. improve, too. This improvement should drive a nice rebound in WSM stock.Does It Hold Water? Yes. Of all the retail stocks on this list, WSM is among one of the cheapest, at just 13-times forward earnings. To be sure, that's because revenue growth and profit growth are relatively muted here (WSM projects as a mid single-digit profit grower). But, that growth trajectory could inflect higher as trade issues become old news. In the event that happens, sentiment will improve, and WSM stock will benefit from substantial multiple expansion.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TGT, AMZN, WMT, HD and LOW.

The data suggest shoppers want to snatch up discounted gadgets and appliances without making a long-term commitment to the world’s biggest online retailer.“If Amazon is hoping to use Prime Day as a way to sign up and retain new Prime members, they might need to rethink their retention plan,” Captify said in a statement. “According to search, consumers are signing up for Prime, getting their deals and then canceling membership shortly after.”Shoppers are projected to spend $5.8 billion on Amazon over the two days, according to an estimate from Coresight Research. The e-commerce giant launched Prime Day in 2015 as a way to lure new Prime members, who pay fees in exchange for shipping discounts and other perks like video streaming.Analysts estimate Amazon’s Prime member retention rate is more than 90%, better than Costco Wholesale Corp. The Seattle-based company has used a variety of tactics to try to find additional subscribers. For example, Amazon offers monthly memberships to attract those who don’t want to join for a year.The average Prime member spends $1,400 a year on Amazon, more than double the $600 spent by shoppers who aren’t Prime members, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The firm estimates Amazon has 103 million Prime members in the U.S.Captify based its estimate on searches by 2.2 billion global consumers using computers, voice-activated devices and smartphone apps. The search metrics include sites like Reddit and deal hunting websites that have discussion forums where shoppers swap knowledge about the best prices, said Rohaan Dullabhai, a senior insight strategist at Captify.Searches for Best Buy Co. were up 255% from the day before Prime Day, while Walmart Inc. queries climbed 130% and EBay Inc. searches rose 72%. That suggests shoppers are bouncing from one site to another in search of the best deal before subscribing to Amazon Prime, he said.&quot;Consumers are becoming more and more savvy,&quot; Dullabhai said. &quot;They are going to the discussion forums to find the best deals and taking advantage of all of these retailers competing with one another.&quot;(Updates with search information about retailers in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Searches for ‘Canceling Amazon Prime’ Spike on Prime Day
2019-07-16,Today I will take a look at Costco Wholesale Corporation's (NASDAQ:COST) most recent earnings update (12 May 2019) and...,Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST): Has Recent Earnings Growth Beaten Long-Term Trend?
2019-07-16,"We hear so much about online retail that it’s easy to lose sight of some important facts: brick-and-mortar stores aren’t going to disappear completely. Customers still like to walk inside, pick up the floor model, or watch a real-life demonstration. While online retail offers convenience, brick-and-mortar offers experience.In 2018, physical retailers brought in $714 billion in sales, a 3.2% increase from 2017, compared to $679 billion in annual online retailer sales. Online’s faster growth rate, 9.6% from 2017, shows that it will soon take the lead, but brick-and-mortar’s sheer size makes a strong case for permanence.Three major big-box style retailers have recently gotten the thumbs-up from Goldman Sachs. Let’s unpack the TipRanks data, and find out why. Costco Corporation (COST)Costco has taken the club-model big-box warehouse store to its greatest success. The retailer has over 100 million members, with a 90% resubscription rate. While club membership is required to shop, Costco has benefits from high levels of repeat visits and bulk purchases; its membership shops frequently and buys a lot. The warehouse-floor layout of the stores helps keep down overhead and stocking costs, while offering high volume keeps prices down for customers.This successful model, in a colorful comparison by five-star financial blogger Luke Lango, has created an “offline version of Amazon (AMZN)… [The] loyal membership base will continue to power healthy results for the retailer for the foreseeable future…” Those results have pushed COST shares well above their average price target, prompting top analysts to reevaluate the stock in the past week.Goldman’s five-star analyst Kate McShane initiated her coverage on COST on July 11 with a buy rating and price target of $290, saying, “The club model continues to have some of the best attributes within retail.” Her target suggests a 3.36% upside to the stock’s current price; at the time she set it, the upside was almost 5%.COST has been on an upward surge as the analysts have been raising their price target on the stock. To give two examples, Loop Capital’s Laura Champine bumped her target to $300 “after [COST’s] June comps data and the encouraging sequential improvement in traffic growth in May…” while Baird’s Peter Benedict set a $290 target, saying, “[COST] is a growth staple as management continues to boost its competitive position.”Costco’s analyst consensus rating is a moderate buy, based on 9 buys and 5 holds assigned in the last three months. As mentioned above, the stock’s share price has powered through the average price target in recent trading sessions. Market analysts have begun setting new targets in the $290 to $300 range, but the average remains at $269. A $290 target will give the stock a 3.36% upside.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the full list of Analyst Ratings Target Corporation (TGT)Goldman gives its best rating to Target, adding the stock to its Americas Conviction buy list. Target has been posting excellent comp sales growth in recent quarters, along with fast growth of the store’s online segment. Looking forward, Target’s upfront costs on store improvements and online initiatives will start to drop in the next few quarters, giving the company an additional boost to the bottom line.This is the background that sparked McShane’s interest in the stock, getting her to start coverage with a $102 price target. In her research note, she says, “Target is starting to benefit meaningfully from door closures, and an inflection in operating income growth should drive accelerating earnings growth.” Her price target suggests an upside of 17.5%.McShane is not the only analyst taking a favorable view of Target. After the Q1 earnings, JPMorgan’s Christopher Horvers set a $100 price target and buy rating on the stock, saying, “Target’s 4.8% comps is one of the best so far in large cap retail’s first-quarter.” Horver’s target implies a 15% upside potential for TGT.Target maintains a moderate buy from the analyst consensus, based on 6 buys and 7 holds. Shares are selling for $86.80, so the average price target of $89.18 indicates a modest 2.74% upside potential.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the full list of Analyst Ratings Walmart, Inc. (WMT)Sam Walton’s retail giant has been having a good year. WMT stock is up 23% year-to-date, a solid performance built on a foundation similar to Target’s. Walmart has been streamlining in-store operations, improving reshelving and stocking times along with face-to-face customer service. The store improvements have gone hand-in-hand with an e-commerce initiative. In a creative twist, Walmart leveraged its existing network of stores to cut delivery costs from the online end – customers can purchase online, and pick-up at the store. It’s a viable and convenient option, given that almost everyone in America lives within 10 miles of a Walmart location.The company’s self-reinvention prompted McShane to note WMT’s improved same-store comp sales and traffic growth. As with Target, she also noted that the company faced front-loaded expenses when implementing the changes, but as those expenses moderate profits will improve. She believes WMT stock will continue its upward trend, and sets a $123 price target as she initiates coverage. Her target shows confidence in a 7% upside.Walmart has been attracting positive analyst attention for the past month and more. On June 24, KeyBanc’s Edward Yruma noted Walmart’s acquisition of the PhonePe P2P money transfer app, and specifically pointed out a potential $14 billion valuation in the medium term. He raised his price target by 4%, to $125, and reiterated his “continued confidence in WMT’s ability to innovate.” His price target indicates an upside of 8.7%.Overall, WMT gets another moderate buy from the analyst consensus, based on 9 buys, 2 holds, and 1 sell rating. The stock’s average price target of $115.33 gives a mere 0.3% upside to the current price of $114.98, but with analysts improving their ratings and raising targets, that upside may increase in coming weeks.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the full list of Analyst RatingsThe retailers detailed here fall into two patterns for success: the warehouse membership model, and the traditional retail model with improvements. Both are viable paths to corporate success and returns for investors.Visit TipRanks’ Top Analysts page, to learn more about Wall Street’s best market watchers.",Goldman Sachs: 3 Big Box Retailers Primed for Gains

We like to avoid holding trades through a company's earnings report to limit our risks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, we recommended a trade on COST for similar reasons. COST, like most retail stocks, reports much later in earnings season.In the time since we recommended a put write on COST, the stock has risen to just above $280. We were able to buy back our COST August 2nd $267.50 put writes and lock in our profits.Now, we're looking to collect even more income from COST. Consumers are Strong Despite Trade WarDespite some softness in the economy, the U.S. consumer is still looking very solid. We want to maintain exposure to retail stocks through COST because it's been performing so well. We may start to look at other consumer stocks in the short term.COST has noted in the past that the trade conflict with China will lead to higher prices. And now that tensions are escalating again, that could affect the COST's share price.Higher prices would theoretically lead to lower sales. Eventually, that would cut into COST's profits.However, when we look at the technical picture, we're fairly optimistic. COST and other big retailers like Walmart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) might be big enough to escape this situation relatively unaffected.  New All-Time HighCOST broke above resistance at $270 last week, and this week, it set a new all-time high at $281.37. The stock started to turn around yesterday, and it may be encountering some resistance. As it comes back down, we'll want to look for signs of support.Daily Chart of Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) -- Chart Source: TradingViewCOST won't report earnings until October, which means we can safely sell options that expire in August without risk of holding through earnings.The $270 level may act as support, but it's also possible options with a strike at that level won't provide much premium. We don't expect much of a pullback from COST, so a put write with a strike at $275, between support and resistance, seems like the best way to generate income without taking on too much risk.To find out which COST puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

2019-07-24,"Second quarter earnings are coming in above expectations. Nearly 80% of S&P listed companies reporting EPS above their estimates, but that may have as much to do with a lowered bar as real growth. Only 28% of reporting companies have beaten their targets on revenue growth, an ominous sign for the US economy as a whole.At the same time, there are still stocks offering high returns, even in this climate. We’ve found three that have beaten the S&P 500’s year-to-date growth of 19.9%, and are showing potential for further gains. The reasons vary for their upbeat forecasts; here, we take a closer look at each stock’s current position and check in to see what the Wall Street analysts have to say. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)Cisco occupies a business niche that is almost guaranteed to generate high profits: it is the premier supplier of computer networking hardware. It has also shown 33.2% share price growth year-to-date, well ahead of the S&P 500. On August 14, Cisco will report earnings for its fiscal Q4 as well as is FY2019. EPS is expected at 75 cents, 15% higher than last year’s Q4 and 5.6% higher than Q3. In the past four quarters, CSCO has averaged a positive earnings surprise of 2.96%.The company’s profitability underlies its strong buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is derived from 15 buys and 5 holds assigned in the past three months. CSCO’s $59 average price target represents a modest 3.2% upside from the current share price of $57, but as we’ll see below, there may be room for further growth.Cisco has been making good use of its profits. Earlier this month, Cisco management finalized a $2.6 billion agreement to purchase Acacia Communications (ACIA). Cisco will pay $70 per share for Acacia, and in return will bring Acacia’s high-speed digital signal processing technologies into Cisco’s product line.Writing after the Acacia acquisition was announced, Merrill Lynch analyst Tal Liani said, “…the deal will expand Cisco's switches and routers through adding new use cases and target markets.” Liani set a price target of $62, suggesting an upside of 7.4%Liani was not the only analyst to voice approval of the acquisition. JPMorgan’s Samik Chatterjee said that the Acacia purchase “presents a very strong strategic rationale in expanding and strengthening Cisco's core optical portfolio.” He rates Cisco a buy, with a $60 price target. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)Costco is the popular membership-only warehouse club store that has created what financial blogger Luke Lango describes as “an offline version of Amazon (AMZN).” The retailer builds on the loyalty of its 100 million strong member base, rewarding customers with bulk deals on staple goods and competitive pricing on most everything else, and getting in return a 90% resubscription rate and customers with a habit of shopping frequently and buying a lot in every visit. It’s a successful model, and in Lango’s words, “will continue to power healthy results for the retailer for the foreseeable future.” Those results are clear from COST’s 37.5% gain in share price this year.One side effect of Costco’s rapid price increase is that the stock actually shows a net downside right now, compared to the average price target. Shares are selling for $280; the average analyst price target is $275. Recent reviews, and price target revisions, suggest that Wall Street is reevaluating COST’s potential.Typical of the new ratings is Kate McShane’s buy. The Goldman Sachs analyst opened new coverage of COST on July 11, describing its club model as offering “the best attributes within retail.” She set a $290, price target, giving the stock a 3.5% upside from today’s price.In the past week, two additional analysts have raised their existing targets for the stock. Robert Ohmes, of Merrill Lynch, pointed out continued consumer spending growth at Costco, especially among lower income customers. Based on increased consumer spending, Ohmes set a $310 price target for COST, suggesting a 10.6% upside. And writing from Raymond James, Budd Bugatch stands by his earlier comments on Costco – back in June, he said, “[E]ven though the stock’s valuation has increased, there is still a pathway for further upside, earnings growth and market share gains through U.S. and international club openings over the next several years.” His revised target of $300 indicates a 7% upside for COST shares.Costco is currently in the middle of its fiscal Q4, historically its best quarter for earnings. The company will report on October 3, and is expected to show EPS of $2.52. This is 6.8% higher than last year’s Q4.  Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN)Of the stocks in this article, Axon has shown the highest growth – an eye-catching 51.3% year-to-date, well above all three major stock market indexes. It’s no wonder that the company has been growing; its flagship product is the Taser less-than-lethal electric weapon, for both law enforcement and personal defense use, and subsidiary products include a line of body cameras marketed to police agencies. In today’s highly charged social/political environment, these devices are in high demand. As a result, Axon has seen revenue grow in every quarter since 2012 – a record any company would envy. At the same time, however, quarterly EPS has been erratic. Heading to the company’s August 6 fiscal Q2 report, earnings are expected at 6 cents per share, down from both last quarter and the year-ago quarter. This is while the company’s Q1 report raised full-year revenue guidance to $495 million.Axon has not been without controversy. During the company’s lifetime, it has dealt with numerous patent litigation matters, along with royalty and penalty issues. In the most recent such case, a patent suit by competitor Digital Ally was dismissed in a US Court of Appeals. After the decision, Needham analyst Scott Berg restated his buy rating on the stock, and set a price target of $80. He said, “Although we expect Digital Ally will appeal this decision, our industry work suggests a patent decision at this level is difficult to overturn. We believe any future impact to Axon of an appeal for this judgment would likely be limited to additional legal costs versus the potential for a large penalty and royalty payments.” His price target suggests an upside of 20%.Also last month, JPMorgan’s Mark Strouse raised his price target by 11%, to $81, on strong estimates for fiscal year 2021. He notes, “[We] expect the company's revenue growth to remain elevated through fiscal 2021 and for margins to continue to expand, consistent with management's long-term targets.” Regarding product and marketing expansion, Strouse added, “[We] believe AB3's live-streaming LTE capability could allow Axon to penetrate adjacent markets such as EMS and fire departments.” Strouse’s $81 target indicates a 22% upside to the stock.Axon holds a moderate buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 5 buys and 2 holds given it in the past three months. The stock’s current share price of $66 and average price target of $74 suggest room for an 11% upside.",3 Growing Stocks Beating the S&P 500

Stocks to Buy: PepsiCo (PEP)Source: Shutterstock It might be a stretch to say that PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) saves its customers money. However, with the company's recent December 2018 acquisition of Sodastream, it not only saves its customers both money and time, but it also saves the planet. Pepsi paid $3.2 billion for the at-home sparkling water brand that helps consumers turn boring old tap water into exciting carbonated beverages. Pepsi captures the at-home market while its customers spend less time at the grocery store, pay less for their non-alcoholic beverages, and reduce the amount of plastic put back into the environment. &quot;With its customizable options, SodaStream empowers consumers to personalize their preferred beverage in an environmentally friendly way and provides PepsiCo with a significant presence in the at-home marketplace,&quot; stated CEO Ramon Laguarta. &quot;I'm confident we can accelerate progress on our shared goal of curbing plastic waste and building a more sustainable future.&quot;It's a win-win. Since Pepsi closed its Sodastream acquisition on December 5, PEP stock is up 11.2%.  Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock The most tangible proof I have that Costco (NASDAQ:COST) saves you money is the property and casualty insurance I got in February 2018 when my wife and I moved to Halifax from Toronto. The company's insurance partner saved us a significant chunk of money, although it's fair to say that some of those savings came from being in a smaller city with lower odds of accident or theft.Nonetheless, because a majority of Costco's profits are from its annual memberships and not the profit margins on the products it sells, the company works feverishly to pass these savings on to its customers. If Costco can get a great deal on orange juice one month, it doesn't take the additional gross profits. Instead, it lowers the retail price in its stores, passing the savings on to the consumer. By ensuring that you're saving money on the items you often buy at the grocery store, Costco will be able to continue raising its annual membership fees without upsetting the customer too much.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund I don't think Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) can say the same thing after price increases sent its stock price down by double digits July 18.

Anything that can save me time, aggravation, and possibly money is worth using.In Intuit's Q3 2019 report ended April 30, QuickBooks generated $887 million in revenue, 18.7% higher than a year earlier. Although it was only 27% of Intuit's overall sales in the third quarter, its growth rate was much higher than its consumer segment (Turbo Tax, Mint) growth rate of 10.3% in the quarter. I use Turbo Tax and am considering QuickBooks in the future for the simple reason that these products save me time, money, and aggravation. It's a stock to buy. Stocks to Buy: GrubHub (GRUB)Food delivery services such as GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and Uber Eats may do nothing for consumers except put restaurants out of business. That's a negative take on food delivery companies based on the recent news that GrubHub has been charging restaurants for phone calls -- between $5 and $9 a call -- that didn't result in food orders. I told my wife this piece of news and she quite rightly said, &quot;How do restaurants stay in business with those kinds of fees?&quot; A more positive view of GrubHub is that it saves busy people time by not having to go out for food or cook after a long day at work. How much money it saves is another question altogether.There are plenty of sites that discuss how to save money using GrubHub promo codes. One of them is Gigworker.com, a site dedicated to the gig economy. It provides ways to take advantage of these promo codes to save money on your orders through the food delivery service. However, because there are delivery fees with most orders placed through GrubHub, I would suggest that some of the savings from promos are lost through delivery fees and tip.   * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season At the end of the day, GrubHub is designed to save you time, while making restaurants money. H&R Block (HRB)Although H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) stock has seen better days -- its all-time high of $37.53 was reached in November 2015 -- there's no denying that the tax preparation company continues to file a lot of America's tax returns. H&R Block prepared 23.6 million tax returns worldwide in fiscal 2019, 1.2% more than a year earlier, generating $3.1 billion in revenue and $616 million in operating profits. Here in the U.S., the number of tax returns prepared by HRB increased by 1.5% while the number of U.S. DIY (Do-it-Yourself) returns increased by 5.9%. DIY tax returns accounted for 39% of H&R Block's tax returns prepared in the U.S., up from 38% a year earlier. The reason HRB is a stock to buy?On July 1, H&R Block announced that it acquired Toronto-based fintech company Wave Financial for $405 million. Wave helps entrepreneurs better manage the financial aspects of their business, including invoicing, payroll, and accounting.Given Intuit's push into the small business marketplace, Wave gives HRB a competitive product to win business away from the maker of QuickBooks. Long-term, the Wave acquisition could be looked upon as a transformational move that takes HRB to the next level. As a result of Wave, HRB now provides a good risk/reward profile.    Amazon (AMZN)Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, along with all the other e-commerce services Jeff Bezos and company provide, take a toll on the environment. It's estimated that Amazon emitted 19 million metric tons of carbon in 2017, the equivalent of five coal-fired power plants. There is no question, however, that consumers can save money and time using the company's products and services. My wife's cousin is a consultant in the small Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. Thanks to Amazon Prime, she's able to spend far less time driving into town to pick up stuff for the household. As someone who doesn't make money unless I'm working, I understand the desire to cut out these time drains. Time is money as they say. So, if you feel bad about the impact your purchases are making on the world at large, take some of the money you'll make from AMZN stock and donate it to an environmental cause like Greenpeace.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Now, if Amazon could figure out how to eliminate its carbon footprint drain, the stock would go to $5,000 in no time, which would be a win-win.  BlackRock (BLK)Source: Shutterstock Keep it simple, stupid. The KISS principle definitely applies to asset managers like BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) iShares and Vanguard, who have captured a big chunk of the retail investor's assets in the U.S. and other places in the world by providing ETFs; an inexpensive investment that captures large swaths of different sectors, countries, market caps, etc. Not only do passively-managed ETFs save investors time and money from traditional active investing, but they also provide a diversified portfolio of stocks that deliver healthy returns over the long haul. To make things even simpler, iShares have several asset allocation EFT fund-of-funds that save investors time and money. Take the iShares Core Growth Allocation ETF (NYSEARCA:AOR). It invests in seven different iShares ETFs that give investors a diversified core portfolio charging just 0.25% annually.  The seven ETFs give you a 60/40 allocation between equities and fixed-income investments, with 60% of the assets in U.S-domiciled investments with the remaining 40% outside the U.S., including both developed and emerging markets.Sure, it doesn't have any alternative investments, but by keeping it simple, BlackRock's saving you time and money. It's a stock to buy.Oh, and a $10,000 investment a decade ago, is worth almost $24,000 today.

2019-07-29,"With stocks continuing to court record highs and a dovish Federal Reserve meeting expected on the horizon, the backdrop continues to favor a bullish bias. In today's gallery, we're going to offer up three breakout stocks to buy.Source: Shutterstock They all boast several attractive technical characteristics.First and foremost is the price trend, which is zooming to the moon. Second is relative strength with market-beating returns so far this year … third is a recent basing pattern that provides low-risk entries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTogether, these factors combine to present some exciting trading opportunities for the week ahead. As usual, we'll offer up specific trade ideas for each pattern.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold Let's take a closer look at three stocks to buy. Adobe (ADBE)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim The long-term trend of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) belongs in a class of its own. It's up ten-fold since 2012, and short of one hiccup in the fourth quarter 2018, it has seen virtually zero giveback along the way. To deliver such gains over seven years is inspiring. But to do it with almost no corrections or nasty volatility along the way?It's the ultimate gift from the market gods.There's no doubt Adobe has been one of the best stocks to buy of this bull market. During this year's ascent, we've seen a modest amount of chop along the way, but each pausing period has ultimately paved the way for higher prices. I see no reason why the past month's high base won't end similarly.Look for a breakout over $313 resistance, then deploy bullish trades. With implied volatility in the tank and ADBE stock's hefty price tag, I like bull call spreads. Buy the Oct $310/$320 bull call spread for around $4.75. Costco (COST)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Costco (NASDAQ:COST) finds itself in a similar position. While its multi-year gains haven't been as jaw-dropping as ADBE, Costco has still been a fantastic stock to buy.The past two years have seen a surge in upside momentum signaling the uptrend is on strong footing. From a charting perspective, this year's trend has seen multiple bases and upside breakouts. Each has seen solid follow through, providing ample opportunity for breakout traders seeking stocks to buy.Currently, COST stock has built a two-week consolidation zone near $280. With the 20-day moving average fast approaching, the time is nigh for an upside pop. Watch for a breach of $284.31, then enter bullish plays. Like Adobe, the cheap implied volatility and the expensive price tag of Costco make it a good candidate for call spreads.  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right Buy the Oct $280/$290 bull call spread for around $4.75. Okta (OKTA)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the more speculative pick of the bunch. Since its 2017 IPO, the San Francisco-based software company has been a favorite among momentum traders. One glance at its price chart reveals all you need to know. Since opening at $23.56, OKTA stock has risen 474%This year OKTA is on pace for another barn burner. Its year-to-date gains have already eclipsed 110%. The best way to play it has been buying breakouts along the way. We've seen many bases deliver powerful upside runs. The current three-week consolidation zone presents another alluring setup.Today's drop suggests the stock may need some more time before an upside break transpires. Watch for a rise above $141.85, then enter bullish trades. The liquidity in its options is so-so, at best, so be sure to use limit orders. Buying the Nov $135/$145 bull call spread for around $4.60 if it breaks out is worth consideration.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Infobip, a Croatian technology company that counts Uber Technologies Inc. and Burger King among its clients, is weighing an initial public offering in New York as it makes plans to expand in the U.S.A public listing “is something that we are discussing at the moment,&quot; Silvio Kutic, co-founder and chief executive officer of Infobip, said in a phone interview. “We are constantly thinking, checking, when to go in this direction and maybe in the next few months, half a year, a year, there shall be a decision.&quot;The company provides corporations with technology to send notifications to customers through different channels, such as WhatsApp or text message. In March, the company said Uber is using its technology to mask contact details when drivers and riders communicate. The company’s customers also include Vodafone Group Plc, Costco Wholesale Corp. and Zendesk Inc.Founded in 2006, Infobip has some 1,750 employees who helped generated about 435 million euros ($485 million) in revenue in 2018, according to Kutic. Employees own 10% of the shares, with the rest shared among the company’s three founders.“We had about 30% annual revenue growth in the last two years and this year we are even accelerating,&quot; Kutic said. Demand for alerts from SMS phone messages are “still growing like crazy globally.&quot;The sector is highly fragmented. Infobip has strong domestic rivals in countries such as China and Brazil, but the largest is U.S.-focused Twilio Inc.Infobip is planning to take on San Francisco-based Twilio in its home market, where it sees most scope for growth. The company bolstered its presence in recent months in the U.S. by opening an office in New York, it’s second in the country, and after acquiring assets from Ericsson AB.“We are now preparing for our big push,” Kutic said. &quot;Today, about 35% of our revenue comes from U.S.-based customers, but these are the digital native companies from Silicon Valley, who operate with us internationally.&quot;The U.S. is also where Kutic, who owns the majority of the shares together with two other partners, would someday like to see his company trading.&quot;For IT companies, there is much more liquidity and better exposure&quot; on U.S. exchanges, he said. &quot;It would be the crown on our works.&quot;To contact the reporter on this story: Rodrigo Orihuela in Madrid at rorihuela@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Amy ThomsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Croatian Tech Firm That Makes Uber Calls Private Weighs U.S. IPO
2019-08-01,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in April 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]If you've been worrying about whether the boom already is over or when it will end, it might be time to start looking for some recession-proof stocks to buy to get you through the lean times. Even if you don't believe those times are not here yet, they very well soon could be.Consider this: The March 2009 low of the S&P 500 occurred more than ten years ago. Since 1945, the average economic expansion has lasted just under five years. This factor in itself should indicate the economy is currently in the late stages of the current economic expansion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 For this reason, investors should have a plan in place to invest in defensive stocks. While such a shift will likely bring the S&P 500 down, some investors become wealthier in such conditions.Contrary to popular belief, some stocks move higher during economic downturns as changing consumer habits create opportunity. These seven companies should prosper in such times.  Source: Shutterstock  Costco Wholesale (COST)Costco (NASDAQ:COST) offers much to consumers during hard economic times. With the need to save money, people will dine in more. They will often buy in bulk and will still prefer high-quality goods. All of these factors work in Costco's favor.Moreover, while other retailers have struggled, Costco's growth continues. Same-store sales increased by 5.5% during the fiscal third quarter of 2019. However, this number matters little to the bottom line. Due to its pricing, nearly all of Costco's profit comes from its memberships. Membership renewal rates have held at around 90% despite 2018's membership price increase.Further, with new locations opening and expansion into China underway, membership increases will continue.In 2017, the sentiment that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would take over retail hit Costco and other retailers hard. However Costco had a pretty good 2018 and the stock has seen steady growth.  Source: Baron Valium via Flickr Walt Disney (DIS)With millions facing unemployment or underemployment during downturns, people find themselves with more free time. This creates an opportunity for Disney (NYSE:DIS) to serve as one of the downturn stocks to buy as they provide low-cost entertainment.Many regard its content library as the best available. This coincides well with the coming launch of Disney's streaming service. Disney is offering a lower price than its peer Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). While many customers will get both services, those focused on access to the best content library at the lowest price will choose Disney.  * Missing copy for url 1. Please edit.  * Url 1 is an external link. Please edit.This along with ESPN, Marvel, Lucasfilm, the theme parks and Disney's other ventures continue to drive Disney's profits higher.With the affordable entertainment Disney will offer, the profit growth for DIS stock should remain robust regardless of how well the economy performs.  Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Dollar Tree (DLTR)Of all recession-proof stocks to buy, perhaps none define the category better than Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). As an extreme discounter, the store holds a continuous appeal to lower-income consumers and for those who want to keep spending to a minimum. During a downturn, this draw also attracts those who would regularly shop at higher-end stores during better times.However, even during these better times, DLTR stock has enjoyed average growth at about 16% per year over the last five years. Analysts believe growth will be about 7.5% per year on average for the next five years. This growth will help it to compete with peers such as Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Big Lots (NYSE:BIG).Now could be a great time to buy DLTR stock, whether a downturn comes tomorrow or two years from now. Both a downturn and its predicted growth could serve as catalysts to push the stock back to its high and perhaps beyond.The company operates over 14,800 stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces. At a market cap of only $24 billion, Dollar Tree stands as a large company that will enjoy steady growth in the years ahead regardless of how the overall economy performs.  Source: Shutterstock  Spirit Airlines (SAVE)Even during this booming economy, ultra-low-fare carrier Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE) has become the fastest-growing U.S. airline.Though airlines do not normally appear on lists of downturn stocks to buy, SAVE stock could buck that trend. For one, cash-strapped customers who might have flown a different airline when they felt wealthier, will turn to Spirit more often.Moreover, higher-end airlines would have to cut back service in more crowded airports. This could serve as an opportunity to take more market share at airports with little room to expand.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 The airline also continues its expansion in South America and has yet to tap the Canadian market. They are also looking at adding regional jet types to their fleet. They fly only certain types of Airbus aircraft currently. Adding a regional jet would allow them to expand to smaller domestic markets presently overlooked by discount carriers.Despite a temporary growth setback in 2017 from having to pay pilots more, analysts expect the fast growth pace to resume. The stock trades at a forward P/E of only about seven.Most expect Spirit to see the one of highest growth rates in the sector. With the ultra-low fares, high growth and the potential to expand, Spirit can prosper in almost any economic environment.  Source: Drew Stephens via Flickr Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) and its peers have faced challenges as consumers increasingly turn to craft beers. Others have turned to wine and spirits, or away from alcohol altogether.During the last recession, consumption of mainstream beers fell as consumers turned to craft beers. The company saw the writing on the wall. They set out to acquire multiple craft breweries in various regions of the country.Some, such as Blue Moon and Leinenkugel, sell nationally. Other brands, such as Hop Valley or Revolver, come closer to the &quot;microbrewery&quot; concept, selling only in select regions of the country. This leaves Molson Coors with a wide variety of products to sell to both the low-end consumers and those who want to enjoy a &quot;luxury&quot; craft brew as they drown their sorrows during a downturn.The trend toward cannabis legalization could also benefit TAP stock. Spirits producer Constellation (NYSE:STZ) bought a stake in Canadian weed company Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) last year. The Molson Coors deal with cannabis company Hexo could also bolster revenue and earnings, which would help TAP to prosper as one of the better downturn stocks to buy.The stock trades at a forward P/E of 12. TAP stock saw minimal profit growth over the previous five years. Still, analysts predict profit growth will come in at almost 7.7% per year on average for the next five years. A move into cannabis would likely increase that estimate. Whatever happens with the economy, investors will have what they need to relieve the pain available on TAP.  Source:  MayApps207 via WikiMedia  Teladoc (TDOC)Healthcare equities tend to function well as recession-proof stocks to buy. Even in a booming economy, the rising cost of healthcare has served as a source of worry for many Americans. However, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) appears ready to cut the cost of doctor visits.For $40, patients can receive a virtual visit from a doctor at any time via their PC or smartphone. This allows for treatment solutions at a lower cost without the wait.Analysts estimate over 400 million doctor visits per year, about one-third of the total, could take place on such a platform. Teladoc holds well over 50% of the market share in telehealth.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer The growth potential remains enormous regardless of how the economy performs. However, unemployed workers often drop health insurance during downturns. Thus, TDOC could provide quick, life-saving treatments to those who might not otherwise be able to afford a doctor.The company has invested heavily in improving diagnostics and taking this service outside the U.S. As a result, it has spent heavily, and profitability will not come in the foreseeable future. Also, with TDOC trading at more than nine times sales, it has become an expensive stock.However, revenue  has nearly doubled every year since 2013. With a majority of the market share, a $4.86 billion market cap and more than 99% of the potential market left to be addressed, TDOC stock should rise regardless of what happens to the economy.  Source:  Via T-Mobile T-Mobile (TMUS)T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and its peers are spending tens of billions of dollars over the next few years to upgrade to 5G technology. 5G promises to revolutionize the wireless industry and perhaps the tech industry as a whole.Tests indicate it will bring speeds between 10 and 60 times faster than 4G. This will improve wireless connectivity and bring the world apps and functions not possible in the 4G realm. One such application is connectivity to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Others have yet to be imagined.However, this places pressure upon T-Mobile, as well as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), to complete the 5G upgrade to stay relevant in the wireless business. Thus, the move to 5G will continue regardless of how the economy performs. Moreover, people must communicate in good times and in bad. This need will help T-Mobile and its peers as downturn stocks to buy.Also following its merger with Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile will see a broader customer base and only two direct competitors in the U.S. With or without Sprint, and with or without a booming economy, T-Mobile and TMUS stock will move ahead at full speed.As of this writing, Will Healy was long TDOC stock.

2019-08-20,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) earnings beat analyst estimates, sending the stock up in pre-market trade Aug. 20.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Investors even ignored warnings from management about trouble ahead.The home improvement retailer earned $3.479 billion, $3.17 per fully diluted share, on revenue of $30.839 billion, for the quarter ending in July.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis beat estimates of $3.12 per share of earnings but missed estimates of $31.1 billion in sales. The company also trimmed its outlook for the full year, based on worries about tariffs. Come for the DividendThis didn't stop the party. Even at its expected opening price of $213 per share on Aug. 20, Home Depot's dividend of $1.36 per share still yields 2.5%, and it's fully supported by earnings.With a government 30-year bond yielding 2.05%, that's a bargain for income investors. Especially since the dividend has nearly tripled over the last 5 years from 47 cents.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential It means that if you got into Home Depot stock five years ago, when it was trading at $93 per share, you're getting a yield of nearly 6% on that investment, along with capital gains of about 22% each year. That's the very definition of a dividend aristocrat.Home Depot has been such a good stock, for so long, that it now represents 5.5% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which it joined in 1999, replacing Sears. Stay for the GrowthSince joining the Dow, Home Depot shares have resisted two sharp recessions. The company has even proven resistant to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), making it a unique investment proposition.Growth has accelerated in recent years, from a $6 billion gain in sales to an $8 billion gain pace. The company is now the fifth largest U.S.-based retail company, behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and Kroger (NYSE:KR).The current interest rate environment could cause another jump in Home Depot's price. Fundamentals are strong, growth looks sustainable and the dividend is high relative to other income instruments.Home Depot bears were worried going into earnings over beating last year's sales, the state of the home remodeling market, and the fact that earnings per share are constantly buoyed by stock repurchases. But these voices are being drowned out, as are those of management, which lowered its guidance for the year at its conference call. Why the Pop?Home Depot stock rose after earnings because it was making up for ground lost to the trade war and global growth fears. HD stock shed more than $10 during August, even crossing a technical sell signal.While the company is known to skew male, it has recently been improving its home decor selection to appeal to women. The focus on textiles and furnishings can help in &quot;staging&quot; homes for re-sale, which also appeals to core customers.While young homebuyers are acquiring older, smaller houses, Home Depot executives say they're still interested in big projects as their home values rise. This should maintain the company's sales momentum. Home Depot Stock Is the Best Retail Buy Right NowHome Depot is the best retail stock to own now. While Costco shares have matched its march upward over the last five years, Costco's dividend yields less than 1%. Home Depot remains devoted to its dividend, it supports the stock with buybacks, and that dividend now yields more than a 30-year bond.That's why investors are ignoring warnings that the stock market is high, that Home Depot stock may be technically stretched, even management's own concerns about the future. They're buying with both hands because, in the current market, Home Depot is a genuine bargain.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-22,"The Target (NYSE:TGT) second-quarter earnings report was a real eye-opener.Net earnings of $939 million, $1.83 per share, on revenue of $18.4 billion were just part of it.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Same store sales rose 3.4%, and traffic to the stores was up 2.4%. Half of that came from Target's same-day fulfillment services, and operating profit was up nearly 17% from a year earlier.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More The result was a fundamental reassessment of Target by analysts and investors. Shares rose a startling 20% and kept going higher as trade opened Aug. 22. A stock that had never traded over $90 per share was suddenly trading at $105. The Target stock price shot right up.But has Target really changed, or have analysts just caught up with the decade's most important retail trend? Americans Don't Shop in the Traditional SenseAnalysts looking at the Target numbers waxed lyrically over its &quot;omni-channel&quot; efforts, the idea that Target lets people buy online and either pick up their orders or have them delivered.But there's a more fundamental change at work. Americans no longer shop. Americans buy. We make lists. We expect low prices. We consider getting what we need a chore, and want it done quickly.When we go out, we also want to visit one store for all our needs. We don't go to a clothing store, a food store, then a drug store or stationery.This trend is behind the rise of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). The question was where Target could fit into this new world, or whether it might wither away as department stores like Macy's (NYSE:M).The second quarter proved to analysts that Target has found its niche, and that it's a sustainable one.Target will deliver clean stores close to where people live, increasingly in densely-packed cities. CEO Brian Cornell says his turnaround for the company is still in its early stages.While many analysts think Cornell's Target is Walmart or Amazon, it's also Costco. Cornell recognized that convenience isn't just about e-tailing.  It's also about being nearby, selling basics people need in quantities small enough to bring back to modern apartments.While Walmart has mostly abandoned small-format stores, Target has gone all-in, with 30 new sites each year placed close to college campuses and other urban employment centers. Store Brands Boost Earnings in TGT StockCornell's strategy for maintaining margins is to build store brands so that what he makes competes directly with what he buys.The company's new grocery brand is Good and Gather, which is being sold as a wellness brand in its grocery aisles. Target's grocery sections are usually smaller than those of rivals, with fewer fresh products.Good and Gather joins the successful Cat & Jack kids' line and dozens of other store brands including Smith & Hawken, bought in 2010.Store brands offer fatter margins than name-brand merchandise. Stores which, like Costco, deliver quality in their store brands, get a double earnings boost. Bottom Line on Target StockAnalysts were reluctant to give Target stock the kind of price multiple given Walmart because they didn't think it fit into Walmart's world.Walmart sells at 25 P/E, and even with its fat Aug. 21 gains Target stock is still selling for under 18 times earnings. Its dividend yield is 2.56%, against less than 2% for Walmart.Walmart's market cap is 62% of its 2018 revenue, while Target's recent gains mean it's selling for 72% of last year's sales. Target remains just 14% of Walmart's size, but analysts now think it can play in Walmart's league. That's a huge change in sentiment, and it means Target stock may keep rising.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-23,"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is the best retail stock besides Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The shares are up almost 22% in the last year, 82% over the last two years and 130% over the last five. It delivers a small, but steady dividend that has doubled over the last five years.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Costco's reputation as the best place to buy goods in bulk is reflected in its financial statements, where net income usually comes close to the amount it generates in membership fees. The stores are usually running at break-even.I have owned Costco shares, but sold them a few years ago, thinking they were overpriced. I worried that Costco was running out of places to grow, as young people moved into small city apartments the company doesn't serve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI was wrong. So far in 2019 Costco shareholders have done better than those at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or even Amazon. Communist? Or Conservative?Costco is unique among retailers not just in that it pays its line employees well, but in that it doesn't overpay managers. Employees are thus more satisfied with their pay and working conditions at Costco than employees at any other company -- even those at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).But Costco is also conservative, in the best possible way. It can cost as much as $100 million to outfit a new store, so it usually rolls out just one or two each month. Its stores are all located in upper-middle class suburbs, with ample parking, gas stations and tire centers. It is the last great suburban success story. Unlike Walmart, it doesn't suck up the whole retail market, it just skims the cream off its top.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip Costco has no secrets. Management admits its focus is on customers and employees, not just shareholders. Its stock is limited to a few items in each category, and its markups average just 15%, against 25-50% markups from other retailers. The company's Kirkland store brand often offers better quality than the national brands it competes with. Costco was late to online shopping, but its app is already considered better than that of Walmart's Sam's Club.During the era of President Donald Trump, which has benefitted upper-income suburbanites most, Costco's growth has accelerated. Sales for the first three quarters of 2019 are up 6.5% overall, and online sales are up almost 25%. During the current fiscal year, it has paid back over one-quarter of its long-term debt, nearly $1.7 billion, despite super-low interest rates.  Can Costco Stock Continue?There are indications that finally, Costco is running out of growth. Neighborhoods and local governments are fighting new stores in some wealthy neighborhoods.Costco's profits accelerated after it switched from using an American Express (NYSE:AXP) to a Citicorp (NYSE:C) by Visa (NYSE:V) card, as did benefits to cardholders. But that's a trick that is hard to repeat.Costco is growing internationally and opened its first store in Shanghai this month. Currently 68% of its stores are in the U.S., but that will change as it rolls out executive memberships in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.Costco's growth has been decelerating slowly in 2019, into the mid-single digits each month, as its fiscal 2018 revenue came to $141 billion. The Bottom Line on COST StockCostco stock is an investment, not a trade. Costco is managed conservatively for the long run. Even if the stores look cookie-cutter, they don't open until after years of careful planning. Risks are growing. A higher international profile means there are now currency risks, trade risks and social dislocation risks. Even Walmart has had its misadventures in growing globally.But, as I said at the outset, I was a fool to sell my shares. Hang on to yours.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-27,"The markets started off higher on Tuesday, following Monday's rally. However, stocks struggled to follow through, with the morning rally fading to losses in the afternoon. Here are our top stock trades going into mid-week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: ChipotleWhen the markets get volatile and the selling becomes rampant, I like to look for names showing relative strength. That is, stocks that are strong relative to the overall market's performance. Among the list of relative strength winners is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock broke out to new highs on Tuesday, bursting over the $825 level and hitting $850 on the day. I'm not necessarily saying that CMG is a screaming buy, only that it's not a screaming short.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Simply put, we do not short stocks that are in this strong of an uptrend and/or are showing this much relative strength. For now, the dips continue to get bought in CMG and new highs are going in the books. While the market has struggled in August, CMG is up 6.5%. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: StarbucksAnother name showing relative strength? Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). However, that's been going on for about a year now.Shares surged higher in July on better-than-expected earnings results and now continue to linger in this mid-$90s range.$97 continues to act as resistance, while SBUX keeps putting in a series of higher lows. Should uptrend support break and the 20-day moving average give way, SBUX may test the 50-day moving average. It could also fill the gap down toward $91.Over resistance puts $100 on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is rallying on Tuesday, but is not sporting the 4%+ gains it was after the close on Monday. The company was ordered to pay a fine of more than $500 million in an opioid ruling, although J&J plans to appeal.Shares were rallying with the news now out of the way, but it's having trouble sustaining those gains. Part of that is due to the overall market, but the charts could be causing the rest of the headaches.The $127 to $128 level held as support, but shares could not sustain above short-term range resistance at $132.While not pictured, I would like to see JNJ close over the $131 to $131.50 area, with the 10-week and 100-week moving averages trading in this area. If it can, and if JNJ can clear $132, it puts the 50-day and 200-day moving averages on the table.Above that and $138 is possible. If $127 gives way as support, $122.50 and $117.50 could be next. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: ShopifyWe highlighted its strength the other day and Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) put together another impressive session on Tuesday, hitting new highs over $400.While it will anger a lot of bears, this one could still have upside. It's not overbought in the short term and is not even close to what has been channel resistance. Like CMG, Shopify may not be a screaming buy at this point, but it's one to keep an eye on.I would love a dip down to $340 in SHOP. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: CostcoCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few retailers that keeps on churning. The company opened its first store in China and had to close it early because of how many customers showed up.What a great problem to have.It sent the stock bursting over $282 resistance and to new highs. Like Shopify, it has a ways to go before hitting channel resistance and is not yet overbought. Whether the overall market keeps a lid on future momentum is hard to say, though.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects Look to see if COST can continue to gravitate higher. If it pulls back, see if $282 can hold as support. Below and it may test uptrend support and/or the 50-day moving average.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

That can be foolhardy advice with any company, and there's a good chance Amazon stock declines further over the near-term, but this is a growth story with over $25 billion in cash on hand and massive economic moats.In other words, there's a lot to like here even if the market gets it wrong for a little while.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects As a high multiple growth stock in a cyclical sector, Amazon makes for a predictable victim when trade tensions escalate and fears of a recession grow. But as has been said many times in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve will do what it takes to keep a recession from happening in the U.S. For the skeptical, consumer data, while fluid, remains sturdy. Speaking of data, check out some of the latest from the Commerce Department on e-commerce, the primary driver of Amazon stock.&quot;Total retail sales for the second quarter of 2019 were estimated at $1,361.8 billion, an increase of 1.8 percent(±0.2%)from the first quarter of 2019,&quot; according to the Commerce Department. &quot;The second quarter 2019 e-commerce estimate increased 13.3 percent (±1.6%) from the second quarter of 2018 while total retail sales increased 3.2 percent(±0.5%) in the same period. E-commerce sales in the second quarter of 2019 accounted for 10.7 percent of total sales.&quot; Amazon's New ActsIn the U.S., Amazon stock is often valued by analysts and investors as a play on cloud computing, e-commerce and the ownership of high-end grocery chain Whole Foods. The company is looking and has the financial resources to increase its footprint in streaming entertainment, among other potentially lucrative markets.Of course, there are able competitors in nearly all of Amazon's key markets in the U.S., meaning that as the company matures, investors will demand some ex-U.S. growth, something the company is already addressing. A recent deal gets Amazon into India, Asia's third-largest economy and one of the world's fastest-growing retail markets.&quot;Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC agreed to buy 49% of Future Coupons Ltd., Future Retail said in a filing Thursday,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;The deal gives Amazon the option to buy all or part of Future Coupons' shareholding in Future Retail, though that won't be exercisable until between three and 10 years.&quot;Over the near-term, this deal is of little consequence for Amazon stock, but the long-term view is much different. Due to a slew of able, native rivals, Amazon has scuffled in China, but India offers plenty of potential.&quot;India's modern retail market will more than double to $188 billion by 2023 from $79 billion last year, according to consultant Technopak Advisors,&quot; notes Bloomberg.Whether it's in the U.S., India or another market, consumers like a good deal. While Amazon isn't viewed through the same lens as a Costco (NASDAQ:COST) or a Walmart (NYSE:WMT), shoppers think of Amazon as a place for good deals, a reputation that will likely be advantageous in international expansion.&quot;We believe Amazon's brand has come to represent low prices, a wide selection, convenience, and superior customer service-a rare combination among retailers,&quot; said Morningstar. Bottom Line: AMZN Stock May Be a Good DealAmazon stock trades for 53x forward earnings and 3.46x sales, so no, Amazon stock isn't cheap. It rarely, if ever, is. However, Amazon stocks continues warranting these lofty multiples for reasons including the aforementioned cash pile, management increasing, steadily increasing return on assets, return on equity, as well as rising gross and operating margins.Analysts aren't right all the time, but Amazon stock closed around $1,750 last Friday. The average analyst price target on the name is $2,261 with some targets in the $2,300 to $2,600 range. It seems Amazon stock may actually be a good deal here.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China has been a graveyard for many foreign retailers, which frequently arrived with grand hopes only to pull back after years of debilitating struggle. Carrefour SA sold 80% of its operations in June after more than two decades in the country, Tesco Plc folded its business into a joint venture in 2013, and Metro AG is seeking a buyer for its Chinese unit. Costco Wholesale Corp. has more reason than most to believe it can buck the trend.It’s an inauspicious time to enter the world’s second-largest economy. Growth has slowed, and the trade war has made the environment less hospitable for overseas companies. China’s plan to set up a corporate social credit system will raise compliance costs and could put some firms out of business, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said Wednesday. At the same time, online shopping is increasingly taking market share from bricks-and-mortar retailers. None of that stopped Costco’s first Chinese outlet, in Shanghai, from being mobbed on its opening Tuesday.It’s probably not a flash in the pan, opening-day discounts notwithstanding. China’s consumer markets are fickle and retail is viciously competitive, with razor-thin margins. Still, Costco looks to have picked its niche carefully. The Shanghai outlet is in a suburban district, aiming to cater to car-driving shoppers willing to load up with bulk items such as 30-pack boxes of cookies or 200-fluid-ounce (6-liter) bottles of detergent. Selling in quantity helps enable the discounts that underpin Costco’s appeal.Such a model wouldn’t work in the more built-up central areas of Shanghai, where most people live in cramped apartments and take public transport. That needn’t matter to Costco, though, as long as the U.S. retailer can find enough suitable suburban markets. Costco’s outlet in Shanghai’s Minhang district has parking space for 1,200 cars, more than any other of its locations.Membership is a key element of Costco’s pitch to consumers. Being part of a fee-paying club adds an aura of exclusivity that may play well with Chinese shoppers, particularly when the Shanghai store offers high-end products such as Maine lobsters, bluefin tuna and Birkin bags. Costco was charging an introductory membership fee of 199 yuan ($28) at Tuesday’s opening, which will rise to 299 yuan.Costco has already shown that it can export its warehouse model, building successful operations in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Revenue from international operations more than tripled in the past 10 years.Sam’s Club, a warehouse membership chain owned by Walmart Inc. that’s been in China for more than 20 years, gives cause for optimism on Costco’s entry. Sam’s Club has pushed upmarket by adding services such private dental clinics (for a higher membership fee) and aims to increase outlets in the country to 40 in 2020, from 23 at the start of this year, company executives told the China Daily in January. Chinese consumers have become increasingly willing to pay for better services in the past one to two years, Chen Zhiyu, senior vice president of Sam's Club China, was cited as saying.Costco positions itself as a higher-end shopping destination than Sam’s Club, and has built a reputation for quality fresh food. That may be the company’s best bulwark against the encroachment of internet operators. Venture capital money has been pouring into online grocers, as my colleague Shuli Ren observed last month. Even so, most shoppers in China still like to touch or at least see their vegetables with their own eyes. Sam's Club drove a 4.7% surge in Walmart’s China sales in its most recent quarter, thanks largely to fresh-food sales.Costco has had a five-year online partnership with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in China to market its flagship private label Kirkland. That’s helped to build the company’s name in China ahead of its entry to physical retail. A strategy that integrates the two may be critical to flourish in China’s demanding retail landscape. “In many parts of China, same-day delivery really means same-hour delivery,” as Walmart observed in its 2019 annual report. The Sam’s Club owner has a partnership with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc.Shares of Costco rose 5% on Tuesday, the most since March. That may overstate the potential from a Chinese expansion that’s likely to be modest and incremental, at least at first. But if Costco can thrive in China’s current conditions, it should be there to stay. To contact the author of this story: Nisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2019-08-28,"Monday's dead-cat bounce wasn't meant to last. Instead, with recession worries renewed by another inversion of the two-year and ten-year yield curve, the S&P 500 fell 0.32% on Tuesday.Source: Shutterstock Altria Group (NYSE:MO) led the charge, falling another 4% as investors protested its reported plans to merge with rival Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). To that end, Philip Morris shares fell nearly 8%, albeit on lower volume, on the unpopularity of the idea among its shareholders.Yet, there were some winners. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them, up 5% after a very well-received opening of its first store in China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow As for names worth a look headed into the midpoint of the trading week though, take a look at the stock charts of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). Here's what's most noteworthy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)It has more to do with the broad market and the industry itself than it does with the company. Nevertheless, UnitedHealth Group shares -- already fighting a losing battle -- started to break down in a big way last week. Yesterday's 3.1% tumble underscored how easily UNH stock could be up-ended.While the stage is perhaps set for a short-term dead cat bounce, even a modest recovery effort wouldn't be enough to undo the bulk of the damage that has been done just since the middle of last month.  *   Click to EnlargeChief among the technical problems here is a break back under what had been a support level tagging most of the key low since late last year, plotted in red. April's dip was an exception.  * Also note that the convergence of all the key moving average lines in February and March has since turned into a divergence … a bearish one. The blue 20-day and purple 50-day moving average lines have since turned into technical resistance as well (highlighted).  * It's a bit difficult to see in detail, but many of the daily selloffs since the middle of July have been on high volume. That bearish volume has been persistently above average the past few days. eBay (EBAY)In the middle of last month, eBay was put under the trading microscope. After it punched through a technical ceiling just under $39 in June, a couple of very rough days were testing that level again as resistance.It ended up surviving, against the odds. But, that reprieve may have only been temporary. The bears took another shot early this month, and although EBAY stock bounced off the former ceiling near $39, the bears started to take another shot on Friday. The outlook is not encouraging for a couple of different reasons.  * The 10 Biggest Winners From Second-Quarter Earnings   *   Click to EnlargeSince the last look, the gray 100-day moving average line has stepped up as a support level, although it has yet to spark a clear rebound.  * It's only a mild concern at this point, but notice how the &quot;down&quot; volume bars since the middle of last week are starting to grow taller, and taller than the green &quot;up&quot; volume bars.  * If the support around $39 should fail, two potential landing spots are already clear. One of them is the white 200-day moving average line, currently at $35.66, and the other is the floor around $35.40, where eBay found support several times earlier in the year. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Finally, it's not a name that's often analyzed from a charting or technical perspective. But, if Berkshire Hathaway is dropping technical hints, then it's dropping technical hints.And, that is what it's doing here. Although they're unsurprisingly subtle given the income-oriented nature of Buffett's portfolio, they're there, and they mean something. Indeed, given that Berkshire is a name preferred by the non-trader types, there's an argument to be made that the chart's shape tells us more about the changing viewpoint of the average investor than charts of more actively traded names. In this case, a big red flag is starting to wave.  *   Click to EnlargeIt's clear on both stock charts, but the perspective needed to fully appreciate the risk is more evident on the weekly chart. That is, BRK.B stock has already logged a string of lower highs, and is testing a major floor right around $198.  * It would be easy to miss in the entanglement, but all four key moving average lines are now sloped downward. It's a subtle clue that the momentum has taken a turn for the worst in all timeframes.  * Berkshire Hathaway will most likely move in the same direction as the broad market, and if that's lower, the next likely landing point is the line that connects the key lows from last year, plotted in yellow, just under $190.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-29,"U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning. Daily turns in the trade war narrative continue to drive stock prices. Today's boost is coming after China's commerce ministry said they &quot;firmly reject and escalation of the trade war.&quot;Source: Shutterstock Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.88%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.83%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 1.08%.Yesterday's action in the options pits saw put volume almost catch up to calls, even as overall volume remained below average. Specifically, about 14.7 million calls and 14 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, over at the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio matched Tuesday's reading at 0.64. The pair of lower readings reflect a market that is trying to return to normal. The 10-day moving average slipped to a two-week low at 0.70.Options trading was buzzing in Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).Let's take a closer look: Autodesk (ADSK)Autodesk shares plunged Wednesday morning after lowering its earnings forecast, but buyers emerged to pare the losses by the closing bell. What began as a 12.5% down open mercifully morphed into a 6.7% loss by day's end. It was still a beating, but not nearly as ugly as it could have been.The concerns weren't centered around last quarter's earnings. Autodesk actually bested estimates, growing sales by 30% year-over-year. Instead, investors' ire was targeted toward the software company's downbeat forward guidance due to trade war concerns.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week The technical picture for ADSK stock deteriorated mid-year, and it was already limping into the report. With yesterday's whack, the shares slipped below yet another support zone, and while the intraday rally was impressive, there is now a ton of resistance to work through. Until we work back above $150, sellers hold the upper hand.On the options trading front, traders favored puts throughout the session. Activity soared to 781% of the average daily volume, with 93,267 total contracts traded. Puts accounted for 58% of the tally. Costco (COST)Costco shares scored a beautiful breakout this week, coming within pennies of tagging $300 a share. Volume surged alongside the rally, confirming institutions were entering the fray. This legitimizes the resistance breach and makes it that much more likely that the stock stays aloft.COST stock has exhibited relative strength during the recent market turmoil. That fact that it is one of the first stocks popping to new highs shouldn't be surprising. Perhaps some of the buying is due to investors piling in ahead of the dividend. The stock trades ex-dividend today, pricing out its next quarterly payment of 65 cents.There's no doubt the dividend is what launched options trading to the moon. Activity rocketed to 567% of the average daily volume, with 106,955 total contracts traded; 78% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility has been rising in anticipation of Costco's next earnings announcement. At 27%, the reading sits at the 60th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $4.94 or 1.7%. Bank of America (BAC)Beaten down banks came to life Wednesday. Bank of America led the way rallying 1.4% at a critical juncture. Its price chart has been chipping away at multi-month support, but buyers swooped in to save it from breaking down. Upside follow-through is still needed to confirm the turnabout though. We've seen many failed rally attempts this month.That said, the risk-reward for bullish trades is attractive with potential support sitting at yesterday's low.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts by a wide margin. Total activity grew to 101% of the average daily volume, with 262,070 contracts traded; 65% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility is hovering at 30% or the 37th percentile of its one-year range.

2019-09-04,"Viral video footage might have reeled you in, but Costco's (NASDAQ:COST) venture in Shanghai, China is worthy of holding your attention. In this episode of Matt McCall's &quot;Money Line&quot; podcast, he talks about what the craze means for Costco stock and what savvy investors should be doing to ride the rotisserie-chicken-filled wave.If you haven't seen the videos, you might be a little confused. What's the big deal about COST stock? Well, as McCall highlights, Costco's grand opening in Shanghai is important for several reasons. It offers packaged, bulk goods that many Chinese consumers want. Plus, the Shanghai location also sells high-end cosmetics and designer handbags.Costco's management had to close the store's doors early Aug. 27 amid reports that wait times for parking spots topped three hours. Later that day, it took to WeChat to announce a new maximum capacity of 2,000 people.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile McCall is still on the fence about buying his own Costco membership, he isn't on the fence about what this means for Costco stock. Tune in to learn how to play this retail trend. McCall's PodcastYou might remember that last week, McCall went head on with mainstream media organizations and &quot;irresponsible&quot; analysts. He's talking about ones that are searching for a recession around every corner. He still doesn't see one coming, and he has some advice if market fears are keeping you up at night. The fact that the S&P 500 is just 5% to 6% off an all-time high is reassuring, too.One thing McCall does see is a new trend for investors on the horizon. Fans of electric vehicles may know that lithium ion batteries, used to power such cars, have two major downsides. One, they rely on cobalt, primarily mined from geopolitically tense hotspots. Two, they are highly flammable. (Remember Samsung's phone scare?)But McCall sees solid-state batteries as the future because they offer less flammable, longer-lasting support. Their potential is in everything from EVs to smartphones. Subscribers to his VIP podcast or newsletters have access to an exchange-traded fund, of sorts. He's put together a list of plays in the solid-state battery space that are all up despite market volatility.Not a paid subscriber? Don't worry. Listen up for more on how General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) are positioning themselves for this up-and-coming trend. GM stock and TM stock are just two ways McCall highlights to get in on the trend.Tune in to &quot;Money Line&quot; for a review of Costco stock's crazy headlines, McCall's critiques of recession fearmongers and some takeaways on potentially the newest trend in the battery and electric vehicle space.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2019-09-11,"(Bloomberg) -- After Lee Bird witnessed At Home Group Inc. lose half its market value in one day this June, the chief executive officer decided to reconsider everything.“This past 90 days has been a revisit of our whole business,” Bird said in an interview. “We obviously lost the faith of our investors.”In response, the home-goods retailer pulled back on its ambitious store-opening plans and revamped marketing to tout what it claims are the lowest prices in the industry. And after staying out of the e-commerce fray because the cost of implementation and shipping could hamper profit, the company now plans a full online offering by 2022.The efforts come none too soon, as a shakeout in retail has left legacy chains struggling to survive the arrival of digital-first competitors like Amazon.com Inc. and Wayfair Inc. Consumers at all income levels are also more discount-oriented, using the internet to seek out deals. At Home appeared immune to these woes until June 6 when weak sales and increased costs from President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods led to a cut in its earnings forecast that hammered the stock.“A long list of little things have gone against the company,” said Brad Thomas, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. “A few have been company specific, but it’s more about housing slowing down about a year ago.”At Home also had little room for error, with its valuation soaring after revenue gained an average 23% annually over the past three years. But investors bolted after the company’s same-store sales fell the past two quarters -- the first declines since going public three years ago. The company’s earnings have also missed analysts’ projections twice in the past three quarters.“It’s hard, but I get paid a lot of money so no one is going to tear up for me,” said Bird, who bought $500,000 worth of shares on Monday.The stock had declined 54% this year through Tuesday’s close. Just a year ago, the retailer sold additional stock to the public for $33.20 a share. The shares climbed as much as 7% to $9.16 on Wednesday, their fourth straight daily gain. The increase in value-driven shoppers should put At Home in a solid position. Much like Costco Wholesale Corp., the chain has a low-cost operating model -- it opens stores cheaply in locations vacated by the likes of Sears and about 70% of its inventory is private label or exclusive.Pricing ModelThat helps the retailer keep prices low, but not enough shoppers were getting the message because of “all the noise” on discounts and deals coming from competitors, Bird said. At Home uses a pricing model of everyday low prices -- a strategy popularized by Walmart Inc. that eschews promotions and instead tries to convince shoppers of constant value. Meanwhile, most retailers employ a model of high introductory prices and then discounts.“The average American is not aware that At Home is a low-price leader,” KeyBanc’s Thomas said.To help remedy this, At Home for the first time is running regular shopping events every two weeks, often tied to seasonal events. There’s currently a focus on fall decor on its website and in stores. A year ago, the chain would have been highlighting a few specific deals, but not a whole category. Early results are that it’s lifted sales, Bird said.Besides opening stores, revenue gains will also come from its first push online, he said. In the fourth quarter, the company will test letting customers buy items online and picking them up at stores. If all goes well, more locations will be added next year, with the goal of shipping purchases to customer’s homes from locations by 2022, he said.Despite the turmoil, the company still sees growing to 600 stores from 200 in the U.S. But it will get there at a slower pace, expanding 10% a year, down from a current rate of 17%. That means it would take more than a decade to reach that goal.“We know we have a huge white space in front of us,” Bird said. “I feel good about the adjustments we’ve made.”(Updates with share trading Wednesday in eighth paragraph. A previous version was corrected to show about 70% of inventory is private label or exclusive.)To contact the reporter on this story: Matt Townsend in New York at mtownsend9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa Wolfson, Jonathan RoederFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",At Home CEO’s Gut Check Prompts ‘Revisit’ of Whole Business

2019-09-18,"Consumer staples stocks have largely fallen off the radar in recent months. Investors have been much more focused on growth as corporate earnings have pleasantly surprised, the U.S.-China trade spat showed signs of hope and the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady.Naturally, these more defensive companies haven't been especially red-hot of late. Consumer staples stocks have lagged the marketwide bounce that took shape beginning in late December. But with many other sectors starting to feel the weight of unwieldy gains, and with China trade talks yet again hitting turbulence, the sector might be ready to heat up again.Steve Azoury, founder of financial planning firm Azoury Financial, says, &quot;Consumer staples, the products that people use every day, will always be a big part of America's economy.&quot; &quot;The trick,&quot; he adds, is identifying the companies that &quot;will stay innovative and update their products and services to excite their customers, and thus the stock prices for investors.&quot;Here are 17 of the best consumer staples stocks to invest in at the moment. While some of these are blue-chip stocks that should ring a bell, others are lesser-known companies that serve as the backbone of brands you may be more familiar with.

2019-09-19,The major stock indexes were modestly higher early Thursday. Dow Jones stock Microsoft is breaking out above a new buy point.,Stock Market Rally Continues; Dow Jones Stock Microsoft Is Breaking Out Today
2019-09-19,"Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoying a robust start to September, investors should remain leery. Aside from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, we have the Brexit drama in the U.K. that could turn out ugly. Additionally, Germany is on the brink of a recession, if it's not there already. Logically, this doesn't bode well for certain market segments like consumer stocks to buy.If you've been paying attention to the global economy and not just our own indices, you'll appreciate that a cautious approach to investing is best. Early this year, South China Morning Post contributor David Brown suggested that international central banks must act quickly to quiet troubling economic conditions. Because that action apparently didn't happen, we're probably going to suffer some slowdown. Thus, consumer stocks levered to discretionary spending are suspect.However, I'm still interested in specific names of this far-reaching segment. While spending will likely slow over the next few months, it won't stop outright. Recession or not, people must make certain purchases, which means secular-industry consumer stocks to buy are very much in play.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, I'm eyeing some companies that have a vice element. Although it's an incredibly cynical argument, let's face reality: vice tends to go up during economic hardships. For example, imbibing overall increased during the Great Recession, likely as a stress-coping mechanism.  * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession Here are seven consumer stocks to buy that can outlast the coming recession. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Soloviov Vadym / Shutterstock.com For several years, shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) languished in largely sideways trading. In retrospect, part of that probably had to do with the generally strong market and economic dynamics at the time. For example, in a robust bull market, a name like KO stock doesn't necessarily appeal to you. That's especially the case when you have high-flying technology companies competing for your attention.Now, the situation is different. Sure, KO stock is considered one of many consumer stocks, and in a downturn, consumers will reduce their spending. But as I mentioned earlier, they won't kill all consumptive behaviors, but rather, are more mindful of their expenditures. Here, Coca-Cola products are compelling because they offer a treat, a nice distraction away from stressful events or circumstances.And let's not forget that any form of cheap entertainment or distraction carries a premium in a recession. That was one of the main arguments supporting KO stock in the last major downturn. I believe a similar dynamic will support Coca-Cola in the next one. Campbell Soup (CPB)Source: HeinzTeh / Shutterstock.com While many investors have tuned into the Coca-Cola story this year, another name among consumer stocks to buy has made ripples, but perhaps without the same level of attention. Shares of Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) have soared this year, gaining over 45%. You'd have to go back quite a ways to when a bowl of soup was this interesting. Yet CPB stock might have room to fly.First, as strange as it is to say this, a recession would really help the case for CPB stock. If the economy slows, consumers will invariably whittle down their discretionary spending. Thus, the family budgeting for going out to eat should decline sharply. In addition, a particularly troublesome recession could see consumers cutting their personal budgets down to the bare essentials.Guess what? Campbell Soup is the bare essentials.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy With Limited Trade War Exposure Second, I like the fact that, like KO, CPB stock pays a dividend. And with a current yield of 3%, it gives concerned investors some buffer against potential volatility. Clorox (CLX)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)In the first two consumer stocks to buy, I featured consumables in the literal since. But with Clorox (NYSE:CLX), most of their products are not things you want to put in your mouth. That said, you might want to consider putting CLX stock in your portfolio. Let's take a look at some of the basics.For starters, most folks know the Clorox brand name as a household cleaning supply specialist. Here, the argument is simple: even in a recession, you've got to keep yourself and your environment clean. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure or more, especially with current healthcare prices.And this logic for CLX stock extends beyond human use. One of Clorox's brands is Fresh Step, which is a popular cat litter brand. Americans love their pets, often changing their lifestyles to accommodate their furry friends.Finally, CLX stock isn't just about cleaning nowadays. Through the Hidden Valley brand, Clorox has some exposure to the food industry. Additionally, its Burt's Bees division offers lucrative personal care revenue opportunities. Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com I'll admit that I struggled with whether to include Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) in this list of consumer stocks to buy. In a bull market, COST stock makes sense. Although it charges a membership fee, customers are more than willing to pay it. Indeed, mainstream comedies like Employee of the Month confirm that Costco is both a cultural and retail phenomenon.But will shoppers be willing to dish out money for the membership dues -- and the 800 gallons of mayonnaise -- in a bear market? After all, people don't just shop at Costco for the necessities. They also go there to buy ultra-high definition TVs and the latest digital gadgets. Plus, not everything in Costco is a great deal. In a downturn, that doesn't support the case for COST stock.  * 10 Companies Making Their CEOs Rich However, here's an important stat to remember: $100,000. That's how much money the typical Costco shopper earns in a year. In contrast, the typical Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shopper earns a much lower $56,482. Thus, in a downturn, Costco's revenue stream is more resilient than its competitors, driving the case for COST stock. Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Source: Shutterstock If we do incur a serious recessionary crisis, consumers will most likely abandon high-dollar, longer-term purchases. That's an incredibly longwinded way of saying most folks probably won't shell out money for new cars. In turn, economic hardship will incentivize people to hold onto their vehicles longer. Invariably, this benefits Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) and GPC stock.Now, Genuine Parts may not be a household name. However, you almost surely heard of their brands like NAPA Auto Parts. With large warehouses stacked with various automotive parts, drivers can save themselves significant money by doing basic work themselves. Thanks to various do-it-yourself videos on platforms like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, the investment proposition for GPC stock isn't as much of a stretch as you might think.Moreover, there's a chance that GPC stock could benefit from higher-than-average income earners who drive European -- specifically German -- cars. As an automotive enthusiast, I appreciate the many intangibles that German carmakers bring to the table. However, their cars are ridiculously expensive to maintain.To get around this dilemma, I can imagine cash-strained drivers buying third-party components for their vehicles. Therefore, I wouldn't ignore GPC in your search for best consumer stocks to buy. Anheuser Busch Inbev (BUD)Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com Perhaps one of the more surprising picks for consumer stocks to buy, shares of Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) are actually performing very well this year. Since January's opening price, BUD stock has gained 50%. However, I think the fundamentals justify the enormous rally.First, entertainment or escapism comes at a premium during economic hardships, as I mentioned earlier. Now, it's true that technically, we're not in a recession. But some clues exist that we're headed there. For example, while the unemployment rate is at multi-year lows, this stat has never indefinitely stayed deflated. Plus, the August jobs report was disappointing, give all of us pause.However, that suggests some extra drinking off the job will occur, driving the case for BUD stock.  * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession Second, Anheuser Busch owns the Bud Light brand, among other popular beers. Bud Light is the most popular beer in America by a long shot. Plus, it's incredibly cheap, which may help to steer recession-burnt and cash-strapped millennials back to beer from other frivolities. Logically, this boosts the case for BUD stock. Altria Group (MO)Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Clearly, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) is the laggard in this list of consumer stocks to buy. On a year-to-date basis, MO stock is down 10%. Even worse, since the first of April of this year, shares are down nearly 25%.While declining interest in smoking has obviously hurt MO stock and its ilk, big tobacco has another concern: the ongoing vaping crisis. In short, a rash of acute lung illnesses which federal agencies believe is associated with vaping has impacted several states. So far, authorities are investigating six deaths that they presume relate to vaping.On the surface, that hurts MO stock because Altria has a 35% stake in Juul. At the center of the firestorm, anti-smoking advocates and politicians have blasted Juul for their marketing practices and their easily concealable products. Worst of all, the President threatened to ban flavored vaping liquids, which may decimate the industry.However, that creates all kinds of ugly that I don't have the space to detail comprehensively here. The big takeaway, though, is that it may do nothing to stop underage vaping because the proposed ban won't affect all vaping liquids. Moreover, banning vaping altogether may violate legal adult users' constitutional rights, as well as destroying an economically viable industry.Granted, this is a risky play. But if we have a reasonable resolution, which I think we will, MO stock could fly far higher than many other consumer stocks.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Walmart Inc. announced its intention more than a year ago to purchase Cornershop outright for $225 million and re-sell the company to its Mexican subsidiary, only to have Mexican regulators oppose the move in June for antitrust reasons.Cornershop is the largest home delivery platform in Mexico and Chile. The app allows users to order groceries from a variety of stores such as Costco Wholesale Corp., Petco Holdings Inc., Walmart, bakeries and pharmacies, and have everything delivered at once, usually within 90 minutes. The items usually carry a higher price tag on top of the delivery fee. The four-year-old startup also operates in Peru and Canada. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.The arrangement could play a significant role in Uber’s strategy of layering more profitable services atop ride-sharing. Since the company’s disappointing initial public offering, the share price has dropped more than 30% and Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has sought to reassure investors that Uber is focused on turning a profit and continuing to grow.When Walmart attempted to buy Cornershop, analysts saw the purchase as a way for the retailer to increase its e-commerce presence with the help of an established app that brought a giant database of users and more importantly, its consumer patterns.“It’s already positioned, it knows the market well and it was going to accelerate this process for Walmart,” said Marisol Huerta, an analyst at Banco Ve Por Mas. “It’s the same strategy for Uber.”The acquisition by Uber means the San Francisco-based company will expand on its Eats offering with the ability to deliver not only prepared food from restaurants, but a wide set of groceries, Huerta said. “They’ll be entering a new market but they’ll already have a big data base and the structure to operate in it.”Uber says it expects the deal to close in early 2020. Cornershop will continue to operate under its current leadership, reporting to a board with majority Uber representation.“Whether it’s getting a ride, ordering food from your favorite restaurant, or soon, getting groceries delivered, we want Uber to be the operating system for your everyday life,” Khosrowshahi said in a statement announcing the deal.(Updates with comments from analyst in the sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Lizette Chapman in San Francisco at lchapman19@bloomberg.net;Andrea Navarro in Mexico City at anavarro30@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Uber to Acquire Chile Grocery Startup Walmart Failed to Buy
2019-10-14,"Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) has been one of the big victims of this year's Retail Armageddon, the shares falling from an April high of $19.41 to a low of $7.40 in August. But BBY Stock is enjoying a pop of over $2 per share after announcing that Australia-born Mark Tritton, who had been chief merchandising officer for Target (NYSE:TGT), is becoming its CEO.Source: Shutterstock The reaction is a tribute to Target CEO Brian Cornell, who joined in 2014 after a computer hack took down his predecessor. Target now trades at more than twice its level of mid-2017, helped in part by store brands created under Tritton.Can Tritton really take Bed Bath beyond? Can he step up as CEO, or did he reach his full potential as an assistant coach?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Mark Tritton and BBBY StockThe 55-year-old Tritton, who was earning $5 million per year at Target, and learned his stuff at Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) before jumping to Cornell's team in 2016. He has also worked for Timberland and Nike (NYSE:NKE).  * 10 Super Boring Stocks to Buy With Super Safe Returns Bed, Bath & Beyond has been looking for a CEO since May, when Steven Temares stepped down.Tritton made his reputation at Target with house brands which compete with name brands on style. They have names like A New Day, Goodfellow & Co., Project 62 and Cat & Jack. That last is a kids' brand that saw $2 billion in sales during its first year and became a &quot;trip driver,&quot; a brand that drove people specifically to the store.Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) strategy, by contrast, has been to buy existing brands like Bonobo's and Bare Necessities. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has put all its effort into delivering high quality through its Kirkland brand. Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has taken a traditional route of value through its Amazon Basics line. The Turnaround Challenge for BBBY StockThe challenge at Bed Bath & Beyond is like the one Cornell faced five years ago. The company has averaged $12 billion in sales per year but has endured four straight quarters of losses, leading it to announce 60 store closings so far in 2019. Sales at stores open over a year sank 6.7% in the most recent quarter.If Tritton can eke out even a small profit, however, BBBY stock can rise quickly. Its current market cap is barely $1.5 billion, and it currently has a 17 cent per share dividend yielding 6.84%.There is almost $1 billion in cash on the books, and long-term debt is just $1.5 billion. Its strengths already had analysts nibbling on it. Two of them jumped to &quot;Buy&quot; recommendations over the last three months, although most remain in the non-committal &quot;hold&quot; camp.The real problem at BBBY should be right up Tritton's alley. Its merchandise is mediocre. It's an old-fashioned &quot;category killer&quot; in the mold of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) (which could be good) or the late Toys R Us (which would be bad). The website looks great, if it's 2005, with brand names on sale prominently displayed.The company launched its first private house brand, Bee & Willow Home, early this year, with plans to launch five more brands by the end of next year. The Bottom Line on BBBY StockThe BBBY challenge sets up very well for Tritton, if the economy holds up.The company has already taken its first step into private brands. Its balance sheet is reasonably healthy. What it seems to need is pizzazz, and that's what Tritton is known for.Joining the crowd that's nibbling on the stock is speculation, but it's a reasonable one, assuming Tritton really deserves credit for Target's turnaround.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-10-15,"The year 2019 will probably go down as one that holders of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock would like to forget. The Seattle-based tech giant has seen growth in the equity come to a standstill. Slowing profit growth and government scrutiny have weighed on the equity. The current Amazon stock price of about $1,740 per share has not moved significantly over the last year.Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com Still, investors may have good reason to look at AMZN stock again. Due mostly to non-retail initiatives, profits could see a dramatic recovery.More importantly, Amazon may rise again due not only to business success but its ability to defy assumptions about numbers themselves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AMZN Stock Has Lost Its LusterAmazon has seen its share of struggles this year. As InvestorPlace's Ian Bezek points out, many question Amazon's move into the low-growth grocery business with Whole Foods as well as a questionable challenge to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming companies.Moreover, competitive responses by the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) have made it clear that Amazon will not dominate retail to the degree some had feared. Additionally, an antitrust investigation of Amazon and other large tech outfits has also added to the uncertainty.  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals However, the firm's previous strategic missteps have not caused long-term harm to Amazon stock. Whole Foods and movie streaming may do little more than incentivize Prime memberships. Still, I do not see these weighing on AMZN stock for very long.Despite the company's start in retail, Amazon has become a conglomerate that derives the majority of its profits from cloud computing. Due in large part to this cloud business, Wall Street sees a significant recovery in the profit growth of AMZN stock. How Fast Can Amazon Grow Profits?For a company that had more than doubled profits in past years, the current earnings prediction of 16.7% seems paltry. However, in the future, analysts forecast an earnings increase of 41.2% in fiscal 2020. They also believe profit growth will average 83% per year over the next five years.Such growth seems mind-boggling for a firm with an $860 billion market cap. It also reminds me of a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. In that study, researchers deal with the conundrum of comparing growth in a large state like Texas with much smaller states. Texas will tend to have the largest absolute increases due to a large size. However, smaller states may grow faster on a percentage basis because of their smaller base.Likewise, with stocks, investors usually assume that percentage increases will drop as an entity grows. Other mega tech companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) continue to put up strong growth numbers.However, their rate of profit increase does not come close to that of AMZN stock. Despite its large size, Wall Street believes Amazon will see the type of percentage profit increases usually associated with successful startups. They foresee an 83% annual earnings increase prediction for the next five years. That comes in lower than the 108.6% average of the last five years. Still, that represents a huge improvement over 2019 numbers. It also manages to push the limits of long-held assumptions about percentage increases.In fairness, a phenomenon unique to Amazon drives these massive increases. The earnings increases do not come from retail, which remains Amazon's traditional, low-margin business. The profit growth comes mostly from the cloud, which continues to enjoy phenomenal growth. Thanks to cloud-driven profit increases, the growth story in AMZN stock may continue for some time to come. My Final Thoughts on Amazon StockThe company may resume the price growth in AMZN stock by calling into question not just rules of business, but that of numbers themselves. The company has struggled in recent months as profit growth has slowed.However, analysts see a resumption of earnings increases of just above 80% on average over the next few years. Investors typically see that level of growth from a successful startup, not from one of the largest companies in the world. This has happened as the company derives most of its earnings not from retail, but its cloud business.To be sure, Amazon has not actually defied any laws of numbers. Still, it has found a way to push assumptions to the limit. This could make AMZN stock not only a buy but also the largest growth equity in history.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-10-16,"Ordinarily, you'd imagine that a trade war with the world's second-biggest economy would be net negative for the retail industry. But for big-box retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), 2019 has been one of the best years so far. Since January's opening price, Target stock finds itself up over 71%, while WMT has gained a respectable 29%.Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com That said, not all big-box retailers have found the current environment favorable. A notable example is Big Lots (NYSE:BIG), which appears to have finally found a bottom. However, it took a loss of nearly 20% before investors apparently saw some contrarian value in its shares. So, what makes TGT stock stand out in what should be a broader headwind in retail?Primarily, I believe that Target owns a moat in the big-box space. Like sector king Walmart, TGT offers discounts to shoppers thanks to its vast scale. It's also a one-stop shop for various needs, including groceries, health and wellness products, clothing, and electronics. Unlike Walmart, though, Target caters to a more affluent customer. Therefore, Target stock levers an economic cushion similar to Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, because Target owns a moat, it's able to dictate favorable terms with its suppliers. While other retail companies desperately explore ways to minimize customer impact from the U.S.-China trade war, Target imposes its solution: bluntly, management tells its suppliers to foot the bill.  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals While that might sound like a net negative for TGT stock due to a combative relationship, Target has been doing this for years without recourse, as the charts demonstrate.But before you think Target stock is unstoppable, you might want to consider the retailer's inventory overflow situation. Target Stock Vulnerable to Operational RiskEarlier this month, Business Insider broke a disturbing story about Target's in-store operational efficiency, or lack thereof. Recently, management quietly cut overnight and backroom shift hours in stores across the nation. Apparently, this was done to increase floor support for customers.However, this move had an unintended consequence. With fewer workers - which Target refers to as &quot;team members&quot; - manning the backroom, the inventory overflow has become untenable. In some cases, heaps of products are stacked on top of each other, making the backroom a fire hazard. Also, guest photographs reveal that excess inventory sometimes spills out into the salesroom floor.Here's the dirty little secret: even in the best of times, Target's backrooms - where I once worked during my college years - were shoddy. In order to get thing done on time, many workers cut corners on safety protocols.Ordinarily, such a situation shouldn't impact TGT stock. After all, I'm fairly certain that all big-box retailers experience these inefficiencies to varying degrees. However, I've never seen anything like what Business Insider recently reported.The magnitude of this problem is such that I believe it can negatively impact Target stock if left unchecked. While most folks consider backroom duty as a lowly job, it's an important one for Target. Without hardworking and competent backroom team members, a store will constantly encounter inaccurate inventory counts. Eventually, that leads to very angry guests, who may take their dollars elsewhere.Plus, let's talk about the obvious: these are large-scale worker's comp cases ready to drop Target stock at a moment's notice. During my Target tenure, I witnessed team member injuries occur in clean backrooms. What we're seeing here is beyond the pale. The Root of the Problem Remains UnresolvedTo be fair, Target responded immediately to the backroom overflow problem. However, responding to a situation doesn't necessarily equate to forwarding an effective solution. Instead, the root cause - cutting overnight and backroom hours - remains unresolved.Indeed, Target's response - sending safety inspectors and demanding changes - may exacerbate the inventory overflow. That's because the team members responsible for the clean up are probably overworked as it is. With headquarters raising wages but cutting hours, the company is forcing out many well-trained employees.And with the craziness that the remaining team members are tasked to resolve, the attrition rate will surely spike. Thus, an effort to cut overhead will negatively affect operational efficiencies and accuracy.Let's also note that the busy holiday shopping season is only a month away. If Target doesn't get their act together quickly, TGT stock is at risk for completely dumb and avoidable reasons.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-23,"As the market gets crazy, boring tends to beat exciting as investors rush to safety. And you can't get more boring than ranch dressing, toilet paper and toothpaste. It's the reason why consumer staples stocks have been on fire over the last year. As political turmoil, slowing growth and other issues have made for a volatile market, many investors have found solace in consumer staples stocks. After all, people still need to brush their teeth and eat even if the economy is trending lower.To that end, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP) has had a banner year -- returning more than 20% year-to-date. And some individual consumer staples stocks have done even better than the benchmark exchange-traded fund.Perhaps the best part is, as the uncertainty continues to grow, consumer staples stocks have even more appeal for investors. For one thing, many consumer stocks fit the definition of &quot;quality&quot; and have strong stable earnings. Secondly, they tend to be dividend-paying stocks and those dividends can provide a nice cushion during periods of market malaise.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a result, many consumer staples stocks are perfect for retirees or conservative investors. So, which consumer stocks make sense today? Here are three that should find a home in your conservative portfolio. Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy: PepsiCo (PEP)Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.8%One of the best things about consumer staples stocks is that the top leaders really don't need any introductions. And that's what we have with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The soft drink and snack-food giant is as American as apple pie with its products finding its way in our fridges and kitchen cupboards. With some of the biggest brands under its umbrella -- such as Mountain Dew, Cheetos and Doritos -- PEP has become a cash flow and profit machine over the years. Last quarter alone, PepsiCo managed to see sales grow by over 4.3% and management is looking to score 4%-6% organic growth over the full year.The reason why PEP has been able to keep that growth coming comes down to its evolving product mix.The firm has been smart in its strategy to move with the times. Sugary sodas are out as consumers have switched to more natural and healthy snacks. For PEP, that's meant a shift towards teas, juices and other healthy snack foods. Key acquisitions of Sabra Hummus and Stacy's Pita Chips brands are just some examples. Additionally, PEP has found great success with sparkling water. Its Bubbly brand continues to win over consumers -- and the best part is that sparkling water comes with very high margins.PEP should be able to boost the growth even further. As it hooks millennials with its healthy and organic snacks, it's courting their children as well. According to Piper Jaffray's latest &quot;Taking Stock With Teens&quot; survey, Gen Z overwhelmingly prefers PEP's brands across several categories.In the end, PepsiCo offers a huge stable of winning brands, cash flows and a growing dividend. It's exactly what conservative investors would want in a consumer staples stock. Church & Dwight (CHD)Source: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.2%The power of consumer staples stocks lies within their ability to survive recessionary environments. The key is that daily activities still need to happen. Teeth need to be brushed and our clothes need to be washed. But what we use to do those processes can and does change during poor economic health. And that's where Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) can shine.While Church & Dwight's corporate name might not be as well-known as other consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), its products certainly are. They include Arm & Hammer baking soda, OxiClean stain-fighting solutions and Trojan condoms. The win for CHD is that many of its brands don't fall under the premium pricing umbrella. A large bottle of Tide goes for around $17 in my area. The similar-sized Arm & Hammer bottle is only about $10. Last recession, CHD benefited as many consumers migrated down to its lower-priced products. The best part is many stayed there after their fortunes changed during the recovery.Organic sales growth at the firm has managed to grow at a 3.6% annual rate over the last decade. And thanks to strong cost controls and buybacks, earnings have grown by about 8% per year in that time.Meanwhile, the firm continues to find other ways to grow. CHD has smartly used mergers and acquisitions to grow its portfolio and it's become a huge seller on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), partnering with the retailer to boost e-commerce and subscription sales.In the end, Church & Dwight isn't as big as many of its rivals, but it does offer a chance to gain growth and stability among the consumer staples stocks. Costco (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 0.9%There's no secret that AMZN and e-commerce are disrupting the model for many retailers. But for those stores that have cult-like followings and offer something different, the times continue to boom. This includes warehouse club Costco (NASDAQ:COST).Shopping at COST is quite frankly an event. Sure, there's the bulk offerings, but there's also plenty of one-time or limited deals, specialty products and its signature Kirkland brand. You literally can get everything from diamond rings to snow tires. And consumers continue to pay some big bucks to be able to access all those deals. COST memberships clock in at about 98.5 million worldwide and even better is that the current membership renewal rate is about 90%.This creates a stable and predictable base of cash flows for COST. We're talking $3.4 billion in fee revenue alone. That's also perfect for conservative investors.Thanks to rising sales and those hefty fees, COST has become a dividend machine. Since 2004, Costco has raised its payout by 540%. Even better is that COST has a history of paying special dividends to its investors. With cash on its balance sheet growing and management hinting at the cash in their &quot;back pocket,&quot; another payout could be on the way.For conservative investors, COST's level of cash generation can't be beaten in the consumer staples sector.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt was long AMZN stock.

Indeed, the average U.S. household will spend nearly $1,500 this holiday season. More impressively 78% of shoppers intend to spend the same or more than they did last year. Obviously, this has strong implications for consumer stocks to buy.Some of the key points that Deloitte brought up are as follows:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * E-commerce may grow sales to between 14%-18%.  * Those with higher income levels have increasingly elected to shop online.  * High spenders, or those will spend more than $2,100, may account for 60% of total holiday cash outlays.  * High spenders will allocate 71% of their funds to socializing and travel.That said, potential investors of consumer stocks should monitor macroeconomic headwinds, such as the U.S.-China trade war. Because of the myriad problems pressuring our economy, I haven't been the biggest fan of retail-centric names lately. Therefore, keep in mind that you may need to exit these names quicker than usual.  * 7 Top-Notch REITs to Buy for Income Still, heading into the biggest retail season of the year, this is an ideal time to benefit from this sector. On that note, here are eight consumer retail stocks to buy before the Thanksgiving holiday. Amazon (AMZN)Source: mirtmirt / Shutterstock.com Typically, e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hits out of the ballpark. Unfortunately, its most recent third-quarter earnings report didn't quite live up to Wall Street's increasingly high expectations. Missing on its earnings-per-share target, AMZN stock was volatile following the disclosure.Nevertheless, I 100% agree with our InvestorPlace's Chris Markoch, who urged readers to go long AMZN stock despite the earnings miss. As Markoch states, Amazon's management team had invested significantly toward expanding its operational scope. Such measures don't come cheaply, but they are beneficial to the company's longer-term prospects.As far it relates to consumer stocks to buy, you've got to like AMZN stock here. Again, based on Deloitte's analysis, retail experts predict e-commerce sales to jump double digits from last year. Of course, Amazon will capture a good chunk of that pie.Also, Amazon is disrupting almost every component of the retail chain. Therefore, AMZN is easily one of the best consumer stocks to buy. Costco (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com The U.S.-China trade war's implications have weighed heavily on the broader consumer sector. Because China is an export-driven economy, with much of their products heading stateside, a protracted conflict hurts both sides. Thus, names in the retail and consumer segment have faltered. However, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and COST stock presents a rare sector opportunity.While it's natural to be leery about consumer stocks to buy in this environment, COST stock consistently proves doubters wrong. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up 39%. Although this performance isn't exactly unique, Costco shares have consistently moved higher throughout the year. In other words, this is predictable performance from a workhorse.  * 7 AI Stocks to Buy to Profit from the Recent Tech Correction Furthermore, you've got to love COST stock if what Deloitte had to say about well-heeled shoppers rings true. According to a report earlier this year from CNBC, Costco shoppers have an average income of $92,236. To put that into perspective, the average American earns $56,516. Uber (UBER)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Although one of the most hyped and anticipated initial public offerings, Uber (NYSE:UBER) admittedly hasn't impressed recently. The UBER stock price sits right above $33. That's significantly below its IPO price of $45, contradicting what I called a transformative investment.For those that are wondering, I still hold this view. Sure, UBER stock has incurred many challenges, not the least of which is a serious cash burn problem. I concede that stakeholders may need to wait a bit longer than I expected to see positive momentum. Nevertheless, over the long run, these cash outlays are painful but necessary ones for continued expansion, disruption and dominance.Moreover, we may see a holiday bump with UBER stock. One of the points that Deloitte made was that high spenders will spend substantially on travel and socializing events. If so, such a dynamic will play perfectly into Uber's hands. After all, we should enjoy our holidays responsibly. Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com Speaking of responsible enjoyment, this is a great time to mention Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). One of the consumer stocks to buy firmly on the vice spectrum, BUD stock is nevertheless incredibly relevant at this time of the year and for obvious reasons.Like many of my fellow red-blooded Americans, I like to knock back a few during the festivities. But I had no clue collectively how much we enjoy imbibing when the weather cools down. According to BeverageDaily.com, the average American adult doubles his or her intake between Thanksgiving and New Year's. This is a huge plus for BUD stock.However, I'd be remiss not to point out that shares have turned volatile recently. Due to a disappointing earnings performance coupled with growth fears in the U.S. and China markets, BUD stock tanked badly. Therefore, if you want to consider other alcoholic-beverages companies, that may be prudent.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With 100% Upside Potential That said, Bud Light is the most popular beer in the U.S. (despite the fact that it's absolutely disgusting). With funds tight during the holidays, though, this factor could benefit BUD stock. Altria (MO)Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Another interesting but risky name to consider among consumer stocks is Altria (NYSE:MO). Even on its best days, MO stock is a controversial investment because of its underlying product. The ongoing vaping crisis really put the hammer on its market value. Between April and September, Altria shares formed a decisively bearish trend channel.However, at least for the time being, you may want to have another look at MO stock. Although the holidays present a time for us to gather with friends and family, they're also incredibly stressful. As the University of Southern California's Keck Medicine explained, stress can trigger a social smoker or past smoker to &quot;light up.&quot; Further, as we discussed with Anheuser-Busch, &quot;alcohol can lower inhibitions, which can make a person more likely to smoke, when they otherwise wouldn't.&quot;Although it's painfully cynical, many folks just don't have the tools to abstain indefinitely. As with alcoholic-beverage companies, MO stock can benefit from the upcoming holiday environment. CarMax (KMX)Source: Shutterstock Generally speaking, automakers have had a dark cloud hanging over them. From the trade war to declining interest in automobile ownership, the sector doesn't have much confidence right now. However, the secondary or used-car market is thriving, if CarMax (NYSE:KMX) and KMX stock are any indication.If you think about it, this dynamic makes logical sense. As Business Insider contributor Arjun Reddy pointed out, debt-strapped millennials make buying a new car less tenable. Furthermore, ride-hailing and self-driving vehicles impose longer-term risks for the auto industry.Still, people need transportation, especially if you live in a state like California which doesn't feature robust public transportation. In this situation, used cars make plenty of sense. You're saving significant money on depreciation costs, which can account for 30% or more off a new sticker price. That alone drives demand for KMX stock.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold Through 2020 Additionally, CarMax takes some of the guesswork and anxiety out of buying used cars. Along with its no-haggle pricing, you can buy extended warranties, giving you peace of mind. This too explains why KMX stock has enjoyed a great year in 2019. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Several years ago, you'd expect a company like Kroger (NYSE:KR) to provide consistently stable returns. As a necessary staple, KR stock represents one of the most important consumer stocks to buy. No matter how much you love your smartphone and other digital gadgets, you can't eat them.Among the biggest concerns is rising competition and the steadily encroaching threat of online grocery shopping. Currently, most people prefer to shop in stores for their groceries, which benefits Kroger and similar consumer stocks to buy. However, online delivery options are becoming more plentiful and are offering cheaper delivery rates.Therefore, KR stock can't ignore the e-commerce threat. Still, there's an opportunity here to buy KR stock to advantage the holiday season. With the various festivities involved, people will flock to grocery stores, especially for last-minute items. As well, if the economy falls into recession, online deliveries will probably take a hit due to their higher costs. Beyond Meat (BYND)Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com Full disclosure: I'm a skeptic of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND). Although I love the idea of eating a juicy hamburger that's actually a vegetable, I'm lost with the details. Arguably, Beyond Meat-branded meats are healthier than the real thing, but they're not health foods. In fact, they're highly processed foods saturated with fats.Like my dad always says, if it's too good to be true, it usually is. Shortly after InvestorPlace published my article on Beyond Meat, BYND stock began to dip, then later nosedived. Since the date of publication, shares have dropped over 33%.But now that BYND stock has had time to remove some of its excesses, a speculative trading opportunity may exist. With the Thanksgiving holiday coming up, it's an opportunity for meat-alternative advocates to evangelize their platform. Thus, Beyond Meat makes for an interesting discounted play among consumer stocks to buy.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-30,"A common element shared by many great dividend stocks that raise their payouts through good times and bad: a low-risk business model that drives recurring revenues. Some of the market's most consistent stock picks have subscription-based models, or razor-razorblade models that generate repeat sales of consumables.Gillette, now part of Procter & Gamble (PG), pioneered the razor-razorblade model as a way to build recurring sales it could count on and plan around. But it wasn't alone. Printer manufacturers HP Inc. (HPQ) and Seiko Epson (SEKEF) used a similar approach, selling inkjet printers with replaceable ink cartridges. Keurig, now part of Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP), rose to fame by selling Keurig machine that brewed single-serve K-Cup pods. More recently, tech companies have discovered the benefits of putting customers on subscription models and setting them to &quot;autopay,&quot; leveraging cloud-based services to generate recurring fees.In a CFO Research/Salesforce survey of senior finance executives, more than half of respondents said 40% or more of their company's revenues were subscription- or usage-based. And why not? Profits become more predictable. Customer turnover is reduced because of high switching costs. You can also achieve greater operating efficiency thanks to more predictable demand. Recurring sales also often deliver higher margins, enhancing the bottom line. And finally, many investors prefer less risk, and can be enticed to giving higher valuations to companies with more predictable financial results.Just ask Adobe Systems (ADBE), which launched its Creative Cloud in April 2012. Revenues have spiked from $4.4 billion in 2012 to $9.0 billion last year. The stock has shot up 700% since then - a performance six times greater than the S&P; 500.What other companies are harnessing recurring revenues?

2019-11-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has $128 billion of cash. There is almost no purchase too large for the company — in fact, large is exactly what investors are waiting for. And yet, the only stock Berkshire bought last quarter was a dinky retailer, RH.Berkshire disclosed in a regulatory filing Thursday that it took a $212 million stake in RH, a California-based home-furnishings chain valued at $3.3 billion. Buffett could even buy the entire company and it’d still be a puny deal for him. But it was a big deal for RH, because the shares surged 9% in after-hours trading and held near that level early Friday morning.I admit I didn’t even recognize the retailer’s name at first. RH used to be called Restoration Hardware, a place that sells $6,000 linen sofas and elongated wooden dining tables with “forthright silhouettes.” The company shrank its name and supersized its stores, an effort to target a more upscale clientele. It’s even installed some on-site restaurants, a little nourishment to help one ponder a new addition to the ski house. That’s partly what makes RH such a funny investment for Buffett. Not only is the billionaire known for his down-to-earth lifestyle — he’s lived in the same fairly modest house for more than 60 years — but he’s also usually drawn to businesses that mirror the America he sees from his unassuming Omaha office: railroads, truck stops, Dairy Queens, the Nebraska Furniture Mart. Furthermore, Berkshire tends not to waste time on minority stakes in small, specialty chains; its only other retail holdings are Amazon.com Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp., companies valued at $870 billion and $134 billion, respectively. RH was the only new position Berkshire took in the latest quarter, aside from buying common shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp., in which it already purchased $10 billion of preferred equity (part of a financing deal to assist the oil and gas explorer in its takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.). All in all, it was another dull period for Berkshire, whose last splashy stock pick was Amazon earlier in the year. With U.S. equities still on the rise, Buffett, 89, and his investing deputies are struggling to find cheap candidates. Whoever made the call on RH — Todd Combs, Ted Weschler or the Oracle himself — he may have had prescient timing. At the end of May, RH’s price-to-earnings ratio hit a low, and the shares have doubled since then, taking a big leg up in September. That said, RH’s overnight gains drove the shares above analysts’ average target level, which is $181 apiece. “The business remains tough to predict and we believe expectations may now be somewhat elevated,” Bobby Griffin, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates who has the equivalent of a “hold” rating on RH, wrote in a Sept. 11 report, citing the China tariffs and a slowdown in high-end U.S. housing. Similarly, Gordon Haskett Research Advisors wrote to clients Sept. 10 that the firm finds other retailers such as Wayfair Inc., Williams-Sonoma Inc. and At Home Group Inc. more attractive. At the end of the day, though, no matter how RH performs, it won’t have much of an impact on Berkshire’s portfolio. Another quarter has passed without a major acquisition by Berkshire, its cash pile hitting a record yet again. RH may sell a $449 wool felt elephant, but it isn’t the kind of elephant Buffett is after. The wait continues.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-11-27,"There's little denying the so-called smart money on Wall Street has earned its reputation over time. And with this group's elite purchasing Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Wayfair (NYSE:W) and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) the past couple of quarters, it's time to follow those footsteps.Hedge fund Tiger Global Management is among the best in the business. Over the past three years its investments have led it to a best-in-breed ranking among large institutional investors with holdings of more than $10 billion. Specifically, the fund has returned nearly 22.50% annually since 2016. And over the past decade, this smart money operator has captured annualized gains of almost 18%.Sure, it would be easy enough to resent Tiger Global Management for generating its market-beating returns. The firm has resources and talent most of us can only dream about. And that can amount to an uneven playing field.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality But when it comes to BYND, W and NEWR stock, I suggest not getting mad. Instead, use the price chart strategically and get ready to beat the smart money at their own game. Smart Money Stocks to Buy: Beyond Meat (BYND)Source: Charts by TradingView Tiger Global's latest 13F filing revealed the fund recently picked up 175,000 shares of faux-meat producer Beyond Meat. Today's investors are also on much stronger footing than the hedge fund after picking up shares north of $150 and possibly as high as nearly $240 during the period.Despite announcing a solid earnings beat in October, BYND stock tanked on worries tied to an expiring lockup period and competition entering the market. There's no guarantees BYND stock will prove to be the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Costco (NASDAQ:COST), let alone wildly profitable for the smart money. But for today's investors, that's also irrelevant. In the aftermath, this $5 billion market leader looks technically ready to sizzle.                                                   BYND Stock Strategy: This smart money stock is currently forming a two-week inside pattern consolidation within a bullish hammer backed by an oversold stochastics crossover pattern. This price action could also reasonably mark a higher-low variation of a classic double-bottom. My advice is to buy BYND stock if shares can rally above the pattern high of $83.50.I'd also recommend using a stop just beneath the pattern low and exit the position beneath $73.50 in BYND stock if necessary. Ultimately, Fibonacci supports have all failed already. Moreover, being able to capitalize on a deeper bottoming variation if that's what is in the cards, is a smart money move. Wayfair (W)Source: Charts by TradingView Wayfair is the market's top dog in e-commerce for home goods and furniture. During the third quarter, the smart money piled into 510,000 shares. As the monthly chart hints, Tiger Global is also down big-time on this position after earnings painted a mixed picture that was less-than-well-received by Wall Street.The good news for today's investors? There's no denying the decline in shares offers a nice opportunity to buy W stock as it challenges key technical support on the price chart. Right now, Wayfair is testing last December's ubiquitous bottom -- its lifetime 62% Fibonacci level and trendline support for the last couple years. Coupled with stochastics that are on the cusp of a bullish crossover signal, W stock earns its place as a smart money buy.  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy Now for the Future W Stock Strategy: My smart money recommendation would be to buy W stock on price confirmation of a monthly chart bottom. Conceivably, this could occur as early as next week. To contain downside risk off and on the price chart, setting a stop-loss beneath the pattern low is an equally smart money move. New Relic (NEWR)Source: Charts by TradingView In cloud-based software analytics outfit New Relic, Tiger Global sank its teeth into a meaty 2.92 million shares during the second quarter after shares were gutted following earnings. Of the three, NEWR stock also happens to be the smart money's only profitable long choice.For today's investors, the price chart suggests the smart money approach is to wait and similarly look to buy shares of New Relic on weakness. The weekly view hints NEWR stock is increasingly likely to turn lower in the near term. An overbought stochastics and challenge of former price support from 2018 makes shares prone to a pullback.NEWR Stock Strategy: Given our outlook, put NEW stock on the radar for purchase if a simple pullback pattern over the next couple to few weeks develops. I'd also suggest any future pattern-based entries are backed by a bullish stochastics setup. If those criteria are met, using the low of the pullback or an exit as loose as $54, with appropriate sizing, is another smart money move worth consideration.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-12-06,"I'd like to start this article on Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock by saying two really important things. First, Costco is as good as it gets in the retail world.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Costco has been dominant because it has utilized two successful retail models: the warehouse retail model, which is successful  because it optimizes convenience by putting everything under one roof and the membership retail model, which is successful because it enables Costco to sell goods at low prices. COST's high-margin membership fees make up for any profits the company loses by selling products for low prices.Second, Costco stock is a great long-term holding. In the long run, COST stock will hold its own against the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), and others. COST's market share in the continuous- growth North America retail market will naturally stay steady. Its margins will also remain largely stable. Thus, the company's  revenues and profits will march higher over time,  propelling  Costco stock higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut investors should not buy COST stock at its current levels.Costco stock has been on fire in 2019. The shares are up 44% in 2019 amid a plethora of positive developments. But, while Costco is a great company, Costco stock is dramatically overvalued at its current levels.Sure, hot stocks can keep going higher for a long time despite their high valuations  But there are multiple catalysts on the horizon which could cause investors to become concerned about the valuation of Costco stock, ultimately causing COST stock to drop by a large amount.  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends  Costco Stock Is OvervaluedPut very simply,  Costco stock is overvalued.Costco operates in the North American retail market, which is growing steadily, due to  population growth, labor force growth, and wage gains. But the retail market is not growing rapidly. U.S. retail sales have been rising all year long at a 3%-5% clip. Canadian retail sales have been growing at a 1%-4% clip. Thus, North American retail sales are currently increasing  1%-5%.Costco's  share of this market has been rising. Its comparable sales growth has been north of 5% for more than two years. It will likely continue to gain market share as the retail world consolidates around a few central players. But its revenue growth probably won't be too impressive. Costco's revenue growth has been stuck in the 5%-10% range for the past decade. It will stay stuck in that range for the foreseeable future.Its gross margins have peaked around 11%, as they haven't risen much in over two years. At the same time, Costco's comparable sales growth trends have slowed from about 7% in fiscal 2018, to about 6% in FY19 to roughly 5% in fiscal Q1. As a result, Costco's profitability hasn't climbed much. These dynamics should persist, so Costco's  margins are likely to be stable going forward.So, at best, Costco's earnings growth is likely to rise about 10% over the next several years. Costco stock trades at 34 times analysts' average forward earnings estimate. That is a ridiculously rich multiple for a retail stock. Simply consider that the entire consumer discretionary sector trades at a much lower forward earnings multiple  of 22, and its projected earnings growth rate  of 12% is higher than Costco's earnings growth.In other words, Costco's valuation has exceeded its fundamentals, and that makes COST stock dangerous. Negative Catalysts on the Horizon Present Huge RisksThe scary thing about Costco stock isn't its excessive valuation. Rather, it is the fact that there are multiple excessive catalysts on the horizon which could spark a major decline by COST stock.On the bright side, the economy and consumer spending are improving thanks to easing U.S.-China trade tensions. But, nonetheless, Costco's sales trends are deteriorating. Its comparable sales growth has slowed from about 7% in FY18 to roughly 6% in FY19 to 5% in Q1. The growth of the company's e-commerce sales has slowed from 20%-plus throughout most of 2018 and 2019 to less than 20% over the past three months.In other words, Costco's growth has been slowing for years. At the same time, its margins could come under pressure because the company may be forced to invest more to offset rising e-commerce competition.So Costco stock could be hit with slowing growth and falling margins in 2020. That combination is a recipe for disaster for a richly valued growth stock. The Bottom Line on COST StockCostco stock is a long-term winner that's trading at a highly unattractive valuation. The game plan for COST stock, then, is simple. Let the company's slowing growth and stagnant margins pop the bubble of Costco stock in 2020 Then, once the stock falls back towards the $250 level, consider buying the shares on weakness.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long WMT.

2019-12-13,"It's difficult to lock down the absolute best stocks to buy for any year - but 2020 could be particularly challenging.For one, 2019's run-up has lifted stocks to sky-high prices only seen a handful of times in history. Also, the global economy is starting the year at a potential inflection point - growth has been weakening for months, but signals of a turnaround are starting to pop up. And the 2020 presidential cycle is almost certain to cause headaches for a number of politics-sensitive sectors.The year ahead could be every bit as volatile as 2019, if not moreso. Thus, the best stocks for 2020 will need to have not just decent-to-robust growth prospects, but a little durability too. That's quite the needle to thread ... but several companies do fit that bill.Here are the 20 best stocks to buy for 2020, rain or shine. A few of these possess typical defensive characteristics such as recession-resistant businesses and/or high dividend yields. A few possess qualities that could protect them from 2020-specific dangers, such as trade turbulence or the upcoming presidential elections. But all of them merit a place in most stock portfolios in the coming year. SEE ALSO: 20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of Retirement",The 20 Best Stocks to Buy for 2020

2019-12-20,"Everywhere you look, plant-based meat specialist Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is everywhere. From inking new deals with fast-food chains to getting on Costco Wholesale's (NASDAQ:COST) shelves, the company is turning its marketing machinery to &quot;11.&quot; Ultimately, if you're bullish on Beyond Meat stock, that's a positive because this is a marketing investment, not necessarily a food-related one.Source: Shutterstock If you analyze the alternative-meat market objectively, you'll realize that Beyond Meat isn't forwarding anything unique. However, it appears that they have.With all the hoopla surrounding the organization and its promotion of authentically tasting fake meats, I'm not surprised that BYND stock mooned the way it has. At the same time, I'm also not shocked that it cratered in October.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo believe in Beyond Meat stock, you've got to assume that the underlying company is different from every other competitor. Furthermore, you're betting that this time, the American public will finally resonate with plant-based meats. Lastly, this transition must develop at increasingly larger scales.Sure, BYND stock appears a no-brainer when you consider its groundbreaking deals, such as with Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) KFC, but will this popularity surge last? Looking at American culinary history, the situation doesn't look too hot. Beyond Meat Stock Not Unique by a Long ShotFrom the perspective of young Millennials, I can appreciate why many investors have jumped aboard BYND stock. For instance, American youth have pushed environmental concerns as a top priority. Beyond Meat invariably provides superior morals and greatly reduces the carbon footprint associated with the traditional meat industry.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 Again, this speaks to the marketing angle of Beyond Meat stock. Essentially, management is utilizing the language that most Millennials use frequently. And with this demographic being one of the company's key targets, they're doing an excellent job.But the reality is that alternative-meat products originated well before Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers, or even the Silent Generation. In 1896, businessman and religious advocate John Harvey Kellogg made a peanut-based &quot;meatless meat&quot; called Nuttose. Not only that, Kellogg went on to &quot;popularize cereal as an alternative to egg- and meat-heavy breakfasts.&quot;Interestingly, Kellogg was a member of a Christian denomination called the Seventh-day Adventists. In 1933, this religious group founded Loma Linda Foods. One of their claims to fame, if you will, is their soy- and wheat-based fake meats.Furthermore, a particularly popular (and reasonably priced) alternative meat company is Morningstar Farms. It specializes in black bean burgers, which I've been told is quite tasty. Because of this, it's also a natural competitor to BYND stock. By the way, Morningstar is under the Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) umbrella.I mention these things because anybody that's thinking about buying Beyond Meat stock should research this topic. In this country, fake meats have a long and storied history. Yet they really make up an insignificant presence in the overall meat market. Competition over a Small MarketWhen you read bullish articles about Beyond Meat stock, you'll more often than not come across the addressable market argument. That is, because the traditional meat industry is so large, BYND has an opportunity to convert meat-eaters. If successful in scale, this could skyrocket shares.Of course, I won't disagree with that logic. However, I'll say that this is a huge &quot;if.&quot;Last year, the global plant-based meat market was a $10.1 billion industry. Experts believe that this year will translate to an $11.6 billion industry. And by 2023, the alternative-meat sector should be worth over $20 billion.That's great and all but how does that compare to the traditional meat market? Honestly, not very well. In 2018, real meats brought in nearly $946 billion worldwide. This year, analyst forecasts call for $982.6 billion.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto In both annual comparisons, fake meats represented only a little over 1% of real meat sales.Moreover, by 2023, the global meat industry will generate a value of $1.14 trillion. Even with fake meat booming to $20 billion, that's less than 2% of its real counterpart.Now, proponents of BYND stock will counter that the underlying company's marketing machinery will convert large chunks of meat-eaters. That might be the case but I'm very skeptical.Since the 1990s, we've seen many companies promote their alternative-meat innovations. Some organizations found rousing success. Yet with more than a century of culinary achievements, fake meats haven't even scratched the traditional meat market share.This time could be different, but I doubt it. Some Food for Thought on BYND StockJohn Harvey Kellogg was a deeply spiritual man who strongly advocated clean living. Subsequently, most Christian denominations teach that believers refrain from the temptations of the flesh. Clearly, Kellogg took that lesson literally with his meatless meat inventions. Kellogg was also a staunch opponent of masturbation.However, people are people. Some may try the clean-living approach, but only a small minority will ever be successful. We as humans are addicted to the pleasures associated with eating flesh. And we can innately tell a counterfeit. That's why Kellogg ultimately failed in his attempt to change what we masticate.However, Beyond Meat would like you to believe that they've got the secret formula down. In the nearer term, the hype machine surrounding Beyond Meat stock makes it a possible bullish trade.But I'd be very careful about holding shares over the long run. Most people don't or can't deny their base instincts. A century of data augments this point.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-23,Costco (COST) remains one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered.,Will Costco Witness Decent Run on Bourses in the New Year?
2019-12-25,"With the new year fast approaching, now is a great time to evaluate your portfolio, rebalance and set yourself up for a profitable 2020. Unlike 2019, when uncertainty took the market lower and offered investors plenty of bargain buys at the start of the year, this year's market is trading near all-time highs. That makes stock picking difficult, especially as political uncertainty adds a layer of confusion in the year to come. It's difficult, but not impossible, to find potential winners in 2020. While the market is near all-time highs, some sectors -- like healthcare -- have remained relatively untouched by the impressive rally. Investors should also be on the lookout for firms backed by solid financials in case a recession is on the horizon. Here's a look at 10 stocks that look likely to deliver in 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Best Stocks: Disney (DIS)Source: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com Disney (NYSE:DIS) has already had a good run in 2019, but the mouse looks likely to keep up the good work in the year to come. Disney's recent streaming service rollout has positioned the firm to make major gains in 2020. More and more subscribers will join and get hooked on the firm's impressive content library. Credit Suisse sees Disney+ taking on some 20 million subscribers just by the end of the year.More importantly, though, is Disney's theme parks -- an often underrated part of the firm's business. Operating income in its parks segment increased by 11% from September 2018 to September 2019. While streaming should help boost DIS over the next decade, the revenue from its theme parks is bankrolling the firm in the near term. Costco (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com When it comes to retail, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the best picks out there because of the firm's unique business model. Costco sells its products more or less at cost and makes the majority of its revenue from membership fees. That's a good thing as the firm boasts some of the most loyal members on the planet. Renewal rates come in consistently above 90%. It's worth noting that COST isn't a cheap option. But that premium is buying a financially sound company with a low debt-to-equity ratio. Unlike many of its competitors, Costco is still seeing strong in-store traffic. In the coming year Costco should benefit from higher membership fees, as well as new stores in Asia picking up steam, making it a great stock to own moving into 2020. CVS Health (CVS)Source: QualityHD / Shutterstock.com Healthcare stocks have been skittish this year as Democratic candidates argue over how to best overhaul the industry. The prospect of universal healthcare isn't ideal for healthcare businesses, but any large-scale changes to the industry are unlikely to take effect until 2022 or later should President Donald Trump be defeated.With that in mind, healthcare is a great place to look for reasonable valuations and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is my pick in that industry. CVS's position as a one-stop shop in the healthcare space makes it a unique play, and the benefits of its Aetna acquisition are just starting to show. Plus, CVS's setup as a retail pharmacy, a private benefit manager and an insurance network means the firm will be able to offer its clients cost savings. That's a positive as the industry evolves. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com When it comes to chipmakers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is hands-down your best bet. 2019 was a bumpy one for the industry as a whole, and 2020 could bring about more of the same as competition remains a concern among investors. However with the U.S.-China trade tension moving in the right direction, chipmakers should see tailwinds in the year to come.Aside from easing concerns about China, NVDA has several growth catalysts ahead in 2020. The firm's Tegra SoCs chips have been used in Nintendo's (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Switch and Switch Lite devices, both of which have seen strong demand this holiday season. Its data center business is also thriving against competitors and poised for more growth in the New Year.NVDA's forecast for the fourth quarter means its upcoming results are likely to disappoint, but that could offer investors a better entry point heading into 2020. But for those looking for a long-term pick in the semiconductor industry, NVDA is it. Visa (V)Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com Another great long-term bet is Visa (NYSE:V). The credit card firm is likely to benefit from the rise of non-cash payments over the next decade. V has been building up its business to make the most of the growing popularity of electronic payments with several strategic acquisitions in 2019. The firm picked up Earthport (a cross-border payment company), Payworks (a payment gateway firm) and Verifi (a dispute resolution business), all over the past 12 months. The benefits of those purchases should start to pay off in the year to come.Plus Visa has a history of shareholder friendliness. Though the firm offers a comparatively minuscule dividend yield of 0.7%, Visa management has consistently raised its dividend over the past five years. Plus, the the firm has bought back an average of $2 billion shares each quarter in an effort to return value to its shareholders. AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com If there was one stock to add to your portfolio ahead of 2020, AT&T (NYSE:T) would be it. The stock has gained roughly 37% this year, but that's only the tip of the iceberg as the telecom giant continues to execute on its massive turnaround plans.T is building out a multi-dimensional company that is able to offer customers a variety of bundled products and services. Not only will AT&T be able to offer a 5G network, but its massive library of content through WarnerMedia will also be a draw for customers. Another benefit to holding T stock in your long-term portfolio is the firm's generous 5.4% dividend yield. That dividend should soften any turbulence in the year ahead. Tanger Factory Outlets (SKT)Source: Ritu Manoj Jethani / Shutterstock.com Retail is a risky place to put your money in 2020, especially if you're talking about brick-and-mortar stores. However I'd make an exception for Tanger Factory Outlets (NYSE:SKT), whose dividend yield and valuation are simply too good to ignore. SKT's share price has been on a steady decline throughout the year as worries about dropping store traffic weighed on the sector as a whole.Tanger's portfolio of outlet stores offers some security, though, as it provides a shopping experience for bargain hunters. SKT also boasts occupancy rates of more than 90% as retailers take up residence in order to off-load past season inventory. The biggest reason SKT makes the cut as a long-term buy is its 9.5% dividend yield. Baidu (BIDU)Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com 2020 could be a great year for Chinese stocks as the nation's economy has started to show signs of life and trade tension with the U.S. continues to ease. Chinese stocks have already started to come back in favor among U.S. investors. And that trend should continue as long as trade negotiations remain positive.Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is my pick among Chinese stocks, though it's worth noting that it is one of the riskier choices on this list. This year BIDU has lost roughly 20% of its value as competition and worries about the Chinese economy weighed on investor sentiment. However, the firm has been investing in artificial intelligence to improve its search functions and voice recognition.Plus Baidu is also working to develop an autonomous driving platform. This won't help BIDU stock in the immediate future, but could pay off in the longer term.The bottom line on Baidu is that although its advertising business has started to slow, the firm is working to diversify its offerings and beef up its search business to make a comeback over the next few years. Aphria (APHA)Source: Shutterstock Marijuana stocks have been beaten down this year as investor enthusiasm about growth in the sector waned amid regulatory issues. While wide-scale marijuana legalization isn't likely to happen in the near term, it's all but inevitable in the long term. Picking a winning marijuana stock right now is a tricky business, but Aphria (NYSE:APHA) looks like the best of the bunch.The firm has been able to turn a profit, something most other pot stocks are far from doing. And APHA is expected to continue growing in the years to come. Aphria is expected to double its production capacity in the year ahead under a new cultivation license. If the firm can remain profitable while expanding its output, the stock will likely see a bump in the year to come. Exxon (XOM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Next year could be a big one for oil stocks as oversupply issues diminish. Production growth is expected to slow in the U.S. and other non-OPEC countries, which would be positive for prices. Goldman Sachs' Brian Singer sees the price of Brent crude rising to $63 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate increasing to $58.50 as inventory levels decline.To take advantage of the improving environment, investors may want to add one of the majors to their portfolios. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) looks like a winner after the firm has been investing in increasing its production over the past year. Exxon also offers a relatively safe 5% dividend yield. That should help cushion the stock should the rise in oil prices not materialize as quickly as expected.As of this writing Laura Hoy was long XOM, T and NVDA More From InvestorPlace * 2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid * 10 2019 Losers That Will Be 2020 Winners * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now * 5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider The post 10 Best Stocks to Beat the Market in 2020 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",10 Best Stocks to Beat the Market in 2020

2019-12-27,"Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) offers both hope and signs of trouble. Its alternative meat products have won over consumers. As a result, both grocery stores and restaurant chains have begun to offer its products. However, this stands in stark contrast to the stock, which has lost most of its value since July.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Analysts also see indications that the direction of the equity bodes poorly for the future of the company. Although stock trends and financials alone could cause investors to sell, another often-ignored dynamic could lead to further selling in Beyond Meat.Admittedly, the narrative of this enterprise appears compelling at first glance. The company's product has reviewed well. And, of course, we hear frequently about millennials and their carbon footprint concerns. They see plant-based meat as a viable alternative with a lighter environmental impact.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, it continues to gain traction in the mainstream food business. The company's products will soon come to Costco (NASDAQ:COST), and its offerings appear at Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Whole Foods and other major grocery chains. Also, a recent positive trial at a KFC should help to bring the thousands of Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) restaurants on board. Investors should also note that alternative products such as black bean burgers have developed some degree of long-term staying power.However, staying power is not success, and the stock of Beyond Meat has demonstrated this point well. After hitting a high of $239.71 per share in July, it dropped precipitously. The price of the equity began to plateau in November. Still, the current share price of just over $77 per share represents a drop of about two-thirds.Despite that decline, this equity still appears overvalued. It currently trades at around 20.5 times sales. Moreover, Wall Street predicts that the company will begin to turn a profit next year. Still, that means the El Segundo, California-based producer of plant-based meats supports a forward price-to-earnings ratio of more than 200. Consider Human NatureHowever, I think the story of this company touches on an underlying and underrated dynamic that drives the market -- human nature. Bets consistent with human nature tend to succeed, and those going against it stand a good chance of failure. This shows up well in the tobacco industry. Although the public continues to malign cigarettes, addiction is human nature, and this drives stocks such as Altria (NYSE:MO). This stands in contrast to Beyond Meat, whose product stands against such impulses.InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto states this point a different way. His article points out the 100-plus-year record of failure for meat alternatives. He also mentions that the meat industry is more than 90 times larger than the market for plant-based meat.Even the Dalai Lama, a one-time vegetarian, now incorporates a small amount of meat in his diet. This confirms the power of human nature over political, dietary and yes, even religious convictions. For investors wary of the &quot;it's different this time&quot; narrative, this looks like an equity to avoid.Moreover, meat producers such as Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and Hormel (NYSE:HRL) plan to offer a plant-based alternative. Still, this will likely become a niche product for them at best. This also does not address the fact that this will mean more competition for Beyond Meat, giving investors yet another reason to sell.In the end, history points to outright failure or limited success at best. The future hints at struggles as larger food companies become more direct competitors, while multiples indicate that the overvaluation remains. Given these factors, the stock of this company looks like an unhealthy choice for investors. Concluding ThoughtsBeyond Meat is a bet against both long-term valuation trends and human nature itself. The stock has fallen by more than two-thirds since the summer. It remains overvalued despite this huge drop. Moreover, the history of the market shows that betting against human nature is usually not a winning strategy. The history of meat alternatives has met with failure, or at best, limited success.The stock of Beyond Meat still has some sizzle. However, due to high multiples and the enduring (and sometimes begrudging) love for meat, investors who buy at these levels will more likely get grilled.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-12-31,"Uncertainty heading into a presidential election cycle, a continued trade war with China (it's only a &quot;Phase One&quot; agreement, after all) and potentially sluggish U.S. economic growth has many Wall Street analysts recommending investors rotate into defensive stocks. And unsurprisingly, consumer staples stocks are getting the nod heading into 2020.It makes sense. Consumer staples stocks - which provide things that people need on a near-daily basis, from food to toiletries - make excellent investments in virtually every economic environment, but they're especially attractive during economic slowdowns. That's because people simply can't cut back on consumer staples like they can other products. As a result, the sector has historically outperformed the broader market during downturns.&quot;We expect the market to vacillate between a pro-cyclical outcome and a defensive one as data comes in and trade tensions and the election evolve,&quot; Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients in early December. &quot;We slightly favor the more defensive outcome given our well below the consensus forecast for S&P; 500 earnings growth next year.&quot;Admittedly, if we get another bull run like we did in 2019, consumer staples might lag a bit. While their 2019 total return (price plus dividends) through Dec. 30 of 27.3% is far better than their 12-year average annual return of 10.4%, it still was about three percentage points behind the S&P; 500&#92;. However, if the market gets choppy, and especially if a correction or bear move is in the cards, expect this sector to shine.Against that backdrop, here are the best consumer staples stocks to buy for 2020. These picks, which include a pair of funds, offer an ideal combination of growth, downside protection and yield that should come in handy if turbulence kicks up in 2020.

That's down from 80% recorded in 2017, showing that the winner of shoppers has been Walmart.Thanks to its efforts across its e-commerce platform, WMT is starting to seriously turn the tide in the world of retail. And, thanks to its already in place vast distribution network, grocery pick-up operations, BOPIS and quick shipping options, Walmart has become a tour de force in the new age of retail. In fact, during its last reported quarter, online sales jumped by 41%. As Walmart gets ready to post its sales and earnings from the holiday season, expectations are already running high that the company will continue a torrid pace of growth. And there's every reason to expect that will happen.The company continues to try new things with e-commerce, and has been boosting its online grocery operations. This includes improving its produce selection and considering building so-called &quot;dark stores&quot; that are strictly used for online ordering and pick-up in order to reduce congestion at some its more popular store locations. Meanwhile, WMT is willing to buy out successful online retailers to boost sales and gain some valuable tech.All in all, WMT has the cash to really compete in the world of online and in-store shopping. And that makes it a prime retail stock to own in 2020. Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock When your main shoppers are fanatics, it's pretty easy to win over the holiday season and beyond. That sums up the case for warehouse club Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Shopping at Costco remains quite the event -- with plenty of one-time or limited deals, specialty products, its signature Kirkland brand and we can't forget those rotisserie chickens.Because of this, the company continues to execute retail the right way,and that showed up in its latest holiday numbers. For the five weeks ending Jan. 5, Costco managed to report an 10.5% increase in net sales. While new international stores did help on that front, the real driver was e-commerce sales. It turns out, making the pivot towards omnichannel retail is pretty simple when your operation is already based on warehouses. E-commerce growth at the chain grew by 20 percentage points over the holiday period.The beauty is that Costco continues to rack up members for warehouse clubs. As of the first quarter of this year, the club featured nearly 100 million members worldwide. Furthermore, their current membership renewal rate is about 91% in the U.S. and Canada, and those members send about $3.5 billion in cash into Costco's fees ever year.  * Forget Lockheed Martin, Buy These 5 Smaller Defense Stocks Instead The end result is a strong, cult-like retailer that is successfully navigating the new omnichannel environment. And because of that, Costco will continue to be one of the top retail stocks for portfolios in 2020, as it is just hitting all the right switches for further growth. The TJX Companies (TJX)Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com Walmart is known for its low prices, and Costco is know for its fanatical customers. However, there is a way to get both with one retail stock -- and that's TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). For TJX, the combination is creating an amazing retailer that, despite not really having an online presence, is just killing it with shoppers.Operating TJ Maxx, Marshall's, Home Goods and other store brands, TJX is a buyer of closet apparel and home furnishings. When Macy's can't unload full-price shirts, TJX buys them for dirt cheap. The secret is that the stores mix of goods constantly change.Because of this, it creates a sort of treasure hunt for the so-called &quot;Maxxinistas.&quot; They are the ones who keep coming back to the store to find high-quality merchandise at cheap prices. The strategy has worked for a long time, but is increasingly working now as consumers have become more price sensitive.In the third quarter, TJX Companies' reported revenue increased by 6% year-over-year to more than $10.5 billion. Even better, foot traffic has been great, as comparative store sales grew by 4% for the quarter. This still impressive considering last year at this time, TJX saw a big 7% jump in the same metric.Already, TJX has mentioned strong preliminary results for the holiday season. The truth is that Americans want good merchandise at deep discounts, and they are willing to go to physical retail locations to get just that.With continued sales growth, strong cash flows and a growing dividend, TJX stock has the goods to keep rewarding shareholders throughout the future.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt was long AMZN stock.

2020-02-07,"Reynolds Consumer Products (NASDAQ:REYN), the maker of Hefty trash bags and Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil, sold 47.2 million shares at $26 each on January 30 for proceeds of $1.2 billion. The first billion-dollar listing of 2020, it is the largest offering by a household goods company.Source: iStockphoto The company marketed its stock at a price range of $25 to $28 a share. On the first day of trading, Reynolds stock gained a respectable 9.8%, closing at $28.55. While it didn't quite meet the first-day open of 1Life Healthcare (NASDAQ:ONEM), an operator of primary care clinics in the U.S. which gained 58% in its trading debut, Reynolds did show that boring names can deliver the goods for investors.Reynolds products aren't sexy, but it believes it's got a compelling investment thesis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;What's attractive to investors about our company is steady proven growth over a long period of time,&quot; Reynolds Chief Executive Officer Lance Mitchell said in an interview. &quot;We have a very consistent, durable demand and investment thesis that's compelling.&quot;  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends Here are seven reasons you shouldn't buy into the Reynolds IPO hype. Don't Buy The Hype: IPO Investors Got HosedSource: Shutterstock Reynolds, as I said in the intro, sold its shares to the public for $26 each. Based on 202.6 million shares outstanding after the IPO, it went public with a market cap of $5.3 billion. As I write this, it's trading above $30, an $800 million increase in its market cap in just three days of trading. That gives Reynolds an enterprise value of $8.5 billion on a pro forma basis.If you turn to page 51 of its prospectus, you will see that Graeme Hart, the company's owner and chief beneficiary of its IPO, contributed $77.2 million in equity to control 77% of the company post-IPO. For anyone that's counting, he paid 50 cents a share for his ownership stake.Meanwhile, IPO investors paid $1.2 billion or 26 cents a share for the remaining 23% of the company. That's quite a deal. Hart's $77.2 million investment is now worth $4.7 billion. How did he get to this point?Hart's private equity firm, Rank Group, acquired Reynolds from Alcoa (NYSE:AA) in December 2007 for $2.7 billion, much of the payment made with borrowed funds.In 2018, Hart said the following about his leveraged buyout strategy:&quot;Be bold,&quot; Hart said in a speech at his alma mater in New Zealand. &quot;That means buy as big as you can, borrow as much as you can and then work the asset as hard as you can.&quot;He did that at the expense of those buying IPO shares. It's Got a Ton of DebtSource: Photo from CreditRepairExpert Source: Shutterstock As I stated previously, a big chunk of the purchase from Alcoa was made with borrowed funds. Then, in 2010, Reynolds acquired Pactiv Corp., the maker of Hefty trash bags, for $4.4 billion and the assumption of $1.5 billion in debt. That was a significant acquisition for Reynolds because today, Hefty accounts for 46% of the company's overall revenue. Without it, Reynolds wouldn't have nearly as interesting a story to tell IPO investors. As the &quot;Use of Proceeds&quot; section states, Reynolds will use the net proceeds to pay down some of the $4.1 billion in debt it had before its IPO. It has arranged a new term loan facility of $2.475 billion, of which $2.45 billion of it will replace the old debt. It will also have a new $250 million revolving facility that is undrawn as of the IPO.The long and the short of it is that the company's long-term debt hasn't changed, but Hart and his related companies have gotten the funds they borrowed to buy and grow Reynolds repaid.   * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends Again, remember that $77 million is all it took to build a company with an $8.5 billion enterprise value. Very Little GrowthSource: Shutterstock Source: Who is Danny / Shutterstock.com As CEO Mitchell stated in the interview I referenced in the introduction, Reynolds has a history of proven growth over a long period. For this reason, he believes Reynolds is a compelling investment.I see things a little differently. In 2014, Reynolds had sales of $2.72 billion. In 2018, it had annual sales of $2.81 billion. That's a compound annual growth of less than 1% in a period of reasonably healthy economic expansion. In my eyes, that's anemic growth, at best. The company's prospectus brags that of its four key areas of focus, two of them: Cost Reduction and Automation, have to do with cutting costs rather than growing the top line. Meanwhile, Reynolds' adjusted EBITDA grew from $523 million in 2014 to $647 million in 2018, a 5.5% CAGR. That, too, isn't what you would call hitting the leather off the ball.Sure, the company discusses paying out a quarterly dividend of 22 cents a share, but I suspect in 2-3 years, that will be the only thing attractive about REYN stock.  Little Growth at a Reasonable PriceSource: Who is Danny / Shutterstock.com In the first nine months ended September 30, 2019, Reynold's adjusted EBITDA grew by 4.2% over the same period a year earlier, 130 basis points lower than its four-year average. I'll assume Reynolds' 5.5% growth rate stays intact for 2019. That works out to adjusted EBITDA of $674 million, which means its enterprise value of $8.5 billion is almost 13 times EBITDA.That's certainly not expensive when compared to other household products companies. However, the likelihood of the company's adjusted EBITDA growing at a pace that keeps up with its market cap and debt accumulation growth, suggests its valuation could get expensive in a hurry. Further, Reynolds' 2018 free cash flow was $448 million. If we assume it will be 10% higher in 2019, you get $493 million. Based on an $8.5 billion enterprise value, its free cash flow yield is 5.8%. That too isn't half bad. Again, just as in the case of adjusted EBITDA, it's likely not going to be increasing its free cash flow each year at the same pace as its market cap and debt accumulation, which means its free cash flow yield won't get more attractive in the years to come. This means you're buying REYN stock today for little growth at a reasonable price. Tomorrow, you'll be getting a low growth for a nosebleed valuation.   * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends There are much better buys given the risk/reward profile. Innovation Can't Happen Fast EnoughOne of Reynolds' business strategies is to drive growth through new and innovative products. To that end, it says that 21% of its revenue in fiscal 2018 was from products that were less than three years old, exceeding its annual goal of 20%.Source: Shutterstock In the prospectus, it mentions several innovative products, including the Hefty Ultra Strong product line, which was named one of 2018's most innovative products, according to Nielsen. In fact, it mentions the words innovation or innovative 101 times in the prospectus. The problem is all companies push innovation these days. In its fourth-quarter conference call, Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) management mentioned these same words a total of 12 times. &quot;We've really picked up the pace of innovation for vitamins. If you look at '17 and '18, we kind of averaged six new items a year, we had 22 new items in 2019, we got 17 more coming in 2020,&quot; stated Church & Dwight CEO Matthew Farrell. Reynolds sells aluminum foil, garbage bags, food and storage bags, party cups, etc. Innovation can be a good soundbyte, but there's not a whole lot of change the company can bring to the table. It's a Controlled CompanyAs I mentioned previously, New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart owns 77% of Reynolds post-IPO (74% if the over-allotment is exercised). This means that Hart will be able to act in his own best interests rather than the company.Source: Shutterstock I realize that it doesn't make sense for someone to act against the best interests of a company they control because, ultimately, they might want to sell it. However, it happens more often than people realize. It's one thing to have a significant stake in a business, but when it's more than 50% of the outstanding shares, corporate governance often goes out the window.As an interesting aside, page 32 of the prospectus states that two subsidiaries of RGHL Group, which is owned by Graeme Hart, have defined benefit pension plans that are currently underfunded by $900 million. Should things go sideways with these pensions, Reynolds could find itself in the middle of a nasty lawsuit because it's a controlled company.   * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends Now, the likelihood of this happening is remote, but it's something to consider when considering this slow-growth business,   International Expansion Going Will Be ToughSource: Shutterstock Reynolds cooking and baking division generates a small amount of revenue outside the U.S. Here in Canada, where I live, it owns the Alcan brand of aluminum foil. It's very popular at Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Outside North America, it has the Diamond brand. In total, the company sells its wares in 54 different countries. However, it is the U.S. and Canada that account for 99% of its sales. It estimates that its addressable market outside North America is $7.2 billion. Based on $2.98 billion in 2018 annual sales, its international revenues were $298 million or just 4% of its estimated addressable market. While this seems like an obvious area of expansion for the company, it's important to remember that it participates in product categories that aren't exactly cutting edge or new to the world. Established brands outside North America aren't going to give up market share just because it says Reynolds or Hefty on the box. Whatever profitability Reynolds currently enjoys could partly disappear if it were to up spending outside North America. Therefore, I believe investors must view this opportunity as a double-edged sword. Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.

The market experienced wild trading in futures and also powerful moves in the regular session as the stock market attempted to recover losses that helped to produce the three major benchmarks' worst weekly declines since the 2008 financial crisis, pushing the benchmarks into correction, widely defined as a decline of at least 10%, but less than 20%, from a recent peak.

2020-03-02,"Costco Wholesale Corp.  shares soared 9.3% in Monday trading after an Oppenheimer note indicated a traffic rise and heightened demand related to the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts visited a Costco in Wayne, NJ over the weekend and found an increase in traffic compared with a normal weekend, and snapped pictures of various out-of-stock items across food and health and personal care merchandise. Oppenheimer analysts call it a &quot;temporary boost&quot; but say the retailer is managing the demand well. &quot;Historically we rarely see out of stocks at Costco,&quot; Oppenheimer said. &quot;Even with strong demand in categories such as bottled water and paper towels, employees were constantly bringing out new pallets onto the floor. Costco likely capitalized more than other players in meeting the consumer surge for these in-demand items.&quot; Other retailers have reported increased demand for items like hand sanitizers, with Home Depot Inc.  putting a cap on the number of face masks sold per customer. Oppenheimer rates Costco shares outperform with a 12-to-18 month price target of $335. Costco is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday.

2020-03-03,"Retail companies dominated Tuesday morning's headlines with Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) reporting fourth-quarter results while Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) continues to be mentioned as a beneficiary of people stocking up on supplies amid coronavirus uncertainties.What To Know Shares of Target were lower ahead of Tuesday's market open as the company reported a slight beat on the bottom line, marking the fifth straight quarter of outperformance, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said on CNBC's &quot;Squawk Box.&quot; But the stock didn't move higher as the earnings report was &quot;par for the course&quot; and 2020 guidance came in &quot;right in line&quot; with expectations.Nelson said he is &quot;more cautious&quot; on Hold-rated Target compared to Buy-rated Costco, especially after Target's stock outpaced its earnings growth over the past few years. On the other hand, Costco and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) have better leverage to consumer staples.Why It's Important Costco's stock gained 10% on Monday and Walmart's stock was up around 8% as anecdotal accounts of supply shortages plaguing Costco stores across the country surfaced. This is more of a &quot;short-term boost&quot; story and will add a lift to near-term earnings.The remainder of 2020 could prove to be a time for investors to show &quot;a little more caution&quot; and consumer staple-names should fare better compared to Target which is more of a consumer discretionary play, he said.View more earnings on TGTRelated Links:Tuesday's Market Minute: Target Misses Earnings BullseyeSuper Tuesday Begins As Investors Eye Earnings From Kohl's, Target, And G7 DisappointsLatest Ratings for TGT  DateFirmActionFromTo  Jan 2020Odeon CapitalInitiates Coverage OnBuy  Dec 2019Cowen & Co.MaintainsOutperform  Nov 2019Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-Weight    View More Analyst Ratings for TGT   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Want A .50 Hot Dog At Costco?

2020-03-03,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) was volatile on Monday, as traders were anticipating the potential ramifications that coronavirus could have on the company's bottom line. The stock will likely attract even more attention later this week, as the company is due to report earnings for the December quarter on Thursday, March 5 after the market closes.Dating back to 2016, Costco's earnings tend to be mixed compared to analyst estimates. The company has beaten the Street's consensus estimate on both earnings per share and revenue in the same quarter just five times in the last 20 quarters. More often than not, the company comes up short on one of those two metrics.But beating or missing Wall Street's estimates is not always indicative of how the stock will react.  Source: Benzinga ProHow Costco Historically Moves Ahead Of Earnings In the table below from options research platform Market Chameleon, you can see how COST has historically moved before each of its previous 12 earnings reports.  Source: Market ChameleonNotice the stock's inconsistent performance leading up to earnings. Shares of Costco, on average, trade lower in the one-week, three-day, two-day, and one-day periods heading into an earnings report. And the stock has roughly the same number of positive and negative performances in the run-up to earnings over the last 12 quarters.How Costco Historically Moves The Day Of Earnings Interestingly, COST has a negative reaction to earnings far more often than it has a positive one. Unlike Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU) (which tends to open higher after earnings), shares of COST have opened down an average of -0.8% after the last quarterly 12 reports, and have opened lower 75% of the time.In all the stock's absolute average post-earnings opening gap--meaning the average move it makes at the 9:30 am open the following morning--has been +/- 2.6% in either direction.  Source: Market ChameleonHow Costco Historically Moves After Earnings If the last few years are any indication, Costco's earnings reports usually make for good buying opportunities.The stock trades higher more often than not in the one-day, two-day, three-day, one-week, and two-week time horizons after an earnings report. With the exception of three of bad performances in the last four years, COST has almost always traded higher after earnings.  Source: Market ChameleonYou can see that Costco shares appear to gain more momentum the further out you go. Its average performance in the two weeks after earnings is a 1.9% gain, by far the strongest of any of the post-earnings periods. The absolute average return of +/-3.4%, suggesting the post-earnings trend becomes more pronounced as time goes on.3 Options Strategies You Can Use To Trade Costco's Earnings Ahead of Costco's earnings, here are the top three options strategies with the highest theoretical edge--meaning the expected average return per trade is greatest based on calculations of historical data--according to Market Chameleon.The cards below show what each trade involves.The most important thing to note on each card is the difference between the market price, the option strategy's current value, and theoretical value, the strategy's value based on historical data. The trades with market prices lower than the theoretical value are being offered at a discount, while a higher market value indicates the trade is more expensive than historical prices.

This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Stock Of The Day: CostcoAs volatility reigns supreme this week with wicked rallies and declines, some issues tend to be holding up better than others. One of those is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST).As citizens prepare for the potential short- and long-term impact from the coronavirus outbreak, photos revealed packed stores and some with empty shelves as many customers are purchasing essential supplies to survive if unable to leave their home for a long period of time.Whether it is humans or algorithms digesting the news and relentlessly purchasing shares, the end result is the same: a much higher stock price. The reason being the expectation of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings results. It should be noted the company announces second-quarter results on March 5, which will not reflect the current onslaught of purchases.Incredible RallyAs a result of the buying frenzy, Costco posted perhaps it biggest up day, point and percentage wise, in the history of the issue. After ending Friday's session at the depressed price of $281.14, it opened much higher. After a brief retreat, it rallied to $309.51 and ended the session at $309.14. The rally continued in Tuesday's broad based rally so far, reaching $314.17.Factors To ConsiderCostco has been in a strong uptrend for years, primarily due to strong earnings that are the result of subscription-based model to its stores. Also, the company is expanding into other countries, such as China, which may keep the earnings momentum going and result in an even higher share price.If the coronavirus becomes an pandemic in the U.S., citizens may not to want to leave their in homes, in fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they may not be going to Costco or anywhere else for that matter, to purchase the normal allotment of goods. In turn, the brief increase of sales may be offset by a long period of a decline.Photo credit: Tony Webster, via Wikimedia CommonsSee more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Recap: Wait And See Approach To Coronavirus Outbreak, Coscto's Huge Move(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Americans have become polarized over something other than politics. We’re now divided into those who are washing our hands more carefully and more often, but otherwise living as usual, and those who are buying a year’s supply of toilet paper at Costco and, at the extreme end, ordering $400 bottles of now-rare Purell.For every Covid-19 headline urging “don’t panic,” there’s another saying this epidemic is “unstoppable” or “out of control” and that we are “unprepared.” Uncertainty is still high enough that facts can be used to support either argument.People just want clear, simple numbers on the likely spread of Covid-19, when it’s likely to peak, and the odds that it will be fatal. But there’s no consensus. An interview in Vox with WHO assistant director general Bruce Aylward says the number of cases may be lower than thought but death rates could turn out to be, as suspected, over 1%. This is based on extensive investigations of the situation in China.A story in Slate this week by Harvard doctor Jeremy Samuel Faust, headlined “Covid-19 isn’t as deadly as we think,” uses data from the ill-fated cruise ship Diamond Princess to make the opposite case — arguing that once we get a handle on the extent of mild cases, doctors may find the death rate much lower than 1%.What we do know is that some people are in more real danger — people over 80, people with compromised immune systems and those with certain pre-existing respiratory conditions are at a much higher risk of death. As for the rest of us, there’s less risk but plenty of guilt. We don’t want to spread the disease by doing the wrong thing.New information is coming in all the time. A paper published in Science examines the effect of travel bans and suggests they had only a small effect on slowing the spread of the virus out of China. The researcher suggest that going forward, the more important action will be to educate people about hand washing and avoiding big public gatherings. And people should prepare to stay home for two weeks if identified as likely to be exposed — which shouldn’t require that much toilet paper.This divide between the scared and not-scared is forming natural filter bubbles. If you’re going about your normal business, you probably see there are still plenty of avocados in the supermarket. People are still going to their anti-gravity yoga classes and taking off on various weekend adventures. Most people on the street are not wearing masks.We in the non-scared bubble are seeing a self-selected sample of others like us and are cut off from the anxious, since they are spending more time either glued to their television sets or frequenting the aisles where Purell and N95 masks are sold (or were sold, until they sold out).The Boston Globe this week examined life inside the fearful bubble, describing how anxiety about the virus is making “us” crazy — “us” being those who are stocking up on dry goods and otherwise not living life as usual. “We’re being told to remain calm, but the Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate in an emergency move, Governor Charlie Baker is urging Massachusetts schools to cancel international trips, and the MBTA is going to begin disinfecting stations every four hours,” writes Beth Teitell. “But all the guidance feels so vague.”Edicts such as “don’t panic” don’t help. It’s never good to panic and it’s not clear what constitutes panic in this case. Postponing your trip to Italy? Working from home until further notice? Canceling large public gatherings?The American Physical Society canceled its massive annual March meeting in Colorado, a big sacrifice considering that many had paid for the travel, spent weeks preparing talks, and a few had already arrived. But that was considered prudent. Smaller gatherings at churches in South Korea and Singapore have generated clusters of disease.The problem is there’s too much emotion and too little fact in media coverage, says Emmanuel Maidenberg, a psychologist at UCLA who studies, among other things, anxiety disorders. Each new U.S. death makes for an onslaught of breathless headlines. And yet progress has been incremental in answering the questions people really want answered: How big will this get?  How dangerous is it? How scared should I be?The fear itself is a problem, he says. It could be limiting life for some people, promoting unnecessary social isolation, or overwhelming the health care system.The health care system in the United States is built on encouraging some degree of medical paranoia. Under ordinary circumstances we’re told that even if we feel fine we need all sorts of tests. And so it’s natural that people will demand tests for Covid-19. So far, testing has been limited to those who are extremely ill or for select people helping scientists track the spread of disease. Harvard epidemiologist Mark Lipsitch has been warning that laboratories and hospitals could be “overwhelmed” if tests become available on demand.There are rational things to do to prepare, and businesses must plan ahead and take seriously the need to ensure sick employees can stay home without financial hardship. Preparing without panicking takes a special kind of mind; someone who can hold two opposing ideas at the same time and continue to function.As for the expensive Purell, don’t worry if you can’t buy it. Proper soap and water washing will do the job, and if you need to sanitize your hands at times when there’s no sink, you can always make your own hand sanitizer.(Corrects 11th paragraph to say South Korea instead of Japan. )To contact the author of this story: Faye Flam at fflam1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Sarah Green Carmichael at sgreencarmic@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Faye Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-03-09,"Stocks are plunging, volatility is skyrocketing and bears are partying like its 2008. The rush into bonds has submerged Treasury yields across the curve -- even out to 30 years -- below 1% for the first time in history. Given the risky backdrop, you'll be forgiven for your desire to sit on the sidelines until some semblance of normalcy returns. But for those brave enough to enter the fray, I have three top stock trades for this week that include some safe stocks to buy.What do I mean by safe? Well, for starters, these stocks have exhibited relative strength during the market meltdown. That is to say, they've fallen far less than the S&P 500. Second, they all boast betas well below the market.So, if the S&P 500 is a hare, these stocks are tortoises.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, two of the three picks are also well-known for their lofty dividend payouts. So in a world where bond yields are seemingly headed toward zero, the appeal of dividend-paying stocks is on the rise.  * 10 Ways to Diversify Your Portfolio at This Time of Crisis That said, here are three top stock trades to consider. Top Stock Trades This Week: Walmart (WMT)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Beta: 0.43The &quot;safeness&quot; of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is on full display this morning. While the rest of Wall Street is having a rough day Monday, WMT stock is not even down 1%. That said, its resiliency is likely a byproduct of two things. First, it belongs to a defensive sector -- consumer staples -- with a history of outperforming during times of turmoil.Secondly, pandemic fears surrounding the coronavirus from China have boosted stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart due to the increased foot traffic as worried consumers snatch-up bottled water, toilet paper and paper products to fill their bunkers.Therefore, because both of these dynamics are likely to remain, Walmart is one of my favorite top stock trades of safe stocks to buy.The Trade: Equity lovers could buy WMT stock outright. Options traders can buy the May $120/$125 bull call spread for around $2.30. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.66Instead of picking individual companies and running the risk that your safe stock suddenly sours, you could opt for a more diversified play using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Moreover, to harness the defensive nature of consumer staples, for example, you could purchase the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP).In addition to Walmart, its top holdings include household names such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).Compared to the S&P 500's 7% drubbing Monday, XLP is only down 4.5%. Furthermore, from February's peak, the fund off nearly 9%. Meanwhile, the S&P has lost almost 18% of its value over that same time period. The juicy dividend yield of 3.31% for XLP is also likely to keep buyers flocking -- even if prices fall further.Remember, unless the companies comprising XLP start cutting their dividends, the cheaper you can buy the fund, the higher the dividend yield becomes. Which, is the silver lining of corrections and bear markets. Overall, these reasons make XLP a top stock trade for this week.  * 5 High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Great Buyback Programs The Trade: Buy XLP stock. Options traders looking to lever up the potential returns could buy the June $60/$63 bull call spread for $1.50. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.35For our final safe stock pick, we're sticking with the defensive sector theme and choosing the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLU). Utility companies have business models that are less sensitive to economic downturns than virtually every other industry. And as such, they've held up quite well during bear markets of the past.The low beta and relative strength have been on full display this month. Compared to the S&P's whack today and recent peak-to-trough decline, XLU is down 5.7% and nearly 10%, respectively. Additionally, its dividend yield of 2.96% is almost as tasty as the consumer staples ETF.So from a charting perspective, XLU has the best looking chart of all the sectors. It's the only one still above its 200-day moving average. And while the short-term trend is a mess, the long-term picture remains healthy.The Trade: Buy XLU stock. Options traders could buy the June $65/$70 bull call spread for around $2.25.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-13,"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is set to open up slightly on Friday, just over a week after the company released a solid earnings report. The warehouse-style retailer beat analysts' expectations on both earnings and revenue.Source: Shutterstock There's no question: Costco stock is a solid performer, which is why it gets a A ranking in my Portfolio Grader.But don't just take my word for it -- see for yourself why I'm bullish on Costco stock these days, and why I think it will fare better than most as the market whipsaws on news about the coronavirus from China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Costco's Earnings ReportCostco reported second-quarter earnings of $2.10 per share, with sales of $38.3 billion. That beat consensus estimates of $2.07 per share and expected sales of $38.2 billion.  * 7 Stocks to Sell as We Enter a Bear Market Perhaps not surprisingly, Costco sales saw a big jump in late February.&quot;We attribute this to concerns over the coronavirus and estimate the positive impact on total and comparable sales to be approximately three percent,&quot; the company wrote in a statement.In a conference call after the earnings report, company officials said the coronavirus-related demand is continuing.&quot;Members are turning to us for a variety of items associated with preparing for and dealing with the virus such as shelf stable dry grocery items, cleaning supplies, Clorox and bleach, water, paper goods, hand sanitizers, sanitizing wipes, disinfectants, health and beauty aids, and even items like water filtration and food storage items,&quot; CFO Richard Galanti said. The Outlook for 2020Costco has been a reliable performer, gaining 20% over the last 12 months.With a market capitalization of $124 billion, COST stock is a relatively expensive one. It has a price-earnings ratio greater than 37 and a price-book value of 8.8.Notably, the company did not issue guidance for 2020. But Costco's short-term success will be contingent on its ability to maintain production and distribution lines in China. And fortunately, China is showing signs of emerging from the Covid-19 wave.Galanti says the company's warehouses have mostly remained open.

Plus, it is now one of a few companies on Wall Street that is relatively immune to coronavirus fears. As long as people are lining up at Costco to get cleaning supplies, basic staples and water, then Costco will have some insulation from the market volatility.And in the future, Costco is committed to growing its presence in China. Before it was temporarily closed for the coronavirus, Costco's Shanghai location had one of the highest membership bases in the chain. It's an extremely popular location. That bodes well for Costco to expand its footprint in the lucrative Chinese market.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-03-13,"A Costco membership opens doors, quite literally, to a vast selection of bulk-size groceries and household goods selling at discounted prices. But buying potato chips and batteries by the case is just the start. The warehouse club also stocks everything from tires and furniture to electronics and jewelry. With so many items to choose from, smart shopping expert Trae Bodge says it's critical to bring a list to avoid overspending, particularly on seasonal items the store loves to put right inside the front door.List or no list, shoppers seem to like the savings and selection. Costco has 53 million paid members around the world, with an 88% renewal rate worldwide (91% in the U.S. and Canada). The chain ranks first in customer satisfaction among department and discount stores, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, edging out rivals Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale. Thinking of taking the Costco plunge? Here's what you should know before investing at least $60 in an annual membership.

2020-03-13,"As poorly as U.S. stocks have performed, there have been bright spots in the market. In past editions of Big Stock Charts, we've tried to highlight some of those bright spots.Source: Shutterstock After Thursday's rout, however, it's almost impossible to do so. Part of the problem is the sheer breadth of the day's declines.Of over 1,500 stocks with a market capitalization over $2 billion, only 14 closed in the green Thursday. And after U.S. stocks fell more than 9% in a single session, only 33 have traded higher over the past month. Many of those names are biotechs or other companies that may actually benefit from the spread of the coronavirus.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell as We Enter a Bear Market Friday's big stock charts focus on three consumer names that had held up relatively well during the sell-off that began in late January. Or at least they had, until Thursday. And while the charts look mixed, Thursday's declines are unquestionably bad news. These companies should be able to avoid the worst effects of the coronavirus -- yet their stock prices are plunging anyway. Costco (COST)Source: Provided by Finviz Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) would seem like a potential beneficiary of coronavirus fears. Yet the first of Friday's big stock charts shows a stock clinging to support:  * The technicals look concerning at this point. COST stock is re-testing support that held both in late February (at least relative to its closing price) and in early October. But it's how the stock has returned to support that might be worrisome. Shares quickly fell through moving averages, including a quick plunge through the 200-day on Thursday. And while the stock didn't quite close at the lows on Thursday, it came close.  * That trading is somewhat surprising. After all, there's a case that Costco should benefit from coronavirus fears. Its customers are stocking up across the country. And unlike some grocers, Costco should see a long-term benefit as well, as it picks up new members who presumably will stick around once those fears subside. Add to that a huge opportunity in China as that region gets back to normal, and there's not an obvious reason why COST stock should be selling off along with the market.  * Except for one: valuation. Even after the pullback, Costco stock trades at almost 30x the consensus earnings per share estimate for next year. Even for a company that seems almost immune to competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and one with minimal short-term disruption ahead, that may simply be too high. If it is, that means COST stock is going to keep heading south -- and strongly suggests the rest of the market will do the same. Kroger (KR)Source: Provided by Finviz Even after a 4.8% decline on Thursday, Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock has performed reasonably well in 2020. Shares are modestly positive year-to-date, and have rallied 2.4% over the past month. Looking forward, the second of our big stock charts does suggest some optimism if the stock can avoid another decline today:  * For the most part, the chart does look bullish. A broadening ascending wedge still holds if KR can keep above $29; that pattern actually would predict a bounce to new highs. Kroger stock did fall through the 20-day moving average on Thursday, but held the 50-day. Even with recent volatility, this still looks like a stock headed in the right direction.  * That said, there's not much room for error at the moment. KR can exit the wedge with another decline. It's only narrowly holding the 50DMA. With U.S. futures pointing to another big decline on Friday, KR may see another sell-off. That would suggest a move to late January support around $27 and then the 200-day below $26.  * In that context, KR is an interesting test case for other defensive names. The stock certainly is cheap enough to see buying, at 12.3x Wall Street EPS estimates for fiscal 2020 (ending January 2021). Coronavirus impacts should be limited; in fact, the company could see a short-term boost from consumers stocking up. Fourth quarter earnings last week impressed the market and sent KR stock soaring. This is the kind of name even nervous investors would consider buying. It would be helpful if they started doing so quickly. Clorox (CLX)Source: Provided by Finviz The story with Clorox (NYSE:CLX) sounds similar to those of Kroger and Costco. The third of our big stock charts shows the technical picture is similar as well:  * Here, too, support needs to hold. CLX stock posted a solid and almost textbook rally from November lows, rising steadily and bouncing repeatedly off the 20-day moving average. But the rally has reversed quickly. The stock has posted bearish tests of both the 20-day and the 50-day. CLX now has exited a narrowing ascending wedge, and the last line of support seems to be the 200-day moving average. If CLX breaches that level, the stock could be in trouble.  * As Josh Enomoto detailed last week, the coronavirus seems to be a positive near-term catalyst for Clorox, as it is for Costco. Whether it's a return to bleach ahead of 'natural' and/or 'organic' but less-effective products, or increased sales of disinfecting wipes, nervous consumers should buy more Clorox products for at least the next few months. That tailwind may not fade, either. Yet, as with Costco, investors are selling the stock anyway.  * Valuation is a question. CLX trades at 24x forward earnings despite relatively modest earnings growth. That's not an unreasonable multiple relative to other defensive large-cap consumer plays like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL). But it is a multiple that's exceptionally relatively high on a historical basis. And so the decline in CLX stock may suggest a significant, permanent re-rating of the entire sector, rather than just a panic-driven sell-off.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-16,"Confirmed cases of coronavirus disease in the US have expanded dramatically, from only 100 just two weeks ago to more than 3,300 now. As the disease spreads, the Federal government has declared a national emergency and released $50 billion in aid for States and territories to fight the viral outbreak. At the same time, the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate back to near-zero, and announced that it will initiate a $700 billion program of quantitative easing.The governmental moves, welcomed by the business community, have at best only partially stemmed the feeling of panic in the general public. Grocery stores are reporting long times – sometimes around the corner – and depleted stocks of household cleaners, hand sanitizers, and food staples. And we’ve all heard the stories (and seen the jokes) about toilet paper hoarding.The consensus outlook is that COVID-19 will get worse before it gets better. Quarantines, social distancing, and remote work options will only go so far to slowing the spread, and essential services (those grocery stores, of course, but also trash collection, fire & rescue, police, hospitals, gas stations, utility works) must continue.But for stock investors, there may be a silver lining. While markets are clearly taking a hit, and have definitely entered a bear cycle, some individual stocks may be primed for gains. Grocery chains, for example. Long lines and short stock may inconvenience the customers, but behind them are high sales – and that can only be good for the bottom line.We’ve use the TipRanks Stock Screener tool to look at three such stocks. All are Buy-rated and offer investors a reliable dividend. In short, they are strong defensive stock plays, just the type to counter a market panic. Let's take a closer look.Dollar General (DG)We’ll start at the discount end, with Dollar General. This low-cost retailer offers customers a wide range of products, from basic groceries to the over-the-counter medicine and household cleaners in high demand today. The discount prices help ensure that customers can afford the merchandise, even in a downturn.All of this puts Dollar General in a strong position for today’s markets. The chain will certainly have not shortage of customers – so as long as management can maintain the supply chain, it should do well.DG also offers a reliable dividend which it just announced will be raised to 36 cents quarterly starting in April. That will mark the third increase in the past three years. The yield is modest, at just 1%, but the company has maintained the payments for the past five years, and low payout ratio of 17% indicates that there is plenty of slack should management choose to raise the payment further.Karen Short, 4-star analyst with Barclays, is upbeat on this stock, describing it as ‘a port in the storm.’ She rates DG a Buy, with a $180 price target that implies an upside of 42%. (To watch Short’s track record, click here)To support her thesis, Short writes, “While others are likely bracing for the macro/supply chain impact of COVID-19, DG likely benefits from staples stock-piling and potential trade down. In times of market turmoil, we believe best-in-class companies with strong balance sheets and ample protection from macro uncertainty should be owned – DG fits the bill [...] DG is a best-in-class retailer offering long-term growth and rare defensive characteristics. We believe current investments are positioning the company for meaningful share gains longer-term.”Also bullish is UBS analyst Michael Lasser: “The market is likely to focus on the co's intermediate term outlook in light of potential supply chain and consumer disruptions related to Covid-19. Still, we think DG is better positioned than others as it serves as a key fill-in shop for consumers.”Lasser’s Buy rating is supported by a $175 price target, indicating his confidence in a 38% upside. (To watch Lasser’s track record, click here)Overall, DG has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 5 Buys and 2 Holds set in recent days. The stock is trading for $137.27, and the average price target, $174, suggests an upside potential here of 32%. (See Dollar General stock analysis on TipRanks)Costco Wholesale (COST)Big-box membership warehouse Costco, like many other large grocery retail chains, has been experiences runs on its stores. Branches in Seattle have reported lines of customers stretching down the block, while branches in New Jersey had reported sold-out merchandise and bare shelves.The strong sales are a reflection of the coronavirus panic, as well as Costco’s loyal customer base. After all, when people see a need to buy up supplies for hunkering down, they’re going to turn first to their favorite discount source – and Costco’s warehouse -style club-membership model has attracted something of a fan base. That’s clear from the near-90% resubscription rate, and gives the chain a strong foundation.Costco just reported Q2 fiscal 2020 earnings, with EPS and revenue both above estimates, show the company’s strength to weather a downturn. At $2.10, EPS was up 4.4% year-over-year  and beat the forecast by 1.4%. The top line revenues were $39.07 billion, which edged over the forecast and showed 10% yoy growth. The strong earnings support the company’s dividend, which at 65 cents quarterly annualize to $2.60 per share. The 0.86% yield is small, but has been growing in recent years.Telsey Advisory Group’s Joe Feldman said of Costco, “Costco has seen a surge in demand for coronavirus-related products, such as dry grocery, cleaning supplies, hand sanitizers, and water filtration products. This is partly offset by softer trends in its travel and auto businesses. The US clubs are operating on a regular basis, and working to deal with the recent acceleration in traffic… Costco's strong relationship with vendors is helping to maintain regular deliveries, although it has been challenging to keep up with the demand in certain categories.”Feldman sees COST shares as a Buy, and reiterates a price target of $330, which implies an upside of 16% from current levels. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)5-star analyst Scott Ciccarelli, of RBC Capital, also takes a Buy-side stand here. His $350 price target suggests a bullish 23% upside. In his comments on the stock, Ciccarelli says, “Sales trends were strong all month/quarter and then accelerated meaningfully as COVID-19 fears spread... Given the rising concerns over an economic slowdown, COST should provide investors with a relative haven.” (To watch Ciccarelli’s track record, click here)With 11 Buy ratings and 7 Holds, COST shares get a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The stock sells for $328.65 and the average price target of $328.65 indicates room for a 15% upside potential. (See Costco stock analysis on TipRanks)Target Corporation (TGT)We wrap up with Target, a major name in retail. The company’s CEO Brian Cornell appeared alongside President Trump during Friday’s update on the government response to the coronavirus epidemic. Cornell affirmed that his company would offer space – in store parking lots – for mass virus testing, as part of a general policy of cooperation with Federal authorities. It was another sign good optics for Target.The chain’s revenue just edged above the forecasts and year-over-year numbers in Q4, coming in at $23.4 billion, but the earnings were stronger. EPS was reported at $1.69, comparing favorably to the $1.53 year-ago number.In addition to a strong Q4, Target also kept up its dividend. The company has a 20-year history of maintaining the payments, and keeping the yield, currently 2.86%, above the market average. The payout ratio of 39% shows that the 66-cent quarterly payment is easily sustainable. This makes Target an attractive income stock for difficult times.Telsey’s Joe Feldman, quoted above, likes TGT shares these days. He sees “an uptick in demand of household essentials, disinfectants, and food products, given the outbreak of COVID-19—a trend we expect to continue in the near-future.” He adds, “Overall, Target’s strategies are working and should continue to allow the company to gain profitable market share and drive earnings growth.”Feldman gives TGT a $137 price target, suggesting room for 43% upside growth in the coming year – fully in-line with his Buy rating. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)And also bullish here is Karen Short from Barclays. She sees the brick & mortar retail sector as declining generally, but Target holding a strong position in it, writing, “We are encouraged by recent sales trends with management citing solid results across categories in February. Additionally, an increase in traffic as consumers start to stock up on essentials in reaction to the coronavirus could be an incremental positive and can further support Q1 results [...] TGT is making substantial improvements to its business, which we believe could position the company well to take market share from other declining retailers.”Short puts a $135 price target behind her Buy rating, implying 44% growth for the stock this year. (To watch Short’s track record, click here)Target is another stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating, this one based on 9 Buys against 6 Holds. The $131.57 average price target suggests a premium of 40% from the current share price of $94.19.

2020-03-17,"Costco (NASDAQ: COST), the Washington-based membership-only warehouse club, announced Tuesday it had acquired final-mile hauler and installation provider Innovel Solutions from Transform Holdco for $1 billion. Financier Eddie Lampert formed Transform Holdco a year ago, in February 2019, to acquire some of Sears' assets, following its bankruptcy. Transform also operates Kmart.Innovel Solutions employs 1,500 people and operates 1,100 trucks, 11 distribution centers and more than 100 final-mile cross-docks. Costco has been an Innovel customer since 2015.&quot;Innovel has for decades provided Sears and, more recently, third parties with ‘final mile' delivery, complete installation and white-glove capabilities for ‘big and bulky' products across the United States and Puerto Rico,&quot; Costco said in announcing the acquisition. &quot;Innovel's network offers coverage to nearly 90% of the U.S. and Puerto Rico.&quot;The deal is the latest stage in the slow-motion unwinding of Transform Holdco's assets: After Lampert's original purchase of Sears and Kmart, he was operating 425 stores (223 Sears and 202 Kmarts). A further acquisition in June 2019 of Sears Hometown stores, which are independently owned and operated, brought the total to 839 stores. Since then, a series of store closures has reduced the size of Transform's portfolio. Only about 182 stores remain from the original 425, while the number of Hometown stores has also fallen.Costco paid for Innovel in cash; Transform said it would use the proceeds to pay down its remaining non-real estate debt (the acquisition of Sears and Kmart was financed by $950 million of debt).Furniture and bulky items have been one of the hardest segments of household goods for e-commerce to penetrate because it's hard to evaluate comfort and quality online and delivery is less than painless, typically expensive with low visibility. Costco management said its acquisition of Innovel would help it accelerate e-commerce sales of &quot;big and bulky&quot; items.Other large transportation companies have acquired final-mile capabilities to mixed results. Schneider National shut down its First To Final Mile delivery service in August 2019, citing poor results and cash burn. XPO Logistics acquired UX Specialized Logistics in 2015 but is considering spinning the business off as it pursues a new identity as a pure-play less-than-truckload carrier.J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ: JBHT), on the other hand, has leaned into final mile aggressively, first buying Special Logistics Dedicated in 2017, then Cory's First Choice Home Delivery in 2019, followed by RDI Last Mile on the last day of 2019.Image Sourced from Wikimedia CommonsSee more from Benzinga  * Stifel Sees Decent Volumes Near Term, 2Q In Jeopardy  * Relief Possible For Government Freight Delayed By COVID-19  * Coronavirus Freight Market Update: Peak Virus And The Impact On Trucking And Economics(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-17,"Discount grocery retail shares bounced back on Tuesday as aggressive Federal Reserve stimulus measures triggered a slight rebound in the market.On Monday and Tuesday, large discount retail option trades were mixed in nature, suggesting investors are divided on whether or not the dips in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) are buying opportunities.The Trades This week, Benzinga Pro subscribers received five option alerts related to unusually large trades of discount retail options:  * On Monday at 11:54 a.m., a trader sold 501 Dollar Tree put options with a $80 strike price expiring on March 20 near the bid price at $2.351.

Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively modest sizes of the largest discount retail option trades by institutional standards, they are unlikely to be institutional hedging.Critical Role In Coronavirus Outbreak Unlike many of the stores that can close up shop during the COVD-19 outbreak, these discount grocery stores are critical in making sure people have food, water and housing supplies during the crisis. The good news for these discount retailers is that they have historically performed relatively well during economic downturns.From the beginning of 2008 to the beginning of 2010, the S&P 500 was down 24% overall, but Costco and Target shares were down just 15.1% and 3.2%, respectively. Dollar Tree shares were up 86.3% during that two-year stretch.On Monday, Dollar Tree announced it would be opening its locations one hour earlier than usual only for elderly shoppers most at risk from the virus.Here's a breakdown of the percentage of StockTwits messages mentioning each of the three discount grocery stocks that were bullish in nature on Tuesday:  * Costco: 58 % bullish.  * Dollar General: 54.5% bullish.  * Target: 75% bullish.

2020-03-17,"ISSAQUAH, Wash., March 17, 2020 -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Innovel.",COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION - ACQUISITION TO FURTHER LAST MILE CAPACITY
2020-03-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When President Donald Trump called several U.S. CEOs to the microphone at his coronavirus press conference last week, it was more than just symbolic. Whether Americans like it or not, Covid-19 is ushering in an era when big business will be more important than ever.As people start reacting to Covid-19, they are looking mostly to the larger businesses for assistance. Costco and Walmart are packed. Amazon and UPS are delivering our packages. For entertainment at home, Americans are relying on Netflix and the cable companies. For information on Covid-19, Twitter is a very useful stop. As hospitals become overcrowded, CVS and Rite Aid may become important as local health centers and sources of community information.It turns out that the larger, more profitable businesses are the ones that have the talent, the command of public attention and the financial resources to adjust to these changing conditions.Big business also has been ahead of the curve when it comes to prediction and adjustment. The NBA postponed its season before most politicians, including the president, realized the gravity of the situation.Only a month ago, there were headlines mocking Silicon Valley for being overly concerned with Covid-19 and for avoiding handshakes. The tech community had a high degree of advance awareness of Covid-19 problems, and it was ready with telework and other adjustments when the time came. The tech world’s penchant for carrying what seemed to be absurdly large surpluses of cash — last year Apple had over $100 billion in cash reserves — now also seems prescient. Apple’s stores are currently closed in most parts of the world.Some of the biggest economic losers from Covid-19 will be economies that rely more on small business rather than big business. The lockdowns in Italy, for example, will be very painful for the large numbers of small, family-run businesses that rely on everyday contact with their customers. The gelato shop and the kiosk and the small bar will be more vulnerable than America’s corporate behemoths. Furthermore, they may be vulnerable to a small number of their workers getting sick.Larger businesses are also easier to assist if necessary. Whatever you think of the forthcoming bailout of the major U.S. airlines, logistically it will not be very difficult to pull off, since the targets are large and obvious and relatively easy to monitor. Banks are willing to lend to them, because they know the government does not contemplate a world without major airlines.It is much more difficult to bail out the millions of small and medium-sized enterprises around the world that will demand assistance. How do you find and track them? How can you tell which have no chance of bouncing back? Government bureaucracies cannot easily deal with those problems, and in turn private banks do not perceive governments to be making credible commitments to these small businesses. By contrast, there are numerous precedents for governmental aid or loans to airlines or other major businesses.Whether Americans like it or not, after the worst of Covid-19 is over, theirs is going to be a nation where big business plays a larger role. The title of my most recent book gives some indication where I stand, and I predict more Americans will come to a new appreciation of big business over the coming months.Business itself, including big business, is increasingly relying on distanced communications. WhatsApp messaging groups are active, while Skype calls are replacing the face-to-face meeting; WhatsApp, of course, is owned by Facebook, Skype by Microsoft. Zoom, whose calls are known for their reliability, is not yet a big business, but I predict it will be fairly soon.Most institutions of higher education are shutting down or postponing their operations. Alternative arrangements are still being worked out, but again I expect big business will play a major role in the transition. Skype and Zoom sessions will replace many a class, and the textbook companies are stepping forward with electronic portals that present classroom materials, interactive exercises and grade student answers. (Disclaimer: Macmillan Worth offers an electronic portal version of my own economics textbook.)Some governments in East Asia have done a good job responding to the Covid-19 crisis. It is hard to say the same for the U.S. or Western Europe. The legacy of that failure is likely to be a further decline of trust in government. And a consequence of that failure is that, when Americans need answers or simply a useful good or service, they are increasingly going to turn to the one institution that can reliably provide them: big business.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tyler Cowen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-03-20,"Panic buying is prevalent in America today due to the coronavirus from China spreading globally. Shoppers are stockpiling essential goods, including bathroom tissue, canned foods, bottled water and hand sanitizer. This phenomenon could translate to an opportunity in grocery store stocks.Three stocks in the grocery store space are poised for exceptional gains during the coronavirus crisis. The criteria to watch include strong earnings and/or sales, a fair valuation as well as a decent dividend payout. Plus, the stores need to be big enough to carry the supplies that today's panicky shoppers demand.  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw With all of that in mind, let's dive into key grocery store stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Grocery Store Stocks to Buy: Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Shares of Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock are bucking the downward trend of the equities market. That's mainly due to a demand for stores that can handle large inventories of essential items. Kroger fits the bill perfectly. Yet, the valuation remains reasonable as the trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is only 17.76.A forward dividend yield of nearly 2% should provide shareholders with steady income throughout the coronavirus crisis. Moreover, Bahl & Gaynor portfolio manager Jim Russell observes Kroger's firm position amid a quickly shifting economic landscape. &quot;Kroger is seen as one of the few companies and industries out there that is seeing growing demand … They're strong operationally and demand is strong at a time when demand is falling off in many other industries,&quot; says Russell.His point is well taken as Kroger remains powerfully positioned to capitalize on the stockpiling trend. KR stock isn't the biggest store chain of the three on this list, but it could be the strongest contender due to the company's ability to stock shelves consistently, while continuing to enrich loyal shareholders. Costco (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com The share price of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock has been a bit wobblier than that of KR stock. The forward dividend payout of 0.85% is decent but not spectacular. Yet, COST stock has something unique behind it. The company's membership model has facilitated strong customer loyalty. A re-subscription rate of nearly 90% confirms this.Plus, the company has demonstrated its ability to keep up with intense stockpiling activity. Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman notes, &quot;The US clubs are operating on a regular basis, and working to deal with the recent acceleration in traffic … Costco's strong relationship with vendors is helping to maintain regular deliveries.&quot;  * 7 Top CEOs Buying Their Beaten-Down Stocks Costco's trailing 12-month P/E ratio isn't terrible at 35.72. Besides, the company's fourth-quarter top-line revenues totaled $39.07 billion, outperforming analyst expectations. This figure also indicates year-over-year growth of 10%. Without a doubt, COST stock has the revenues and the shopper loyalty to flourish in these challenging times. Target (TGT)Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com Would any stockpiling-store investment list be complete with Target (NYSE:TGT) stock? Certainly not. The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is outstanding at 15.92, so Target shares are priced for perfection. Meanwhile, a forward dividend yield of 2.55% should keep buy-and-holders satisfied while they ride out the stockpiling craze.Telsey's Joe Feldman assigned Target stock an ambitious price objective of $137. That's a substantial increase over the current share price. He asserts, &quot;Target's strategies are working and should continue to allow the company to gain profitable market share and drive earnings growth.&quot;And the earnings growth is certainly there for TGT stock. The company's fourth-quarter earnings per share came in at $1.69. That's a marked improvement over the $1.53 per share posted in the same quarter from the previous year. Furthermore, the quarterly revenues of $23.4 billion were above the consensus analyst forecast. All in all, TGT stock presents a real value proposition among grocery chain large-cap stocks.David Moadel has provided compelling content - and crossed the occasional line - on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, Finom Group, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

2020-03-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As more U.S. states roll out stay-at-home orders to combat the spread of coronavirus, it’s now possible to identify an emerging American model of such restrictions. The approach is notably less strict than Covid-19 measures adopted in other affected countries, not only autocratic China, but even democratic Italy. And although the model is sufficiently restrictive that it will have massive effects on the economy, it does not come close to a complete shutdown of economic activity.The emerging American model has several distinctive elements. The first is that, while its contours are being specified in emergency orders issued first by local governments and now by state governments, it isn’t particularly coercive. Indeed, at least in this first iteration, the American model depends mostly on voluntary compliance.To be sure, governors are issuing what they are calling “orders,” not mere recommendations. Some governors, like New York’s Andrew Cuomo, have made a point of saying that the orders are meant to be taken seriously, and hinted that police could issue fines to violators.Yet even if police enforcement is mentioned, there is little practical possibility of systematically implementing it. There just aren’t enough law enforcement officers. The legal basis for such enforcements would be shaky given the language of the orders thus far drafted. Above all, the orders allow for such a large range of exceptions for people to move around that even the most efficient police force couldn’t figure out whether people on the move fit into exceptions or not. For better or worse, the American model is going to operate for the foreseeable future as an honor system.The exceptions are also noteworthy and important. It’s not only that the American orders allow people to shop for food and medication. They also allow people to go out to get fresh air and exercise.Whether this exception or others are good ideas as a matter of public health isn’t the point — although leading epidemiologists like Harvard’s Marc Lipsitch have endorsed them. Rather, what’s significant is that the option of leaving the house discretionarily at any time to move around guarantees that Americans aren’t confined to quarters, no matter how trapped they might feel.As the weather warms up in northern U.S. climates, this get out of the house option is likely to be taken by more and more people. It might create problems if people walk or run or sit in urban parks too close to one another — something that may already be happening in urban centers where green space is limited. Yet it fundamentally underscores the reality that there is no lockdown going on.Then there are the many exempt employment sectors. In a uniquely weird American phenomenon, those are increasingly being specified by state governors on the basis of the federal list of essential sectors promulgated by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is under the jurisdiction of the federal Department of Homeland Security. (Thus, for example, California’s order pointed to the CISA list, and the more recent Massachusetts order also cites the CISA list, although it adds to it.)These sectors stretch pretty far into to the economy, as I noted when the first order came out. They include not only food supply chains and medical workers but also such sectors as “financial services.” The definitions offered by the CISA list are pretty vague and general. There are enormous numbers of potentially uncertain edge cases around the margins. This means it will mostly be up to employers and employees to determine whether their functions are essential or not. Again, self-regulation will likely be more important here than government regulation. And it’s not as though the state orders require everyone working in one of these sectors to carry around identification proving they work in one of these sectors and are therefore permitted to go to work.Many retail businesses will be closed by these orders, with predictable and predictably devastating economic consequences. Yet it’s also true that big box stores will probably remain open, since they typically also sell food or other daily necessities. In a world where Walmart, Target, Costco, and even Home Depot remain open, as do convenience stores and pharmacies and supermarkets, a great deal of economic activity can still take place. And of course the online sector of the economy will continue to function, even if delivery times will slow down radically as a result of increased demand. Indeed, there will presumably be a large increase in delivery — another sector exempted from restrictions as part of transportation.The upshot is that, for the foreseeable future at least, the American model of quasi-voluntary stay-at-home with lots of exceptions is going to be an experiment. It remains to be seen whether it will successfully flatten the epidemiological curve. Regardless, it is highly noteworthy that its relatively cautious measures rely so much on public willingness to cooperate — and that the model is aimed to keep at least some of the economy going in the midst of crisis.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Feldman is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and host of the podcast “Deep Background.” He is a professor of law at Harvard University and was a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter.

2020-04-01,"(Bloomberg) -- On Mar. 18, a laid-off customer-service representative for one of the airline companies attended an Amazon.com Inc. employee orientation in Dallas. He found himself packed into a room with about 70 other applicants, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder to watch a PowerPoint presentation about what it’s like to work for the online retailer. The man, who provided a smartphone photo to document his experience, said the event was exactly like one he attended last year for a seasonal holiday job with Amazon. In other words, there were no special precautions to keep attendees safe from the coronavirus. When the man raised concerns about the crowded conditions, he said an Amazon manager mocked him and a fellow recruit sneered.“They made jokes and told me to leave if I was unhappy,” he said, adding that one manager said Amazon’s operations were exempt from the rules because the company is considered an essential service. “They didn’t care one tiny bit.” The former customer rep took the job but still worries about getting sick. Amazon also ignored official social-distancing guidelines at mid-March events near Portland, Oregon, and in Kenosha, Wisconsin, according to two applicants. A fourth person who attended an Amazon job fair in West Jefferson, Ohio, said she was sent home and asked to return another day because the gathering was too crowded, suggesting precautionary measures are in place at least at some events or Amazon is changing its practices.The absence of social distancing at Amazon hiring events recently made the rounds on social media. One user tweeted photos he said were taken at recent recruiting event in Los Angeles. Another complained on Twitter that the event she attended, where people were in close proximity on a line, wasn’t safe. She didn’t disclose the location. Bloomberg was unable to reach those people.In an emailed statement, Amazon said it has updated its recruiting practices to avoid large crowds and keep applicants safe, but it declined to say precisely when it made the change.“These situations occurred two weeks ago and we’ve since moved all new hire events and orientations to virtual platforms,” Amazon spokeswoman Lindsay Campbell said. “Any situation in which teams don’t follow social distancing guidelines are immediately investigated.”In its initial rush to hire 100,000 people to meet surging demand from customers fearful of visiting physical stores, Amazon dusted off its holiday season recruiting playbook: holding events with lines snaking through hallways and crowds packed into meeting rooms to watch videos, submit identification and fill out paperwork. The practices violate official Covid-19 safety guidelines, which include avoiding large gatherings and maintaining at least six feet of distance from others.Amazon is widely seen as an indispensable service amid the pandemic, providing such essentials as food, cleaning supplies and medicine. That hasn’t stopped critics from accusing the company of putting customers ahead of its warehouse workers. These employees aren’t simply handling essential goods but also processing returns and packing toys, clothes and cosmetics. As the outbreak spreads and more cases are confirmed among Amazon’s warehouse workforce, demonstrations and walkouts have erupted in the U.S. and Europe along with demands from lawmakers and regulators for the company to improve working conditions.On Monday, workers staged a walkout at Amazon’s Staten Island warehouse, where three more cases were reported Tuesday evening; they called for the facility to be shut down for cleaning. Hours later, workers at a Chicago depot picketed outside their facility. And in Romulus, outside Detroit, on Wednesday, a group of Amazon employees lined the sidewalk of their warehouse, complaining about a lack of transparency from management and beseeching Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos to shut it down.Amazon has lauded the bravery of its workers delivering essentials during the crisis and said it’s protecting them through social distancing requirements and stepped-up cleaning.With the economy imploding, many Americans are willing to toil at an Amazon warehouse. Almost 4 in 10 would have difficulty covering a sudden $400 emergency expense, according to a survey on economic health released in May by the Federal Reserve, highlighting the precarious financial condition of many hourly workers living paycheck to paycheck. A record-breaking 3.3 million people filed jobless claims in the week ending March 21, and experts say unemployment could top 30 percent, five points higher than the Great Depression’s jobless peak.Amazon’s March 16 announcement that it would be hiring and boosting pay represents a lifeline to thousands of people who have lost their livelihoods in the travel, leisure and hospitality industries. “There are very few jobs right now, and millions of people are going to want them,” said Fred Goff, who runs Jobcase, a job search and networking site for hourly workers. “Amazon was ahead of the curve with $15 an hour and announced temporary raises. They’re not going to have a problem hiring people.”Vancouver, Washington, resident Robin Guyton, 62, is among them. She had part-time jobs bringing developmentally disabled people on outings to shopping malls and bowling alleys, but her hours were sharply reduced since everyone has to stay home. Amazon beckoned with warehouse work that pays up to $20 an hour and health benefits. She attended a hiring event near Portland in March and accepted a job offer that day.“It’s a big company and in times like this, their services are more in demand, so there’s some job security,” she said. “This whole thing took the wind out of my sails, and I just need a job to pay the bills.”Good pay, benefits and job security outweighed her alarm about the crowded job event, where she said people were packed side-by-side at tables to fill out online applications on shared computers that weren’t cleaned between uses.“I was so stunned, but I was so desperate to get the job I just did what I could by staying as far away from people as I could,” she said.Walmart Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp., Kroger Co. and CVS Health Corp. are all also ramping  up recruitment to meet surging demand for essential supplies. Some have sped up hiring practices by offering virtual interviews and forgoing drug and background checks, reducing the need to pack people into big job fairs.Walmart, which is hiring 150,000 people, compressed its hiring process from approximately two weeks to just 24 hours and is giving verbal offers by phone following online assessments. Other companies like Kroger use online platforms to check the identification of applicants so a bunch of new workers don’t have to attend big events to go through government-required ID verification, said Julie Pearl, co-founder of Tracker Corp., one of several companies that provide a remote ID checking service.One speed bump for the companies hiring is a new stimulus package that includes enhanced unemployment benefits that could give some workers pause about taking grocery clerk, warehouse or delivery jobs that they think are too risky during the outbreak, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.“There are a lot of people with low or average pay who will find that their income when they are laid off will rise, not fall, as a result of the special unemployment benefits,” he said.Amazon could be taking steps to make some hiring events safer for applicants. One woman, who previously worked with people with disabilities, applied for an Amazon warehouse job and said she and about 20 other applicants were sent home from a hiring event in West Jefferson, Ohio, on March 21 because it was too crowded and asked to return another day.She returned three days later to find a much smaller group of about 25 people and some seats were roped off. The orientation was shortened by two hours to limit time people spent near each other, said the woman, who was between jobs when she heard an advertisement that Amazon was hiring.The warehouse manager where she works has been sending daily emails reminding employees of the importance of their jobs in keeping essential goods moving during the pandemic, she said, and hand sanitizer was available throughout the facility during her first week on the job. (Updates with worker protests.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon's Covid Hiring Boom Has Applicants Packed Into Job Fairs With No Special Precautions

Nowadays though, investors have all the tools they need to do their own research to find diamonds in the rough.The retail sector has been hobbled for years thanks to a decade-long beatdown courtesy one Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But early adopters of e-commerce fared better than laggards. The current market crash has exacerbated previous stresses to do-or-die levels for many companies. Yesterday we learned that Macy's (NYSE:M) will drop out of the S&P 500 and into the small cap index.Three retail companies stand out for having done things right. Target (NYSE:TGT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are the three best retail plays for the rebound. The goal here isn't to find the perfect bottom, but to enter where you're unlikely to regret it. And after a 30% correction, the odds of getting that entry wrong are much slimmer than, say, two months ago, when the markets were making new highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Telecom Stocks That Are Worth a Close Look It's easy for experts to stamp a stock &quot;buy&quot; when the trend is straight up. The challenge is overcoming fear like Warren Buffett to be greedy when others are fearful. Retail Stocks On The Shopping List: Target (TGT)Last year I wrote about Target's strength relative to other retail stocks, a prediction that played out well for those who staked a claim. I hold the same assumptions for 2020.During this horrendous market crash, Target stock is still above its 12-month pivot level near $90 per share. Compare that with the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) that has fallen back to 2012 levels with no bottom in sight. TGT stock should be at the top of the list for bullish investors.Of the three retail stocks we'll look at today, Target is the cheapest, trading at 15 times price-to-earnings and 0.6 times sales. It's rare to find a cheap company whose stock still outperforms.There's also a technical reason to buy into the current dip. Once the stock lost the $110 level, it triggered a bearish pattern with a -$15 target scenario, which has already played out. There are many who doubt the value of technicals, but they're an essential tool for modern investors. Risking money in the markets without even basic chart knowledge means placing yourself at the mercy of those who pay attention to them. The good news is that this crash worked it out so that TGT stock is now at a solid support zone.The area around $90 per share has been a battle zone for TGT stock over the past two years. Both bulls and bears will want to fight hard to win the philosophical argument, creating congestion. On the way down, sellers overwhelmed the buyers. But this battle will bring that formula back into balance to form a trough.Remember that the &quot;bottom&quot; is actually a process, not a moment, and so trying to nail the perfect entry point is futile. The idea is simply to buy low and sell high, and this is as low as Target stock has been in a while. Costco (COST)As the the novel coronavirus hit the United States and panic set in, consumers' knee-jerk reaction was to hoard toilet paper, paper towels and disinfectants. Bulk retailer Costco saw massive lines as a result. This is somewhat ironic, given that shoppers put themselves in close quarters for hours in line, rather than social distancing. Nevertheless, shelves were bare in minutes. This process has repeated for weeks on end, though the trend has begun tapering a bit this week.While most other businesses are shut down, stores like Costco are experience a massive spike in sales. P&Ls will probably be too murky to judge the future using short-term reports, meaning investors will need to use their best judgment to guarantee gains.Luckily for us, Costco stock has a very reliable performance record, so you can count on it over the long-term. This is all a long way to say you should definitely buy COST stock on the biggest market dip in modern history.  * 7 Telecom Stocks That Are Worth a Close Look To be clear, value is not the reason to catch the COST stock knife; it still has a 33 price-to-earnings ratio. However, it is now selling below its full year revenues. That's just too cheap to pass up, especially for longer term investors. When the stock markets are higher in the future, Costco will also be higher. Walmart (WMT)Source: Charts by TradingView The same hoarding sales spike we noted for Costco also applies to Walmart. Stores were mobbed and the shelves were picked clean. But beyond cleaning goods and the like, consumers also bought out most of the grocery section. So registers at WMT were singing a happy tune, and the P&Ls aren't looking as terrible as millions of dormant companies out there.However, looking past this period toward the future, we have to consider that much of this increase in sales now is pulling away from future sales. So we may be looking at a spike and then a consequent dip.So for the near-term following this quarter, comparable sales may look terrible. Investors looking to buy in now should know this and be okay holding the shares through that downswing. This effect is smaller for COST stock, since the extra sales were concentrated on a handful of items. For that reason, I would prefer Costco stock over WMT here.But for investors more concerned about value, Walmart is second-cheapest, with shares at 22 P/E ratio and 0.6 times full year sales. But sometimes cheap isn't as important as the overall scenario.For whatever reason, after the Christmas 2018 crash, Wall Street changed its sentiment towards Walmart. In 2019, they couldn't buy enough of the stock. Case in point, WMT set a new all-time high just a month ago.This dip brought Walmart stock back down to test the $100 neckline and it's held above that level so far. This is encouraging and suggests that the zone below will be solid footing.Corrections are beneficial in the sense that they shake out shareholders who aren't firm in their conviction. This is to say that Walmart stock is a buy near $104. If you already own WMT stock, you can hold it confidently knowing that there will be buyers below. Why I Am More Optimistic Than MostThe big question when trying to invest in a market crash is figuring out the bottom. In this case, we have an unprecedented setup where the demand crash is self-imposed. Soon enough, the world will go back to work and the switch will be set back to ON. These retail stocks are especially poised to benefit from the global restart.Of the three today, Target stock is my favorite because it has the most ground to recover and from a better relative base.Moreover, the sellers will have to not only fight the Fed, but also the White House's $2 trillion relief package and the brilliant scientists combating COVID-19. Fed Chair Jerome Power recently said during a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview said that they had unlimited bullets. The White House also said it will do more as needed to restart the economy. The bulls have cavalry coming, so bears should be cautious.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-04-09,"Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares held steady as the novel coronavirus pushed the stock market lower. That's no surprise, given the wave of panic buying as the pandemic hit America. But, while competitors like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have made new highs, Costco stock has pulled back.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com To me, that's a sign Costco shares are a buying opportunity on the dip. Why? The company's membership-based model gives it less volatile revenue. Granted, the company isn't the only player in the club retailer space. Not only do you have publicly traded BJ's Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ), you also have Walmart's Sam's Club unit.Yet, Costco is leaps and bounds ahead of these rivals. Not just in size, but also in growth potential. The company's stores have continued to grow, while its peers tread water at best. In fact, places like Sam's Club have closed stores, while Costco continues to expand its reach.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYes, Costco stock isn't &quot;cheap.&quot; Shares trade at a higher valuation multiple than its retail rivals. But, in terms of quality, and growth potential, shares offer a solid opportunity in today's market. Costco Stock Is 'Crushing It'Shares may have pulled back from their pre-pandemic highs. But the company's operations have been stronger than ever. In March 2020, sales soared 11.7% from the prior year's period. Yet, short-term tailwinds like the coronavirus are just the start.What do I mean? I'm talking about how this short-term catalyst benefits long-term growth. Today's crisis likely drove increases in Costco membership. And that's the beauty of this company's business model relative to traditional discount retailers.  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential The company generates positive gross margins on its retail sales. But membership fees are the real profit center. And with a stunning 90.9% renewal rate in North America, this represents a steady income stream for Costco. Yet, consistent revenue doesn't mean the company faces weak growth. Thanks to a combination of same-store sales growth, along with consistent new store openings (16 new U.S. locations in 2019 alone), the big box bulk behemoth can keep the growth train humming.But that's not all! Costco stock also has an international catalyst in motion. Even better, a China catalyst in motion. As I've previously discussed, the company last year opened its first Chinese location in Shanghai. Not only did the Shanghai store do record business at opening. This location has one of the chain's largest membership bases. I take this to be a sign the company has tremendous growth runway in China.In short, Costco is not just a high-quality, growing business. The company has exposure to a key &quot;megatrend,&quot; the rise of China's middle class.With these kinds of catalysts at play, what more could you ask for? Yes, the stock trades at a premium valuation. But diving into the details, shares are worth the premium price. Discount Store At Premium Valuation? It's Worth It!A big concern among investors looking at Costco stock is valuation. I agree, this is no value stock. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 34.8. BJ's stock certainly doesn't command a similarly high earnings multiple. The smaller rival trades for just 15.5 times forward earnings.Not even Walmart trades for such a premium valuation. It trades for 23.5 times forward earnings. I know, it sounds funny to say a discount store deserves a premium valuation. But don't get lost in the weeds sweating over this.Yes, Wall Street has taken into account the company's many positives, and priced them into its valuation. Yet, that doesn't mean the ship has sailed in terms of potential gains. Firstly, you have the potential appreciation from the stock rebounding from the recent pullback. Secondly, with strong growth likely to continue, shares will go up in tandem with increased earnings.On the other hand, companies like Walmart may face challenges moving the needle. The big box rival projects low single-digits earnings growth, at best. BJ's earnings guidance may exceed analyst projections. But, with anemic revenue growth, they'll have a tough time maintaining earnings growth long term.Simply put, Costco's status as a leader in its space, along with solid financial performance, makes it a high quality stock to buy. Sure, you have to pony up a premium. But long term, it's worth it. Winners Like Costco Belong In Your PortfolioCostco stock continues to trade below its 52-week high. And that's despite the coronavirus tailwind, plus big catalysts that could help drive long-term growth. A leader in the big box bulk niche retail sector, the company is leaps and bounds ahead of its rivals.Even as shares command a big valuation premium to peers, the stock is a screaming buy. My take? Costco stock belongs in your portfolio. Buy the dip, as soon as possible. The recent pullback likely won't last for long.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-09,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) puts up market-clobbering returns over the long-term, but more recently it's been a struggle. There's no sugar-coating it: The Oracle of Omaha has had a rough ride through the current bear market.The S&P; 500, which has recovered somewhat from the depths, was down 18.8% from the February market top through April 8. The average return across all of Warren Buffett's stocks, however, has been a loss of 28.0%.The Berkshire Hathaway portfolio was built to deliver market-beating return over the long haul, not thrive in a global pandemic. Many of Buffett's best stocks of late are growthier plays that have turned tail.

2020-04-09,"Retail has been the second-worst sector in the S&P 500 this year. However, Target (NYSE:TGT) has outperformed in 2020, with Target stock down 23.3% vs. a 32.6% decline for the retail sector.Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com This outperformance doesn't make Target a buy on its own. However, there are clear reasons that the stock has been outperforming in this mess and it's something to take note of. We've seen that unfold plenty since February, so let's explore why Target is still one of the best names in retail. Why I Like Target StockThere are a handful of retail players that are transforming or already fit the mold for retail's future. Those names include Target, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). You could include a few brand-specific names too, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nike (NYSE:NKE), but these are companies that make their own products and happen to be great at retail. For this purpose, we are talking about the big-box retailers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from US Department of Commerce; US Census Bureau Walmart, Costco and Target rely on a bulk of their profit to come from in-store shoppers, but they are focused on growing sales via e-commerce. Physical retail locations will always have a role to play for consumers, but they are increasingly looking for online solutions. Those that can do both, like these three, will be long-term winners.But let's not forget the other positives for Target stock. The company pays out a 2.7% dividend yield and trades at a reasonable 14.7 times earnings. Despite the recent novel coronavirus impact, analysts still expect positive revenue and earnings growth this year and next year. That's even with the &quot;recession&quot; word -- and in some circles, the &quot;depression&quot; word -- being tossed around.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Let's put it another way. Investors who are interested in Target stock can begin accumulating this retailer with a 2.8% dividend yield and below-market valuation, while still trading at a near-25% discount from its Q4 high. That's even as Target is forecast to have positive sales and profit growth this year and next year, and remains a long-term winner in the space. Target and the CoronavirusObviously the coronavirus has thrown a wrench into the system. It's got investors worried about financial markets, the labor market, the health system and a whole host of other concerns. It's just not a good situation.However, the silver lining is that things will get better. It's just a question of when, not if.Over the last several quarters, Target stock has had plenty of bullish momentum. The company would report blowout numbers, the stock would rip higher, consolidate sideways and repeat the pattern on another strong quarter. That is, until this quarter.Target reported earnings on March 3. The company missed on revenue estimates and reported comp-store sales growth of just 1.5% vs. expectations of 2.1%. Keep in mind, the quarter ended before the impact of the coronavirus. So it had lost some momentum before the chaos hit. One quarter doesn't tell the whole story, but it's worth pointing out.With investors talking about a recession, retail should be flattened. That's not the case for Target, though.Management said store traffic has been robust, as have sales. Near the end of the month, comp-store sales for March were up 20% year-over-year. While units like apparel were suffering, essentials, food and beverages were up strong. A few weeks ago, I noted that in-store alcohol sales were also strong for retail across the board. Bottom LineTarget has been seeing a boost, not a shortfall in traffic in sales. That said, the company suspended its buyback and pulled its prior guidance due to the wide-ranging outcomes that are possible. Further, the company is now set to limit the number of customers in stores to help promote social distancing.Perhaps that creates some short-term weakness in the stock over the next few quarters. Maybe the results will still be better than expected. It's hard to say with so much uncertainty in the world right now.However, what's not uncertain is Target's long-term trajectory at this point in time. This retailer is a winner and has a lot of positive attributes. With such a discount from the highs, long-term bulls should consider accumulating a position.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-09,"Warehouse supermarket chain Costco (COST) has reported net sales of $15.49 billion for the retail month of March, an increase of 11.7% from $13.87 billion last year. Comparable sales trends in the US also remained strong with a 12.1% US comp increase for the month of March.Similar to other retailers, COST is also seeing surging consumer demand online with e-commerce sales accelerating by 49.8% in March.However, the results do suggest a recent softening. “We believe this reflects a pull forward in demand, restrictions in stores impeding customer traffic, shoppers browsing less in discretionary areas, and the shutdown of select services” writes Oppenheimer’s Rupesh Parikh.He recommends that investors take advantage of a likely continued volatile trade from here, adding “sales trends could slow further from here.” The analyst reiterated his COST buy rating on April 8 with a $335 price target (9.5% upside potential). COST shares have meaningfully outperformed year-to-date, up 4% vs. a 15% decline in the S&P 500.Net-net, Parikh is staying firmly onside when it comes to Costco stock: “We view COST as both an attractive shorter-term beneficiary of money flows related to coronavirus fears and a longer-term winner, which should help to drive continued outperformance.”The rest of the Street is slightly more cautious; the stock shows a Moderate Buy consensus on TipRanks with a $330 average price target.

2020-04-09,"With so much pain in the retail space, it's easy to get pessimistic about apparel companies. However, some brands have a certain type of immunity in this mess, one of which is Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU). While LULU stock is still down more than 26% from its highs, shares fell an incredible 51.6% from peak to trough.Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com That kind of performance is simply an overreaction and it's unlikely investors will get such a great opportunity in the stock again. Put simply, Lululemon is a premium consumer brand. Although it's possible for the company to fall out of favor, that's not the case right now.The company continues to pull the right levers. Prior to the novel coronavirus outbreak momentum had been quite strong. Lululemon may not be on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) level per se, but it's up there with Nike (NYSE:NKE).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Does Nike Provide Clues?On March 24, a day after the market bottomed, Nike reported its fiscal third-quarter results. Keep in mind, this isn't for a quarter ended months ago, it was a quarter that ended Feb. 29. Nike beat on earnings and revenue estimates, and pointed to a huge rebound in pent-up demand out of China. Further, management said that online sales had been strong amid the global outbreak.  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential What does that have to do with LULU stock?Lululemon has that &quot;it&quot; factor, as does Nike. It's not immune to mall closures and retail slumps, but like Nike, people are going to buy its products in good times and bad. That's evident by its own quarterly earnings report on March 26.Like Nike, Lululemon reported earnings late March. However, the reported period ended Feb. 2, so it doesn't give us as good of a look at how the virus is impacting business. Still, the company was able to beat on earnings and revenue expectations.Further, management pointed out that once coronavirus restrictions were relaxed in China, there was an immediate spike in business. That has improved week by week, but it's the online sales that caught our attention. Nike said it saw a near-triple-digit spike in Chinese digital sales. Lululemon saw a 60% jump in its Chinese digital channel, while management remains committed to doubling its store count in the country this year.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from Trefis.com Nike has a larger presence in China, but both companies show how this region can be a significant revenue generator. In a way, looking at LULU stock is like looking at Nike in the past -- and that's very encouraging for Lululemon's future. Particularly with both companies' latest quarterly figures. Future of CommerceThink of the big-box retailers that are doing well, like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Or brands like Apple, Nike and Lululemon. They all have one thing in common over their peers that are dying out: traction in e-commerce.These companies do an excellent job blending in-store sales and experiences with online sales. It's not just China where Lululemon is experiencing strong online sales. In the quarter, overall revenue rose 20%, while comp-store sales climbed 9%. However, direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales jumped 41%.One could argue that Lululemon is more exposed to changes in fashion trends and has a smaller addressable market than Nike. That's true, but like its athletic-apparel peer, Lululemon is leaning more on DTC sales to drive its top line. As retail continues to evolve, this should only benefit LULU stock in the long run. Bottom Line on LULU Stock  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAt the end of the day, brands like Nike and Apple thrive for a few main reasons: They innovate and they have great customer loyalty. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that Lululemon has similar qualities.LULU stock is an excellent stock for those with a long-term view and can see the value in Lululemon. There will be carnage in retail, but the cream of the crop will rise to the top. I would be surprised if shares retest the lows near $130. If they do -- down abut 50% from the highs -- buy-and-hold investors will be rewarded down the road. But even a dip back into the $165 area wouldn't be so bad.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-14,"The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic isn't just taking a terrible toll in lives, straining the healthcare system and disrupting daily life: It's eliminating American jobs at an unprecedented pace.Nearly 17 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits between March 15 and April 4 as mass layoffs began to ripple throughout the economy. The travel, retail and restaurant industries have been hit particularly hard. Goldman Sachs predicts unemployment could reach up to 15% later this year. If so, that more than double the job losses as a result of the 2008 recession. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard isn't nearly so optimistic, believing unemployment could spike to 32% by next quarter.However, if you've suddenly found yourself on the job search, some relief is on the way. A few sectors are seeing a huge spike in demand, and as a result, several companies are hiring thousands, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of workers right now.Employment categories currently seeing a surge in hiring include grocery stores, food delivery services, package delivery drivers, freight trucking, cleaning services, call centers, e-commerce warehouses and logistics, nursing homes, online tutors, manufacturers of popular shelf-stable food products, pharmacies and security services.To help anyone out there trying to find a job, we've put together a list of 33 of the largest, best-known companies hiring now in response to coronavirus-sparked demand.

2020-04-16,"Over the weekend, The New York Times ran a very interesting article that leveraged credit and debit card data from Earnest Research to analyze how the novel coronavirus pandemic has impacted consumer spending. Spoiler alert: there have been some big changes for consumer stocks.Naturally, as an investor and financial markets analyst, I looked at The New York Times data and conjured up a list of hot consumer stocks benefiting from the stay-at-home economy.That list is fairly robust.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPerhaps obviously, it includes grocery stocks, supermarket stocks, video game stocks, and music and video streaming stocks. Consumers have bulk-bought groceries and consumer staples, and they have doubled-down on at-home entertainment options amid the pandemic.But it also includes some less obvious consumer stocks, like home improvement stocks and office supplies stocks. According to the NYT data, consumers have actually spent more at home improvement and office supplies stores in the last week of March.Broadly, the list includes hot consumer stocks that will stay hot so long as consumers remain locked indoors, which is likely for the next few weeks.  * 30 Stocks on a Deathwatch With that in mind, some hot consumer stocks winning because of how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted consumer spending includes:  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  * Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  * Costco (NASDAQ:COST)  * Target (NYSE:TGT)  * Kroger (NYSE:KR)  * Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM)  * Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY)  * Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ)  * Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)  * SiriusXM (NASDAQ:SIRI)  * Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  * Disney (NYSE:DIS)  * AT&T (NYSE:T)  * Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU)  * Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  * Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI)  * Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)  * Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO)  * Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY)  * Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY)  * Wayfair (NYSE:W)  * Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)  * HelloFresh (OTCMKTS:HLFFF)  * GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB)  * Office Depot (NYSE:OD)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  * Lowe's (NYSE:LOW)  * Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW)  * Dollar General (NYSE:DG)  * Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) Hot Consumer Stocks in the Stay-at-Home Economy: Amazon (AMZN)Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Arguably the hottest of hot consumer stocks winning in the stay-at-home economy is Amazon. That's because this company has exposure to multiple booming stay-at-home economic trends.Consumers are spending more money online. Amazon has the biggest e-commerce platform in the U.S.At the same time, consumers are spending way more money on grocery delivery, online grocery platforms, video streaming, and gaming. Amazon owns a physical grocer with a delivery arm in Whole Foods. The company has an online grocery platform with AmazonFresh. The company also has the second biggest video streaming platform in the world with Amazon Video, and the world's biggest video game streaming platform in Twitch.In other words, Amazon is in every channel that consumes are increasing their spend right now. That bodes well for AMZN stock during these turbulent times. Walmart (WMT)Source: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com Largely because consumers are bulk-buying consumer staples products, Walmart has been a big winner amid the coronavirus pandemic.According to documents seen by The Wall Street Journal, Walmart's U.S. store sales rose 20% in March. Meanwhile, Walmart.com sales rose by more than 30% over the past eight weeks.All of that is because consumers are buying everything from groceries, to toilet paper, to at-home workout equipment … and Walmart sells all of that. At discount prices, too, which is important because millions of consumers are losing their jobs right now, and shopping on a budget.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Net net, given its positioning as America's largest discount general merchandise retailer, Walmart should succeed in this turbulent economic environment. Costco (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com When American consumers are bulk-buying, there's no place better to do it than Costco.It should be no surprise, then, that as the coronavirus pandemic has sparked consumers to bulk-buy like never before, Costco's comparable sales rose 12.3% in March.This dynamic should persist for the foreseeable future. So long as the pandemic is spreading, consumers will keep bulk-buying. So long as they keep bulk-buying, Costco's comparable sales trends will remain red hot. This operational momentum should keep COST stock on an upward trend.I'd caution, however, on valuation. COST stock presently trades at 34-times forward earnings. At that elevated valuation, there's a very reasonable argument that bulk-buying upside is already priced in. Target (TGT)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Much like Walmart and Costco, Target has benefited amid the coronavirus pandemic from a wave of panic bulk-buying.Target management said in late March that comparable sales for the month were trending 20% higher, led by a 50%-plus uptick in essentials comparable sales. This uptrend in comps will persist so long the coronavirus pandemic keeps spreading, and so long as consumers remain under &quot;stay at home&quot; orders.Of note: for a steady growth retailer with attractive coronavirus resilience, Target stock is attractively valued at just 15.5-times forward earnings.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever This attractive valuation, coupled with favorable fundamental drivers, should enable TGT stock to meaningfully outperform going forward. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com As restaurants have closed down, there has been a huge surge in grocery shopping. According to NYT data, in a 7-day period that ended March 18, grocery sales were up 79% year-over-year.That's great news for Kroger, America's largest grocer. Comparable sales at Kroger rose 30% in March amid a surge in grocery shopping.This trend will persist. Restaurants will remain closed for the next few weeks, at least. Consumers will keep up buying groceries in bulk for the next few weeks, at least. Kroger stock will keep heading for the next few weeks, at least.That's especially true since, at 12.7-times forward earnings with a 2% yield, KR stock offers an attractive valuation and steady income, alongside surging sales. Sprout's Farmers Market (SFM)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Alongside Kroger, Sprout's Farmers Market is another grocery stock which has been among the hottest consumer stocks in the market recently.Sprout's is much smaller than Kroger. The former operates about 340 supermarkets across the U.S. The latter operates more than 2,700. Nonetheless, Sprout's is still one of the five big grocery store chains in America, and is consequently a big beneficiary of increased grocery shopping.  * 7 Media Stocks That Will Power Higher After the Pandemic Subsides Grocery shopping trends will remain healthy for the next few weeks, at least. These favorable fundamental trends -- coupled with what is an attractively discounted valuation of 15-times forward earnings -- should propel out-performance in SFM stock going forward. Nestle (NSGRY)Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com When consumers do their panic grocery shopping, they are buying home food and drinks. Nielsen said recently that baking yeast sales rose 231% for the four-week period ended March 21. Canned meat sales surged 132%, pasta sales surged 95% and soup sales rose 90%.Another hot item in this group? Nespresso coffee cups, according to NYT.Who owns Nespresso? Nestle. The beverage giant also owns a variety of other home beverage products, the sum of which are likely seeing huge demand amid this pandemic.Net net, as one of the world's largest providers home beverages, Nestle is well-positioned to see robust sales increases as consumers flock to grocery stores. These robust sales increases should continue to make NSRGY stock one of the hotter consumer stocks in the market. Constellation Brands (STZ)Source: ShinoStock / Shutterstock.com Consumers aren't just buying coffee cups at the grocery store. They are also loading up on alcohol. According to NYT data, alcohol sales are actually up about 25% amid the pandemic.And, believe it or not, Nielsen data actually finds that one of the most popular and in-demand alcoholic beverages during this pandemic is Corona beer.Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands is the maker of Corona beer. The company is also a major investor in cannabis producer Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), and consumers have apparently been panic-buying weed.  * The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Beginners As Markets Rebound All in all, then, Constellation Brands is well positioned for a robust increase in sales amid an uptick in demand for alcohol and pot. Spotify (SPOT)Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com Another category which has seen a big uptick in consumer spending amid the coronavirus pandemic is music streaming -- and the most important company in that space is Spotify.Long story short, it appears that because consumers are stuck working at home, they are listening to music more, and are more willing to pay up for premium, ad-free music subscription services. In that category, Spotify is the unparalleled leader. The company should consequently see an uptick in paid user and engagement growth in March and April.However, it's worth mentioning that a lot of music listening time happens while consumers are commuting and/or working out. Consumers aren't doing either of those things right now. As such, Spotify also has some headwinds here. SiriusXM (SIRI)Source: Shutterstock Alongside Spotify, another important player in the music streaming category is SiriusXM.The attractive thing about SiriusXM stock -- relative to Spotify stock -- is that, despite both companies having exposure to music streaming tailwinds amid the coronavirus pandemic, SIRI stock is off about 30% from recent highs, while SPOT stock is down just 15% from recent highs.In other words, despite having largely similar businesses, SiriusXM has seen its stock price hit much harder than Spotify's stock price.  * 3 Gold Stocks to Buy for Rising Precious Metal Prices The implication is that, once quarterly numbers roll around and both SiriusXM and Spotify report better-than-expected numbers from coronavirus-related tailwinds, SIRI stock will bounce more, because of its bigger pre-earnings drop. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com Music streaming isn't the only streaming entertainment channel in which consumers are spending more money right now. Video streaming is seeing an uptick in spend, too.According to NYT data, consumer spend on video streaming services increased by more than 30% in the last week of March.The most obvious beneficiary of this uptick in video streaming spend is Netflix. That's because Netflix is the 400 pound gorilla in this space, with 167 million global subscribers.As goes the video streaming industry, so goes Netflix. The video streaming industry is booming right now. Consequently, NFLX stock will boom, too. Disney (DIS)Source: ilikeyellow / Shutterstock.com Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the rapid increase in consumer demand for video streaming services is Disney.That's because Disney just launched its streaming service, Disney+, in late 2019. What's the best possible catalyst for Disney+ to gain mainstream traction quickly? A pandemic, in which no one can go outside, and video streaming services like Disney+ are the best entertainment option.In other words, the pandemic will accelerate mainstream adoption of Disney+ globally. Indeed, it already has. In just five months, Disney+ has amassed 50 million global subscribers.Yes, Disney's other business -- theme parks, cruises, box office, and linear televisions ads -- are being killed amid this pandemic. But, those businesses will bounce back once the pandemic fades. In the meantime, the company's true growth business -- Disney+ -- will be on fire.  * The 7 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for the Long Haul Ultimately, that means DIS stock should both weather the coronavirus storm going forward, and bounce big once the virus passes. AT&T (T)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Another streaming service provider which should win big because of the coronavirus pandemic is AT&T.AT&T owns HBO. HBO has its own streaming service, called HBO Now. But, more excitingly, AT&T is going to launch its new streaming service, HBO Max, in May. This streaming service will include all HBO content, alongside tons of content AT&T acquired from its TimeWarner acquisition.In other words, HBO Max is AT&T's Netflix -- and it's going to launch at a perfect time.It is quite likely that millions of bored consumers, still largely stuck inside in May, sign up for HBO Max in a hurry, and that the streaming platform is a huge hit from day one.If so, then AT&T stock should bounce back in May on this big success, much like Disney stock has bounced back on Disney+'s success. Roku (ROKU)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com A less obvious -- and more prolonged -- way to play the streaming video boom is by buying Roku stock.Most of Roku's revenues come from connected TV ad sales. And, yes, ad spending trends will get hit hard in the second quarter, leading to Roku reporting pretty ugly numbers.But, zoom forward five months. Roku is seeing record engagement today, thanks to the streaming TV boom. Ad dollars always follow engagement. Once ad spending trends bounce back in a few months, then, Roku will turn record high engagement, into record high sales.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 That pivot paves the path for a huge second-half recovery rally in ROKU stock. Apple (AAPL)Source: Shutterstock Yet another consumer stock to buy to play the increase in streaming TV engagement is Apple.In late 2019, Apple launched its Netflix competitor, Apple TV+. It's unclear whether or not Apple TV+ is seeing the robust increase in paid demand that Disney+ is. Nonetheless, it is clear that Apple TV+ is releasing several of its original shows to be &quot;free&quot; during this quarantine period.This is a smart move. Many consumers will watch these free shows because, well, they are bored and the shows are free, so why not? Some will like the shows. Of those that do, some will pay up, and turn into long-term Apple TV+ consumers.As such, amid the coronavirus pandemic, Apple TV+ should see a substantial uptick in subscribers, which should lead to increased Services revenue growth, and a higher AAPL stock price. Activision (ATVI)Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke/Shutterstock.com One category which has seen a huge gain in consumer sales amid the coronavirus pandemic is gaming. Consumer spend on gaming products and services rose more than 50% in the last week of March, according to NYT data.Leading the way was probably video game publisher Activision. Not only is the company behind a portfolio of games which are the exact type of competitive, online games consumers are playing right now with their friends -- such as Call of Duty -- but Activision also just launched Season Three of its its Call of Duty: Modern Warfare universe.In other words, it is quite likely that consumers are playing -- and paying up for -- Activision games at a robust rate today.  * The Top 15 Stocks to Buy in 2020 So long as this continues, ATVI stock will continue to be one of the hottest consumer stocks in the market (shares are up 5% year-to-date against a massive market sell-off). Electronic Arts (EA)Source: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com Electronic Arts is one of three major console video game publishers, with a robust content portfolio that includes FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, Sims, and Star Wars.Just look at how search interest in some of these titles has surged over the past few weeks. Clearly, consumers globally are staying inside and playing EA games more.This trend will persist for the next few weeks, at least. Even once it fades, EA is supported by powerful, long-term growth tailwinds in increased consumer experience digitization, eSports, and new console upgrades towards the end of the year.Big picture: EA stock is a long-term winner, with significant near-term tailwinds. Take-Two (TTWO)Source: Thomas Pajot / Shutterstock.com Another video game publisher which is winning big because of increased video game engagement and spend in Take-Two.The maker of series such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K has clearly seen a huge uptick in consumer interest in its games during the pandemic. Some of that has to do with a recent NBA 2K tournament that the NBA just hosted, wherein ESPN aired NBA 2K games played between NBA players.Much like EA and Activision, though, Take-Two is much more than just a near-term coronavirus play. The company is supported by secular tailwinds in increased video game engagement and spend, and esports.  * 5 Growth Stocks to Buy for 2020 As such, I'd stick with the rally in TTWO stock -- both for now, and for the long haul. Nintendo (NTDOY)Source: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com Believe it or not, while the market has plunged this year, Nintendo stock has actually risen 4% to sit just shy of 52 week highs.The strength in NTDOY stock can be attributed to huge demand for the Nintendo Switch gaming console. Long story short, the Switch has been the hottest game console in the market for the past few years. One of its greatest attributes, relative to traditional consoles, is that it's movement-based, and consumers are increasingly looking for movement-based things to do because they can't go to the gym.Case-in-point: my own household. We own a Switch. We've spent upwards of $100 on new games like Just Dance and Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 as active entertainment alternatives, in a sea of passive entertainment options.My thinking is we aren't alone. A ton of households have done something very similar, meaning Nintendo's sales are likely booming during this pandemic. Etsy (ETSY)Source: quietbits / Shutterstock.com Not surprisingly, e-commerce sales are up during the coronavirus pandemic, mostly because several physical stores are closed.More surprisingly, though, arts-and-crafts e-commerce leader Etsy hasn't seen a steep fall of in sales because of the pandemic. One would presume that demand for arts-and-crafts products would get slammed in a pandemic. That hasn't been the case. Gross merchandise sales fell just 2% in the third week of March, according to Etsy management.Broadly, then, it appears that e-commerce tailwinds are offsetting a drop in consumer discretionary spend for Etsy.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for Your 10-Year-Old So long as this remains the case, ETSY stock should outperform in the retail world. Wayfair (W)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Much like Etsy, e-commerce home furniture platform Wayfair was expected to see a steep fall off in sales amid massive declines in consumer discretionary spend.However, that hasn't been the case.Management announced in early April that the platform has seen increasing sales momentum recently, and that the company will meet or exceed its first quarter guidance for revenue growth and profit margins.In other words, we are again seeing a case of accelerating e-commerce tailwinds offsetting slowing consumer discretionary spending headwinds.So long as this continues, W stock -- which is already up 285% from the lows -- will keep bouncing back. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Jirapong Manustrong / Shutterstock.com A &quot;picks-and-shovels&quot; way to play the e-commerce boom amid the coronavirus pandemic is by buying Shopify.Shopify is an e-commerce solutions provider. The company essentially builds e-commerce enabled websites for all merchants and retailers.Amid the pandemic, many merchants and retailers have been forced to close their physical operations. If they still want to make money, they have to do so online, which means they have to build e-commerce enabled websites.Who builds those better than anyone else? Shopify.  * The 7 Best Low-Cost Index Funds for Your Retirement As such, it is quite likely that Shopify has seen a surge in demand over the past month. This surge is not a one-time thing. Instead, Shopify will turn many of these merchants and retailers into long-term customers, meaning that SHOP stock isn't just a good investment today -- it's a good investment for the long haul, too. HelloFresh (HLFFF)Source: ThomasDeco / Shutterstock.com Not everyone can physically go grocery shopping. Even further, not everyone wants to.That's why demand for online grocery delivery and meal kit maker services has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic. The biggest and most important company in that space is HelloFresh.HelloFresh is a big and growing meal-kit maker which has seen its share of the U.S. meal-kit market grow from 12% in 2016, to 26% in 2019. These huge market share gains can be attributed to HelloFresh's superior speed, simplicity and convenience. Relative to peers, HelloFresh's meals are easier to make, take less time and require less labor and ingredients.This winning strategy will enable HelloFresh to continue to dominate the meal kit category for several years to come. The company is also already profitable on an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization basis, and will only get more profitable with increased scale from the coronavirus pandemic.Net net, if you're looking for a pure grocery delivery play at this time, look at HelloFresh. GrubHub (GRUB)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com While not everyone can or wants to do grocery shopping, not everyone can or wants to cook. That's why demand for food delivery services like GrubHub has skyrocketed amid the coronavirus pandemic.GrubHub has announced that they've seen a record number of new users and restaurants join the platform over the past month, as restaurants have closed their doors and consumers have turned towards food delivery options.Still, I'd be a bit cautious on GRUB stock simply because GrubHub continues to cede market share in the food delivery space to DoorDash, Postmates, and Uber Eats. This market share erosion has been going on for a few years.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Heats Up So long as it continues, the implication is that GrubHub could ultimately one day be pushed out of the food delivery space it invented. That risks makes GRUB stock unnecessarily risk here. Office Depot (OD)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com One of the bigger surprises from the NYT's report is that consumers have been spending more at office supplies stores like Office Depot.This is because employees are working from home. They are upgrading their homes to be at-home offices. That means more pens, more paper, more computer accessories, and the like.Where do you buy that stuff? Office Depot.But, where else can you buy it? Walmart. Amazon. Target.Because of this, I'm not convinced that Office Depot can turn a recent uptick in sales, into long-term success. There's simply too much competition from much bigger, more capable players. Home Depot (HD)Source: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com Home improvement sales are also surprisingly up during the coronavirus pandemic. That's probably because there's no better time to embark on do-it-yourself home improvement projects than… well… when you're stuck at home.In this market, Home Depot is the biggest player.As such, so long as consumers remain cooped up at home and stay occupied by doing DIY home improvement projects, Home Depot's sales should generally continue to trend higher.  * 10 Stocks to Buy Whose Companies Are Stepping Up for Their Employees This near-term strength, coupled with Home Depot's long-term dominant positioning in a secular growth home improvement market, makes HD stock quite attractive here and now. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com The bull thesis on Lowe's is very similar to the bull thesis on Home Depot.Consumers are stuck at home. To entertain themselves, they are embarking on DIY home improvement projects. This leads to a near-term sales boost for Lowe's and Home Depot. At the same time, these two companies are the two dominant players in a home improvement markets that grows alongside the economy.Thus, in both the near- and long-term, LOW stock looks good.The one thing I'd to like add: valuation. HD stock trades at 20-times forward earnings. LOW stock trades at 16-times forward earnings. This is about as wide as the valuation gap between these two stocks has ever been… and it means LOW stock could have explosive rebound potential in the back-half of 2020. Sherwin-Williams (SHW)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com What's one of the easiest home improvement projects consumers can knock out during quarantine?Painting. It should be no surprise, then, that consumer interest in painting has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic. Long story short, consumers are using the extra down time stuck at home, to finally get around to re-painting the guest bedroom.That's great news for Sherwin-Williams, the largest paint company in the world.  * 3 Bank Stocks to Buy Amid Earnings Report Drama Yet, SHW stock trades at a relatively discounted 22-times forward earnings multiple. That attractive valuation, coupled with favorable near-term demand drivers, should help SHW stock outperform peers for the foreseeable future. Dollar General (DG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Discount shopping is also up amid the coronavirus pandemic. That's for two reasons.First, consumers are bulk-buying, and when bulk-buying, prices can add up. So, consumers opt-for for discount retailers to bulk purchase.Second, millions of consumers are getting laid off. Millions more are concerned about being furloughed and/or taking pay cuts. Budgets across the nation are tight. When budgets are tight, consumers penny pinch. And penny-pinching consumers tend to shop at dollar stores.That's great news for Dollar General, one of the major dollar store operators in the U.S. That's why, while pretty much every other company is firing or furloughing employees, Dollar General is nearly doubling its normal hiring rate into the end of the April.So long as the virus keeps spreading, and so long as the economic fall-out keeps getting bigger, then Dollar General's sales and DG stock will remain on an uptrend. Dollar Tree (DLTR)Source: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.com Lather, rinse, repeat. The bull thesis for Dollar Tree is nearly identical to the bull thesis for Dollar General.The DLTR bull thesis is just slightly more enticing for one reason: valuation.Historically, these two stocks have traded at very similar valuation levels. Today, however, that isn't the case. DG stock trades at nearly 23-times forward earnings, above its five-year-average multiple. DLTR stock trades at 16-times forward earnings, well below its five-year-average multiple.  * 10 Stocks to Buy Whose Companies We Can't Live Without Consequently, if you're looking for a dollar store stock to buy during the pandemic, I'd go with DLTR for valuation purposes.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-04-16,"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has been a stud in this tough tape. While shares initially got caught up in the selloff, Costco stock has had a robust recovery off the lows. In fact, shares of Costco are just 1.6% off its all-time highs.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com On the one hand, that shows great relative strength vs. the broader market. Some retailer stocks are doing really well right now, like Costco and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- the latter of which just hit new 52-week highs. On the other hand, those gains could make the stock vulnerable.So while it's encouraging to see big gains here, these stocks could be ripe for profit taking if the market takes a turn for the worst.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Closer Look at Costco Stock  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comFrom peak to trough, Costco stock fell just 13.6%. Man, that's impressive considering the S&P 500 fell more than twice that amount. Even Amazon fell more than 25% from its 2020 high to the March low. Costco shares have now rebounded nearly 16%.The stock market has been resilient over the past few weeks, pushing higher despite elevated economic concerns and persisting worries about the novel coronavirus. However, we're approaching an interesting hurdle in the road. Earnings seasons is kicking off -- which hasn't been all that inspiring so far -- while oil prices plunge below $20 despite OPEC+ reaching a production cut agreement just a few days ago.  * 9 Robust Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market With the S&P 500 25% off the lows, it's fair to wonder if we've rallied too far, too fast. If that's indeed the case and the broader market comes under pressure, Costco stock is unlikely to be immune. Granted, it may very well hold up better than the overall equity markets -- again displaying relative strength. But that doesn't mean it won't go down.Above is a weekly chart of Costco. The stock did a good job of holding the 50-week moving average on the downside and putting in a series of higher lows, evidenced by uptrend support (purple line). Furthermore, bulls regained control when COST reclaimed the $300 to $305 area.While we like Costco stock for the long term, we have to consider the risk/reward with shares near $320. While the stock could push up to resistance around this mark and breakout to new highs, that feat may be difficult in the current environment. Instead, investors should aim to scoop this name up on a discount. Why Like Costco Wholesale?Bulls came rushing back to Costco stock in the same way that customers rushed into stores. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, consumers panic-purchased food, alcohol and key supplies. That spurred sales higher for companies like Kroger (NYSE:KR), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Costco.Last month, Costco beat on earnings and revenue expectations. Additionally, comparable-store sales rose 7.9% vs. expectations of 5.7%, while online sales rose 28%. February comps were robust, rising more than 11%, as were March comp-store sales, which climbed 12.3%. Anticipation of strong March figures was a key reason we liked the stock so much last month.That said, some analysts feel less bullish on the stock now. JPMorgan analysts expect some &quot;normalization&quot; in sales this month. They estimate comp-sales to grow &quot;just&quot; 5.7% -- which would be great for most retailers -- and believe consensus estimates for Costco's fiscal third quarter are too high. As a result, they cut their earnings estimates from $2.10 to $1.75 per share for the quarter.We're not basing our bullish opinion on one quarter worth of business for Costco. Here's a retailer that, for decades now, has proven it can deliver outsized growth. Customers love it, and the company is a best-in-class operator within the retail sector. Harsh economic times may or may not be around the corner. But with Costco's low prices, it should remain popular with consumers.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from Coresight Research; Various sources (Company reports)  Beyond the CoronavirusOur bullish thesis goes beyond just a multi-month spike in sales due to the coronavirus. Costco continues to make efforts to grow its online business. As the retail landscape continues to evolve, e-commerce continues to play a larger and larger role.There's a reason why the retail sector continues to see a large number of store closures despite the economy coming into 2020 in a strong position. That was a trend long before the coronavirus came along, and it's an event that will likely fuel the e-commerce transition.Several big-box retailers are among those taking notice and are making digital transformations as a result of these changes. That includes Costco, which has done a great job pivoting online, along with Target, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), among others.So, for that reason, Costco stock remains a long-term buy.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-16,"Warehouse supermarket chain Costco (COST) has announced that it is ramping up its dividend by 7.7%- at a time when many companies are suspending their dividend payments.On April 15, its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Costco common stock and approved a quarterly increase from 65 to 70 cents per share, or $2.80 on an annualized basis. The latest hike marks COST’s 16th consecutive year of dividend growth.The dividend is payable May 15, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 1, 2020.Costco stock has marginally increased on a year-to-date basis, and looking forward analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock’s prospects.According to TipRanks, COST shows a Moderate Buy analyst consensus with a $329 average analyst price target. In the last three months the company has received 13 buy ratings and 7 hold ratings. (See COST stock analysis on TipRanks).“With what we view as a huge competitive advantage (buying better and working on a lower mark-up than almost any other company) and attractive defensive characteristics in a weakening economic environment, we remain buyers of COST shares” commented RBC Capital analyst Scot Ciccarelli on April 9.He made the comments after Costco reported that US core same store sales (ex-fuel and FX) increased 12.1% in March vs the +24.1% consensus, due to social distancing guidelines.Despite the miss, Ciccarelli continues to believe that Costco remains one of the best positioned stocks among his coverage to overcome the current crisis due to their heavy food/consumable offerings- especially as stores remain open for business.Related News:  Arcus Surges 50% In After-Hours Trading On Rumored Gilead Stake  Billionaire David Shaw Pulls the Trigger on These 2 Stocks  Time to Pull the Trigger?

But rather than headed down a deeper hole, the market seems to moving past this stunning number in hopes COVID-19 will pass sooner rather than later and the US economy will get back to work.Whatever happens, the reality is, no one knows much about anything here. And instead of trying to time a bottom, or pick the hot sectors now, or predict which quarter the economy will resurge, just do one simple thing:Buy quality.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Robust Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market That's it. That's your best bet for now and for the future. These 7 A-rated stocks to buy for strength are all top-rated stocks in my Portfolio Grader:  * CoStar Group (NASDAQ: CSGP)  * Chemed (NYSE: CHE)  * Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP)  * Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)  * Costco (NASDAQ: COST)  * NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA)  * NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)For now, many investors will be looking for the safety of quality stocks. And when good times return, high-quality growth stocks like the ones I recommend at Growth Investor are the companies best built to take advantage quickly. CoStar Group (CSGP)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com CoStar is a unique company in the real estate sector. It provides information, analytics and marketing to the commercial real estate sector.In a world where things have changed so swiftly in just a matter of weeks, the first thing businesses of all types are going to have to examine is how best to move forward.And one the biggest expenses on their books is real estate. Whether it warehouses, office buildings or anything in between, right-sizing space will be crucial. And CSGP is one of the best in this new and fast-growing business.The company has been around since 1987 and is headquartered in Washington, DC but serves not on the US and Canada, but the UK, Spain, Germany and France as well.The stock is up 33% in the past 12 months. More impressively, it's up 7% year to date, a significant relative outperformer. Chemed (CHE)Source: Shutterstock Chemed is an interesting union of two business divisions that aren't necessarily sexy, but are durable and necessary. And the Cincinnati, Ohio, company has been around since 1970, so that durability should be self-evident.Its two divisions are VITAS and Roto-Rooter. VITAS offers hospice and palliative care using a team of professionals from doctors to clergy and volunteers. VITAS is the leading provider of end of life care and has nearly 50 hospice programs in 14 states and Washington, DC.Roto-Rooter is a franchise that offers plumbing services for commercial and residential clients. And it's the largest of its kind in the US. It actually got its big start during the Great Depression, giving people a chance to start a necessary business with little training and a constant demand.  * 9 Robust Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market The stock is up 42% in the past 12 months, and almost 3% year to date. These are two solid sectors that will continue to deliver. And I've got more where that came from. Shopify (SHOP)Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Shopify is an online commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses.Given the state of the economy and the soaring unemployment numbers, there's a good chance many of those people out of work won't have jobs to return to for quite a while.If you recall, this is what happened in 2008 and was the real power behind the 'gig economy' movement, when fee-for-services jobs blossomed for a new generation. You can expect the same thing to happen again.Many older workers will be replaced with younger, cheaper workers. And middle management will get replaced by productivity software and other structural moves.That leaves a lot of people looking for work in sectors built without those jobs for now. Starting a small business as a contract worker or turning a hobby into a business it what Shopify allows these workers to do.The stock is up a whopping 125% in the past year, and 25% year to date. It's not cheap, but in this market you can afford to be patient or buy in over time. Lockheed Martin (LMT)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. Net sales for the company in 2019 were nearly $60 billion.When there is instability in the world - whether that comes as a virus or a repressive regime - defense companies stay busy. When there is significant geopolitical change brought on by rogue actors or power shifts among superpowers, defense companies stay busy.Needless to say, LMT workers do not have idle hands now, nor will they in coming years.Also, because these companies are so big - they have divisions all over the US - boosting defense spending is a win-win for politicians. It shows they're tough and it also boosts the economy. In an election year, both are very important.  * 9 Robust Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market The stock is still reasonably valued given its potential and it continues to perform. It's up 19% in the past 12 months, and off a mere 4% year to date. Plus, it delivers a reliable 2.6% dividend. Growth and income is a hallmark of many of the stocks I recommend for Growth Investor. Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock Costco is a major membership warehouse wholesaler that caters to everyone from small businesses to bulk shoppers, especially those with larger families.Everything is super-sized but the quality is usually top-notch, name brands are available and the size of the company means it has significant purchasing power for its house branded items.For example, it is one of the largest wine buyers in the world, so it can go to quality wineries and place massive orders for great wine at a bargain price. The same goes for most of its products.Also, given the runs on groceries and other essential items, its members-only status keeps down the crowds. And the super-sized items give consumers a head start on stockpiling.This is a company that is doing well now and will continue to thrive, as it did before the lockdown. The stock is up 26% in the past year and almost 6% year to date, with a 0.8% dividend. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.com Nvidia is one of those companies that symbolizes the next generation in computing.Initially starting out as a builder of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for institutions, researchers and gamers, it is now one of the leading tech companies in the world.GPUs have become the game changer in so many of the new cloud-based industries that it went from a funky niche company to major player in a matter of a few years.Around 5 years ago, the stock was trading in the low 20s, where it had traded for years. Now, it's trading near 290, and has a $172 billion market cap.But it has seen volatility, as many tech firms have. And the competition is heating up because they now see the huge opportunities moving forward. But Nvidia is still leading the pack in robotics, drones, smart vehicles, big data, you name it.  * 9 Robust Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market The stock is up 50% in the past year, and up almost 20% year to date. It's a bit pricey, but for that kind of performance in this kind of market, a premium isn't a surprise. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Next Era Energy is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy. It's also a regulated electric utility in south Florida.This gives it both a growth engine and a solid base of regulated revenue. You see, the renewable energy it owns is sold to companies and other utilities for carbon credits to offset their dirtier fuel outputs. And now more companies are also seeing the advantages of having reliable power as the electrical grid becomes increasingly unreliable with no real interest in the federal government or industry to upgrade it.This is the current growth engine for NEE. However, its FPL (formerly Florida Power and Light) has been around a very long time and has a lock on the most dynamic and wealthiest part of Florida. And there are plenty of snowbirds who went south to wait out COVID-19, so demand should be strong.The stock is up 26% in the past 12 months, and year to date it's treading water. It also comes with a respectable 2.4% dividend.It just goes to show, there are still great dividend investments out there, as my Growth Investor subscribers can tell you. And with bond yields so low (even negative, in some cases!) dividend stocks are leading the way out of this bear market.Now that we're hearing from analysts and companies during earnings season, I expect growth stocks to follow … at least, the ones who have what it takes, like my Netflix of 5G. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is a favorite on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it a &quot;Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my new stock report, The Netflix of 5G, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great investment.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-04-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A series of dispatches from America in the age of Covid-19.The hunt for a roll of toilet paper: It’s now one of those shared experiences in American life we will all one day tell our grandchildren about, just before they infect us with some new virus.None of the delivery services here in Berkeley, California, even pretend that they can get their hands on it. You have to go out into the wild to find it, but that’s of course tricky. I walk down to the local Safeway, which now feels like a trip through no man’s land just after the collapse of peace talks. It’s hard to resist the impulse to bob and weave or at least trot through the aisles, like a man dodging sniper fire. No luck: The toilet paper shelves, and only the toilet paper shelves, are swept clean. I then drive to Costco — where a big sign outside lists all the things they don’t have any more of, toilet paper being at the top. I think that maybe I can lay in wait until the next delivery arrives, and pounce on a 24-pack of jumbo rolls as it falls off the truck. But the checkout guy says they get only one load each morning and that it sells out in the first 30 minutes — when only seniors are let in. So the seniors are not entirely innocent here.Finally, I walk down to a local corner store, near the Cal campus. The place was unsettling even before the pandemic: ill-lit, oddly stocked and seldom patronized. The guy behind the counter, always a little jumpy, is now wearing a mask. He used to fear armed robbery, now he’s terrified of people handing him cash. The shelves with the paper products are predictably empty, and when I ask him how long before he gets more he says, in a muzzled voice, “they don’t tell me.” “Who is they?” I wonder but before I can ask, he says, “I can sell you one roll.” He vanishes into a storeroom and emerges with an object that looks less like a roll of toilet paper than a millstone, or one of those giant Dutch Gouda wheels. It has no packaging on it; it’s just this truly massive single roll of toilet paper. I of course snap it up for $5 and take it home to measure it, in the same spirit I used to measure rainbow trout after a fishing trip. It’s not Charmin; it’s not even squeezable. But it’s 15-inches in diameter. God knows where the guy got it; I sensed I shouldn’t ask.*****A few years ago, I met a prominent molecular biologist and biochemist named Joe DeRisi. Among other achievements, he had identified the original SARS virus back in 2002. He is one of those people who has trouble saying anything that isn’t interesting. I badly wanted to write about him and his work but could never quite figure out how to do it. Infectious disease seemed such a narrow and specialized subject: Who would possibly be interested in that?Today, he runs the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco, where he has spent the last three weeks turning his third floor into a coronavirus lab. “The thing I’m most interested in is testing the bejesus out of people,” he says, when I call him. “It’s impossible to know what’s going on without more testing.” The new lab, staffed by 200 graduate-student volunteers working around the clock, can process 2,500 tests a day. But it is largely idle, processing only about 200 tests a day. The reason: a shortage of the nasal swabs needed to administer the tests. “They’re thinner than a Q-tip,” DeRisi says. “You can’t just jam a Q-tip up there. And they were basically all made in a single factory in Northern Italy.” The factory was overstretched by the demand; hence, the shortage.Anyone who thinks it is a challenge to find toilet paper should try getting these nasal swabs. In the past few weeks, DeRisi has called everyone he can think of to obtain them. He assumed someone must be in charge of this sort of thing in our public health system, but it turns out no one is. “It’s like when you get to the front of the plane and you find out there is no pilot,” he says. The head of a big tech company said he wanted to help and offered all sorts of high-tech stuff — but DeRisi said all he needed were these glorified Q-tips. “Oh, we don’t know how to make those,” said the tech exec.*****I wait until dusk to go for a walk, so I have the local hiking trail to myself. Fifteen minutes in, I come across the hind leg of a deer. It’s just lying there, like a small tree limb, in the middle of the trail. The thigh is gnawed to the bone and the blood, while not wet, isn’t reassuringly crusty and dry either. The lower part of the leg remains uneaten, as if the meal had been interrupted. A sign at the park entrance tells you to watch out for mountain lions. Anyone who runs or walks at dusk is vaguely aware that, if he is ever going to be eaten by a mountain lion, now would be the time. In pre-pandemic days I’d have been on alert: glancing around, listening for a rustle in the woods, trying to remember if I was supposed to curl up in a ball, or stand on my tiptoes and scream. But just then people appeared on the trail. Humans. Without masks. Headed straight for me.After we’d picked our way past each other — I could see them holding their breath, too — I spent the rest of the walk preoccupied with the possibility that there might be even more of these killers in the woods. I totally forgot about mountain lions. The new fear had replaced the old one, the way more urgent news shoves less urgent news from the front page. If the virus wasn’t at the forefront right now something else would be: but what? Fear works a bit like that. For example, there was a time Donald Trump was whipping up fear of Mexican immigrants, who he advertised as rapists and murderers and so on. Could he still frighten people in Michigan with stories about Mexican gang members, or does he need to wait until the pandemic ends? Are the Americans who once feared Mexican immigrants still as afraid of them as they were six weeks ago?*****The news just arrived from New Orleans that Tom Dempsey is dead. The former Saints kicker had been living in the Lambeth House, a retirement community, along with a lot of my parents’ old friends. Like some huge number of them, he had caught the virus. You have the feeling right now that this kind of thing is going to be happening a lot. The pace of death will outrun our ability to process individual deaths. But for Tom Dempsey, I’d like to pause for a moment.He was one of those athletes whose story was bigger than just sports. He was born in 1947 with no fingers on his right hand and half of a right foot, at the end of his kicking leg. I was in Tulane Stadium with my father when he used that half of a foot to kick his game-winning 63-yard field goal — which would remain an NFL record for the next 43 years. Incredibly, the first response to that kick of some NFL owners was to complain — to say that having a stump rather than a foot gave Dempsey an advantage as a kicker.People in New Orleans loved the spectacle, but even they viewed their kicker more as a source of amusement than as a hero. “Made it by half a foot, give him a hand,” people used to say, and laugh every time. But Dempsey has always been one of my heroes, and I once ran him down and took him to lunch. He was defiant: He knew how hard it was to do what he had done. And he knew how hard he had worked to turn a weakness into a strength. I know one man who, as a small boy, had met Dempsey and asked him, “What happened to your feet and your hands?” Dempsey had been sweet about it. “Well,” he’d said, “when I was standing in line in heaven to get hands and feet, I was last in line. And by the time I got to the front they only had one-and-a- half pairs left.”(Corrects fifth paragraph of column published April 8 to say that a nasal swab factory in Northern Italy was overstretched by demand, not closed.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Michael Lewis is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-04-30,"In the midst of an economic scare as severe as this one, investors should look to blue-chip stocks to weather the storm. Many of these companies have massive financial resources that will allow them to not only keep the lights on while the economy grinds to a standstill, but get aggressive on the upswing, through advertising spend, research and even acquisitions.I recently wrote about the importance of balance sheets to investors. You should always consider factors such as a company's cash and debt before buying. But doing so is all the more vital when Wall Street's focus shifts from growth to survivability.You see an affinity for blue chips in the analyst community. For instance, Jefferies, in a March 16 report outlining high-quality stocks to buy on the dip, was focused on &quot;strong business models, healthy cash flow and very robust balance sheets.&quot; That's a common refrain among the pros finally emerging to suggest buying this dip.Here are 25 blue-chip stocks with some of the strongest balance sheets on Wall Street. Each of these stocks' balance sheets are graded on a 1-20 scale (the higher, the better). We also included two other measures: a &quot;market-based rating&quot; and a &quot;COVID sensitivity score.&quot; The market-based rating takes bond-market signals into account. For instance, an unusually high yield on a bond indicates that fixed-income investors see a higher risk of default. (I've always said bond investors are some of the smartest minds in the market.) Meanwhile, the COVID sensitivity score measures the impact of the coronavirus outbreak to a variety of income and balance-sheet items.Both scores are in a range from 1-5; again, the higher the better. So a market-based rating of 5 is a strong signal of confidence from the bond market. And a COVID sensitivity score of 5 implies the stock is much less sensitive to the outbreak than your average company.One last note before we dig in: A balance sheet is a snapshot of a moment in time. Therefore, if you're going to use balance sheets to educate your investments, you'll need to keep looking at the most recently available reports.Now, let's look at these well-fortified blue chips.

2020-04-30,"As a general rule, the best stocks to invest in while the economy is plunged in a recession tend to be boring, get-the-job-done companies.They have to be. In a recession, there's typically not a lot of money for much else.No one has officially announced a recession yet - it usually takes six months to determine a recession has actually occurred. But according to 45 different economists, the U.S. is indeed in the midst of a recession. The National Association for Business Economics expects economic growth fell 2.4% in Q1, and will drop 26.5% in Q2.While those same economists believe the U.S. economy will rebound in the second half of the year, the global picture isn't so bright. The International Monetary Fund believes the world economy will remain in a weakened state all year, with GDP contracting 3% - well below its January projection of 3.3% growth - before rebounding with 5.8% growth in 2021.The companies best suited to survive, if not thrive, in this kind of environment, are defensive stocks that provide products and services people simply can't live without.With this in mind, here are 20 best stocks to invest in during a recession.

2020-05-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the coronavirus pandemic continues, Bloomberg Opinion will be running a series of features by our columnists that consider the long-term consequences of the crisis. This column is part of a package envisioning a new consumer economy. Consumers tend to respond to mass crises in two contradictory ways, research has shown: We retract into our shells and hold onto our money, then we spend as if there’s no tomorrow. One reaction naturally follows the other: First comes penny-pinching to help us regain a lost sense of control, then an exuberant play to live this brief and fragile life to the fullest while we still can.Buying behavior, in other words, is tied to how people are feeling about their own mortality — subconsciously or not — especially in times of great social trauma.Are these the reactions we should expect in the wake of Covid-19? If so, how will they play out? Doug Stephens, the founder and president of Retail Prophet and the author of two books on retail consumer behavior, has been looking at past widespread traumatic events for the answers. I asked him some questions about what the future might hold. Here is a lightly edited transcript of our exchange.Mary Duenwald: It seems a bit heavy to look at consumer behavior through a lens of mortality. Is our fear of death always hovering over us when we shop, or does it come into play only after grave crises?Doug Stephens: They say that the only certainty in life is death. And for many years psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists have postulated that much of human behavior is predicated on that very simple notion — that we’re all going to die. Human beings are unique in the sense that we, unlike any other animals, are conscious of our own mortality — something that strikes terror into the hearts of most of us. Terror Management Theory, developed by social psychologists Jeff Greenberg, Sheldon Solomon and Tom Pyszczynski, suggests that our only means of coping with persistent death anxiety is to create a worldview, a reality if you will, that works to distract us from death’s inevitability. We busy ourselves with work, family, friends, religion, community, plans, etc. — mostly in an effort to stave off thoughts of death. This worldview that we create brings meaning and order to what might otherwise be viewed as a chaotic and uncaring universe. Within that worldview we also work to ascribe value to our rightful place and existence within it. We tell ourselves that “my boss depends on me,” “my church values me,” “my family needs me” or “my team can’t win without me” — all to establish a sense that our lives have inherent value. For many, material goods help to bolster this sense of self-esteem and worth.But every now and then something comes along that shatters the security of this worldview and our value in it. Things like wars, depressions, recessions and terrorist attacks can shatter the illusion of meaning, order and self-worth that we’ve created. This is what Terror Management Theory refers to as “mortality salience” — a reminder that life is finite and we aren’t really any more important or valuable than a blade of grass or a bird. Thus, in the face of such events, we attempt to do two things: defend and shore up our world view and re-establish our self-worth and esteem. MD: How does spending — on things or experiences or services — help people tolerate their own mortality?DS: Spending on material goods can do two things: Give consumers a renewed sense of control over their lives, their security and safety. This tendency explains much of the panic buying we witnessed at the outset of the pandemic. Leaving Costco, for example, with an overflowing cart of essentials instills a sense of control in the midst of chaos. Spending can give us security and control in other ways too. Buying a new pair of pants can give us a better sense of control in preparing for a job interview. So, control and order is the first priority.Second, spending on material possessions can enhance our sense of self-esteem. As a society, we use possessions as a proxy for individual value or worth. This need or desire to acquire material goods after a crisis is explained by another theory called Secular Immortality, developed by Elizabeth C. Hirschman, a professor of marketing at University of Virginia. Secular Immortality suggests that this need to reaffirm our worth and value in the world can drive us to create a sense of lasting legacy or symbolic immortality through material possessions. Amassing, owning, displaying possessions can imbue us with a sense of immortality. MD: What other mass crises in the past could be instructive about how consumers will behave after Covid-19?DS: It’s not easy to find other world events that can compare completely with Covid-19, but the 1918-19 pandemic offers some solid clues. The pandemic, which came on the heels of the First World War, resulted in a long and severe depression. But by mid-1921, we saw the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, a period of unprecedented growth, prosperity and yes, consumption. In fact, the U.S. economy grew by 42% inside of the decade. The extreme brush with mortality people felt from 1914-1919 spurred a rush to reconstruct our cultural worldview and reestablish our value within it.MD: What do you see happening this time around? Will we have to wait until the coronavirus has been eradicated for consumer spending to bounce back, or for exuberant spending to happen?DS: First, I don’t think we’ll return to life as we knew it anytime soon. I expect a slow relaxing of social distancing measures as we wrestle the curve, but some curbs on our behavior may persist for years. Consider how 9/11 changed every aspect of air travel. But eventually, there will be a careful reopening of our global economy. By that time it’s nearly certain that much of the world will be in, or on the precipice of, a recession. In the short term, deep uncertainty about their economic future and job security will be met by most with a natural inclination to reduce spending, focus on essentials and avoid risk. Eventually, as the economy picks back up, we are likely to see these ideas of Mortality Salience and Secular Immortality manifest themselves, and a period of significant consumption beginning in 2022. MD: Will some kinds of spending return before others do?DS: We typically see spending on durable goods — cars and homes, for example — recover before non-durables like electronics and apparel. I expect that to be the case as well post-Covid-19. Luxury will also come roaring back, but it will take a secure employment market and a return to growth in the stock market to revive the average shopper as well as high-net-worth consumers. MD: Will we change the kinds of things we buy? Vacations instead of shoes, gifts instead of personal things — that sort of change?DS: There are volumes of research suggesting that experiences make us fundamentally happier than material possessions. I believe this is especially true today because experiences have become our primary social currency. Experiences play well on social media and provide us with the sense of self-esteem we seek.What is more difficult to calibrate will be the scars consumers are left with. Will we be as willing to spend time on planes or in crowded airports? Will we try to limit our public exposure, at least until memories of Covid-19 recede? It’s difficult to estimate the depth of this trauma. Will we become more practical in terms of only buying what we need, or less so?DS: I think we’ve learned to be resourceful and do more with less. We’ve seen more people cooking, crafting, taking up hobbies and finding pleasure in simple things. Much of this may be part of short-term coping strategies aimed at making it through isolation, but the events of 2020 could also give us pause to reflect on what we truly need and want out of life versus what is superfluous. So, yes, we could become more practical in our choices.It’s worth noting, however, that mortality salience can also trigger risky and self-destructive behaviors such as drug and alcohol use and over-spending. If an individual believes that a particular activity, despite its risk, results in higher self-esteem, they are likely to pursue it regardless of the outcome. Could the Covid-19 experience teach consumers things that change their behavior for good? DS: Yes. We only have to look at the way the Great Depression indelibly imprinted the psyches of those who lived through it, to understand how trauma can shape future behaviors. The propensity to save money, use coupons, re-use items, conserve and mend things, rather than buying new — all of these behaviors were borne out of the economic brutality of the Depression and the scarcity that accompanied it.Likewise, after this pandemic, I don’t think anyone will ever look at a touchscreen in a store the same way again. Some of us may avoid air travel, movie theaters and any similar crowded public spaces. I do believe we’ll have a greater sense of appreciation for the people who work in stores, wait on tables and deliver things to our homes. And I fully expect to see people creating small stock-piles of key products in the event of any other similar crisis. My personal hope is that Covid-19 can impart to us a greater appreciation for the fragility of life and the world we share, making sustainability an even higher consumer priority. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mary Duenwald writes editorials on energy, health care and science for Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-05-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Geckobrands was wary of Amazon.com Inc. when it first started selling waterproof smartphone cases and other outdoor gear seven years ago. The Grandville, Michigan, company knew that getting too cozy with the world’s largest online retailer could alienate the brick-and-mortar stores with which it was trying to develop relationships. When the pandemic struck, Geckobrands products were in more than 3,000 locations, including Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., the supercenter chain Meijer Inc. and amusement park kiosks.Now many of those stores are closed. With springtime orders tanking and bills piling up, Geckobrands has choked back its aversion to working with Amazon. “Our brand has to be more relevant on Amazon right now,” says Geckobrands President Gabe Miller, whose company now sells 50% more of its products through the e-commerce giant. “Store traffic, whether the retailer is open or closed, is just so suppressed.”Consultants that help brands navigate Amazon’s marketplace say the company is attracting a broad range of vendors that before the outbreak sold everything from fishing gear and art supplies to clothing and beach totes at physical stores. Brands and wholesalers assume that many of their retail partners won’t survive the pandemic, meaning Amazon will probably hang onto much of the new business. Jeff Bezos is spending heavily—and willing to forgo profits—to keep his company running through the pandemic. Amazon’s online sales soared 24% in the first quarter, the fastest pace in four years. Deemed essential, Amazon has a unique opportunity to grab market share while most of its brick-and-mortar rivals are closed. Bezos, who has compared his warehouse workers and delivery contractors to Covid-19 first responders, is betting that strengthening Amazon’s position won’t provoke antitrust regulators already investigating the company. “This is one of those situations where the rich get richer,” says Andrew Lipsman, analyst at EMarketer Inc. “It’s not just Amazon. The top 10 retailers that can remain open have a tremendous advantage and we’re going to see a lot of smaller retailers get washed out.”Before the pandemic, about 45% of brands didn’t sell products on Amazon at all, according to a survey conducted by Feedvisor, which sells pricing software used by online retailers. And more than one-third said they didn’t need Amazon to reach customers. Many brands and wholesalers kept Amazon at arms length because they were concerned it would squeeze their margins, collect precious customer data and copy their most popular products.Showrooming—when shoppers check out products in physical stores and later buy them online—made retailers reluctant to give shelf space to products prominent on Amazon. Nike’s retreat from Amazon last year highlighted brand frustration with Amazon.The pandemic has upended those verities and accelerated the ongoing stampede online. What’s happening now echoes the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy three years ago. The chain shuttered hundreds of stores and left more than $1 billion in annual toy sales up for grabs, most of which went to Amazon, Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. The difference this time is that multiple chains and categories have gone dark.Under normal circumstances, Magpul Industries, an Austin, Texas based gun-accessory maker, would be selling plenty of rifle scopes and stocks through Dick’s, Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s. But with so many specialty retailers temporarily closed, Magpul is starting to put its wares on Amazon, according to Josh Cowan, a former Amazon executive who helps the brand and dozens of others sell products on the site. “Brands are absolutely terrified to be reliant on Amazon right now, but they have no other choice,” says Cowan, an account manager at Streiff Marketing. “Amazon has been the one place where brands in all categories have said we have to double down.”Ivory Ella, which sells “save the elephants” t-shirts and hoodies and donates proceeds to wildlife conservation, is considering putting inventory on Amazon, which it has traditionally avoided since it prefers online shoppers buy from its own website. The company sells merchandise to hundreds of mostly mom-and-pop gift shops in tourist towns around the country that closed due to the pandemic, putting almost half of its sales in jeopardy.Amazon was never a good fit for the brand's strategy,  says CEO Cathy Quain, but now it has no other choice. “It’s a necessity for us to be where people can shop,” she says. “If we have another surge of the virus come holiday season and retailers have to close in October, November and December, people will be doing most of their shopping on Amazon.&quot;Amazon has long enjoyed outsize power over small businesses that generate most of their sales on its site. Now that leverage is expanding to include bigger brands that could previously rely on physical stores for most of their sales. Meanwhile, store closings and shelter-in-place orders have sped up consumers’ stampede online, with Amazon emerging as one of the few remaining sales outlets. Big-box chains like Walmart, Target and Costco Wholesale Corp. are also benefiting because they’re allowed to remain open to sell groceries, along with just about everything else. But they face restrictions on what they can sell in some states while Amazon has eluded any such mandates in the U.S.Amazon’s market power is already being scrutinized by the U.S. government, as part of a larger examination of the grip big technology companies have on the economy. Last week, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee investigating Amazon threatened to subpoena Bezos if he ignores a request to testify before the committee. The demand followed a Wall Street Journal report that the e-commerce giant used data from third-party sellers on its site to develop competing products, contradicting testimony from an Amazon executive before the panel while under oath last year.The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating the relationship between Amazon and its suppliers to determine if the e-commerce giant uses its market power to stifle competition. Brick-and-mortar store closings only strengthen Amazon’s position. Online sales growth doubled to 30% in March and about tripled in April, according to Lipsman of EMarketer. The pandemic puts Amazon in a unique position of being able to grow quickly even if overall consumer spending shrinks due to rising unemployment and a retrenching economy.The losers are the mom and pops that have closed to protect public health. More than half of small businesses closed and 80% percent have let go employees, according to a survey by the Main Street Alliance, a network of 30,000 small business owners.“One of our major concerns for the long term is the potential for massive corporate consolidation and monopolization of our economy,” says Sarah Crozier, a spokeswoman for the group. “If Main Street is left to wither, the economy will look vastly different at the other end of this.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Wins Business From Reluctant Brands After Virus Closes Stores

2020-05-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amid the worst jobs report in the history of jobs reports, a few industries actually added jobs from mid-March to mid-April.“General merchandise stores including warehouse clubs and supercenters” is the North American Industry Classification System category for Walmarts, Targets, Dollar Trees, Sam’s Clubs, Costcos and such. It seems likely that supermarkets also saw job gains, but for them and most other industry subcategories employment is reported with a one month lag, so we won’t know until the next jobs report. Food and beverage stores, the supersector that includes supermarkets, saw a 42,000-job seasonally adjusted decline in employment in April.Among the other job-gaining sectors, “other information services” may require some explanation. About 80% of its jobs are at “Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals,” which covers the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter. The remainder are at other digital information providers such as, well, the publisher of Bloomberg Opinion. “Couriers and messengers” is FedEx, United Parcel Service and their ilk.One thing that stands out here is that the job gains are really, really tiny compared with the 20.5 million jobs lost. We may well see a more significant shift of employment into pandemic-resistant or pandemic-fighting sectors in the coming months, but that takes a while. And given that the shifts in demand that have had everybody lining up at Costco for toilet paper are not (one hopes) permanent, such companies are unlikely to go overboard with hiring.Another thing that stands out is that a lot of sectors that would seem to be quite essential in a pandemic nonetheless shed jobs. I’ve listed a selection here, ranked by percentage job losses rather than the absolute numbers because that seemed more informative.Other health-care sectors were even harder hit as almost all non-coronavirus-related care was put on hold for the month, with employment down 15.2% at ambulatory health-care services and 52.5% at dentists’ offices. Then again, a lot of those jobs ought to return quickly as well, although things are definitely going to be tough for dentists and dental hygienists, whose work probably entails more intense coronavirus risk than any other.The bigger message here may just be that a U.S. economy that is pared down to “essentials” isn’t much of an economy. Here’s hoping we all start doing a lot more nonessential (but also non-virus-spreading) things soon.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-05-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The e-commerce rebels are making their advance.Last October, Shopify Inc. CEO Tobi Lutke said his company’s goal was to “arm the rebels” against the Amazon.com Inc. empire. Since then, the mantra has become a rallying cry for Shopify’s employees and the merchant customers that use its e-commerce store software. And now, the business turmoil sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic is creating an opportunity for the online seller rivals to gain some valuable ground over their giant competitor.Amazon is widely considered one of the biggest beneficiaries of the e-commerce boom, as self-isolating consumers shift their shopping behavior to purchase more online. The numbers are bearing out the trend: While most companies are suffering from dramatic business slowdowns, Amazon last week  posted first-quarter revenue of $75.5 billion, up 26% from a year earlier, and projected continued momentum by giving a sales growth forecast range of 18% to 28% for the June quarter.(1) Amazon’s growth hasn’t come without issues, though. The company has faced severe logistical challenges to meet demand – including the rapid hiring of 175,000 additional workers. And the stress put on its supply chain and delivery networks, along with the prioritization of certain essential items, has led to shipping delays and many shortages for its customers. Questions revolving around workplace safety have also dogged Amazon.With Amazon so much in the spotlight, it may be surprising to know that consumers are increasingly going elsewhere for their online shopping needs. In fact, several e-commerce sellers are showing dramatically faster growth rates than the tech giant. On Wednesday, Shopify revealed the aggregated online sales of its merchant customer base grew 46% in the first quarter and accelerated further in April. That news came after online furniture retailer Wayfair Inc. said it had revenue growth of roughly 90% so far in its second quarter, a significant increase versus the 20% growth it generated for the three months ended in March.Traditional retailers are flourishing as well. On April 23, Target Corp. said its online business had risen more than 275% month-to-date to that point, while electronics retailer Best Buy Co. also pointed last month to recent triple-digit growth trends for its website. Costco Wholesale Corp., meanwhile, reported April e-commerce sales growth of 86%. For all the antitrust scrutiny Amazon has gotten for crushing the competition in e-commerce with its leading 37% share in the U.S. last year, according to eMarketer, these recent numbers point to share losses for the tech giant. Rivals now have an opening to show they, too, can delight customers with good service and build consumer loyalty. And if they can take advantage, perhaps the e-commerce race isn’t over yet.What is the clearest signal investors, at least, are noticing the progress? On Wednesday, Shopify briefly surpassed Royal Bank of Canada as the most valuable company in Canada for the first time. Yes, the rebels may have a fighting chance.(1) Amazon first-quarter revenueincludes its sales at its online and physical stores, third-party seller services, subscription services, AWS cloud-computing sales and other businesses.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-05-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As panic-ridden consumers stock up on essentials, kitchen pantries are looking like a blast from the processed-food past: boxes of Kraft macaroni and cheese, cans of Bumble Bee tuna, Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Shake ‘N Bake, etc. Brands of yesteryear that had been struggling to find their place in a new health-conscious society are suddenly having a moment once again. But a moment is probably all it will be, not a new normal, which is why packaged-food companies shouldn’t get too comfortable about their comfort food.The Covid-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place orders have led consumers to revert to old ways of shopping in search of ready-made meals and foods with long shelf lives. Parents who are working from home during this time are multitasking like never before, taking on the role of cook, housekeeper, teacher, disciplinary and full-time employee all at once in a Groundhog Day-like loop. As such, traditional meal times have blurred, and in some cases snacks are replacing them, according to research by Euromonitor International. This explains the resurgence of companies such as General Mills Inc., whose brands include Annie’s, Betty Crocker, Cheerios, Pillsbury and Totino’s pizza rolls. Its U.S. retail sales surged 45% in March and 32% in April. To put that into context, the company’s average annual growth rate was just 1.5% over the last decade.In the U.S., the food category that saw the biggest uptick in demand during the week ended April 25 was bread crumbs and other mixes for coating foods, followed by dough and batter products, according to Nielsen tracking. That bodes well for brands such as Shake ‘N Bake, whose parent company, Kraft Heinz Co., just reported its first quarterly sales boost in more than a year.In recent years leading up to this crisis, Campbell Soup Co. was perhaps the hardest hit by changing consumer tastes and demand for fresher foods. The company lost $8.6 billion of shareholder value between mid-2016 and mid-2018, a performance that saw its last CEO out. But amid the shutdowns, Campbell’s stock has been staging a recovery and is trading near its highest price in three years. Kellogg Co. has called this a “reappraisal opportunity” for cereal — a chance to persuade shoppers to give its sugary products another try. Speaking during Kellogg’s recent earnings call, CEO Steve Cahillane said: “Consumers rediscovering these benefits could be very positive for this category, and we plan to seize this opportunity.”But careful, Kellogg. The fact of the matter is, even if the coronavirus leaves a lasting impression on certain aspects of consumer behavior, the dislocation taking place at supermarkets is shaping up to be more of a temporary phenomenon driven in part by food shortages and fear. Consider the absurdity that about 20% of store-bought noodles have been out of stock in the U.S. since mid-March, when the earliest lockdowns began, according to Euromonitor. That’s on the same level as toilet paper shortages. Even baker’s yeast, of all things, is still sold out in many places. But just like we’re not all going to turn our YouTube-taught hair-cutting skills into new careers, most of us won’t keep up such rigorous home training for “The Great British Bake Off,” either.Consumers generally still want fresh, less-processed and healthier-sounding foods. Nielsen is already seeing this in surveys of other countries: In France, shoppers continue to seek out organic items, while Asian consumers say healthy eating has become more of a priority after the virus. And if the post-virus rise of virtual fitness classes is any indication, health and wellness is still top of mind for lots of people.It’s true, families need convenience right now and many are looking to save money as the U.S. dips deeper into a recession and the unemployment rate soars above 14%. That’s partly why seemingly dated grocery products are coming back into favor. They also provide a sense of nostalgia and familiarity at a time when life has been thrown off course.Another significant factor is all the bulk-buying: Wholesale stores such as Costco and BJ’s offer a much more limited variety that tends to be dominated by big-name food brands (although new trendier products are increasingly making their way in). Buying fresh and organic also usually costs more and sells in smaller packages. Over the next few months, Euromonitor analysts expect a greater shift toward more affordable items, private-label brands and bulk purchases.That does create an opportunity for the food giants. A downside to stocking up is all the packaging and cardboard that accumulates, taking up space. It’s an annoyance that companies could try to resolve if sheltering at home is to become a more regular part of life over the next couple of years rather than a distant memory. As U.S. states reopen, though, consumers will probably start to go back to their old routines — or at least some version of them. A bit of the doomsday-prepper mentality may remain, leading more households to keep their cupboards stocked with nonperishables, just in case. But it’s fair to say that the future of the supermarket isn’t Kraft mac and cheese or Campbell’s canned soup. It would be short-sighted to interpret this moment as a rebuke of their innovation efforts. If anything, it’s a time to step it up. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-05-15,"J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) continues to fight for its life, but that doesn't mean investors have to get long on JCP stock.Source: Supannee_Hickman / Shutterstock.com The novel coronavirus has hampered the retail sector, as well as many other industries and sectors. However, retail in particular is feeling the pinch -- and perhaps that's because many in this group have already been under pressure.Neiman Marcus and J. Crew both filed for bankruptcy, and now, many assume J.C. Penney will too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that in mind, let's dive into JCP stock. The Rumors on JCPAccording to reports, J.C. Penney could file for bankruptcy as soon as this week. Moreover, the company is looking to secure $450 million in financing. One option under discussion includes the retailer drawing half of those funds immediately, with the rest of the $225 million coming down the road if JCP can hit certain milestones.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Have Nothing But Upside In Their Future Sounds nice, but is it really worth it?Shares caught a pop on the news, ending higher by 11% on Wednesday when the rest of the market was hit hard. That's after JCP hit a new 52-week low in the prior session. After closing at 22 cents on Wednesday, is it possible this stock doubles?It's a possibility. But with so many great retailers out there, is the one circling the drain the one you really want to bet on? Those who answer that question with a &quot;yes&quot; are gambling, in my opinion -- not investing. Breaking Down RetailBuying JCP stock because it might get lender financing or that it might survive another few months isn't investing. Unless that given investor specializes in bankruptcies and special situations, all of this hinges on what kind of deal Penney's can swing.Either way, what's the end goal? To bridge its operations until the country begins to reopen so that it can make it through the holidays? There's a reason shares have gone from a 2016 high of $12 to ending 2019 near $1. Remember, that's before the coronavirus pandemic.Sad as it is to say, the coronavirus simply accelerated the trends that were in play. While that's benefited companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the struggling retailers are going out of business. Sure, they likely would have anyway, but the process is being sped up.That said, not every retailer is hurting. Look at the stocks of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). They are rebounding hard as consumers -- despite many being out of work temporarily -- are tackling household projects.Look at Target (NYSE:TGT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). These big-box retailers are thriving as consumers continue to buy essential (and some non-essential) supplies. They all saw initial spikes in sales as consumers bulked up their pantries and supply cabinets. But with so many stuck at home, sales should remain steady.It's easy to get carried away and look for out-sized growth from these companies. But simply not falling apart is a victory in my eyes, particularly for this sector. Of course, we can't forget about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- and the e-commerce giant has been as busy as ever. The Bottom Line on J.C. Penney  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comI don't know if J.C. Penney will file for bankruptcy this week or this month. What I do know is that the company and JCP stock has been on the ropes for years. Somehow the company does just enough to make it to the holidays, where a strong economy has kept them afloat for years.Obviously it's an unfortunate event for its employees and no one likes to see people lose their jobs. But from an investment perspective, this one has been under pressure for a long time; the writing has been on the wall.Let's put it this way:Sales have declined in each of the past four years, as has net income. While fiscal 2017 ended with break-even results net income, JCP lost $268 million last year. Current assets of $2.7 billion do edge out $1.9 billion in current liabilities. But with $2.1 billion of current assets (79%) coming from inventory, this current ratio is misleading. Every department store has bloated inventory and the reduces its value.The retailer has $4.6 billion in long-term debt. How is a company with a $71 million market cap supposed to survive under that kind of burden? The short answer is, it can't. It's just a matter of how long it can survive in the meantime.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-05-22,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Earnings season has proven to be good enough. Since April 9, the S&P 500 has rallied 5.4%. The NASDAQ Composite, meanwhile, has done far better. It's gained 13.9% over the same stretch, and now is positive in 2020.That said, it does seem like earnings reports have been quiet. With a few exceptions, investors have looked past near-term results. Most companies have withdrawn forward-looking guidance. Stocks have risen over the last six weeks, but it's difficult to peg earnings season as the core reason why.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven in that context, and with the peak of the earnings calendar in the rearview mirror, earnings next week look particularly intriguing. The slate is dominated by two key sectors, which have posted very different performances over the past few weeks -- and the past few years.On the one hand, a number of software companies report next week. That sector has been one of the best in the market for years, and has helped drive the sharp rebound in the NASDAQ.On the other, we get reports from a number of retailers, both large and small. That sector, with only a few exceptions, has underperformed essentially since the financial crisis -- and during this crisis as well. But a couple of the recent winners do report next week, and will look to build on impressive reports from giants Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) this week.  * 10 Stocks on a Bankruptcy Watch Additionally, there are some other intriguing releases. Elsewhere in tech, chipmaker Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), as well as hardware manufacturers HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), are on the docket. However, software and retail dominate the seven earnings reports to watch next week -- which include:  * Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY)  * Dollar General (NYSE:DG)  * com (NYSE:CRM)  * Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST)  * Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA)  * VMWare (NYSE:VMW)  * Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC)So, with all of that in mind, let's dive into the earnings reports. Earnings Reports to Watch: Workday (WDAY)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, May 27, after market closeEven at this point in the earnings calendar, we haven't seen that many key reports from the enterprise software sector. The likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) have reported, of course. But in terms of key verticals and key offerings, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) posted a solid beat on Thursday afternoon.However, there are some SaaS (software-as-a-service) leaders set to report -- and Workday is the first of them next week. That alone makes Wednesday afternoon's earnings release worth watching. We'll get a glimpse of how enterprises are responding to the pandemic. This crisis, after all, is a key test of the maxim that SaaS revenue is safer than secured debt.Trading in WDAY stock on Thursday will be interesting as well. Again, software stocks still are leading the market -- but valuations were a concern even before the world economy came to a halt. How investors respond to Workday stock will be worth noting, no matter what earnings look like. That's particularly true given what comes the following day. Dollar General (DG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, May 28, before market openDollar General has a big opportunity with its fiscal first-quarter release on Thursday morning. It took a few weeks, but investors are treating DG stock as a pandemic play. The stock touched an all-time high earlier this month before a modest retreat.The case for DG stock is that consumers facing short-term struggles will trade down to its lower-priced offerings. Q1 earnings need to show that's the case.After all, Walmart posted a 10% comp in its Q1, and Kroger (NYSE:KR) is posting blowout numbers. Just keeping pace with those rivals might not be enough given that Dollar General stock has rallied 30% from March lows.  * 3 Energy Stocks That Keep Powering the World However, if Dollar General can beat even elevated expectations, there's room for upside with shares valued at just 24x forward earnings. And if the numbers show further market share gains from rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), which also reports on Thursday morning, all the better. Salesforce.com (CRM)Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, May 28, after market closeAfter Workday's report on Wednesday, Thursday is a huge day for software names. Salesforce.com, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) and Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) all report.That's four stocks with a combined market capitalization well past $200 billion. All four stocks have gained this year; in fact, CRM is the laggard of the group. It's gained just 9% year-to-date, while the other three names are up at least 40%.But Salesforce earnings are clearly the group's most important. Salesforce.com is far larger, and by far the most valuable. Its reach is broader, meaning the company should be able to highlight how customers are responding in a range of industries.Meanwhile, CRM stock long has been an intriguing barometer for the broader market. The attractiveness of the Salesforce.com business really is in doubt; the argument has been over valuation. Particularly with the NASDAQ now in the green for 2020, that argument should be of particular interest to investors throughout the market. Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, May 28, after market closeTo be fair, there may not be much in the way of news from Costco's earnings on Thursday afternoon. The company already has disclosed sales for the first 11 weeks of the 12-week quarter. And COST stock has traded sideways for a few months now. Indeed, options markets at the moment are pricing in a less than 5% move between now and next Friday.But for both the market and for COST stock, there will be some news worth monitoring. Management no doubt will give some color on store traffic as states have reopened in the last two weeks. There may also be some discussion of the response to the company's restrictive policy surrounding mask-wearing.  * 3 Chinese Stocks to Trade As Tensions Mount Over Transparency Issues Additionally, with investors shrugging at earnings from Walmart and Target, the reports from Dollar General and Costco might confirm a trend. Market bears have questioned why markets are still rising despite sharply negative short-term economic news. So if strong results from Costco are met with a shrug, perhaps positive short-term bounces too are being ignored. Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, May 28, after market closeSpecialty retail stocks have fared much worse than the sector's largest players, but by the standards of the group Ulta Beauty shares have done reasonably well. The stock has traded sideways over the past four years, with some volatility, along the way -- but many niche-focused rivals have done far worse.After a 14% decline YTD, ULTA again has outpaced many other retail stocks. To keep that outperformance going, the company needs to find a way to inspire some confidence with Thursday afternoon's report.It's going to be difficult. Ulta's stores closed at the end of March, and only are set to reopen next week. Online sales no doubt will benefit, but Ulta is going to post a soft first quarter release.We have seen a similar, if smaller, company report this week: Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT). And that stock saw just a 4% decline on Thursday despite reporting steep sales declines in March and April. Ulta's earnings will get much more coverage and attention, however, and could signal how other specialty retailers will fare as they report earnings in the coming weeks. VMWare (VMW)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, May 28, after market closeThe market is pricing in accelerating adoption of cloud services as a result of the current pandemic. That's a key reason why both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have touched all-time highs.VMW stock, however, hasn't seen that benefit. Shares are down 11.5% YTD, and off about 17% from late February levels.That sets up a crucial report for VMWare on Thursday afternoon. The cloud shift is a risk to VMWare's core business of ""virtualizing"" on-premise servers.Moreover, VMWare is trying to catch up through acquisitions. However, that's a risky strategy in an environment where corporate IT teams are facing unimaginable workloads. Those teams may take the path of least resistance, which doesn't necessarily suggest choosing VMWare's ""hybrid cloud"" offerings.  * 4 Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains Relative to trailing profits, VMW stock is cheap. But this is a quarter that can set the narrative for the stock going forward. This is a clear ""value trap or value play?"" argument, and Q1 results and commentary could push investors in one of those directions. Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Friday, May 29, before market openCanopy Growth officially confirmed its earnings date on Friday, as fourth-quarter results will be released next Friday.That said, it will close an interesting and important stretch for the cannabis industry. Most notably, last week Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) posted results that were much better than expected. Also, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) posted a decent quarter as well.The industry still is growing, even if share prices across the sector don't necessarily reflect it. That said, though, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ) is down nearly 60% over the past twelve months.If Canopy -- the industry's largest player -- can post a big quarter, broader trends in the sector start looking more positive. And with shares down so far, even after a 90% bounce from March lows, that could suggest room to rally for not jut Canopy stock, but other pot stocks as well.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-05-27,"It seems fitting that as the U.S. prepares to launch astronauts into orbit today for the first time in almost a decade, the stock market has been rocketing higher for weeks.SpaceX is planning to launch two astronauts this afternoon just after the closing bell, weather permitting. SpaceX is privately held, but if the U.S. is back in outer space to stay, that could be good news for companies with a space presence like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC), Barron's pointed out yesterday.Back on the ground, it looks like the countdown is on for a launch from where things left off Tuesday on Wall Street. Major indices and some of the airline and travel stocks are up in pre-market trading. The question is whether the S&P 500 Index (SPX) can register its first 3000 close in nearly three months after just missing that yesterday.Optimism continues to be the word of the day despite some worries about the U.S./China trading relationship and obviously concerns about any potential rebound in virus cases. There's a sense among some market participants that the worst is behind us as people get back to work.At the end of the day, it's important for investors not to get ooled into a sense of complacency. If a trade war gets going, for instance, this isn't a super-strong U.S. economy that can necessarily withstand that kind of body blow the way i mostly did last year. We were a healthier economy at that time. China's economy is more fragile now, too.Investors look ahead to the Fed's Beige Book later today. Earnings to consider watching Wednesday include Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE: RL) and Toll Brothers Inc (NYSE: TOL).Some big retailers including Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) report on Thursday. One thing to consider listening for on calls of companies like COST is whether executives think crisis-related stock-up demand pulled some sales forward, which could potentially detract from results later this year.Chase for 3000 Stalls... The first test of 3000 in almost three months came up a little short yesterday. So today we'll see if the S&P 500 Index (SPX) can get back above that level, where it hung out for most of Tuesday before some late-session selling.Nine of 11 sectors rose yesterday, but Information Technology was a laggard. That sector has been on such a run that a little pause for breath doesn't seem all that worrisome, though it did keep the Nasdaq (COMP) from joining in the gains posted by other major indices.The sagging finish yesterday couldn't really dent what was a pretty amazing start to the new week. A little profit-taking at the end of the session probably won't alarm anyone too much, though the late retreat might also have reflected concerns about China. It would have been technically positive to hold onto those gains above 3000, a level that  lines up pretty closely with key resistance at the 200-day moving average for the SPX (see more below)....But Not for Long People didn't have too long to regret the late slip below 3000. The SPX looks like it's going to start today well above that. The question is whether those gains can hold. Closing above 3000 today and for a few more days would likely help cement those bullish feelings.After the close, investors got two new pieces of what might be welcome news. First came reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had said a new fiscal stimulus would ""probably"" have to be done. That's been a contentious issue for a few weeks, so maybe there's some progress getting to an agreement. Politics aside, it's hard to argue that more money from Washington for businesses and employees would be bad for the stock market. One concern heading into June is whether stimulus will continue after the impact from the $3 trillion legislation passed in March starts to wind down. The other welcome news was more symbolic as Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) announced a partial reopening of its trading floor June 8. On the less sunny side of the street, a report from Bloomberg News that said the Trump administration is weighing sanctions on Chinese firms and officials over the situation in Hong Kong, and that might have helped push stocks off their highs in the final hour of trading yesterday.Still ""Cycling"" Along Cyclical stocks in sectors like Industry and Energy led the charge last week, a pattern that continued Tuesday. Even the flagging Financial sector joined the act, storming ahead as bond yields inched higher and investor optimism soared. View more earnings on RLAs research firm Briefing.com pointed out, optimism around reopening appears to be steepening the yield curve, with longer-dated yields rising more quickly than shorter ones on Tuesday. That's often a positive sign for the economy and for Financial stocks in particular. A slight decline in the U.S. dollar--which nervous investors clung tightly to back in March--also might signal growing hopes for better times ahead.Airline and other travel stocks helped lead the scoring Tuesday, with some of the major airlines including Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE: DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc (NYSE: UAL) soaring double-digits by midday Tuesday.Retail, another beaten-down sector, also saw buyers looking ready to shop. Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) rose nearly 20% at one point before seeing some of those gains melt by end of day. It still gained 10%. Others including Nordstrom, Inc (NYSE: JWN), Kohl's Corporation (NSYE: KSS) and Nike Inc (NKE) all had nice starts to the short week. Not Out of the Woods You could argue it makes sense that people are buying cyclicals on the vaccine optimism. However, it's important not to get carried away, especially when the scientific community warns that a vaccine is months out at best and there hasn't been much progress finding treatments for the symptoms of the virus.What makes some market watchers nervous is that by mid-June when most states are fully open, the economic data will start coming in on how much people are taking advantage of new opportunities to go out and shop or eat. It's unclear if the reality will be able to keep up with the great expectations that we're seeing right now. That means investors could be in for disappointment. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, remember what you heard here last year when stocks were galloping higher and higher: There's no reason to go ""all in."" Some investors let ""FOMO,"" or fear of missing out,"" guide them too much. Any time you put more money into the market, there should be a solid reason for doing so and it should fit into the context of your long-term investment plans.  CHART OF THE DAY: PLAYING CATCHUP: The Financial (IXM--candlestick) and Industrial (IXI--purple line) sectors are both cyclical parts of the market that got hammered harder than the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX--blue line) by Covid-19. Over the last month, both sectors are starting to recover a bit and even catch up to the SPX. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade.For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Data Dive: Few if anyone expects any really rosy numbers these days, so you have to take what you get. In the case of Tuesday's numbers, investors got something a little better than expected even if things still look pretty soft on the economic front. Consumer confidence, an important metric when it comes to figuring out how eager people might be to go out and spend (when they can go out) did indicate some improvement from a month earlier. The headline figure was 86.6 for May, up from 85.7 the last time out. It was still below analysts' expectations, but might indicate a little more consumer optimism as the economy starts reopening.New home sales for April, a backward-looking number, actually came in much higher than Wall Street had expected at a 623,000 annual clip. That could indicate that low mortgage rates are having an impact, and also that people are still making big bets on the economy in these tough times with major purchases. Toll Brothers, one of the largest home-building companies, reports after the close today and could provide more insight into new home buying trends.Crowded Showrooms? If you canceled a trip recently, you're probably in good company. So it wasn't too surprising to see Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NYSE: HTZ) file for bankruptcy last Friday. Other car rental companies, including Avis Budget Group Inc (NASDAQ: CAR), are also struggling, and that's not good news for the major automobile makers, either. During normal times, CNN reported, rental companies account for around 10% of new car purchases. That's not happening now. In fact, cash-hungry rental companies are likely to sell a large portion of the 1.5 million cars they own over the weeks and months to come, according to analysts interviewed by CNN. This means car makers have to compete with more supply coming onto the market even as they try to keep their own new cars from gathering dust at dealers. The upside of all this could be for any consumer out there trying to buy a vehicle. The average new car price had been skyrocketing for years and rose to nearly $39,000 by the end of last year, according to Kelley Blue Book. However, demand for new cars was flagging even before the crisis, and the average price actually fell sequentially in April. Having new supplies augmented by the rental industry would seem to indicate the potential for more price drops in the future, and a rough road getting even rougher for the major automakers. Low-interest rates could conceivably help bring some traffic back to the dealerships, but remember, unemployment is in the double-digits. Next week brings May auto sales from many of the big car companies, offering the latest perspective on how things are moving along.Dog Catches Car. Now What? The big news this week for chart watchers is that the SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) both spent time Tuesday above the psychological 3000 and 25000 levels, respectively. Some technicians also pointed out the significance of the SPX rising above its 200-day moving average intraday for the first time since March 5. While some would say eclipsing the 200-day could put new wind in the market's sails, it looks to others like it could be more of a destination than the start of a new journey. Basically, the SPX had to claw its way back about 800 points to get back to the 200-day, which coincidentally stood right at 3000 heading into the week. That means it's hard to say how much more momentum might remain, and whether there are enough fresh catalysts to bring fresh money from the sidelines.Also, getting ""back to 200,"" so to speak, didn't help the market much during the 2008-2009 downturn, as one analyst pointed out to CNBC. The SPX bounced around that level for about two months then after getting there for the first time. Another analyst said the next resistance zone above 3000 might stand near 3080, which is where the SPX traded in mid-March when the NBA suspended its season.

2020-05-29,"(Friday Market Open) It's often said that markets climb a wall of worry. Well, it feels like there's a lot to worry about this morning, and that's slowing the long rally heading into the weekend.A weaker tone took hold overnight as investors awaited the administration's latest words on China. The talk has been heating up and today we might find out what sort of action--if any--the White House plans to take at President Trump's news conference.Depending on what President Trump announces and any counterpoint China takes, things could get nastier pretty fast in their relationship and scramble an already struggling global economy even more. This nervousness could be reflected in crude being down this morning and people coming in to buy bonds.Compounding the uncertainty, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at 11 a.m. ET today. It's not a formal speech, just what's called a ""conversation"" with a moderator at Princeton University. Still, you never know what Powell might say that's potentially market-moving.In addition, this is the last day of the month, which sometimes means a little profit-taking and possible higher volatility. Cboe Volatility Index futures (/VX) crept above 30 early on. Yesterday saw three-day winning streaks snapped for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) and S&P 500 Index (SPX) and a five-day victory streak ended for the Russell 2000 Index (RUT). Bonds are higher this morning as caution creeps in.Investors are punishing Costco (NASDAQ: COST) this morning despite revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations and a comparable sales rise of almost 8%. One issue might be that competitors like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) had double-digit same-store growth. Also, COST's comparable sales fell in April, and the company had higher expenses as it paid out overtime and implemented safety measures.It looks like COST benefitted from people stocking up during the crisis, so maybe there's some concern that sales got pulled forward and might not be as strong with the economy now reopening on so many fronts. On an interesting note, 4% fewer people visited COST stores but spent an average of 9.3% more per transaction.Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) shares also took a licking in pre-market trading as the company beat earnings forecasts but trimmed their forecast.Can We Hope for a ""Turn-Around Friday?""  That was an ugly close yesterday, no doubt about it. Luckily, there's still a day left this week and month to see if the market can leave a better taste in our mouths heading into the weekend.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) were among those hardest hit late Thursday by the China fears, though they've all generally managed to do pretty well throughout the combined crisis of last year's trade war and this year's pandemic.The other thing that possibly tripped up stocks late yesterday might have been thoughts that the market has just come too far, too fast. It's the end of the month, and sometimes investors and money managers take the opportunity to reassess when they arrive at these kinds of junctures. Also, it's a time when you often see profit-taking. That's why you can't necessarily rule out another ugly close today.A Merry May, at Least for Wall Street  Even if things skid a bit, it's hard to get too disappointed about the way May went. Both the $DJI and SPX managed to consolidate the sharp gains they made in April and move above areas of key technical resistance despite a constant background of horrible data and some rough earnings reports. As of Thursday's close, the SPX had advanced 4% in May and was back above 3000 and above its 200-day moving average for the first time since early March.Some of the sectors that had revived in recent days, like Financials and Industrials, hit the dirt on Thursday as investors headed back into more cautious sectors like Utilities and Staples. That went counter to May's encouraging trend that saw Industrials, Communication Services, Financials, Energy, and Materials all climb double-digits since April 30. When you see these sectors outpacing the ""defensive"" ones like Real Estate and Utilities as well as Information Technology--the market's favorite security blanket the last few years--it can suggest many investors see light at the end of the pandemic tunnel.Whether they're right remains to be seen, and June could be a month that goes a long way toward providing some answers. The pandemic still rules the roost, as anyone who saw the devastating jobless claims yesterday would probably acknowledge. While some jobs appear to be coming back, that's not too evident yet in the numbers. Without jobs returning, sentiment could remain on the mat. That's a terrible situation not only for those without employment but also for consumer demand that drives so much of the corporate earnings picture.After climbing more than 35% combined in April and May from the late-March lows, it wouldn't be too surprising to see a bit of a ""June swoon,"" especially considering that summer is historically a weaker time for the markets. That said, there's still a lot of money on the sidelines, and investors probably don't have many other great choices right now if they're looking for yield. The bond market still shows no real sign of giving up ground in a way that might make yields there more attractive to investors.One Canary Took Wing This Month  Another thing investors probably shouldn't ignore is the amazing May performance of the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-cap stocks. While the RUT took a major blow yesterday, it's up 11% so far this month, way better than the SPX. As we've been noting, small-caps can sometimes be a canary in a coal mine for the economy. If they keep putting on a show like this in June, that could send a positive signal even if larger-caps can't find new traction.This continues to be a headline-driven market, especially with earnings season basically done and so much worry around the virus. Any headline, good or bad, could trip things up or light a fire under the market on any given day, as we saw yesterday with some of the social media stocks like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) getting slammed by word of an executive order from President Trump pertaining to the industry.What faces investors next week? First of all, there's the May jobs report coming up next Friday. Some might say this one isn't as important as the one in early July, which will show more impact from reopenings. Still, any payroll report is bound to get a lot of attention in this stumbling economy, and the challenge could be trying to find anything positive to take home from it. We'll talk more about that in days to come.Next week also brings May auto sales and the ISM manufacturing index for May. The ISM fell to 41.5% for April, the lowest since early 2009. Every key index--including new orders, production, employment, and order backlogs--sank dramatically. With the May report this coming Monday, any improvement might be welcomed as a possible sign of life for the economy. We'll have to wait and see.  CHART OF THE DAY: WHAT NEXT? This three-month chart compares the S&P 500 Index (SPX--candlestick) with its 200-day moving average (blue line) and 50-day moving average (red line). Note the 50-day fell below the 200-day soon after the SPX made its low in late March, but just recently has begun bending a bit back toward the 200-day. It took quite a rally to get the 50-day to move upward, so it will be interesting to see if the two lines can continue to converge and possibly cross over--which would be a bullish sign. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Change of the Guard? The situation arguably looks a little healthier now if you're someone who doesn't like to see too much concentration in one area of the market. Going into the week, about 90% of stocks in the SPX were trading above their 50-day moving averages. As one analyst noted, when you see that happen historically, it's often been a good omen for the year ahead.What seems to be happening is a rotation by some investors out of the Consumer Staples, Technology, and Health Care stocks that put a charge into the rally, and into some areas that got less love recently like Financials and Industrials (at least until yesterday). You could look at this as a rotation out of growth and into ""value,"" to some degree, but it's way too early to call it a trend. Value stocks are typically thought of as well-run and fundamentally sound companies whose shares have been taken down more than they deserve due to overriding issues in their sector or because many investors ran to embrace more ""exciting"" stocks elsewhere.Flying Away: While you never want to see people lose jobs--especially when so many already have--investors seemed to view this week's Boeing (BA) layoffs as good news for the company. No one likely needs to be reminded of how far BA's shares have sunk, so the idea of cost-cutting might have gotten some people excited about the stock. However, this isn't your ""father's BA,"" to use that old phrase. It's likely to be a more slimmed-down company in the future, which raises questions of whether market cap could ever return to the January 2019 highs from before the 737 MAX shutdown.Also, If you're hoping for good news about the airline industry, BA didn't have much optimism to offer this week when it announced those layoffs. Instead, BA's CEO talked about how it could take years for the industry to recover from the pandemic's impact. Speaking of which, despite recent rallies for many of the airline stocks, most aren't incredibly far off their March lows and continued to trail the broader market during this long rally. Anyone thinking of ""bargain-hunting"" by going after a beaten-down airline stock should understand the risk they're taking, especially with those companies in the business that are most highly-leveraged. Some analysts continue to warn that bankruptcies can't be ruled out, and it might be survival of the fittest.Marching in Place: You might want to consider keeping an eye on the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) in the coming days and weeks, as well as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). If either start moving higher, it could be a sign of investor caution gaining ground. VIX managed to stay below 30 most of last week, down from highs above 80 at the peak of the crisis. It's still not back to historical norms of around 20.The $DXY, meanwhile, has been as steady as a rock for almost two months now, rattling around between roughly 98 and 100. If it leaves that range one way or another, it could tell us something about investor thinking. A drop in the dollar might suggest people are more willing to take a chance on less defensive investments and even on markets outside the U.S. It's a higher dollar that would cause some investors to lose sleep.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-05-29,"Warehouse retail chain Costco (COST) has reported mixed earning results with third-fiscal quarter revenue of $37.27B beating consensus expectations by $610M, and marking a 7.3% year-over-year gain. Meanwhile Adj. Comparable sales in the US rose 8% and E-Commerce sales exploded +64.5%.However EPS of $1.89 fell short of a Street figure of $1.92 due to higher expenses of $283M or $0.47 per share, which the company was unable to overcome even with favorability in the fuel business. EPS was negatively impacted incremental wage and sanitation costs related to COVID-19.As a result, shares pulled back 2% in after-hours trading on Thursday.COST also revealed that it is now estimating a 1–2% negative impact from some of its businesses being closed/restricted (notably optical, hearing aids, photo, and eliminated food court offerings) during the quarter.“We expect a gradual profit recovery at COST over time as COVID-19 expense pressures dissipate and stay at home restrictions go away” Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh reassured investors post-print.The analyst added: “We believe longer-term investors should continue to take advantage of a volatile trade.” He has a buy rating on the stock and $335 price target. With shares up 6% year-to-date, this price target indicates upside potential of 8%.According to Parikh, Costco’s long-term prospects continue to look very promising thanks to its unique consumer value proposition coupled with open-ended global growth prospects. That’s on top of a consistent track record of shareholder returns, a strong management team, and prospects for a special dividend, and a “leading competitive position poised to continue to drive share gains.”Overall COST scores a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus from the Street with 12 recent buy ratings and 6 hold ratings. Meanwhile the average analyst price target stands at $331 (7% upside potential).

2020-05-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the coronavirus forced the western world into lockdown in March, humans were confronted with a moral test. Drawing on centuries of philosophical thought that produced the world’s competing modern value systems, each person had to decide which measures were justified to limit the medical and economic carnage. There was plenty of possibility for discord.Initially, people and leaders coalesced around a version of the biblical philosophy of the “golden rule” — that we should not do to others what we wouldn’t want done to ourselves. That was the basis for asking everyone to make personal and economic sacrifices to limit the death and suffering of the weakest and oldest. Governments of the left and the right made that choice, strongly supported by religious leaders up to and including the Pope.At the time, I wrote, “We are all Rawlsians now,” invoking the Harvard philosopher John Rawls who 50 years ago put a version of the golden rule at the heart of his influential theory of justice.I was wrong. Now the brief weeks of Rawlsian unity have given way to a bitter factional and cultural battle, with rival moral principles hurled like metaphysical grenades. Different countries have taken antithetical approaches while the U.S. has split itself almost into two nations, divided between those who wear masks and those who do not.“Quarantine is when you restrict movement of sick people. Tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people,” Meshawn Maddock, an unmasked protester in Michigan proclaimed to Fox News.Masks, which were not at first recommended by the public-health authorities in the U.S., have created the deepest fault line. “Mask-shaming” started as a tactic by government-supporting mask-wearers. Early in the lockdowns, Jorge Elorza, a law professor who serves as the Democratic mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, encouraged people to speak up if they saw someone in public without a face mask. “You should socially shame them, so they fall in line,” he said.Meanwhile in Texas, chat-show host Brenden Dilley donned a Trump 2020 cap and took to Twitter to explain why he was not wearing a mask. “Better to be dead than a dork,” he said, throwing in some F-bombs for emphasis. “Yes, I mean that literally. I’d rather die than look like an idiot right now, you weakling.”It took North Dakota’s Republican governor Doug Burgum to remind citizens tearfully that those wearing masks might be doing so to protect a loved one who was vulnerable.What has gone wrong? What has the virus revealed about the moral principles that motivate us? The story can be told with the aid of an allegory, a novel by Steven Lukes, a British political philosopher who now teaches at New York University, called ""The Curious Enlightenment of Professor Caritat.""Professor Caritat’s JourneyLukes’s allegory is simple but devastatingly effective. Professor Caritat is an expert in enlightenment philosophy in the country of Militaria, which emphasizes order above all else, and sounds like contemporary China. He is imprisoned for his subversive beliefs. Members of the opposition spring him from jail and send him on a trek through the neighboring countries of Utilitaria, Communitaria and Libertaria in search of the best way to run society. Everybody knows that they hate the military government, but what should they replace it with?These countries follow three great schools of moral thought:Utilitarians, following the Victorian reformer Jeremy Bentham, who believe in pursuing the greatest good for the greatest number, even if such an approach may bring harm to some. Communitarians, who believe that the sense of moral duty is rooted in a sense of community, and look for a concept of “common good.” Libertarians, who believe that individual freedom is paramount, and therefore resist attempts at paternalism or coercion. In Lukes’s words, “Each of these countries takes one of these ideas to an extreme to the exclusion of the others, and each one is a dystopia.”In Utilitaria, which is gleaming and prosperous, the elderly are routinely put to a humane death. Abortion is legal but decided on by the government, which rules whether any given birth would aid the general happiness.In Communitaria, everyone is divided into narrow camps, and it is almost impossible to do or say anything without causing offense (which will be punished as a crime).In Libertaria, which calls the contemporary U.S. to mind, citizens are left alone, which means that many are left to sleep on the street, city centers are full of sleaze, and a few rich people benefit from gambling.It is a brilliant tour of moral thought, and Lukes told me the book was most influenced by Isaiah Berlin, the 20th-century British philosopher and essayist. Both Berlin and Rawls were present at the lectures in which Lukes first told the fables of the different countries that would become the novel.“The book is really about pluralism: Is there an irreducible conflict between these values?” Lukes said. “Rawls is an attempt to somehow bring them together to give an overarching theory that somehow encompasses everything. You could contrast that with Berlin’s position that these are irreducible conflicts that aren’t going to be resolved, because that’s what life is. Instead you just have to choose what your ultimate values are.”By the end of Lukes’s allegory, Professor Caritat has come around to the Berlin point of view: The conflicts between these competing moral systems can’t be resolved.And looking at the real-life allegory acting itself out in the U.S., Berlin again seems to have been proven right. We are not arriving at a position of moral coherence, but instead confront moral conflict. How did this happen?Rawlsian PhantomsIt’s evident now that those early days of Rawlsian unity were an illusion. Yes, the calls for sacrifice to protect the elderly certainly sounded as though motivated by the golden rule. But in the months since, the scandal of those abandoned to die in nursing homes on both sides of the Atlantic has only grown.Moreover, getting people to sacrifice in the name of the golden rule requires trust in governments to make sure that those sacrifices are not wasted. In many places, that doesn’t exist. The deepening inequality across the western world would have been anathema to Rawls. In the U.S., long-standing casualties of inequality such as African-Americans and Native Americans turned out to be particularly susceptible to the virus, so the pandemic began to reinforce existing feelings of injustice.Other than in countries where the state could rely on its ability to coerce people, like China, lockdowns worked most effectively under governments perceived to be trustworthy and efficient, like Germany or Norway. In Norway, people believed that enforced self-isolation would pay off. In the U.S., public-health failures blazed a trail of skepticism.When governments are perceived to be unfair or inconsistent, Rawlsian discipline breaks down. Exhibit A is the remarkable story of Dominic Cummings, the Svengali-like political adviser to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Britain has a strong tradition of accepting authority, and the population had complied with a strict lockdown with minimal protest — until it was revealed that Cummings had broken the lockdown rules to drive 260 miles with his wife and child when he thought the family might have contracted Covid-19. It led to an outcry, especially as Johnson refused to dismiss him, claiming that Cummings had been concerned for his family and was entitled to use his discretion (opening the way for many more Britons to stop social distancing), and Cummings refused to apologize.For the many Britons who had gone without funerals or visits to elderly parents, this was a fatal philosophical blow. If Cummings had broken the golden rule, and the government had supported him, there was no reason why they should follow. The ministers defending Cummings were “telling the nation that Dom’s only crime was loving his family too much — and so implicitly telling every Briton who obeyed the rules that they loved their family too little,” the columnist Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian.A final problem for self-sacrifice a la Rawls was that people felt that governments were asking too much, stretching the golden rule too far. Ashley Radcliffe, a stay-at-home mother from the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe Woods put it this way in an interview with the Detroit Free Press:The restrictions are too much. People want to work. They want their lives back. In the first couple weeks I was like, 'We're all staying in.' And we all did. Then that kind of wore off. She has restarted neighborhood play dates for her 5-year-old son. Liberty? Which Kind?Resisting authority is one thing. Fighting for liberty is another. Much depends upon exactly what liberty means, and Isaiah Berlin framed that moral debate. In a famous 1959 essay called ""Two Concepts of Liberty,"" Berlin suggested that libertarians practiced either “positive” liberty, which entails the active freedom to do something, or “negative” liberty, which is freedom from interference. His point was that these two kinds of liberty are different. The U.S. Constitution is rooted in negative liberty, the freedom to be left alone. But the protesters who entered the Michigan capitol in Lansing with assault rifles in April and May were plainly pursuing positive liberty. Berlin, who was born in Latvia in 1909 when it was part of the Russian empire, believed that opened doors to totalitarianism.What, in any case, do the protesters want? A mandatory lockdown clearly violates any definition of liberty, but can this really be said of requiring people to wear a mask when entering a shop? In one incident, a man was caught on video demanding the right to enter a Costco unmasked “because I woke up in a free country.” In Albany, Minnesota, chanting protesters tried to pull the mask off a reporter, asserting their positive liberty to violate his negative liberty. Various people have been caught on camera deliberately coughing or spitting on people asking them to put on a mask.Libertarians often face criticism that they are justifying selfishness, and disregard for others. Such incidents confirm the stereotype and embarrass many libertarians. Resistance against incursions by an untrustworthy state does not justify violence against people who wear masks, or even going maskless in public. As Lukes put it: “You are putting other people in danger and you are putting yourself in danger. If liberty just means no restraint on something we might want to do, there are obvious deprivations of liberty that are totally justified. Like driving drunk.”Positive liberty also violates many American conservatives’ respect for their community and its norms, even if they share an instinctive distrust of over-reaching governments. Gary Adkisson, publisher of the Bismarck Tribune in North Dakota, wrote of how he would arrive dirty from work in the fields at a store with a “No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service” sign: There were rarely any other shoppers there, but my grandfather or uncles would not let us go inside shirtless or shoeless. It didn’t matter that no one else was there, or that the shirts were no cleaner than our skin, or that we would take them off as soon as we left. We wore them because that’s what the proprietor required. It was a matter of respect.Opposition to lockdowns and masks is led by libertarians, but — much as Berlin might have predicted — self-isolation also runs afoul of communitarian and utilitarian ideals. Communitarians, on the right as well as the left, sense that lockdowns violate traditions and harm the community. Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas, was articulating a communitarian spirit when he said on a Sunday talk show: “We take the virus very seriously. It’s a risk. It causes death. But you can’t cloister yourself at home. That is just contrary to the American spirit.”And of course there is the powerful utilitarian argument that lockdowns are wrecking the economy. That can be attacked as preferring profit to people, but record unemployment numbers suggest a real risk of a mental health crisis that could counterbalance the public-health benefits of reducing the Covid-19 death toll. In Italy, where the disease swamped hospitals for a time, doctors resorted to utilitarian rationing of care.None of the great schools of philosophy appears to have been deemed adequate on its own for the great test posed by the pandemic. Principles and TribesIf no version of moral philosophy has triumphed, what ideas are left standing? Is rhetorical allegiance to principles, such as the golden rule, liberty or the “American way,” just a cover for tribalism? As the virus has so far hit the geographical regions where one tribe of Americans lives, while mostly sparing the other, principles tend to rationalize behavior instead of guiding it. For people in the densely populated cities of the Acela corridor, who tend to be politically liberal, wearing masks and following government instructions seems like a good idea. For the more sparsely populated states in the middle of the country, whose citizens are philosophically more inclined to distrust the government, it is different.“People can vote or take political positions for a whole variety of motives,” said Lukes. “But nevertheless, when it comes to justifying their ideas they reach out for principles. Whether those principles are truly important to them is different.”And that is what has happened. Governments, with some exceptions, couldn’t persuade their people that they were really following the golden rule and treating everyone with equal respect. They also failed to prove that it was worth doing so. Protesters lost their patience, and misused the notion of liberty as a cudgel against lockdowns, while also bringing valid utilitarian, communitarian and libertarian criticisms into the fray. All may claim to be motivated by principle. But in the U.S., at least, people seem to be taking refuge in tribes, and joining those with whom they already share grievances.At this point, it looks as though Isaiah Berlin has been proven right.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.John Authers is a senior editor for markets.

2020-06-04,"Costco Wholesale (COST) has reported impressive sales for the retail month of May. Comparable sales rose 9.7% (excluding the impacts from change in gasoline prices and foreign exchange), easily beating the consensus estimate of 4.5%.Specifically, the company reported $12.55 billion in net sales for the four weeks ended May 31, 2020 versus $11.67 billion last year.For the thirty-nine weeks ended May 31, 2020, the company reported net sales of $120.19 billion, an increase of 7.7% from the $111.56 billion made during the similar period last year.Notably, comparable e-commerce sales shot up by 108.1% over the four weeks, and 38.1% over the last 38 weeks. Meanwhile, the US recorded a 9.2% sales jump for May, with Canada at 4.9% and ‘Other International’ at 17.9%.RBC Capital analyst Scot Ciccarelli was pleased by the results, writing: “In addition to what we view as relatively solid comp results, the company’s e-commerce efforts continue to bear fruit, as sales in the channel more than doubled during May… likely due to more online grocery shopping amid Covid-19 fears.”He believes that Costco continues to be one of the best positioned among his coverage to overcome the current crisis due to their heavy food/consumable offerings and ‘investment in value.’“With what we view as a huge competitive advantage (buying better and working on a lower mark-up than almost any other company) and attractive defensive characteristics in a weakening economic environment, we remain buyers of COST shares” the analyst concludes. Ciccarelli’s COST buy rating comes with a $348 price target (13% upside potential).Overall, analysts have a cautiously optimistic take on Costco with a Moderate Buy consensus made up of 13 recent buy ratings and 7 holds. The average analyst price target stands at $332 (8% upside potential). Shares are currently trading up 4% year-to-date.

2020-06-05,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett says “nothing can stop America.” To put his money where his mouth is and spend some of his $137 billion stash before this crisis is over, he wouldn’t have to look far. If there’s one company that warrants the dealmaker’s attention, it may be Costco Wholesale Corp., a retailer in which Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. already owns a stake. At Berkshire’s virtual shareholder meeting last month, Buffett signaled that the Covid-19 pandemic hasn’t afforded him deal opportunities at bargain-basement prices the way past economic meltdowns have. Despite the nationwide shutdowns that are just starting to lift and a soaring unemployment rate, the S&P 500 Index is only 8% off its February all-time high. That’s partly due to aggressive actions taken by the Federal Reserve to mitigate the crisis, though one can’t deny that there exists an astonishing disconnect between stock prices and the economic realities of many Americans right now.Costco wouldn’t be a typical crisis-era bet for Buffett in this regard. The shares are up, not down, this year and its operations have carried on throughout the pandemic. Zoom, Netflix, TikTok, Costco — the retailer is right up there with those services that have become centerpieces of the stay-at-home recession.But in so many other ways a Costco deal would still be classic Buffett. For starters, Buffett already likes Costco. Berkshire has owned the stock for two decades; its 1% stake is valued at about $1.3 billion currently. Buffett’s business partner Charlie Munger, the 96-year-old vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, also sits on Costco’s board. Last year, Buffett even publicly marveled at Costco’s in-house Kirkland brand, which at that point had $39 billion of annual sales. “Here’s somebody like Costco, establishes a brand called Kirkland and it’s doing $39 billion — more than virtually any food company,” including Kraft Heinz Co., he said. Berkshire is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder.Costco has proven during this crisis that it has a durable brand and a wide competitive moat, two of the key attributes Buffett looks for. More than 90% of Costco’s U.S. club members renew, and globally the rate is nearly as high at 88%. Those warehouse memberships are a predictable source of cash flow, almost akin to Berkshire’s insurance float that Buffett uses to invest. While the majority of Costco’s 787 warehouse clubs are in the U.S. and Canada, it does have locations in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia. It’s also expanding in China, offering Buffett exposure to the country’s growing middle class.Costco’s same-store sales have risen 6.5% on average for the last 10 quarters, topping other U.S. mass retailers including Walmart Inc., the parent of Sam’s Club. Costco also generated more than $1,300 of sales per square foot in fiscal 2019 — more than any of its peers.The share price has gotten a bump from all the panic-shopping, and at 34 times earnings, Costco’s valuation certainly isn’t what Buffett would call cheap. But Costco should continue to fare well in a post-virus America, especially if it leads some residents to ditch cities for suburbs and spend more time at home. After the meat and toilet paper shortages, more shoppers may even turn to bulk-buying to be better prepared for future lockdowns or shortages.The biggest hurdle to a takeover is that Costco’s market value is $137 billion — precisely the amount of cash Berkshire has available. Berkshire’s last major acquisition was Precision Castparts, a maker of airplane engine parts, for $37 billion in 2016. After years spent searching for his next target, Buffett signaled recently that his hunt is on hold, suggesting that he thinks the crisis could still get worse before it gets better. “The cash position isn’t that huge when I look at the worst-case possibilities,” he told a stunned audience last month that tuned into the livestreamed annual meeting expecting to hear something a little more upbeat or at least hopeful from the Oracle of Omaha.(1)Berkshire could simply increase its stake in Costco, a stable holding that pays a 70-cent quarterly dividend. But it wasn’t all that long ago that Buffett spoke of the possibility of an acquisition Costco’s size. “If a $100 billion deal came along that Charlie [Munger] and I really liked, we’d get it done,” he said in May 2018. With Buffett set to turn 90 in August, it would be uncharacteristic to not want to do one last splashy transaction.It also wouldn’t be the first time Berkshire acquired one of its stock holdings. Berkshire owned shares in Precision Castparts before that deal. It also took a stake in the BNSF railroad in 2007 and kept adding to that position until it eventually purchased the whole company. Berkshire’s ownership of Geico even dates back to the 1950s when Buffett first bought shares and as a curious young investor began a serendipitous friendship with the insurer’s former CEO, Lorimer Davidson, as Buffett often retells it.Whether as a takeover candidate or stock pick, Buffett’s best option may be right under his nose. (1) One well-known shareholder, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, even exited its Berkshire position, deciding itcan find worthwhile investing opportunities faster than Berkshire can at this rate.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-06-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s a long-running joke among my team’s deals writers and editors that in the corporate world, all roads eventually lead to mergers. Whatever is happening on the outside or on Wall Street — economic downturns, upturns, elections, currency fluctuations, CEO departures, CEO arrivals, good earnings, bad earnings, you name it — the case can somehow always be made, almost comically, that it’s an impetus for more corporate tie-ups. Warren Buffett would say that’s thanks to all the fee-hungry bankers playing to CEOs’ vain propensity for empire-building. Others say it’s the animal spirits at work.Whatever the case, the global pandemic is giving businesses plenty of reasons to get back to dealmaking. Yes, even social distancing may draw some companies closer together. How they do it will just require a bit more ingenuity in a post-handshake, post-Covid-19 world.As drugmakers race to develop vaccines and treatments for the virus, the pharmaceutical industry is an obvious place to expect renewed M&A activity. Already, drug giant AstraZeneca Plc has made a preliminary takeover approach to Gilead Sciences Inc., Bloomberg News reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. That’s a potential $100 billion transaction. Executives from Johnson & Johnson also said in April that one of their top priorities is finding M&A that enhances its pipeline, citing the drugmaker’s financial strength. The company has $18 billion of cash and equivalents, and Ebitda exceeds debt.It was the pharma industry that kicked off the global megamerger wave last time around, in early 2014, as companies including AstraZeneca participated in a game of merger musical chairs. Soon enough, just about every industry had joined the deal frenzy, which lasted until earlier this year. It might have kept going had the virus not arrived.M&A globally is down 50% this year after the coronavirus quite literally brought the economy to a halt. But stay-at-home orders have been lifting across Asia, Europe and the U.S. And now that New York City — the unofficial headquarters of the M&A market — is beginning to reopen, deals that were in the works previously may pick up where they left off. Those are “low-hanging fruit” for bankers to try to get done, said Eric Becker, who manages the AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF at Water Island Capital, a firm with $2.5 billion under management. “Those were situations where they were still able to hit the golf course and have the handshakes and look at each other face to face.”The M&A handshake may be over, but tech-savvy companies are already embracing the deal-by-video-chat method. Verizon Communications Inc. acquired videoconferencing business BlueJeans Networks for about $400 million in April, and though those talks began last year, the deal had to be finalized over BlueJeans video calls. Intel Corp. also bought Moovit Inc., an Israeli public-transit mapping startup, for $900 million last month. Moovit’s CEO told one publication that the deal came together over Zoom video calls.Not only could more companies use videoconferencing tools to do M&A, other tech-affiliated companies could copy Verizon by acquiring a service like BlueJeans to round out their business software offerings. That’s if working from home is going to be more common even after Covid-19 gets under control. And for deals in which physical assets and property are key, investors have cited the prospect of drones being used to conduct due diligence and avoid unnecessary travel and virus risks. Whether that’s a practical solution remains to be seen. Companies that announced deals just before the virus struck may experience buyer’s remorse. Tiffany & Co.’s acquirer, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, is reportedly looking to pay a lower price than the $16.2 billion it offered in November, but Tiffany, of course, doesn’t want to renegotiate the terms. The spread between Tiffany’s share price and LVMH’s bid is wide at 10%, signaling investor apprehension that the deal will collapse.But then there are deals that make all the more sense because of the crisis. Uber Technologies Inc. is trying to acquire Grubhub Inc. to consolidate the market for food-delivery services as demand surges. Even as restaurants reopen, diners in heavily populated areas may still be reluctant to eat out. Becker also cited an ongoing trend of regional bank acquisitions, as smaller banks require better online capabilities and larger banks seek a deeper community presence.Vulnerable companies may already be bracing for activist shareholder interventions and unsolicited bids. The law firm K&L Gates LLP said that between March and mid-April more than two dozen U.S. public companies adopted so-called poison pills — more than the total number of S&P 500 companies that had these types of takeover protections in place last year. Private equity firms are also likely to be gearing up for buyouts. Such campaigns run the risk of igniting political and public scrutiny in a year marked by soaring unemployment and social activism over inequality. Other opportunistic buyers may soon come out of the woodwork. Amazon.com Inc., which isn’t a frequent borrower, aroused suspicion when it issued $10 billion of debt in recent weeks. Oracle Corp. also raised $20 billion. “When you start seeing some of these deep-pocketed buyers doing these large debt deals, it makes me think there's pent-up demand for M&A,” Becker said. One caveat: Regulators are ostensibly taking a tougher stance against potentially anti-competitive takeovers by tech giants. Even so, companies that see President Donald Trump losing the November election may want to act before less-merger-friendly Democrats take charge.There’s also the question of what Warren Buffett will do with Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $137 billion of cash. I suggested last week that Costco Wholesale Corp. should be its next bulk purchase. Wherever the crisis goes from here, all roads still lead to deals. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

With that said though, Best Buy stock has performed well.Source: BobNoah / Shutterstock.com Shares are still up 61% from the March lows, and that includes its 5.5% decline on June 11. That came as the rest of the market was hammered as well.Best Buy shares have found a way to climb despite this state of limbo. On the one hand, it's not benefiting from a flood of demand from the novel coronavirus the way many grocers are. By the same token though, it's also not one that's being completely shut out either.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Is Best Buy Doing During Coronavirus?Retail is a very difficult sector to trust, as it depends on so many different factors. On the one hand, public sentiment and consumer confidence is key. That is, sentiment being positive enough to go out amid Covid-19 and confidence being high enough to justify spending money.On the other hand, retail also has to balance state and local regulations, as many counties and states imposed various lockdown and stay-at-home orders.Best Buy isn't like Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Kroger (NYSE:KR), Target (NYSE:TGT) and a handful of others. It's also not as vulnerable as companies like Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) or Macy's (NYSE:M).Instead, Best Buy can benefit from several key trends performing well due to the coronavirus outbreak. The three main trends that come to mind include: e-commerce, work from home and gaming.E-commerce sales are exploding. All you have to do is look at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) to know that to be the case. If that doesn't work for you, ask your local mail carrier how the parcel load has been lately. Online sales are surging, juicing a secular trend that's been play for years.Work from home is another obvious trend during the coronavirus outbreak. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already announced indefinite work-from-home policies, while many others in tech and corporate are taking this avenue. That has driven up demand for accessories, monitors and office equipment.  * 7 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy and Hold Now Finally, gaming is on a tear. The industry recorded its best sales for the month of March in 12 years. April set a new record. While Best Buy won't capture all of the gaming dollars that consumers are doling out, it will catch enough that it will benefit the company's revenue results. Valuing Best Buy Stock  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comWhile Best Buy's stock is benefiting from these trends, that's not to say it's thriving necessarily. It has plenty of competition and has had to work its way through various lockdown obstacles.When the company reported earnings a few weeks ago, it beat on earnings and revenue expectations. However, sales of $8.56 billion fell more than 6% year-over-year. Still, given the impact that many are seeing, I'll take that if I'm an investor.Domestic online comp-store sales ripped higher by 155%, showing off Best Buy's e-commerce push, while management had this to say about the results: &quot;In the middle of Q1, we shifted all our stores to a curbside-only operating model and were able to retain approximately 81% of last year's sales2 during the last six weeks of the quarter, even though not a single customer set foot in our stores.&quot;That was the company's first quarter of its fiscal year and look how well it did. Consensus estimates call for sales to slip just 3.3% this year, although that may be overly cautious given the rapid reopening we're seeing in the U.S. That said, the earnings front calls for a bigger hit, as analysts look for a drop of 16% this year.Best Buy stock trades at a reasonable 15 times earnings and pays out a dividend yield of 2.7%. Does it pack the biggest growth punch out there or the most yield? No. But it has solid growth and is a retailer that will do well with or without the coronavirus outbreak taking place.

2020-06-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Covid-19-related lockdowns have ushered in plenty of consumer behaviors that I don’t expect to last, including cutting one’s own hair and baking enough homemade bread to spark a run on yeast. But there’s at least one spending shift brought on by the pandemic that is bound to be quite sticky: buying groceries online. Many shoppers tried this format for the first time in the past several months, and there’s good reason to believe they won’t give it up. It’s a dynamic that will further strengthen retail heavyweights Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp., while putting more pressure on traditional grocery chains.Nearly half of respondents in a survey by Coresight Research reported trying online grocery shopping for the first time or increasing their use of it because of the novel coronavirus. Importantly, the study was conducted March 17-18, when state and local stay-home mandates were just starting to take effect. It stands to reason, then, that even more consumers may have been pushed in this direction later. I’ve always thought it was revealing that Walmart and Target have long said their curbside pickup services have unusually high net promoter scores, a commonly used industry metric that is a proxy for customer satisfaction. In other words, once people try these services, they tend to really like them. The hard part is getting them to take the initial plunge. The pandemic just provided shoppers a forceful reason to do just that. Target, for example, has said that 2 million people used its drive-up service for the first time in the first quarter.(1) Sales to the retailer fulfilled by its grocery-centric same-day delivery service, Shipt, were up more than 300% in the quarter from a year earlier. U.S. shoppers have tended to eschew online grocery shopping because they want to squeeze their peaches and nab that just-perfectly-sized steak. But this unusual moment will make some of them realize just how much of their typical grocery haul is comprised of replenishment-type items that are, in fact, easy to hand off to someone else. After all, a box of Cheez-Its or a pint of Ben & Jerry’s tastes the same no matter who selects them. Also, retailers and services such as Instacart have fine-tuned their app experiences so it’s generally very easy to reorder favorite items after you’ve done it once. These factors, I expect, will drive a sharp increase in e-commerce penetration of a corner of retail that has remained relatively insulated from digital change. Walmart and Target, two retailers that already have shown themselves to be holding up well amid the pandemic, stand to benefit from this shift. Both long ago realized that online grocery was going to be key to avoiding further wounds from Amazon.com Inc. and invested accordingly. Walmart has hired tens of thousands of workers who focus on filling these orders; Target acquired Shipt to help it gain and protect grocery market share. If both these chains can also convince customers to add higher-margin items such as apparel and home goods to these orders, that could help make them more lucrative. Costco, which recorded booming online grocery sales in the latest quarter, also showed potential to emerge from the lockdown phase with a large group of digital converts.   When Kroger Co. reports earnings later this week, we’ll see to what extent the supermarket giant’s online business got a boost from shoppers under stay-at-home orders. The cornerstone of Kroger’s e-commerce strategy — a partnership with Britain’s Ocado Group Plc that will bring that company’s technology to the U.S. — is one that, by design, won’t bear fruit for a long time. That doesn’t leave me particularly confident in the company’s positioning for winning digital dollars right now.It’s unclear what a stronger uptake of online grocery shopping means for Amazon. Bloomberg Opinion has frequently noted that Amazon’s strategy around the grocery business seems as ill-defined as the day exactly three years ago that it plunked down $13.7 billion for Whole Foods Market. According to the Coresight survey, far more consumers have bought groceries recently with Amazon than with any other retailer, an encouraging sign for the Seattle shopping juggernaut. The problem is, its base of shoppers is not growing much, even as some of its competitors see huge gains on that measure. The real losers from the swing toward digital grocery shopping are likely to be the regional grocery chains such as Ingles Markets Inc. or Publix that have already suffered in recent years as customers have shifted their grocery dollars away from supermarkets to warehouse clubs, discounters such as Aldi or even Dollar General Corp. Smaller, traditional grocers simply don’t have the massive capital-expenditures budgets and talent pool of their larger competitors that could help them hold their own in the digital realm.   In this way, the rise of online grocery shopping will help strengthen the retailers already in the winner’s circle and may accelerate the demise of others.(1) Curbside pickup is available at Target for non-grocery purchases, too, so not all of these new customers necessarily bought food.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In August 2018, according to the seasonally adjusted reckonings of the Census Bureau, sales at the nation’s restaurants, bars and other food-and-drink establishments outpaced sales at food and beverage stores for the very first time. This happened eight more times in 2019. In January and February of this year, it looked as if dining and drinking out had surpassed buying food and drink to eat at home once and for all.Then came the coronavirus, temporary and permanent restaurant closures and a lot of supermarket, superstore and online binge-buying. Since March, Americans have spent twice as much money at food and beverage stores as at food service and drinking places, and that underrepresents the disparity because lots of food and drink purchases made at Costco, Walmart and online are reported under other categories.The gap did begin to close in May, as is apparent in the above chart, but I imagine it will be a while before spending on dining out again surpasses spending on dining in. I also imagine though, that the former will eventually surpass the latter again, and that the gap will then grow and grow in the decades to come. One of the main sources of my belief is this chart:Clearly, dining out supplanting eating at home is a trend that has been in place for a really long time. This time the food and drink purchased for off-premises consumption does include all those online and Costco purchases. The dining-out spending includes accommodations, which was about 16% of the total as of 2018 — I use the combined number in the chart because the food-and-drink-only data isn’t available yet for 2019. A U.S. Department of Agriculture series that includes spending by governments and businesses as well as households shows spending on food and alcohol away from home to have surpassed spending on food and alcohol consumed at home in 2013, and been about 2% higher in 2019.Something big seems to have shifted about how we get our food and where we eat it. Part of the change is, to be sure, about prices: Food consumed at home has gotten cheaper, relatively speaking, than food consumed away from home.Still, Americans have in fact been buying more food from restaurants, not just paying more for it. The food-away-from-home share of total average daily energy intake rose from 17% in 1977-78 to 34% in 2011-12, according to USDA surveys. Fast-food restaurants were responsible for most of this rise, indicating that convenience is a big driver in the shift toward food away from home. But in recent years there’s also been a boom in high-end dining as affluent consumers look to buy experiences rather than things.Fast-food sales are already bouncing back from the coronavirus, with McDonald’s announcing this week that U.S. same-store sales were down just 5.1% in May compared with May 2019, after a 19% decline in April. Full-service restaurants, on the other hand, will continue to struggle until either we defeat the virus or it defeats us (in the sense that efforts to control it are abandoned, not that it kills us all). At the high end, this was a risky, low-margin business even in the best of times. Many restaurants have already closed permanently in the wake of virus-induced shutdowns, and restocking their ranks could take years. Much about the business may need to be reimagined and reinvented in the process.Demand for what restaurants offer, though, is surely not going away. Yes, if working from home becomes more prevalent, as seems likely post-pandemic, the lunch business could take a permanent hit. And if working from home encourages lots more people to work from places less expensive than New York and San Francisco, that could cut demand for restaurant dining in such cities. But those who work remotely have a tendency to settle not in the middle of nowhere but in smaller cities with attractive physical surroundings and lots of restaurants and bars and brewpubs. Bloomberg Businessweek deputy editor Howard Chua-Eoan has a lovely reminiscence in this week’s edition about what he misses about restaurants and how he has coped in their absence. It’s clear that he will be back at these “sanctuaries of joy,” as he calls them, as soon as he is allowed. Millions of other people will be too.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

Still, there’s much that can be gleaned from it about Buffett’s frame of mind as the nation enters month five of a pandemic that’s otherwise kept the famed investor on the sidelines. This is Berkshire’s biggest acquisition since 2015, yet it’s small by Berkshire standards — a relatively low-risk deal in the midst of a recession that’s set to change the outlook for some industries for good. Even though Buffett recently signaled little appetite to make any big bets so long as the end of Covid-19 remains entirely unknown, energy is one area where he’s been poised to make smaller, opportunistic purchases. During Berkshire’s unusually somber shareholder meeting in May, he cited the energy division, along with the BNSF railroad and insurance unit, as parts of his conglomerate that were less affected by the virus. “These businesses will produce cash even though their earnings decline somewhat,” he said. In his annual letter in February, the billionaire wrote of wanting to invest more of the energy unit’s retained earnings to take on large utility projects. The Dominion deal hands Berkshire more than 7,700 miles of gas pipelines and 900 billion cubic feet of gas storage. And it comes as Dominion and Duke Energy Corp. pull out of plans for a controversial pipeline project along the U.S. East Coast; other projects like it have been scrapped as well, and pipeline stocks have taken a beating. That confluence of factors created a rare chance in this environment for Buffett to get a deal at a price he likes in an industry he’s comfortable with — and at a time when he and seemingly everyone else is scared to do much else. It also happens to be an industry that Buffett’s successor-in-waiting, Greg Abel, knows well as the current head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.What stood out as noteworthy in Berkshire’s deal announcement was that the first quote was from Buffett, not Abel. This says that Buffett, even as he is set to turn 90 years old next month, is still calling the shots and wants that known. It’s also a reminder that Berkshire’s history of striking sweetheart deals with favorable terms is very much because of Buffett’s celebrity and acclaim — there’s something to be said for selling your company to the Warren Buffett. That leaves the question: Will Abel be awarded the same preferential M&A treatment when Buffett’s gone? If not, what’s he to do with Berkshire’s more than $100 billion of cash that not even Buffett has been able to spend?With 2020 now marked by economic shutdowns, virus fears and a host of canceled trips, weddings and graduations, it hasn’t been a good year for anyone, not even the world’s sixth-richest man (he was fourth-richest before the crisis). Ideally, Buffett would be making a splash with one more giant deal right about now, and something more fascinating to the average investor than a bunch of underground pipes at that. (Costco Wholesale Corp. is one such example I speculated on recently.)Buffett may not seem much older than he did a year ago — he’s certainly just as sharp — but turning 90 is symbolic as a final chapter for the Oracle. He won’t want the last footnote of his legacy to be an unmemorable purchase of gas assets, even if it is a fine transaction. Then again, Covid-19 isn’t leaving him much choice. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-07-09,"There's not much direction on Wall Street this morning despite a slight downturn in weekly jobless claims. The market continues to sputter along ahead of earnings season, and might simply keep bobbing up and down on news of the day until earnings come along to provide more of an anchor. Weekly jobless claims of 1.314 million probably won't be enough to move the needle too much. That number was slightly below analysts' average estimate and down from a revised 1.43 million a week ago, which is definitely going in the right direction. However, the drop wasn't too dramatic. Anything above one million a week was basically uncharted territory before this year.With yesterday's gains, the market's risen six of the last seven sessions, and the Nasdaq (COMP) logged its 25th record close of the year. Not too shabby, especially when you consider the gains come along with daily jumps in virus cases across the country to all-time highs. This divergence is nothing new, and neither is asking if it can last. The answer? No one knows, because the virus is so out of anyone's experience following the market.We have an earnings sighting this morning. Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) component Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NYSE: WBA) reported a quarterly loss as prescription-filling lost ground. Shares dropped more than 3% in pre-market trading. Earnings per share came up short of analysts' expectations while revenue was slightly above. The Wall Street Journal noted today that the pandemic has been challenging for drugstores, with patients putting off visits to doctors and other health providers. This also could be a challenge for big pharma and medical device companies, and might be reflected in Q2 earnings across that sector.While drugstores struggled to get traffic, grocery stores continue to pack the aisles. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) reported an 11% rise in June sales, with same-store sales up more than 14%. E-commerce results went through the roof. The COST numbers looked great. You'd expect same-store sales to be up from a year ago, but that's pretty amazing and it's a good story.The dollar has been on the decline lately, a notable exception to action in other so-called &quot;safe haven&quot; investments like gold and bonds, which keep moving higher. Weakness in the dollar might reflect overseas investors shying away at a time when the U.S. appears to be leading the world in a category no one wants to lead: New cases of COVID-19.What a Wednesday! Retailers, Cruise Lines Revive &quot;Buy the dip&quot; shows no sign of going anywhere. At least that's how it looked Wednesday, when major indices bounced back very impressively from Tuesday's sharp descent and lackluster trading in the pre-opening hours. Even the travel and retail sectors got a lift, with cruise lines showing signs of life and retailer Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) jumping 9% after receiving an analyst upgrade. The retail sector has had more than its share of problems due to COVID-19, as anyone watching this market could probably tell you. Still, there are some companies that seem to be situated a little better than others, and KSS might have advantages because its stores generally aren't located in struggling shopping malls. Also, the firm making the upgrade cited what it said was a healthy balance sheet for KSS and more than 90% of its stores being open.It's important to remember that the retail sector, more than most, represents dozens of different stories. It's far too complex to think of as one monolith responding to a single set of fundamentals. There's going to be a drumbeat of retailers filing for Chapter 11 over the coming months, but within a slew of losers there are going to be some winners. Veteran investors typically look closely at individual balance sheets in this space for a sense of who's well situated and who's not. One thing interesting about the action yesterday was that only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors actually recorded gains, led by Info Tech (what else is new?) and Consumer Discretionary. Still, no sector really fell out of bed except Materials, which dropped nearly 1.5% despite copper hitting five-month highs on what analysts said was optimism about Chinese demand. Dow, Inc. (NYSE: DOW) was a laggard in that sector, and its 3% decline helped keep the $DJI from posting bigger gains. We've said again and again that the market remains extremely headline-driven and could stay that way into earnings season. On Wednesday, the key headline appeared to come from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard telling CNBC that he's optimistic on a recovery. U.S. unemployment will likely decline to below 8% or &quot;maybe even 7%&quot; by the end of the year, Bullard said, according to a Reuters report.It's apples vs. oranges from the Fed lately, because earlier this week comments from another Fed official sounded pessimistic and helped push stocks lower. Another Fed speaker, Raphael Bostic, is scheduled to speak at midday. Investors lately seem to be grabbing onto optimism wherever they can find it, which helps explain how we've come back more than 40% from the March lows. More help came yesterday from the &quot;mega-caps&quot; as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) kept chugging along.Watching the RUT for Clues The gains aren't spread evenly since March, but over the last month things have been pretty neck-and-neck between the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT), both of which are up about 5% since then. That's a good sign for anyone bullish, because a healthy RUT is often associated with broader market gains--especially for domestic stocks, which dominate the RUT. Back in May, the RUT led the SPX for a while at a time when so-called &quot;value stocks&quot; began to get some love from the Street. That phase didn't last too long as investors embraced cyclicals over value through most of late June. If value stocks are coming back--and the 1% gains in the beleaguered Financial sector Wednesday were a promising sign--that might be what it takes for the major indices to take another stab at their post-crisis highs above 3200. Still, one day isn't a trend. Financials remain beaten down pretty badly as they approach key bank earnings next week, and analysts anticipate a pretty abysmal Q2 reporting period for the sector. Investors should consider watching which parts of the market lead over the next few days. If Financials and small-caps continue getting a bid, maybe that's the sign of another sector shuffle taking place.CHART OF THE DAY: MOVING &quot;RUT&quot; ALONG: Though the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RUT--purple line) has lost a bit of ground to the S&P 500 Index (SPX--candlestick) over the last week or so, it's mostly been keeping pace pretty well with the larger caps in the SPX. Yesterday saw the RUT post slightly better gains than the SPX, harkening back to late May when a rally in the RUT helped key a wider rally in &quot;value&quot; stocks. We'll have to wait and see if this continues. Data Sources: FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Technically Speaking ... From a technical perspective, yesterday's action in the SPX looked pretty constructive. The SPX made its lows relatively early on, testing an area of technical support some analysts had pegged near 3130 and bouncing right back. The close well above 3150 put the SPX back on what in normal times might be a positive track.However, trading has been pretty thin lately, so you can't necessarily depend on technical indicators to provide too much direction. Basically, we've been in a relatively tight trading range between 3000 and 3150 over most of the last month, and at least up until now there hasn't really seemed to be much buying interest above that or selling interest below it. So we might stay parked here for a bit unless there's a major new catalyst. But remember: Next week, banks are set to kick off what will be a barrage of earnings releases over the next few weeks. With expectations already discounted substantially, anything positive could lead to a renewed test of the highs for SPX. But if executives were to, for example, paint a less rosy picture than what's baked in, we could certainly retest recent lows.Still in Dry Dock: By now, it's no secret that the ship has left port on that little bounce for cruise line stocks back about a month ago. Continued delays in getting back out on the high seas put the kibosh on many investors' hopes, though cruise lines remained net-buys among retail investors tracked by the June TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM). The problems for cruise lines go well beyond just getting ships in the water. These companies have to burn a lot of cash to maintain their boats, and now there's a special task force on cleanliness. Beyond that, everyone is likely to be ultra-conservative because they don't want someone to get sick on board and file a lawsuit. This industry really needs a piece of good news, and it's hard to see where it might come from in the short-term. It may take a couple weeks of cases going down around the country to get people optimistic again about getting back onboard this particular sector.Back in the Game: One thing the market seemed to draw some enthusiasm from early this week was legendary investor Warren Buffett's first deal since the pandemic. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE: D) agreed to sell its natural gas assets to Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) for $4 billion in cash.Buffett, as most investors probably know, has a big stash of cash that hasn't exactly been burning a hole in his pocket lately. When Buffett doesn't buy, it can cause concern about his confidence level, which is closely tracked since he's the &quot;Oracle of Omaha.&quot; This deal might have helped ease some minds. Sometimes when the market sees Buffett's hand going to his wallet, a tight M&A picture can loosen up a bit.Good Trading,  JJ  @TDAJJKinahanTD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-07-09,"Costco's (COST) comparable sales rose 11.5% in June fueled by e-commerce revenue growth.Analysts had estimated an advance of about 4.2% in comparable sales for the five weeks ended July 5. E-commerce sales were up almost 86% during the reported period. On a geographical breakdown comparable sales advanced 11% in the U.S., 8.4% in Canada, and 18% in other global markets.In the 44 weeks ended July 5, the food retail chain reported net sales of $136.37 billion, an increase of 8.1% year-on-year. Costco had in recent months suffered from a sales drop as stay-at-home orders and social distancing restrictions have led to a traffic decline at its warehouses, while e-commerce revenue didn’t offset the trend during the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.Shares gained 1.4% to $320.65 in Thursday’s pre-market trading. The stock is currently up 7.6% year-to-date.Following the sales data, five-star analyst Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer ramped up the stock’s price target to $355 (12% upside potential) from $335 and maintained a Buy rating, saying that shares have lagged since the March market lows, but that he sees the potential for a catch up trade from here.“We are lifting our forecasts and reiterate our top pick status to reflect the stronger than expected June results,” Parikh wrote in a note to investors. “A special dividend is also increasingly likely in 2021 following the recent debt issuance.”The analyst views Costco as both an attractive shorter-term beneficiary of money flows related to coronavirus fears and a longer-term winner, which should help drive continued outperformance.Meanwhile, the rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 8 Buy ratings versus 6 Hold ratings. The $326.64 average price target implies shares are slated to advance a modest 3.3% in the coming 12 months.

2020-07-10,"Thursday was a wild day on Wall Street, with some stocks flying and others dying. And with so much variation between sector performance, it's increasingly becoming a market of haves and have-nots. So, whether you're happy with your portfolio this week very much depends on where you have exposure. Therefore, let's take a look at three of my favorite top stock trades.The hottest sector by a long shot remains technology. However, many leaders are skirting the stratosphere and thus, offer poor entries. I'm talking Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the like. What's more attractive than chasing the big boys, though, is finding stocks to buy that are just now emerging from well-established bases. The risk is lower, and they arguably have more gas in the tank than the tech giants that have already run for so many consecutive sessions.  * The 7 Best Stocks to Invest in Right Now In addition to their more tempting entries, all of these selections went absolutely bananas on Thursday. That said, I love the relative strength and think it suggests more gains to come in the following names:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)  * Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST)  * Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU)As usual, we'll take a closer look at their charts and offer the technical reasons why they're such compelling plays. So, let's dive in. Monster Rally Stocks to Buy: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)  Click to EnlargeSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade You might think our first pick is obvious because it hales from the tech sector. But before Thursday, Advanced Micro Devices hadn't participated in the tech boom virtually at all. Not since mid-April, at least. Bears might spin its relative weakness as a negative, but I think all it's done is made the eventual breakout all the more compelling.I see a beautiful cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly time frame that is now on the cusp of completion. AMD is on every momentum traders' radar, and I guarantee they're all perking up after this week's ramp back up to resistance.If you want more confirmation, you can wait for a push above $58 to signal the resistance breach is here. Given the volume behind Thursday's rally, however, I think an upside break is inevitable.The Trade: Buy the Aug. $57.50/$62.50 bull call for around $1.75. Costco Wholesale (COST)  Click to EnlargeSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade The hubbub surrounding Costco's unique positioning to profit from the novel coronavirus has died down considerably in recent months. And in that time, its stock price hasn't budged. Like AMD, the silver lining of an asset treading water for months is it creates a clear trading range to build bets around.One of my favorite technical analysis phrases is &quot;the bigger the base, the higher in space.&quot; COST stock has been hugging $305 since last September, effectively creating a year-long base that we're now breaking out of. Thursday's nearly 3% jump saw a large influx of volume, and increase the likelihood that the resistance breach could have staying power.The implied volatility rank is low, and at $326, Costco is too expensive for long calls. Thus, I think bull call spreads are the way to go here.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week The Trade: Buy the Oct. $330/$345 call spread for around $5.60. Roku (ROKU)  Click to EnlargeSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Roku rounds out our trio of stocks to buy with an epic 12% jump on Thursday. More than 25 million shares traded throughout the day, marking its highest volume day since mid-April. That said, many of the biggest gainers on Thursday were those benefiting from the global pandemic. Coronavirus cases are on the rise, and investors seem to be warming up once more to companies like Roku.Remember, more people at home means more consumers streaming shows via Roku's media devices.Additionally, what else excites me about the ROKU stock chart is that it's just now breaking out of its three-month base. Unlike Apple or Amazon, which have already rocketed into orbit, Roku shares are just now blasting off. And I think it brings the stock's all-time high of $176.55 as a realistic upside target over the coming weeks.The Trade: Buy the Sep. $150/$160 bull call spread for around $3.90.For a free trial to the best trading community on the planet and Tyler's current home, click here!

2020-07-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Politics have been getting in the way of Americans broadly adopting a crucial preventative health measure: Wearing a mask in public to curb the spread of Covid-19. Now, though, the experts that have been urging that practice have an enormously powerful ally in Walmart Inc.The big-box retailing giant said Wednesday it would require customers at its eponymous stores and Sam’s Club chain to wear face coverings. While some 65% of its locations were already doing this to comply with local regulations, it will make it mandatory at all stores nationwide beginning July 20.  Walmart does not get any credit for leading the industry on this, given that Costco Wholesale Corp., Best Buy Co. and Starbucks Corp. had earlier moved in this direction. Still, it was certainly the right thing to do because it will go a long way toward protecting its customers and the 1.5 million employees of its U.S. stores. And because of Walmart’s ubiquity and its outsize influence in American shopping, its embrace of the policy could be a hugely important step toward getting mask-wearing to be a routine behavior in all sorts of public domains. Walmart stores are often located in rural areas, which have only recently started to see a surge in Covid-19 cases and are likely to be brimming with voters who cast a ballot for President Donald Trump and have taken note of his dismissiveness of masks. In many of these places, Walmart is one of consumers’ only options for buying household essentials. If a grocery trip can normalize mask-wearing for these people, that’s a win for everyone’s health. Walmart also has plenty of establishments in states such as Florida and Texas where cases are surging and governors have been reticent to take aggressive action to stop it. In those places, the chain is effectively stepping in to curb the spread of Covid-19 where lawmakers have failed. As the country’s largest retailer, Walmart’s move also gives cover to smaller chains to require mask-wearing. I’m sure many mom-and-pop retailers have seen the viral videos of shoppers throwing tantrums at store employees over mask policies and are loathe to have such fire-breathing scenes happen in their establishments. But if mighty Walmart is making customers do this, these stores should feel emboldened to make the choice that is best for public health. In fact, within hours of Walmart’s announcement, industry trade group the National Retail Federation issued a press release urging all retailers to require customers to wear masks nationwide. The group said it hoped Walmart’s move was “a tipping point” on this issue. It remains to be seen how easily and successfully Walmart can enforce this policy. The company says it will install “health ambassadors” at each store, workers positioned near the entrance who will responsible for reminding visitors of the mask requirement. That may be a delicate task, especially at first. But, with any luck, Walmart’s move will create an industrywide norm that will soon make the act of wearing a mask mundane and apolitical. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-07-17,"Over the past six months, big-box retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has proven itself to be a resilient holding for long-term investors. Costco stock fell below $300 per share in March but has since made its way to new highs amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com Costco is always a buy on a pullback, but with the share price trading near all-time highs, is it still worth picking up? The answer is yes if you're a long-term investor. COST benefits from both long- and short-term catalysts that make it a valuable addition to almost any portfolio. With the market's volatility set to continue through the end of the year, investors could start building a position in Costco stock slowly and keep the firm on their watch list to buy any future dips. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Costco Stock Is the Ultimate Pandemic PlayUnlike many other equities, Costco stands to benefit in almost any climate moving forward. COST stock is an obvious play in the event of renewed Covid-19 outbreaks or failed vaccine hopes. The company offers people a way to stock up on essential products at ultra-low prices. If we learned anything from the first coronavirus wave, it's that people like to panic-buy when the threat of a lockdown is looming.  * 15 Growth Stocks That Are Being Propped Up By Low Rates But Costco also appeals if the pandemic is brought under control and the U.S. finds itself in a prolonged recession. If economic uncertainty causes consumers to cut back substantially, subscription services will be under threat.But a Costco membership is likely to be one of the last to go. That's because paying Costco's membership gives people access to low prices on everything from tires and fuel to bread and meat. There's a case for Costco in the ideal scenario as well -- a quickly contained pandemic and a v-shaped recovery that yields economic growth sooner than expected. In that case, not only will members be unlikely to cut their membership, but more small businesses will reopen, potentially increasing their Costco purchases.  Near-Term CatalystsIn the short-term, Costco looks like a worthwhile pick. Whether or not the U.S. will be able to get control of it's surging case numbers is up for debate, but there's no question that there's a real threat of renewed lockdowns in several states right now.That threat should continue to push COST stock upward as investors look for pandemic-proof bets.Not only that, but Costco appears to be on track to report impressive earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. The firm's Q3 results were relatively muted as its April sales put a damper on rising demand in March. But strong performance over the summer should offer investors something to cheer about when the firm reports for Q4.Like the rest of its peers, Costco has been hit with coronavirus-related costs like increased sanitation, worker protection, and wage increases. But strong sales growth and improving margins should more than make up for that added expense.  Beyond the PandemicSo-called &quot;pandemic stocks&quot; like COST are having a moment in the sun right now, but long-term investors should consider who will win and lose once coronavirus is behind us. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is one example of this.Despite its all-star performance during the pandemic, the firm's guidance suggests that the back half of the year could be a challenge in current conditions. In short, Netflix's pandemic-boost is over. Costco doesn't have that issue. Its customers were loyal before the pandemic -- the firm has enjoyed a subscription renewal rate above 90% for the past few quarters. That's despite a 5% increase in membership fees.  The Bottom Line on CostcoCostco is one of the best retailers on the market because of its unique business model. The firm makes most of its money through subscription fees, which makes for very predictable income. As past quarters have proven, Costco members are sticky and tend to continue renewing even in periods of economic slowdowns. There aren't many stocks on the market that offer a compelling case no matter how the pandemic plays out and COST stock is certainly one of them.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Lisa Marsh’s job shopping and delivering groceries for Instacart during the past three years has been unforgiving. Company tipping policies cut into earnings while boycotts and other labor strife created confusion, she said.Then the global pandemic hit, transforming once mundane trips to Los Angeles grocery stores where she lives into a palpable health risk.In recent weeks, another problem has emerged: bots that snatch the largest, most lucrative orders out of the hands of other shoppers.Here’s how it works. Instacart pays contract workers to shop for groceries and deliver them to customers. Normally, the shoppers open the Instacart shopping app and, as orders flash by, click on the ones they want to fulfill. But in order to gain an edge, some shoppers are paying software developers who have created bots -- in the form of third-party apps -- that run alongside the legitimate Instacart app and claim the best orders for clients.In this way, the app tilts competition between shoppers but is invisible to customers and doesn’t take business away from Instacart either. The cost of the third-party apps ranges from $250 to $600 in cryptocurrency or bank deposits, according to the darkweb research firm, DarkOwl.When Marsh opens her Instacart shopping app, she sees promising orders disappear before she can act. “No human can click that fast,” she said. “Instacart needs to fix this. These bots are literally taking the food off my kids’ table.”While bots aren’t a new problem for Instacart, the recent deluge is different because it comes at a time of white-knuckled expansion for the San Francisco-based startup. The company said customer demand for grocery delivery has surged more than 500% during the pandemic, notching growth its investors didn’t expect until 2025. This makes the platform, which hasn’t expanded its team as fast as its revenue, an attractive target for hustlers.A spokeswoman for Instacart Inc. said the bots affect just a sliver of its more than 500,000 shoppers and that the company has already taken measures to address the issue.“We take the integrity of the Instacart platform very seriously and have a trust and security team dedicated to monitoring the unauthorized use of the platform which includes all efforts to prevent illicit and fraudulent third-party apps from violating our terms of service,” said Natalia Montalvo, Instacart’s director of shopper engagement and communications.Instacart said it’s combating bots by cranking up pressure against app makers and banning violators when they find them. The company said it deactivated 150 shoppers found to be misusing the platform and shut down a half dozen sites claiming to sell batches to Instacart shoppers including Instashopper.app, Sushopper, Ninja Hours and Acrobatshopper.The developers of those apps couldn’t be located for comment.Instacart also recently introduced new procedures such as prompting shoppers to verify their identity with a selfie and not permitting shoppers to switch devices in the middle of an order. Shoppers using the updated app can also choose to review a single order for 30 seconds before claiming it or passing it to another shopper.“As a result of these measures, we’ve seen a dramatic reduction in the use of unauthorized third-party apps because of the hard work and dedication by our security and legal teams to protect the shopper experience,” Montalvo said. Instacart also this month enlisted the help of security platform HackerOne to battle bots by offering a bounty program, she said.But as security experts at Amazon.com Inc. and other sites have discovered, battling rogue apps is a lot like playing whack-a-mole. As soon as a company thwarts one bot program, a new version of it emerges, usually with a new name.“If Instacart cared -- if it was losing money -- they could devote resources to make the jobs of these automatic snipers much harder,” Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert, author and lecturer at Harvard University, said there are ways for companies to detect such bots. “This is a problem that any company that makes money from automation is likely being forced to deal with. Some handle it well. Others don’t.”In recent months, different Instacart shopper-related apps have come and gone, sometimes using slightly varied titles, such as Ninja Hours, Ninja Shoppers and Ninja Shopper. DarkOwl discovered nearly a dozen active platforms in mid-May advertising openly on YouTube and social media platforms, including Reddit. Digital breadcrumbs linked these sites back to users spanning the U.S., including New York, Savannah, Georgia and Northern California’s wine country, according to DarkOwl. Others linked to an apparent Brazilian app developer syndicate that leans heavily on YouTube ads narrated in Portuguese, the research firm concluded.The developer of those apps couldn’t be located for comment.Some of the apps work, others are scams, according to DarkOwl. The Bitcoin wallet linked to the site of Ninja Shoppers indicates its owners have received 76 deposits -- about $20,000 -- including many from Instacart shoppers desperate to jumpstart their stalled shopping careers.The apps are typically available on websites published by their developers. In the case of Ninja Shoppers, the app is free to download, but users must be ‘’activated in a private group” in order to be granted permission to pay for a user authentication token, according to their website, which is published in English and Portuguese. Once logged-in, the program prompts the user to find Instacart sales available near their location, according to a YouTube video viewed more than 13,000 times since May 9.Despite Instacart’s efforts to crack down, finding a permanent solution may be difficult. Earlier this month, one man using the Instacart shopping app, who said he’s been using a bot since March, offered to install it on another shopper’s phone for $250, plus a $130 weekly recurring fee, according to screen shots of a conversation in late July seen by Bloomberg. When reached by phone earlier this week, the man spoke first in Portuguese and then in English, confirming to Bloomberg he was selling a bot for those amounts. He declined to answer additional questions after learning that the information would likely be publicized.Fear of getting deactivated or scammed out of money has stopped some shoppers from spending money on the apps. Others like Santa Cruz-area grandmother Ginger Colgate said she refuses to do so on moral grounds.“It’s just not right. It’s against the rules,” said Colgate, complaining that her earnings dropped from $1,800 a week to $300 because the bots have siphoned the best work. Colgate said she still sometimes drives to Costco and opens the Instacart app, hoping for work.“So many times I sit with tears in my eyes in the parking lot just waiting and hoping to get an order,” she said. “I’ve basically given up.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Instacart Shoppers Besieged by Bots That Snatch Lucrative Orders
2020-07-31,"Since the late 1950s, legendary investor Warren Buffett and his long-time partner Charlie Munger have transformed Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) from a struggling textile manufacturer to a holding company with a market capitalization greater than $470 billion. Today, I'll discuss three Warren Buffett stocks to hold for the next 10 years.Buffett firmly believes that stocks outperform all other asset classes over time. However, he's not one to buy shares in a company at any price. Indeed, the Oracle of Omaha is regarded as the king of value investing.Earlier in the year, Buffett released his annual shareholder letter. Although Buffett is bullish on stocks long term, he said &quot;that rosy prediction comes with a warning: Anything can happen to stock prices tomorrow.&quot; And within days of his warning in February, markets globally did indeed crash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo him, if you're not thinking of owning the stock you've just bought for at least a decade, don't even think of owning it for a day. Therefore, falling prices don't make him nervous because he has seen equity markets recover time after time. Instead, he patiently waits.One of my favorite Warren Buffett quotes is &quot;opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.&quot; In other words, he'd recommend retail investors to buy stocks as prices decline.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income InvestingBuffett invests for the long haul and he has generated massive wealth over the last few decades. BRK.A stock currently has the most expensive share price of any company in history. In 1964, each Class A share was just shy of $20. Now each Class A share costs upwards of $290,000 (no, that's not a misprint). Buffett has been making, on average, 20% a year.Buffett's preferred investments are:  * Large-cap stocks  * Financials, including banks and insurance companies  * Consumer brands  * Stocks that pay dividendsBerkshire Hathaway's regular 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show his holdings. With that in mind, here are three Warren Buffett stocks to hold for the next 10 years:  * Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  * American Express (NYSE:AXP)  * Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) Warren Buffett Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Apple shares comprise around 20% of Warren Buffett's portfolio with Berkshire Hathaway. Regular InvestorPlace.com readers will be familiar with the fact that Buffett loves consumer stocks. And he regards Apple as a compelling consumer business thanks to its popularity worldwide.In a recent interview Buffett said, &quot;I do not focus on the sales in the next quarter or the next year. I focus on the … hundreds, hundreds, hundreds millions of people who practically live their lives by [iPhone] … It's probably the best business I know in the world.&quot;Two years ago, Apple became the first U.S.-based company to hit a $1 trillion valuation. Currently the market-cap is about $1.6 trillion. With such a market-cap, it would be safe to assume that Apple shares are unlikely to be held down by the market for too long, even in uncertain times brought on by novel coronavirus. Wall Street and Buffett regard large-cap companies as good, stable long-term investments.In fact, so far in the year, Apple shares are up around to 33%. But that metric tells only half the story. On March 23, AAPL stock hit a recent low of $212.51. Now it's hovering around $405.Apple announced on Thursday, in its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, a four-for-one stock split to occur in August.The Cupertino, California-based tech giant committed to be carbon-neutral by 2030. The commitment extends to its supply chain, too. As a result every device it sells will have net zero climate impact before the end of the decade.The company also has long-term catalysts, including the opportunities yet to be offered by the upcoming 5G iPhone. Thus, long-term investors may regard any dip in AAPL shares as a good opportunity to buy into the business. American Express (AXP)Source: Shutterstock American Express is one of the largest global payment networks.Buffett has been a shareholder since 1964.  According to the second-quarter earnings release of July 28, the company's net income came at $257 million, or 29 cents per share, compared with net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.07 per share, a year ago.Analysts are debating the economic effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on global economies and the spending habits of consumers. If our economy does not show the V-shaped recovery many have been hoping for, then businesses like American Express are likely to be adversely affected further.One important point to highlight is that the company's core consumers form an affluent client base relative to the customers of competitors. Thus American Express - a trusted brand - may be less affected from a potential economic slowdown. Year-to-date, AXP stock down around 24%.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income InvestingLong-term investors who would like to follow Warren Buffett stocks may consider buying AXP on the dips. Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Costco Wholesale is the second-largest global retailer by revenue,.COST stock has rewarded its shareholders well so far in 2020. The share price is up about 11%. In comparison, the S&P 500 index is about down 1%.Costco operates in the warehouse (or wholesale) club space within the retail industry. This segment usually performs well regardless of macroeconomic conditions, thanks to the low cost and high-value products. Costco's main competitor is Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and both companies are thriving in recent years. The group runs on a &quot;subscription business model,&quot; where customers pay an annual membership fee to have access to its bargain-priced bulk goods. In 2019, Costco collected around $3.35 billion in membership fee revenue, which is almost entirely profit. The membership service has a renewal rate of over 90% in the U.S. as the group scores high on customer satisfaction surveys. By using a membership-only system, Costco is able to book nearly all of its profits one year in advance. Thus the annual membership model contributes to its operating income and gives Costco stock immense earnings stability.Coupled with strong customer loyalty, the retail giant has pricing power, too. And as a result both the top and the bottom lines register year-over-year increases. Over the past quarters, the Street has also been applauding Costco's cost structure, one of the lowest in the retail industry.Although I believe COST stock is likely to go higher in the long run, there will be profit-taking around the corner. Therefore those investors who may want to recession-proof their portfolio could regard any dip in the stock price as a viable opportunity to buy into the shares.Tezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, including a Ph.D. degree, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

2020-08-07,"Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock was underperforming for years before the novel coronavirus hit. No more. It opens for trade on Aug. 7 at about $35 a share. That's a 21% gain for 2020, against 2.3% for the S&P 500 index, and 11% for Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the country's biggest grocer.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Kroger operates under dozens of brands, from Fred Meyer in Portland to Ralph's in Los Angeles, and from King Soopers in Denver to Harris Teeter in North Carolina. As a result, most people don't realize it's America's second-biggest grocery chain, with 10% of the U.S. market. Its share is twice that of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), which has 5%, and five times that of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Whole Foods, at 2%.Thanks to the virus, this fact has gotten through investors' heads and made Kroger a hot stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Hot CompanyDuring the April quarter this also made Kroger a hot company. Sales zoomed to $41.55 billion. That's a gain of 11.5% over the same quarter of 2019. Profits also rose sharply, to $1.54 per share, up from 95 cents a year earlier.Can it do that again? The spring quarter is usually Kroger's best. Analysts are only expecting revenue of $29.3 billion when Kroger next reports earnings Sept. 17. That would still be 5% ahead of last year. Net income is expected to be 50 cents per share, up from 37 cents last year.Kroger has gone from being the forgotten store of the middle class to essential during the pandemic. The center of the market, where packaged goods like canned meat, cereal, and ketchup are located, has gone from cold to hot as well.The virus also has the media talking about Kroger again, often in the same breath as Walmart. Kroger has been bottling its own milk for years, a trend that has destroyed dairy aisle &quot;name brands&quot; like Dean Foods and Borden.  Suddenly, the media notices.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand When talking about mask requirements, Kroger is also being mentioned in the same breath as Walmart. The same is true with the coin shortage. Kroger had always been there. It's just being noticed now. After the PandemicThe question for investors is, what happens after the pandemic passes? Will Kroger go back to being the forgotten home of the forgotten middle class?That depends on what the grocer does now.Kroger didn't bring out its first unified brand message until late last year. It's now combining all advertising under a single national team, which will handle all channels, and all Kroger brands. This includes streaming and internet-based ads, where Kroger data is being used to target ads on Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) streaming boxes.More controversial are Kroger's plans for home delivery. These still focus on automated warehouses from Ocado Group (OTCMKTS:OCDDY), a British company it partnered with two years ago. It's a contrast to Walmart, which has been handling online fulfillment directly through its stores. Kroger stores do pick-up, too. They just don't do it as well. They also don't do it profitably. Ocado warehouses are designed to do it profitably. The Bottom Line on Kroger StockI spent much of last year pounding the table for Kroger stock, writing that it wasn't being appreciated and praised the Ocado deal. This was thanks to Kroger's performance through the 2010s. It still trades for 10% less than it did five years ago. From a high of $41 a share in late 2015 it fell to a low of $20 in 2017.Now it's closer to fair value. The price-to-earnings ratio is 13.5, and the 18 cents per share dividend yields 2.05%. Whether its pandemic gains are temporary or permanent is still unknown, but the slow-motion turnaround looks real.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-08-12,"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved up to $336.69 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-11  * Strike Price: $320.00  * Volume: 391  * Open Interest: 583 Signs of Unusual Options Activity One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-12,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. gasoline consumption recovered last week to where it stood just before the pandemic forced everyone inside but uncertainty lingers for the oil industry as driving season season approaches its end. Will anyone be driving back to school?Gasoline demand last week increased to 8.715 million barrels-a-day, the highest level for the four-week moving average since March 20, Energy Information Administration data show. “That’s an impressive number,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. “It looks like people are finally getting back on the road, especially since we had been seeing a lot of discussion of the second wave of the virus.”More drivers were spotted in California and Texas, the states with the most registered vehicles, Macquarie said in a note this week. Still, demand is off last year’s figure by nearly 1 million barrels a day. That’s the equivalent of taking about 1.5 million pickup trucks off the road.Gasoline isn’t the only road fuel in recovery mode. Product supplied for diesel last week rose to its highest since April 3. Highway miles for trucks are up this year over 2019 with more shoppers turning to online orders. The uptick in consumption has prompted once-moribund refiners to process more crude. Refinery utilization rose to 81% so far in August from 73% in early June.These embers of a recovery may flicker out as summer comes to a close. September will likely bring a drop in gasoline demand figures both monthly and compared to last year with fewer parents driving kids to school, Houston oil analyst Andy Lipow said. U.S. Labor Day marks the end of summer travel.“We’ll see it come off a lot more this year,” Lipow said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Gasoline Demand On the Rise in the Waning Days of Summer

Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Costco Wholesale posted an ROCE of 0.07%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on COSTROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Costco Wholesale is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In Costco Wholesale's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Recap Costco Wholesale reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.89/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $2.04/share.See more from Benzinga  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Costco Wholesale  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-14,"The BigCommerce (NASDAQ:BIGC) IPO was a huge success. Within two days, BigCommerce stock rallied more than 330% from its $24 IPO price, to a high of $104 in early August.Source: Shutterstock Then the hype faded. BIGC stock dropped. From $104 … all the way to $70.This near-term weakness won't last.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the long run, robust growth tailwinds in the e-commerce platform market coupled with BigCommerce's favorable competitive positioning in that market will power significant revenue and profit growth at the company.That significant revenue and profit growth will translate into significant gains for BigCommerce stock.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListSo, buy the dip in BIGC stock. This is a long-term winner, and today's weakness will ultimately look like little more than a blip on the radar in five years.Here's a deeper look. The Burgeoning E-Commerce Platform MarketTo understand the long-term bull thesis on companies like BigCommerce and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), you need to understand the bull thesis on the broader e-commerce platform market.Long story short, all the big dogs in the retail world - like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) - have already built out robust e-commerce platforms. Small retailers haven't. As of 2018, around 40% of small businesses didn't even have a website, mostly because e-commerce has remained relatively niche.Not anymore.Thanks to the novel coronavirus pandemic, consumer adoption of e-commerce has permanently accelerated. E-commerce is no longer niche. It's everywhere and everything.So, what you have started to see in 2020, is small and mid-sized businesses swarm to e-commerce. This trend won't slow down. Over the next decade, it will accelerate, to the point where websites will become the new storefronts, in that every retailer will have one by 2030, and most retailers will be doing most of their business through them by then.But, building a robust e-commerce operation isn't easy. You have to build a website and optimize it from a design, sales and marketing perspective. You have to build out sales capability in social channels, leverage data to increase conversions, employ digital marketing campaigns to drive traffic, so on and so forth.These small and mid-sized businesses are flocking to e-commerce platform companies, like Shopify and BigCommerce, to help them build strong e-retail businesses.This flocking will remain vigorous over the next decade. As it does, the amount of money flowing through these e-commerce platforms - both subscription dollars and marketplace dollars - will soar. BigCommerce Is a Strong Company in a Strong MarketFor all intents and purposes, Shopify is the king of the e-commerce platform market. With 1.05 million merchants and $61 billion in gross merchandise value, Shopify is simply miles bigger than everyone else in the space.But this isn't a winner-take-all market.Of all the small and mid-sized businesses that will rush into e-commerce platforms over the next decade, not all of them will choose Shopify, simply because there are other platforms out there that offer different features which may appeal more to different sellers.The strongest of the &quot;other guys&quot; in this market is BigCommerce.BigCommerce has a solid positioning in this market, powering 60,000-plus online stores as of June 2020. But, more importantly, BigCommerce has enough distinct advantages over Shopify in certain areas that the platform is a better option than Shopify for many sellers.For example, BigCommerce features zero transaction fees, whereas Shopify takes a 0.5% to 2% commission off every transaction. Plus, BigCommerce has far more robust product listing options, more APIs, better multi-currency solutions, tiered pricing structures and more streamlined customer upload options.To that end, BigCommerce is often a more attractive option than Shopify for many smaller sellers, international sellers, bulk discount sellers, retail shops with a ton of SKUs or personalized items, so on and so forth.In other words, BigCommerce reasonably projects as a solid second-fiddle to Shopify in the burgeoning e-commerce platform market.On that basis alone, BigCommerce stock looks like a compelling long-term buy. BigCommerce Stock Has Upside PotentialBigCommerce has a $5 billion market cap. Shopify has a $120 billion market cap.I'm not drawing this comparison to say that BigCommerce could one day be a $100+ billion company. It won't be, partly because BigCommerce won't ever have as many merchants as Shopify. And partly because BigCommerce doesn't make any revenue off of marketplace sales, whereas that is Shopify's biggest revenue stream.But I am drawing this comparison to show that BIGC stock does have significant long-term upside potential.BigCommerce powered 60,000 online stores as of June 2020. There are 7.1 million e-retailers in the world. So, BigCommerce powers about 1% of e-retail websites in the world today.About 74% of small retailers don't have an e-commerce enabled website. Thus, we can estimate the total number of retailers in the world at 27 million. By 2030, I think most of those retailers will have an e-commerce presence. If hat number's 80%, the total e-retailer pool would be 22 million.Let's say BigCommerce maintains 1% market share. Total online stores powered by BigCommerce will measure 220,000 by the end of the decade.Using 2019 numbers, BigCommerce made about $2,000 per year off of each one of its online stores.  That number will rise over time, thanks to price hikes and more bigger sellers on the platform (who have higher subscription price points). BigCommerce's unit revenues could easily rise to $4,000 to $5,000 by 2030.The math there implies nearly $1 billion in revenue by the end of the decade. Gross margins are around 75%. The opex rate should fall with scale towards an application software industry-average opex rate of 40%. So, you're talking 35% operating margins, $350 million in operating profits, and potentially $280 million in 2030 net profits after taking out 20% for taxes.Application software stocks typically fetch a 35x forward earnings multiple. A 35x multiple on $280 million in 2030 net profits implies a potential 2029 market cap for BIGC stock of nearly $10 billion.That's about double today's market cap, with room for upside if BigCommerce expands market share in the e-commerce platform market. Bottom Line on BIGC StockBigCommerce stock is a long-term winner.Sure, the IPO hype didn't last long. Don't worry about that. This is all just near-term noise.Let the hype fade. Let the traders flip the stock. Then, step in, buy the dip and hold for the long haul as secular e-commerce platform tailwinds push BIGC stock way higher in the long run.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-08-14,"As a big picture investment idea, you can't do much better than Home Depot (NYSE:HD). As a hardware and home maintenance retailer, Home Depot is a needed commodity in any market, bull or bear. This resiliency underlining Home Depot stock has proven itself yet again during the novel coronavirus pandemic.Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com Sure, people flocked to Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stores when the coronavirus first struck and it made sense: you can't live without food, water, and convenient hand sanitizer packages.However, many of us - including yours truly - discovered that items that we necessarily can't eat nevertheless play a vital role in our comfort and in a real sense, our safety.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTherefore, I haven't been surprised that Home Depot stock has steadily marched higher since its March lows. But ahead of its second-quarter earnings report, it's fair to consider the other side of the coin.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListYes, HD received a shot of relevancy during the peak of this crisis. As well, other potential crises - particularly the record-breaking hurricane season - should theoretically lift Home Depot stock. But back in March, people had more money to work with. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to exact a toll on our country, those collective funds have been negatively impacted.Further, the deadlock in Congress about extending pandemic-related relief to millions of desperate Americans raise concern, not only for Home Depot stock but for other retail names. At one point, many workers were making more money staying at home than they did actually working. Surely, this supported consumer spending.Now, without that vital support, a dark cloud hangs over the labor force. It's not as if every HD customer is well off. Unusual Housing Dynamics for Home Depot StockObviously, with a name like Home Depot stock, the security moves on major developments in the housing market. In this case, HD generally moves higher when it's a seller's market. This makes sense because higher home prices indicate greater demand, which in turn benefits HD's valuation.Of course, this trend has its limits. If there is too much demand, meaning that inventory is constrained, the shift toward HD wouldn't be sustainable. A classic example is the housing crisis which eventually led to the Great Recession.Further, between 2012 to 2018, the price of Home Depot stock shared a strong direct correlation with the monthly supply of houses in the U.S. (which the government measures as the ratio of houses for sale versus houses sold). In other words, as home supply increased (to reasonable levels), so too did HD shares.But from the beginning of 2019, we saw an abrupt change to this relationship. Instead of a direct correlation, we now have an inverse relationship: as one metric goes up, the other slides down. Nowhere is this new dynamic more evident than it is during this crisis.  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto In April, the housing supply ratio jumped to 6.8, a multi-year high. At the time, Home Depot stock averaged $218.53. Jump ahead to June and the housing supply is down to 4.7 and HD shares traded at $249.This tells me that demand for home furnishings, repair and remodeling is strong - with a dearth of inventory, what else are current homeowners going to do?Looking back at history, until the housing supply ratio reaches unsustainable levels, perhaps at ratios seen during the last housing crisis, the bullishness in HD stock will likely continue. Again, there's really nothing that prospective home buyers can do. Divisive Politics Can Be a Surprising CatalystStill, the big wildcard is the economy. Unless the U.S. government can get its act together and present viable solutions, we may face a catastrophe. You only need to look at the rising prices of precious metals to understand the fear investors have.As well, the political divisiveness isn't helping matters. But on some levels, it's a positive catalyst for Home Depot stock. Primarily, President Donald Trump has every incentive to throw anything and everything at the struggling economy. If it's sickly by election day, he's toast and he knows it.On the other hand, Wall Street seems to have a love affair with the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket. Thus, even if Trump loses, that could also be positive for HD stock.Given the strange dynamics of the new normal, I'd say that Home Depot looks good into 2021. And even if disaster strikes again, it's reasonable to have confidence in HD. It's been proven reliable during the worst of times and hopefully, this pandemic should prove no different.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-08-14,"Shares of Costco Wholesale Inc. (NASDAQ: COST) rose by 10.79% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Costco Wholesale has.Costco Wholesale's Debt Based on Costco Wholesale's balance sheet as of June 4, 2020, long-term debt is at $7.60 billion and current debt is at $1.50 billion, amounting to $9.10 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $10.83 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $-1.73 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Costco Wholesale has $51.73 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.18. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * ROCE Insights For Costco Wholesale  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Costco Wholesale  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart Inc. shoppers are a pretty loyal bunch. But when virus-spooked Americans began avoiding stores earlier this year and shifting spending online, far more Walmart customers went to Amazon.com Inc. than Walmart.com.So even though Walmart, too, has thrived as an essential service amid the pandemic, Amazon is benefiting more.In the first week of February, shoppers made purchases at Walmart stores and on Walmart.com about twice as often as they did on Amazon.com, according to Facteus, which tracks credit and debit-card spending for millions of shoppers. That behavior shifted significantly during the pandemic; in the first week of August, this cohort of shoppers were just 2 percentage points less likely to shop at Amazon than a Walmart store. Walmart, through a spokesman, declined to comment.When the coronavirus began spreading across the the U.S., Amazon stumbled at first. Shipping times lengthened; multiple products were out of stock. Some reports said the company’s vaunted customer service metrics were starting to slip. Amazon responded by hiring 175,000 people to keep its operations running as existing employees sickened or stayed away for fear of catching Covid-19.The strategy, which included stepped-up safety measures in warehouses, eased investors’ fears. But few predicted the second-quarter earnings report that shattered Wall Street’s already optimistic expectations and forecast a continued surge in demand even as stores start to re-open. The shares have advanced more than 65% this year, compared with a 3% gain for the S&P 500.Turns out the online retail giant was perfectly situated to take advantage of a sudden shift in consumer behavior that, according to McKinsey, has compressed 10 years worth of online sales growth into three months. Amazon’s easily searchable website packed with hundreds of millions of products that can be delivered from warehouses scattered across the country stood out more than ever when the malls and Main Street went dark. And shoppers suddenly became quite forgiving of delivery delays. More than 8 in 10 thought holdups of a few days or longer were reasonable given the outbreak, according to a survey of 500 Amazon consumers conducted in June by Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Goat Consulting.As always, consumers are mostly mission-shopping at Amazon—hitting the site with a list that now includes everything from hand wipes and masks to above-ground pools and home-office furniture. But another trend has emerged too. People who once trolled the mall with no particular product in mind are starting to do the same on Amazon, which hasn't previously been known for window shopping. Consider the surge in demand for shelves shaped like coffins and gigantic stuffed panthers—classic retail therapy for a panicked populace.“Rather than price-compare or look for alternatives, a large portion of the U.S. population—as well as in other core Amazon markets—defaulted to Amazon,” says Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, a New York research firm that monitors the site. “They were able to default to Amazon because of its vast selection, so even as people went from shopping for masks to toilet paper to webcams to dumbbells to inflatable pools and back, Amazon had it. It’s not that other retailers didn’t have the same products at similar prices. The key was that customers didn’t look elsewhere.”Of course, other retailers allowed to stay open throughout the pandemic have benefited, too. Walmart, Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. have all gobbled up sales lost by shuttered stores, allowing them to grow even when consumers cut overall spending in response to rising joblessness and a tenuous economy. But Amazon has outperformed them all. Its website attracted 2.57 billion visitors in July, more than EBay Inc., Walmart, Etsy, Home Depot, Target and Best Buy combined, according to Marketplace Pulse.Amazon has become a substitute for entire industries. Foodies turned to it for new kitchen appliances after their favorite restaurants closed. Hair dye sales surged because people couldn’t go to salons. Many Americans are finally starting that garden since they have nothing else to do. All of these factors combined to propel second-quarter sales 40%  to $88.9 billion.The big question for investors is whether Amazon’s sales spike will endure. The economy is still struggling, and it doesn't help that Congress is deadlocked on a fresh round of stimulus spending and an extension of unemployment benefits. There’s also little doubt that some of the buying on Amazon and elsewhere is related to the pandemic and could fade. In a survey of 1,000 U.S. shoppers conducted last week, more than half said they’ve made online purchases as a way to relieve stress, says Vivek Pandya, Senior Digital Insights Manager at Adobe Digital Insights.That could explain the strong demand for those coffin-shaped shelves, which are sold as a kind of gag by Helium 10, an Irvine, California-based company that makes e-commerce tools. Ditto for the spike in sales of giant stuffed animals.  “Whether people are just looking for something large and comforting during these uncertain times or they’re just bored and think a giant panther would look good in that empty space in their living room, I don’t know,” says Macy Frazier, an operations analyst at Viahart, the Canton, Texas-based merchant that sells them. “There’s just something going on.&quot;Retail therapy exists in good times as well as bad. And when the pandemic ends, Amazon will inherit a landscape decimated by dozens of retail bankruptcies, including department store chain J.C. Penney Co., clothing retailer Lord & Taylor, furniture and housewares seller Pier 1 Imports Inc. and Modell’s Sporting Goods Inc. It’s telling—and a potentially ominous sign for these retailers—that Amazon’s subscription services surged 30% last quarter. Most of that is new Prime members, who will be hard to dislodge once the battered chains emerge from Chapter 11 with fewer stores.(The third paragraph in this story published Aug. 12 was corrected to say the data refer to the number of transactions not spending. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Wins Loyal Walmart Shoppers as Americans Stampede Online

2020-08-21,"Costco (NYSE:COST) stock is up just 15.7% so far this and up 24% in the past year. Most of its peers have done better, but Costco stock is much more expensive. Something doesn't make sense here. This article looks at the relationship between Costco's higher valuation and its relative returns.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is up 72% year-to-date. And it increased over 77% in the past year. These are both significantly higher returns that Costco stock. However, Target (NYSE:TGT) is up 7.8% in 2020, but over 64% in the past year. The year-to-date is lower than Costco but the one-year return is higher.Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock is up 14.1% year-to-date, slightly lower than Costco. And its one-year return is up 20%, also lower than Costco. Lastly, Kroger (NYSE:KR) is up 24.2% year-to-date, and 58.9% over one year. Both of these blow away Costco stock's performance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe problem is that every one of these peers, except for Amazon is much cheaper than Costco. Costco sells for 39.6 times 2020 estimated earnings. But Target is at 26.9 times earnings, Walmart is at 26.8 times, and Kroger trades for just 12.7 times earnings. These three are all cheaper by at least one-third or more than Costco.Only Amazon is more expensive at 100 times earnings. But of course, its performance blew way past Costco. Why Returns Matter When Fundamentals RuleWe can look at ratios and growth rates and strategy differences and compare them all day. But you see my point. It's the stock price performance that matters in the end.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns NowThe bottom line is this: Costco stock is simply too expensive for its average stock return performance. Why pay a premium, in terms of earnings, just to get an average to poor stock price gain?If you watch CNBC, or even Fox Business or read online what analysts say about stocks, it's always about the fundamentals or the expected outlook.But at some point, don't you just have to reject this and just look at reality? You say, hey, whathappened in the past and why am I overpaying for this stock?Well, here is one reason. The long run counts. Costco's price-earnings ratio is higher than its peers because its formula works better over the long run. The proof? Costco stock outperformed its peers over the past five years, except, of course, for Amazon. Nobody ever beats Amazon.For example, Costco stock is up 132.7% over the past five years. Walmart is up just 88.6%, Target is up 75%, and Kroger is actually down 6.9% over the past five years. Amazon stock rose by 494.6%.So, for the most part, Costco stock beat its competitors, except Amazon, by at least 50% to 60%. What to Do With Costco StockTherefore, the moral of the story is that you pay for what you get in the long run. You pay a high price for the higher expected performance over several years. This is clearly evident with Amazon. But it is also clear with Costco stock.For example, Costco's P/E ratio is one-third higher than its peers, but in the long-run - at least five years - the return is twice that higher P/E. In other words, the average 65% higher performance is twice the 33% higher P/E ratio.So, sometimes, all you have to do is look at the simplest numbers, not the fundamentals. The fundamentals work themselves out over the long run. Costco's superior fundamentals translate into superior performance, despite the higher price the market charges for the stock.The only important requirement is time. It takes time for the market to works these things out and see the value of the higher quality of the company.That means if you want to buy Costco stock, stick with it for a good five-year period. You can average cost into the stock over this time. That will help you to be patient investing in Costco stock over time.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-08-28,"I am a big fan of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stores and I am almost always bullish Costco stock. But since I am not a perma-bull, I am not blindly recommending that people buy it now.Source: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com Today's message is one to raise caution but not alarm. Simply put, I believe that there will be better entry points into this great stock for new investors. It would be best to wait out at the risk of missing the next bit of upside and avoid the potential unknown downside.The last time I wrote about COST stock, I called for investors to buy the dip that the China tariff headlines caused. Back then we had a good base and an excellent economic backdrop. Now we are at completely the opposite end of the scale. Yesterday we learned that 15 million Americans continued to file unemployment and the GDP is shrinking. This by no means should be an invitation to set new records in the stock market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThings seem healthy because of several artificial and temporary factors. The U.S. has deployed unprecedented fiscal and monetary programs propping up a crippled economy. The Fed is committed to keeping us awash with liquidity -- that's the monetary part -- and the White House is providing the fiscal spending. The stimulus will soon end which will create a hole in the economy. If that's the case then stocks are too expensive up here. Costco Stock Is Not ExpensiveWhen I caution against valuation, I don't mean that COST stock is exorbitantly expensive, because it's not. A 41x price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is tolerable especially for an outfit of this caliber. The bloat comes from the overall exuberance that exists in the entire stock market. Equities on Wall Street have recovered the entire quarantine correction and more, while the economic fundamentals are still worse than ever.  * 30 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for 20 Years of Income Growth Soon enough the bulls on Wall Street figure out that main street is still struggling. Then they will need to realign their lofty expectations with the underlying reality.The &quot;E&quot; in P/E has a way of shrinking if money gets tight in the hands of our people. And that is why I recommend exercising patience for those looking for new positions in COST stock. This is nothing against the company because they have been excellent at executing their plans. They are one of two major retailers that have figured out how to successfully fight Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the other one. Year-to-date they are both up twice as much as the S&P 500. The Real Threat to COST StockThe White House website states that &quot;consumer spending is roughly 68 percent of GDP&quot;. We also know that there is a ton of free stimulus money flooding the economy right now, so spending is artificially high.The politicians are late with the next stimulus package and the longer they take the smaller it will be. Besides, after the election, both sides will have disincentives to continue any stimulus and the gravy train will end. The U.S. consumer could be headed into a cash crunch which will ripple through our economy. If and when that happens, all equities will fall, even the ones dubbed &quot;Covid-19 stocks&quot; like Costco and Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM).If the unemployed do not come back to work they will find themselves short on funds and will crimp spending abruptly. So far the quarantine wounds are covered with gauze, but soon enough we will find out if the wounds have festered or healing.I appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Federal Reserve in keeping liquidity in the market. However they have gone overboard with the jawboning efforts. Mr. Powell is choosing to change the measurement tools with regards to inflation and unemployment because they are not getting the results they expected. Costco Can Continue to WinSource: Charts by TradingView The stock broke out from $322 per share in early July and has since filled its target objective. In the process it has established a set of higher-lows and higher-highs that formed a tall rising wedge. Those are susceptible to sharp corrections and without warning.COST stock should retest the neckline from which it broke out. Therefore I expect a six to 10% correction and that would not change the bullish outline. If I'm long the stock for the very long term then I can ignore these comments. But if I'm looking to open a new position, I see no reason to rush before a dip.The stock needs to transfer out of weak hands and into fresher ones. It rallied 30% from the bottom and that is tiresome, especially in the face of adversity that killed almost all other brick-and-mortar retailers. The run on toilet paper and cleaning supplies helped but a lot of the kudos fall on the management team. How to Get Long Now and Leave Room for ErrorIf I'm forced to commit long Costco at this point I would rather sell October $305 puts and collect $2.50 in premium. This way I can be long now, leave room for a correction, and not even need a rally to win. In fact, the stock can fall 11% and I still wouldn't lose any money.Costco operation is not the cause for my worry as much as the entire stock market as a whole is. Much of the buying is happening in sectors that are frothy. The NASDAQ has been setting records either on the back of massive mega-caps rallying 12% like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) did on Wednesday on no news, or on the back of hopeful companies like Zoom that have a price-to-sales of 120x.I appreciate the potential of technology but it has reached ridiculous levels. Eventually these stocks will have to fall because nothing goes on forever. That's the bigger threat to the Costco stock price. If these frothy stocks fall they will drag the whole market with them.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. Join his live chat room for free here.

2020-09-03,"Costco Wholesale said net sales spiked 15% in August as shoppers are returning to the stores and e-commerce revenue continues to accelerate.Costco’s (COST) reported net sales of $13.56 billion for the four weeks ended Aug. 30, up from $11.79 billion last year. In the fourth quarter ended Aug. 30, the retailer generated net sales of $52.3 billion, an increase of 12.7% year-on-year, exceeding the $51.9 billion analysts had forecast. Comparable sales in the fourth quarter rose 14.1% compared with the 9.8% expected by analysts.In addition, e-commerce sales jumped 102% during the retail month of August. On a geographical breakdown comparable sales, excluding the impacts from change in gasoline prices and foreign exchange, last month advanced 14.3% in the US, 15% in Canada, and 15.4% in other global markets.For the 52-week fiscal year ended Aug. 30, the company reported net sales of $163.2 billion, an increase of 9.2% from the $149.4 billion during the similar period last year.Earlier this year, Costco had suffered from a sales drop as stay-at-home orders and social distancing restrictions have led to a traffic decline at its warehouses, while e-commerce revenue wasn’t enough to offset the trend during the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh last month reiterated a Buy rating on the stock after hosting a virtual call with senior management, saying that COST remains a top pick.“Right now, the company is really firing on all cylinders, in our view, benefiting from its leading value position in the grocery category, increased consumer appetite for at home related products, and accelerating growth in e-commerce,” Parikh wrote in a note to investors. “Going forward, we believe share gains could be stickier than most given the company’s superior value proposition, merchandising efforts in categories such as white goods, price investments, digital efforts, and benefits from a large number of retail bankruptcies.The analyst, who has a Street-high price target of $400 (11.5% upside potential) on the stock, sees prospects for “double-digit upside” and continues to forecast a special dividend of $10- plus in coming quarters. (See Costco stock analysis on TipRanks).Meanwhile, the rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 16 Buy ratings versus 7 Hold ratings.With shares up 22% so far this year, the $352.88 average analyst price target implies 1.7% downside potential in the coming 12 months.Related News:   Walmart’s Flipkart Launches Online Wholesale Service In India   Macy’s Pops 6% As 2Q Revenue Surprises   H&R Block Drops After 1Q Revenue Miss More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Intel Rolls Out Tiger Lake Laptop Chips As Street Says Hold   * Nordstrom vs Macy’s: Which Stock Has A Better Chance Of Recovery Post-Covid?   * Nio August Car Deliveries More Than Double   * Five Spikes 7% In After-Hours As 2Q Sales Top Estimates",Costco August Sales Jump 15% As E-Commerce Explodes 102%

2020-09-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Mukesh Ambani has joined the league of world’s richest with the help of a simple formula: assembling admirers for $2 businesses. First he got Facebook Inc. and Google to back his fledgling digital ambitions, and now he may be trying  to entice Amazon.com Inc. into his retail venture, already India’s largest.In four years, the Indian billionaire has amassed roughly 400 million customers for his mobile data business. What does Ambani eke out from each of them? Less than $2 a month. The chump change didn’t deter Facebook and Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc. Together with marquee private equity investors and sovereign wealth funds, Silicon Valley tech titans made a beeline recently to invest in Ambani’s Jio Platforms Ltd., valuing it at about $65 billion. That $20 billion fund-raising spree has already met the refining and petrochemicals czar’s goal of making his flagship Reliance Industries Ltd. net-debt-free, giving it enviable financial strength just as the coronavirus pandemic is taking a toll on most other balance sheets. The tycoon wants a repeat performance for another $2 business in his stable: retail. He has offered a 40% stake in Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. to Amazon, Bloomberg News reported Thursday. It’s unclear if Jeff Bezos will bite. But others have. Menlo Park, California-based Silver Lake Partners, which bought a stake in Jio, has written a $1 billion check for 1.75%. Another Jio investor, KKR & Co., is also probably coming on board.To see how the excitement is rising once again over a princely $2, consider Reliance’s 30 million square feet of retail space. Each square foot, analysts expect, will garner $2 a day by 2022. On an operating margin of 7%, that translates to  $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. All Ambani had to do was to convince Silver Lake that this Ebitda is worth 38 times today. And with that, he unlocked the gates to a $57 billion enterprise.If the Facebook deal for Jio is any guide, Amazon as a strategic partner might get its 40% for a small discount to what Silver Lake paid, though the reported $20 billion price tag is still formidable. Excluding his $38 billion divorce settlement, Bezos hasn’t done a transaction as large as this. There’s another wrinkle. Amazon India, in which he has already committed billions of dollars, competes with Reliance Retail’s physical stores — as well as with Ambani’s version of “phy-gital” retail. But on his own, Bezos must fight with one hand tied behind his back. Foreign-owned e-commerce sites, such as his or Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart, must operate as pure marketplaces for third-party sellers. The law against owning inventory has become stricter, with discounts triggering allegations of favoring connected parties. India’s competition commission received a fresh such complaint from a group of Amazon vendors recently. Being an Indian company, no such restrictions apply to Reliance’s grocery stores, supermarkets, or JioMart, Ambani’s vision of virtually connecting 30 million neighborhood shops with his telecom customers.Although still untested, the latter is his edge. The bulk of the 20-fold growth that India’s online grocery sales might witness over the next five years may go to the Jio-Facebook partnership, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates. The advantage for Ambani could also carry over to higher-margin items, the same way as Costco Wholesale Corp.’s popular $4.99 rotisserie chicken helps the American retailer sell a little more of everything from apparel to flat-screen TVs. Covid-19 has been a shot in the arm for Reliance, despite retail Ebitda of only $145 million in the June quarter, a 47% drop from last year. The carnage from a nationwide lockdown allowed it to swoop on debt-strapped rival Future Group’s retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units, acquiring the lot for just $3.4 billion. More importantly, the prospect of getting stuck with sub-5% growth in the post-pandemic economy is making Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government reliant on an increasingly small number of domestic groups to pull India out of its tight spot. Unlike China, India’s billion-plus consumer market has been open to U.S. tech firms. But when Ambani requested Modi last year to end “data colonization” by global corporations, it became clear that a shift was coming. Any remaining doubts have been removed by the post-Covid surge of economic nationalism. Where does that leave Silicon Valley and Wall Street? With U.S.-China relations deteriorating — most recently over the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy — both need an alternative. In a billion-plus consumer market, even a $2 business holds the promise of future riches, and Reliance is demonstrating that it has more than one such opportunity. To get into bed with Facebook, Google, and possibly even Amazon at the same time takes some chutzpah, though. Chalk it up to Ambani’s dominance of the market. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-09-14,"This is among our most important themes for 2020, and stretches across industries. We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are delivering three important signals amid all the recent market volatility:  1) the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively. This third factor is especially important as the pandemic upends the nation's recent record of long-term economic growth.  Here are 13 stocks that meet our double-digit dividend test and are on the Argus BUY List.

2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the few bright spots in a very challenging year has been the monthly emails from my budgeting app showing huge declines in my spending. I can’t take much credit for the drops, given all the Covid-19 restrictions and risks that have prevented my family from spending at usual capacity. But still, it’s nice to see something moving in the right direction.The app says we’ve been saving between $2,000 to $3,500 each month since March. And compared to the same period in 2019, our credit-card balances are down 25% to 30%, led by a complete halt in travel, dining out and my thrice-annual hair-color appointments. This echoes some of the broader spending trends in the U.S. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, categories like clothing, recreation and food services experienced rapid declines in the second quarter of 2020, compared with previous quarters. Some of these pandemic spending habits are here to stay, at least for a while. I estimate that my new lifestyle can save me about $10,000 a year at no cost to my overall fulfillment. Instead, it can open my bank account up to the things 2020 has led me discover matter more.Self-care and grooming. I’m not giving up on myself, but I don’t need all the pricey wellness stuff that Instagrammers have been telling me is essential. You know what is actually essential? Sleep, water and staying off social media.  That said, I did pay over $100 for a fancy haircut in August, for which I drove into Manhattan. It was my first chop in seven months, and I immediately felt revived. My gray roots, however, can wait. And they can be handled by a $29 at-home coloring kit in lieu of the $200 salon appointment. I tried the DIY kit once, deemed it a success and now I’m hooked. Manicures ($80 per month) will also make a comeback, but they’ll be far more seldom. And as we became more cost-conscious in the pandemic, I learned by trial that the Target-brand face scrub ($4) can be just as effective as the fancy stuff ($24). Estimated annual savings: $1,400Fancy food brands. I do far more food shopping now than before the pandemic, and it’s taught me how to get the most bang for my buck while still eating healthily. Besides joining Costco, the key is to opt for cheaper store-label brands whenever possible. Sales of private-label goods, according to Nielsen, jumped 29% since March -- ahead of regular-branded product sales, which grew by 24%. I figure I save anywhere from $30 to $40 per week by avoiding higher-end brands.Estimated annual savings: $1,500Fast fashion. With nowhere super exciting to go these days, my closet has remained the same since March. Once the world reopens for good, I’ll be more inclined to buy a new blazer or colorful dress. But “fast fashion” clothing from the likes of Zara and H&M will no longer be my go-to picks. I’ve realized that a closet full of clothing is useless. Instead, I plan to invest more in a high-quality, capsule wardrobe – one that’s heavy on the tops. Spending more on individual items today can mean saving more money in the long run.Estimated annual savings: $250Weeknight take-out. In June 2020, restaurants accounted for 1.2% of our overall credit card statement, compared with almost 8% the year prior, when we ate out (or ordered in) some five nights per week. That’s hundreds of dollars in savings per month that we don’t miss. Is it easier to order a meal online and have it delivered to your door? Sure. But after being more or less forced to cook these past several months, I’ve discovered some joys in the ritual. I love watching my kids watch us prepare dinner. They gather around the counter, building up their appetites, asking “What are you making?” and “Can I help?” I love when the smells of roasted garlic and spices fill up our house, reminiscent of when I was growing up.  We’re creating great memories and I now can’t imagine going back to the old ways of eating.Estimated annual savings: $5,000$30 workout classes. Old Farnoosh would blindly drop $300 a month on fancy fitness classes such as cardio boxing and barre, but in the past six months, I’ve paid for all but one outdoor workout class due to studio closures. Instead, I’ve practiced better eating, done some home workouts and started to run more, all which have led to similar results. I do miss barre class, though, which can’t quite be replicated at home. So, I’ll probably go back to attending a handful of those every month in person.Estimated annual savings: $1,800I’m sure that once the world resumes a greater level of normalcy, we’ll revert to our old spending habits. I, for one, can’t wait to travel somewhere other than the supermarket. But the recession has undoubtedly taught me some big lessons about what I care about and what I can manage on my own.  This past month, for example, I replaced my 2011 Macbook with the newest model because working from home all day required it. I’ve learned not to wait so long to invest in tech, especially for work. I also paid more for higher-end cookware this summer, making meal prep more enjoyable. Finally, our charitable giving is up in 2020, as the year’s made it abundantly clear that with some easy trade-offs, we have more room to give.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Farnoosh Torabi is a financial journalist, author and host of the &quot;So Money&quot; podcast.

Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors.

2020-09-24,"ISSAQUAH, Wash., Sept. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today announced its operating results for the 16-week fourth quarter and the 52-week fiscal year, ended August 30, 2020.  Net sales for the quarter increased 12.5 percent, to $52.28 billion from $46.45 billion last year. Net sales for the fiscal year increased 9.3 percent, to $163.22 billion from $149.35 billion last year.Comparable sales for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year were as follows:                16 Weeks 16 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks        Adjusted*   Adjusted*    U.S. 11.0% 13.6% 8.1% 9.2%    Canada 9.1% 12.6% 5.0% 7.4%    Other International 16.1% 18.8% 8.9% 11.2%                 Total Company 11.4% 14.1% 7.7% 9.2%                 E-commerce 90.6% 91.3% 49.5% 50.1%                  *Excluding the impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange.Net income for the fourth quarter was $1.389 billion, or $3.13 per diluted share, compared to $1.097 billion, or $2.47 per diluted share last year. This year’s fourth quarter was negatively impacted by incremental expense related to COVID-19 premium wages and sanitation costs of $281 million pretax ($0.47 per diluted share) and a $36 million pretax charge ($0.06 per diluted share) related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt. These items were partially offset by an $84 million pretax benefit ($0.15 per diluted share) for the partial reversal of a reserve of $123 million pretax ($0.22 cents per diluted share), related to a product tax assessment taken in the fourth quarter of last year.Net income for the fiscal year was $4.00 billion, or $9.02 per diluted share, compared to $3.66 billion, or $8.26 per diluted share in the prior year.Costco currently operates 795 warehouses, including 552 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 101 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom, 27 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France, and China. Costco also operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.A conference call to discuss these results is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. (PT) today, September 24, 2020, and is available via a webcast on www.costco.com (click on Investor Relations and “Play Webcast”).Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

2020-09-25,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) reported a top-and-bottom line beat in the fourth quarter, but shares moved lower following the earnings release Thursday afternoon.Here's how the Street reacted. The Costco Analysts: BofA Securities analyst Robert Ohmes maintained a Buy rating on Costco with a $400 price target.Wells Fargo analyst Edward Kelly maintained an Equal Weight rating with an unchanged $320 price target.MKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk maintained a Neutral rating with a price target lifted from $320 to $325.BMO Capital Markets analyst Kelly Bania maintained an Outperform rating with a price target lifted from $340 to $385.BofA On Costco's Q4 Print: Costco reported earnings per share of $3.13 versus the Street's estimate of $2.85, Ohmes said in a note. Same-store sales were higher by 13.6% in the U.S. excluding fuel, and 14.1% higher when factoring in foreign exchange and fuel, the analyst said. Ticket growth in the quarter was 12.7%, while traffic comps improved to negative 1.2% for the total company and positive 1.2% in the U.S., he said.Online comps accelerated from the prior quarter to 91.3%.Costco said it is benefiting from in-home and solitary leisure categories, as members are substituting money previously budgeted for vacations toward furniture, exercise equipment and more, Ohmes said.Membership renewal rates were also high in the quarter and likely trending near all-time highs, according to BofA. Wells Fargo Says Costco Outperforming High Bar: Costco reported a fourth-quarter beat despite being up against a high bar, Kelly said in a note.The report signals Costco is &quot;clearly&quot; executing well in a difficult environment and winning market share, the analyst said.View more earnings on COSTThere is reason to believe the momentum carried over into the new fiscal quarter, he said. The COVID-19 pandemic is weighing on the company's financial results -- especially a $2-per-hour wage increase -- and management continued to push back against expanding its omni-channel capabilities, such as online purchases with in-store pickup, Kelly said. A &quot;more modest&quot; membership growth in the quarter from $1.05 billion to $1.106 billion suggests the pandemic-induced sales growth may not sustain in the future.Costco remains an &quot;outstanding company,&quot; but at 36 times EPS in the next 12 months, it is &quot;difficult to justify&quot; buying the stock at today's price, according to Wells Fargo. MKM Sees Different Costco Story Vs. 2000s: Costco is a best-in-class operator and considered the best warehouse club concept, Kirk said in a note.Yet the club membership segment isn't enjoying the same level of growth it did in the early 2000s, the analyst said. Rivals are notably increasing their promotional activity to attract new members, and Costco fought back through &quot;outsized&quot; promotional membership offers in August, he said. Foot traffic trends point to Costco underperforming its peers since the start of the pandemic, Kirk said. Costco's stock is also trading at all-time high multiples at around 40 times NTM and 22 times EV/NTM EBITDA, the analyst said, adding that it's difficult to imagine how the stock can continue re-rating higher. BMO On Where Costco Stands Out: Costco stands out from other retailers, as around 60% to 65% of total EBIT comes from membership fees, Bania said in a note.Costco's earnings are &quot;more steady&quot; compared to its rivals, especially ahead of continued retail closures, the analyst said. Costco also deserves credit for rising executive membership penetration and a competitively advantaged online business, he said.

2020-09-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Most years, the end of the retail industry’s sales calendar is defined by a tidy succession of seasonal events: back-to-school, Halloween and Christmas. With the pandemic, this isn’t an ordinary year. The result? Those shopping rituals are poised to converge into a super season of sorts in October, creating a tricky balancing act that is bound to trip up some retailers.  Back-to-school shopping usually crests in August, but it got off to a slow start this year amid uncertainty around whether learning would be virtual or in-person. Accordingly, chains including Target Corp., Gap Inc., Macy’s Inc. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. have said they expect an elongated season for buying these goods, perhaps stretching into October. That means they’ll need to continue keeping ample inventories of lunchboxes, backpacks and fall clothing even as shoppers begin to look for costumes, candy and decor ahead of Halloween. Adding to the mix, the industry is preparing for an unusually early start to Christmas shopping, on the theory that people will want to get a jump on their gift-buying — or can be persuaded to do so — to avoid being shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow shoppers in December. So chains such as Target and Kohl’s Corp. have decided to begin their holiday deals in, you guessed it, October.And there’s more. In the middle of the weird blurring of seasons, Amazon.com Inc. is set to hold its annual Prime Day deals bonanza.  The event, usually held in July, was postponed as the e-commerce giant adjusted to an onslaught of pandemic-related demand. Amazon announced on Monday that it will kick off the sale on Oct. 13. Retailers recently have sought to piggyback on Amazon’s mega-sale with discount blitzes of their own. But given that the timing of this year’s sale had been up in the air for so long, rivals haven’t had much ability to plan around it. They’ll need to scramble now. (Target, for one, has already announced its own “deal days” starting Oct. 13.)All of this makes for a merchandising and marketing nightmare. Do you deck out your mannequins in first-day-of-school outfits or jack-o’-lantern pajamas? Do you give prominent shelf space to pumpkin-spice treats or gingerbread cookies? Do you offer deep discounts on desk supplies or Christmas cards?It’s not just that these shopping events are colliding, it’s that consumers will be approaching them differently this year. Halloween spending is expected to drop to $8.05 billion from $8.78 billion last year, according to the National Retail Federation, as fewer people attend parties or trick-or-treat. Retailers have tried to adapt, with Costco Wholesale Corp., for example, saying it is carrying only about 80% to 90% as many Halloween costumes as last year. Meanwhile, Children’s Place Inc. reduced orders for dressy kids’ clothes for the fourth quarter, assuming they won’t be hot items amid a dearth of big holiday get-togethers. Even as many retailers gird for an early start to the holiday gift-buying season, there’s a fair chance the opposite happens. With so many Americans out of work, and uncertainty about how safe a large gathering will feel in December, I see good reason to delay holiday shopping, much as people have done with back-to-school spending. That, too, could throw off retailers’ game plans for October and the rest of the year. If Santa really does get to work in October and sales start to take off then, industry watchers will find it difficult to even assess how this year’s gifting spree compares to expectations or to results in previous seasons. Deloitte’s 2020 holiday forecast, which calls for modest growth, is for the November through January period.Retailers can take some comfort in the fact that consumers still appear hesitant to spend money on traveling and have few options for buying items such as sports tickets, leaving room in their budgets to spend at stores. Still, October is shaping up to be an unusually messy month, one that is bound to leave many in the industry with too much or too little inventory and frustrated customers. The ones that do best will likely be those who initially bought merchandise conservatively but then positioned themselves to make “chase” orders in season once they see what is actually selling — and when. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

However, there are a few rules that can help identify stocks to buy for beginners, and help new investors make overall smart choices.
These rules include “buy what you know” — or pick stocks of companies you understand. Choosing stocks of companies that have “strong fundamentals,” or solid balance sheets, is another rule. And, of course, “diversifying your investments,” or making sure that you don’t put all your eggs in one stock, is also an axiom to live by.


					7 Innovative Stocks Pushing Our World Ahead				

Here we look at seven excellent stocks to buy for beginners;:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Apple (NASDAQ:APPL)
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B)
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)
Costco (NASDAQ:COST)
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)
FedEx (NYSE:FDX)

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: Amazon (AMZN)

Online retail giant Amazon ticks all the boxes when it comes to investing rules. The company is a well-known brand that people understand and use in their daily lives — ordering everything from toilet paper to television sets online. The company has a solid balance sheet and is super profitable. And Amazon is an increasingly diverse company, branching out into everything from artificial intelligence to the streaming of movies and TV shows. Brands include Amazon Web Services, Whole Foods Market and Prime Video, to name a few.
The stock is not cheap by any means. At more than $3,000 a share, it is the most expensive security on this list. Nevertheless, AMZN is a solid growth stock for beginner investors.
Recently, Amazon has been expanding into cloud computing and focusing on developing its own content to compete in the streaming wars against the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu. But its bread-and-butter e-commerce business continues to go gangbusters and has gotten a boost during the pandemic as more people order goods online.
AMZN stock has essentially doubled from its March lows to $3,220 a share today. Again, not cheap, but definitely worth the price to add powerful growth to a portfolio.

Apple (APPL)

There is no bigger name in consumer technology than Apple. The company co-founded by Steve Jobs out of a garage in the 1970s has been responsible for many of the biggest consumer tech products developed over the past 45 years — from the Apple II and Macintosh computers to the iPod and iPhone. All investors are familiar with Apple and its highly visible products.
The company has a strong balance sheet and rock-solid business model. It also has a competitive advantage in most of the markets in which it has a presence, having effectively developed its own technological ecosystem with iPads and Apple Watches.
Not content to rest on its laurels, Apple is always pushing into new frontiers. Most recently, the company has focused on offering new services through products such as Apple Pay and Apple TV. These new products and services are increasing its cash flow and broadening the Apple brand. Streaming content through the subscription Apple TV+ service is another way that the company is diversifying its business.
AAPL stock has doubled from its March low and the company recently undertook a 4-for-1 stock split that now has its shares priced at $115 each. This makes them more affordable and attractive to individual retail investors. This is a stock that people can buy, hold and retire on.

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)

Investors are in trusted hands with Berkshire Hathaway. In fact, you’re in the hands of the most successful investor in history — Warren Buffett. And his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns a lot of different businesses and investments, from being the largest shareholder of Apple to owning the GEICO insurance company. Berkshire Hathaway has an impeccable track record of making smart acquisitions and investments.
Buffett’s buy-and-hold investment strategy has also proven to be unmatched in terms of its success. From 2008 to 2018, the company saw cumulative growth of 119.7%, compared to 73.2% growth for the S&P 500. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway has what is often called a “fortress balance sheet” that includes more than $120 billion in cash. The huge pile of cash allows the company to provide financing to other distressed companies at extremely favorable terms. While the company’s class A stock trades at $323,000 a share, new investors can purchase the company’s class B shares for $215 per share.
For new investors who may be uncertain of which stocks to buy, they can rest easy putting money into Berkshire Hathaway.

Procter & Gamble (PG)

In addition to profits, investors can also earn dividend payments from the stocks they hold in their portfolio. And one of the most stable and best paying dividend stocks is consumer goods company Procter & Gamble. Commonly known by the acronym P&G, the company has a strong track record of delivering exceptional dividends to shareholders.
In 2020, for example, Procter & Gamble raised its dividend for the 64th consecutive year, and this year marked the 130th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend since incorporating way back in 1890. As of October 2020, P&G’s annual dividend payment is $3.16 a share for a dividend yield of 2.29%.
Another good reasons to buy PG stock is its many well-known consumer products ranging from Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent to Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste. Sales have gotten a boost during the pandemic as people have stocked up on essentials while sheltering in place at home. PG stock has risen 43% since the market crash in March and now trades at $140 a share.

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: Costco (COST)

Grocery retailer Costco is a simple but powerful business that is familiar to most Americans. The company’s warehouse setting and wholesale pricing have revolutionized the retail sector and changed the way people shop and consume food.
While its approach has been replicated, Costco retains a competitive edge and commands huge brand loyalty among consumers. These facts make the company a worthwhile investment, especially beginners who want a stock they know and understand.
Like other companies on this list, Costco has seen a bump in sales during the Covid-19 pandemic as people spend more to stock up on food and other essentials. In addition, Costco has been growing its online sales. E-commerce sales nearly doubled, rising 90% in the quarter ended Aug. 30. Online sales represent a huge and growing source of revenue for the retailer. That said, Costco continues to open brick-and-mortar stores, planning to open nine new locations by the end of 2020 — six in the U.S. and three in Canada.
Costco stock has increased 500% since 2010 and is up roughly 40% from its March low to $367.

McDonald’s (MCD)

The Golden Arches is a good investment in good times and bad. Despite intense competition, McDonald’s remains the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain with nearly 40,000 locations in 100 countries. And while the company’s dine-in restaurants closed during the pandemic, its drive-thru windows remained open, helping to keep revenue buoyant.
The company also continues to experiment with its menu and change things up with the food and beverage offerings. McDonald’s café that serves a variety of coffees, cookies and muffins has proven to be a hit with the public.
MCD stock has been on an uptrend recently following an analyst upgrade by Bank of America, which raised its 12-month price target on the stock to $250 a share. McDonald’s stock currently trades at $225 a share and has increased 64% since its March bottom.
Going forward, McDonald’s has a new CEO and is testing out delivery services and plant-based burgers. This is a company and stock that is both familiar and innovative, giving it plenty of growth potential for investors.

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: FedEx (FDX)
Source: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com

	
You can count on Federal Express, and not just to deliver packages to your house or business. The company also delivers for shareholders. FDX stock has been a major outperformer in recent months, more than doubling since March when shares were trading at $90. Today, the stock is changing hands for $271 per share.
The reality is that the Covid-19 pandemic has been a massive accelerator for the private delivery company as people and businesses order and ship a growing number of products. The company’s most recent quarterly results handily beat analysts’ expectations.
Moving through the final quarter of the year, FedEx expects to see a further boost to its business during the busy holiday shopping season as people avoid malls in favor of ordering gifts online. Indeed, demand shows no signs of slowing down and FedEx is successfully fending off competition from rivals such as Amazon. For beginner investors, FDX is a solid blue-chip stock with enormous growth potential. The company is also a trusted and established brand that does one thing and does it extremely well — deliveries.
On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL, BRK.B, BAC, MCD and FDX.

2020-10-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This is one of a series of interviews by Bloomberg Opinion columnists on how to solve today’s most pressing policy challenges. This conversation has been edited and condensed. Sarah Green Carmichael: Over the past 40 years, incomes for the top 0.01% have soared and everyone else has really only gotten a modest raise, or none at all. Over that same time, industries have also gotten more concentrated, with a handful of firms now capturing the majority of profits. Your new book is called “When More Is Not Better: Overcoming America’s Obsession with Economic Efficiency.” As someone who majored in economics at Harvard, got an MBA from Harvard Business School, served as a professor of strategy and also was the dean at the Rotman School of Management, what do you see happening here?Roger Martin: In economics, you learn that one of the fundamentals of a developed economy is a big, prosperous middle class. It has the most people and it’s the heart of the economy. And in business, you learn that there’s a whole bunch of competitors, and they all are duking it out in something called an industry. There are some going out of business, because they’re doing badly, and there are some that are doing better than others. And so we’re surprised when we see that the rich are getting richer, richer, richer, richer and richer, like they’ve never gotten before. And those middle-class people are stagnating. And then in industries, we might see the winner take all while other companies are either just hanging on, or are in the process of going out of business. The economy has accidentally produced these very Pareto outcomes rather than having outcomes that are more distributed.SGC: In your book, you say that companies and policy makers have become consumed with the idea that the economy can be “made ever more perfect by pursuing increasing levels of efficiency” —  things like shorter customer call times, fewer retail employees per square foot, the cheapest possible procurement costs, or mergers and corporate consolidation. If an efficient machine is the wrong metaphor for the system that we want, what is a better metaphor for understanding how the system really does work?RM: I think the best metaphor is a complex adaptive system. We’ve set up the economy for Amazon, and we should set it up for the Amazon. Amazon is a big machine, the Amazon is a complex adaptive system.First, it’s a system, so the pieces of the puzzle connect and influence one another. It’s complex in that it’s really hard to tell in advance what exactly affects what. And lastly, and maybe most importantly, it’s adaptive. So whatever state it’s in, it optimizes to that state. Think about the jungle — if there’s a little tree growing behind a big tree, it’s going to grow sideways to get out from the out from the shadow of the big tree. Or if there are predators in this part of the rain forest, you will go scurrying over to that part.So what does that mean? It means that if you’re if you’re a Nobel economist, you can say, “Well, if we increased money supply by 2.8%, we’ll get this much GDP growth.” Chances are, you’re just going to be wrong. Because you don’t actually know what’s going to happen. The other implication is that adaptivity has got every chance of overwhelming whatever you tried. People will say, “Ah, I know how to exploit that. And I’m going to start behaving differently.”So we have all these machinists pulling levers and hoping that things will happen the way they want, but it doesn’t happen the way they want. People just adapt to it and game the system for their own purposes, and that has all contributed to having outcomes that that almost nobody wants.SGC: You express concern for the future of democratic capitalism in the book. At the same time, the middle-class people that you spoke with as part of the research said they were completely politically disengaged. How does someone go from total disengagement to then wielding a pitchfork?RM: Yeah, well, you don’t need many people wielding pitchforks to make a revolution. You just need acquiescence. Or even people just saying, “Well, maybe this is worth a try.” I started this project in 2013, before Bernie Sanders was a national figure. He was a senator, but not really a national figure. And that was before you had 40% of under-25-year-olds thinking socialism would be pretty good.SGC: You argue that we do need to strive to make our system more resilient, “so that over time it can adjust to its changing context in ways that allow it to continue functioning and delivering its desired benefits.” But to get there, I’ve noticed that you don’t prefer a grand solution. You prefer many small solutions instead. Why take that approach?RM: Well, it’s not so much a preference. It’s that I don’t believe that any grand solution would work. And that’s again because it’s a complex system. I think anybody thinking that they have the answer is delusional. And if you take small steps, you can avoid taking a step that’s accidentally horrible.Isn’t that how you live your daily life? You don’t say, “I’m feeling tired, why don’t I sleep for five days?” You say, “I’m gonna go to bed an hour earlier and see if I wake up feeling better.” Because we are a complex adaptive system.SGC:  For a business, this is a very difficult time to resist cost-cutting or become less efficient. The pressures on managers to be more efficient are very real. And it seems like it would be very difficult to resist those pressures.RM: First, I don't say that efficiency is bad. I say the obsessive pursuit of it, with no attention to resilience, is going to kill you. Just keep that in mind that there's a certain amount of resilience that that you need. And if your top line has dropped by half, right, it’s not actually pursuit of efficiency to lay off half your staff. You're no more efficient than you were when your business was 2x, right? That's not increased efficiency. That's just being non-stupid.SGC: What about the public sector? Given all that Congress seems to not be able to get done, how realistic is reform?RM: Politics is an industry, just like any other. It happens to be a duopoly in the U.S. And right now, I would say it is managing for efficiency and not resilience. It’s managing its own business —  the business of politics, not the country. “How can we gerrymander to make sure that we have no elections that matter?” And they’re getting lower and lower ratings from the electorate. They’re asking, “What makes my life efficient?” Not, “What makes this institution resilient for the long run?”If they were worried about [resilience], they’d say there’s certain amount of friction we should put in it. We should not gerrymander, we should actually have real elections so we actually have to compete for votes. It is conceivable to me that it has to kind of crash and burn as an institution before we get to the other side.SGC: When you think about a more resilient, less efficient economy, what does it look like? What does success look like?RM: So it’s not less efficient — I’m just asking for balance. There’s a difference between efficiency and the pursuit of efficiency. Aristotle said that if a person sets out in life to be happy, they’re unlikely to end up happy. But if a person sets out to live a good life — by which he meant a life of servitude to their society and their fellow citizens —  they’re likely to end up happy.I would say the same about shareholder value. Pursuing shareholder value does not increase the probability that you will increase shareholder value. In fact, it makes the job harder. It makes customers say, “Oh, so we don’t matter?” It makes employees say, “So that’s what I roll out of bed every morning to do?” So I would say, the pursuit of efficiency without resilience ends up being kind of self-defeating, and ends up being very short term. You get a burst of what feels like efficiency that becomes inefficient.SGC: Can you give an example?RM: If you’re McDonald’s, you spend a decade or more making your Big Macs a little smaller and a little smaller until “Big Mac” is misleading advertising. But you’re getting more efficient all the way. And then you notice this broader thing happening, which is people not showing up in your restaurants.On the other hand, Costco is grotesquely inefficient. If you think about it in a really narrow sense, they pay everybody more than they would have to pay. The quality of their meats is more than would be necessary to compete with the Kroger’s across the street. But their sales per square foot are five times the competitor across the street. And when’s the last time you’ve seen a Costco ad on TV? Never. Because people are desperate to go to Costco and buy more stuff than they ever thought they were going to.SGC: What’s the bottom line? What are the hallmarks of an economy that would be more resilient, rather than this sort of fragile, ostensibly efficient economy we have now?RM: A resilient one would be able to handle shocks, and would be able to adjust in a more continuous way. A resilient economy would have people saying, “This isn’t really working the way we thought, and it hasn’t blown up yet. But since it’s not working the way we thought, we should tweak it.” That’s what a resilient one would look like — just constantly, continuously tweaking and managing it.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Green Carmichael is an editor with Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-10-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will invest about $3.6 billion to double its stake in Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., taking control of China’s largest chain of hypermarts to try and fend off rivals like JD.com Inc. in e-commerce’s hottest growth arena.Alibaba will raise its direct and indirect stake in the grocery chain to about 72% by acquiring equity from Auchan Retail International SA, then make a general offer to shareholders to buy out the rest of Sun Art. The latter’s Hong Kong-listed stock leapt as much as 30% Monday, its biggest intraday gain since 2011. Alibaba gained as much as 1.8% to touch an intraday record.The deal signals the intention of Asia’s most valuable corporation to accelerate an effort to dominate one of Chinese e-commerce’s largest untapped frontiers. Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang has made expansion into physical retail and the grocery business in particular a cornerstone of his growth strategy, an effort that paid off during the coronavirus pandemic. Sun Art already operates hundreds of hypermarkets across China under the Auchan and RT-Mart brands, a massive distribution and storage network that can supplement Alibaba’s own efforts in fresh produce.The Chinese e-commerce giant is now grappling with intensifying competition from the likes of JD, food delivery giant Meituan Dianping and startups such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed Missfresh, all chasing a market for groceries and fresh produce that HSBC expects to grow 2.5 times to 690 billion yuan ($103 billion) by 2022 from 2019. Alibaba was among the pioneers in that arena, announcing in 2017 it would spend about $2.9 billion for a 36% stake of Sun Art.The deal “suggests that the tech giant seeks to further expand its one-hour home grocery delivery services such as Taoxianda, leveraging the grocer’s extensive offline hypermarts across China,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kevin Kim said. “This could capture consumers flocking to online platforms, further induced by Covid-19 early this year, yet may hurt foot-traffic to the grocer’s physical stores.”Read more: Alibaba Touts Post-Virus Rebound While Watching ‘Fluid’ U.S.Read more: New Alibaba Chief Explains Why He Wants to Kill His Own BusinessZhang has been directly involved in the expansion into what the company calls its “new retail” strategy, combining e-commerce with physical stores. He helped launch a startup called Freshippo within Alibaba that aimed to combine a grocery store, a restaurant and a delivery app, a business that’s underpinned an overall new retail division that’s grown into a $12 billion operation, contributing a fifth of total revenue in the June quarter.As Alibaba increases its stake to a majority, Sun Art’s financial statements will be consolidated into the larger company’s. Peter Huang, Sun Art’s CEO, will add the title of chairman for the business.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s $3.6 billion investment to raise its stake in Sun Art to 72% from the 36% acquired in 2017 signals the company’s intention to strategically ramp up its supermarket retail services. The acquisition should boost its Taoxianda and Tmall Supermarket and help compete against JD.com, Meituan and Pinduoduo, which are also aggressively trying to push into fresh produce e-commerce.\- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.The online groceries segment has leapt to the forefront during Covid-19 when shoppers shunned restaurants and physical stores, though the industry -- which requires more complex logistical structures such as so-called cold chain storage -- has proven difficult to crack in years past.Alibaba’s initial moves into physical retail were closely followed by WeChat-operator Tencent, which has itself invested in brick-and-mortar chains such as Yonghui Superstores Co. JD now also operates its own thriving groceries business, while Meituan and up-and-comer Pinduoduo Inc. in recent years began investing aggressively in the arena.Sun Art is the industry leader in China’s hypermarkets, operating giant Costco- and Walmart-style stores that sell everything from seafood to wine and furniture under one roof. It held 14% of the market share in 2019, according to global intelligence firm Euromonitor International. Alibaba has also invested in many other brick-and-mortar retailers including Shanghai-listed Sanjiang Shopping Club Co., Shenzhen-listed New Huadu Supercenter Co., and Hong Kong-listed Lianhua Supermarket Holdings Co.Meanwhile, France’s Auchan has become the latest in a slew of foreign retailers to step back from China after struggling in the market. Last year, Carrefour SA sold an 80% stake in its China unit at a discount while German wholesaler Metro AG sold a majority stake in its operations there.Big box offerings are faring better. Costco Wholesale Corp. opened its first outlet in China last year to frenzied crowds and is planning its third store. Walmart Inc. plans to quadruple the number of its members-only warehouse chain Sam’s Club in China to 100 stores over the next eight years, as growth outpaces the company’s separate network of over 400 Walmart stores selling basic groceries.(Updates with Sun Art’s market share in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Takes Over China’s Top Hypermart Chain for $3.6 Billion

2020-11-13,"Snowflakes. Soy boys. And other pejoratives, many of which are unrepeatable in polite company. These are some of the lesser grievances that liberals have had to endure during the four years of the Trump administration. Barring unlikely and bizarre circumstances, President-elect Joe Biden will take over the White House, leading to much joy among the left. In this exuberance, it’s tempting to configure your long-term stocks to buy based on the election results.
However, that would not be the wisest course of action. Don’t get me wrong — the transition to Democrats taking control of the executive office is wildly significant. As CNN reported, Biden plans to issue executive actions that will undo outgoing President Trump’s policies. Among them, controversial issues such as immigration reform will be top on the list. With such promised large-scale changes, of course it will have an impact on long-term stocks.
But it’s important to not get myopic. Although you might want to direct your long-term stocks toward companies that will largely benefit from Democratic rule and avoid those that perform better under Republican stewardship, Biden probably won’t have full control of government. Even if he did, the Democrats can’t afford to alienate Americans who did not vote for the former Vice President.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
To be fair to Trump’s non-stop accusations of voter fraud, the electoral race was tight. Despite the federal government’s poor handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Trump still won over several million voters across all demographics, largely due to his economic policy strengths.


					7 Retail Stocks That Will Benefit From 2020’s Holiday Shopping Season				

So, don’t buy into exclusively politically motivated narratives. Instead, for strategic portfolio allocation, consider companies that will do well irrespective of who’s in office. Based on large secular trends, these long-term stocks to buy should have an extended pathway to profitability.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Disney (NYSE:DIS)
Costco (NASDAQ:COST)
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)
Ford (NYSE:F)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP)
Finally, a word of advice that’s not financially related. Nothing is as bad as it seems nor is it as great as it seems. Besides, if Biden wants to make his stay in the White House last longer than four years, he’s got some compromising to do. Therefore, approach these long-term stocks to buy agnostically.

Long-Term Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)

Under ordinary circumstances, the concept of Amazon being a leading candidate among long-term stocks to buy is almost sacrosanct. For one thing, you can look at the incredible resilience of AMZN stock over the years. Despite many bumps and bruises, against all manners of accusations of antitrust behaviors, the e-commerce giant has continued to forge ahead. It’s the disrupter that is often the bane of small businesses, yet it’s our disrupter.
Recently, though, Amazon’s status as the pinnacle of capitalistic success has put it in hot water. Sure, the company’s CEO Jeff Bezos may have clashed with President Trump. It’s no secret who Bezos supports. But just because Biden is in office doesn’t mean it’s clear skies ahead for AMZN stock. No, Biden must answer to the Democrats. Traditionally, the left has championed workers’ causes, including unionization, which isn’t favorable to Amazon.com.
So, does that mean investors should axe Amazon from their list of long-term stocks to buy? Not at all. Indeed, when you look at the growing prominence of e-commerce, Amazon plays a pivotal role. No matter who’s calling the shots, AMZN will remain a force to be reckoned with.

Disney (DIS)

Although the cruise ship and airliner industries arguably represent the face of suffering from the novel coronavirus, Disney has been one of the most deeply impacted names among long-term stocks. After all, people travel from all over the world to attend its vast theme park empire. In addition, the disruption to Hollywood hurt Disney’s pocket badly, making DIS stock a questionable investment.
Therefore, it’s no surprise that encouraging developments from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) on the coronavirus vaccine front gave the Magic Kingdom a much-needed boost. Should a vaccine provide a viable solution, high-contact businesses could once again flourish, particularly from pent-up demand. Further, the return of theme parks is going to be vital for many local economies as Disney was forced to lay off tens of thousands of employees.
But should the coronavirus worsen — or an even scarier proposition, another pandemic arises in the near future — Disney has unlocked the key to its potential success. From the company’s Star Wars franchise was derived The Mandalorian, which has been a runaway success. But not many lay observers know that the production team filmed half the scenes in an ultra-advanced semicircular LED-based studio, which allows for real-time visualization that’s far superior to greenscreen technology.


					7 Battery Stocks That Hold the Keys to Next-Gen Innovations				

In addition to the actors’ benefit, this LED system allows Disney to film in its own cocoon, sheltered from the outside world. That means the company can produce content even during a severe pandemic, which is a huge catalyst for DIS stock.

Costco (COST)

During the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans rushed to their local Costco stores to pile up on the essentials. Cynically, the demand was great for the warehouse retailer on one hand because the company experienced Black Friday-like crowds every day. Of course, not all Costco members abided by the mitigation protocols, which made for interesting viewing on social media.
Now, the U.S. is again making Covid-19-related headlines for all the wrong reasons. Recently, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that on Nov. 6, new daily infections hit just under 133,000 cases. At time of writing, the seven-day moving average has breached the 100,000 case level. That is simply wild, which suggests that we could see greater demand for COST stock.
However, I’m not interested in Costco simply as a play on the pandemic. While the numbers look bad, there is an argument to be made that people are getting used to the crisis. Further, with Biden at the White House, it’s possible that more folks will take the health crisis seriously.
No, my interest in COST stock is that the underlying company caters to the well off. If we have a K-shaped recovery, this is one of the names that should belong in your list of long-term stocks to buy.

PayPal (PYPL)

Another company among long-term stocks that has direct exposure to the Covid-19 pandemic, PayPal has seen its profile rise as people added one more reason to avoid cash: potentially, handling physical money could result in higher risk for coronavirus transmission. To be clear, we don’t know precisely how long the coronavirus sticks to surfaces such as paper money.
However, this is more of a common-sense approach. Cash is germ friendly so unless we’re Scrooge McDuck, we shouldn’t be handling it too often. Still, this is just a one-dimensional factor for PYPL stock.
I say this because whether we’re dealing with a pandemic or not, society is increasingly becoming cashless. Sure, there is the odd cash-only business that is still viable, such as your neighborhood pizzeria. But with digitalization comes multiple contactless payment options. At a certain point, you’d imagine that such business luddites will eventually go out of business if they don’t adapt.


					10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in November Under $10				

Further, PYPL stock is a compelling opportunity because of how the underlying company addresses the unbanked and underbanked communities. Lack of access to the financial system is a detriment to our connected ecosystem. Thus, PayPal is doing some social good by helping to even the playing field.

Ford (F)

Prior to the election when the opinion polls showed Biden having a consistent lead over President Trump, many investors had the same idea regarding long-term stocks to buy: pivot to companies that have strong clean energy implications. For many, that meant piling into electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). To be sure, TSLA has absolutely dominated the markets. But in my view, this dominance also leaves the door open for Ford.
True, American car companies have been languishing for years. However, Ford made a strong push to EVs with the Mustang Mach-E. Granted, automotive enthusiasts didn’t care for an SUV wearing the iconic Mustang badge. Still, demographic and consumer trends indicated that two-door pony cars were on their last legs. For F stock, the electric SUV just made business sense.
Over the long run, I believe Ford can capture significant market share from Tesla. After all, Ford is a car company first. They’ve been in the business for a long time and understand what motivates the automotive market. Further, the Ford dealership and service center empire is vast, providing superior support for customers. If you love contrarian thinking, you may want to give F stock a good look.

Nvidia (NVDA)

One of the true no-brainer investments among long-term stocks, Nvidia offers extensive exposure to relevant markets. First and foremost, the company is renowned for its advanced graphics processors, powering some of the most groundbreaking video game systems.
For those that are not familiar with the industry, video games have transitioned from niche consumer segment into a mainstream giant. As the coronavirus disruption demonstrated, games are no longer just for entertainment purposes. For example, racing simulators help Formula 1 drivers acclimate to tracks with which they’re not familiar. That has been even more crucial this year due to global shutdowns of live sporting events.
Additionally, Nvidia powers the future through various artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies. An area of increasing competitiveness is autonomous driving. With so many players, it’s difficult to know which one will emerge victorious. But the underlying platforms will require advanced processors, which should boost demand for NVDA stock.


					7 Penny Stocks That Are Ready to Take Off				

Finally, connectivity solutions will pave the way for smart city infrastructures. Again, Nvidia finds itself as one of the leaders in this space, a market which will likely only grow in importance. Therefore, if you’re not worried about day-to-day price swings, keep NVDA stock in your drawer.

Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)

Joe Biden is hardly what you would call a perfect candidate. Although he has proven himself to be mentally fit, at his age, cobwebs have inevitably developed. And they’ve come out at some inopportune times. For instance, during the second and last presidential debate, President Trump hit him hard on his confused stance on fracking and other environmental issues.
Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, Biden must answer to the Democrats. Consistently, the party has pushed issues such as addressing climate change. Therefore, one of the logical long-term stocks to buy is Brookfield Renewable Partners. Clearly, Biden would not be popular within his own party if he broke rank and decided to go all fossil fuel on everybody.
Not surprisingly, BEP stock has put on a tremendous performance this year, gaining nearly 58% year-to-date. Further, the raging wildfires we suffered this year raises the importance of sustainability, which should bolster Brookfield.
But I don’t see BEP stock as being a catalyst levered exclusively to Democrats. The reality is that younger people care deeply about the environment. Therefore, the next generation of Republican leaders can’t afford to alienate whole swathes of voters. Ultimately, that’s great news for Brookfield and other sustainability oriented companies.

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett is a living, breathing billionaire, but he’s also a leading economic indicator. So after his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. dumped almost $13 billion of stocks in the throes of the Covid-19 crisis, investors were beside themselves. They’ll now be quite relieved to see that his company is back in buying mode, making the biggest outlay for equity purchases in a year.And he’s not just making oddball bets, like Japanese trading houses and, yikes, gold. A filing late Monday showed that in the latest period Berkshire Hathaway bought a handful of U.S. pharmaceutical giants: AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. It also purchased a new stake in T-Mobile US Inc., the wireless carrier with the most enviable spectrum position heading into 5G, and Snowflake Inc., one of the hottest tech IPOs of the year. They’re part of the net $4.8 billion Berkshire spent buying equities during the period; it spent an additional $9 billion buying up its own shares.  The disclosure of Berkshire’s Pfizer holding — valued at $138 million as of Monday’s close — comes a week after the drugmaker announced that its Covid-19 vaccine has been more than 90% effective in preventing cases of the virus. Following up on the good news, Moderna Inc., another company in the Covid-19 vaccine race, said Monday that its formulation was 94.5% effective. Even so, my colleague Max Nisen tells me that Buffett’s pharma bets likely aren’t entirely vaccine-related, as that logic only really works for Pfizer. Instead, Buffett — or one of his investing deputies — probably sees broader value in the pharma space, which had been somewhat beaten down heading into the U.S. election on fears of a “blue wave” that would produce profit-crimping policies. Those fears aren’t quite so intense without Democrats taking control of the Senate, or at least not yet.Berkshire continued its banking purge — further reducing its stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. It also exited a $1.3 billion position in Costco Wholesale Corp., which I guess means Buffett didn’t take my suggestion to outright acquire the retailer for his next “elephant-sized” deal. But shares of Costco have risen 7% to an all-time high since the third quarter ended, and it just declared a whopping $10-a-share special dividend. Buffett is going to be hitting the See’s candies hard tonight!Read more: Buffett's Next Bulk Purchase Should Be Costco: Tara LachapelleBut it sure is good to see the investor, well, investing again. Right before the pandemic hit, Buffett said in a TV interview that he’s been a net buyer of stocks every year since he was 11 years old; he’s 90 now. It's incredible how a virus — and the mishandling thereof — rattled his optimism in a way that wars, terrorist attacks and other recessions didn’t. The U.S. isn’t out of the woods yet, but there are reasons to be hopeful, and that seems to be what Buffett’s latest moves are suggesting. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-11-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Since January, upward of more than 12,000 retailers in the U.S. have shuttered their doors – a record rate of decline. Yet shares in Macy’s and its counterparts are surging in anticipation of the world after Covid-19, thanks to recent vaccine breakthroughs. How can smaller players get wiped out while the larger chains thrive?The bloodletting that’s taking place right now is eerily reminiscent of what happened during the Great Depression.In the early 20th century, independent stores dominated retail storefronts in cities and towns across the nation. Most Americans bought everything from books to meats to gardening supplies from businesses owned and operated by folks who lived in the community.Such stores worked much differently than modern retail. Shoppers would enter the premises and ask a clerk for certain items. The idea of simply browsing the store? Unthinkable. That changed, though, with the advent of the first chain stores. These included general-merchandise stores like Woolworth’s, which sold cheap factory-made goods, and the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, better known as A&P. These and other early chains pioneered new methods of retailing that eventually became the norm.As historian Marc Levinson has shown, A&P began building stores that were the forerunners of today’s supermarkets. A&P sold standardized packaged foods and built stores with predictable layouts; maintained lean inventories; and embraced the benefits that came with economies of scale. A&P bypassed wholesalers, buying directly from manufacturers – and in some cases, purchased food producers to secure further control over the supply chain.As these chain stores muscled into towns and cities, they began challenging the hold that small-time retailers had enjoyed. By the late 1920s, independents began pushing for special state taxes to slow them down.And then the Great Depression hit. By one estimate, retail sales fell 50% between 1929 and 1933. But this cataclysm did not hit the retail sector equally.A 1946 study mined census surveys and an obscure report from Commerce Department to create a data set on retailing during this critical period. In order to determine which variables were most predictive of a retailer’s survival during the Great Depression, the researchers ran a series of regression analyses.They found that older retail establishments – ones that had already weathered previous, if smaller, storms – tended to survive the early 1930s at higher rates than newer establishments. Veteran establishments, after all, have a longer track record of success and more experience navigating challenges. These reputational assets allow them easier access to the kind of credit necessary to weather a severe crisis. (This dynamic also resurfaced in the Great Recession that followed 2008.)At the same time, though, a particular kind of well-established retailer was more likely than others to survive the Great Depression: chain stores. Several studies have confirmed this outcome. For example, an in-depth examination of grocery stores in Washington, DC, between 1929 and 1935 found that A&P and its peers had better chances of survival than independents – a remarkable outcome, given that many New Deal policies favored small-time retailers.Like older firms, chain stores enjoy economies of scale and purchasing power. They likewise had access to lines of credit that ordinary mom-and-pop businesses did not.There was another important factor. By one measure, stores with higher levels of labor productivity had a better shot at survival. But this wasn’t just a matter of working employees harder. The 1946 study also found that retailers paying higher wages had greater odds of making it than those that cut labor costs.This is puzzling at first glance. In the struggle for survival that took hold of retailing in the 1930s, slashing wages was the easiest way to hold down costs. Many grocers opted for that strategy – and went under.By contrast, the most sophisticated chain stores – A&P in particular – did not, holding wages steady even though it temporarily hurt their bottom line. Those better-paid, experienced employees likely had more incentive and ability to help the company weather the storm.Fast forward 90 years, and past A&P’s bankruptcy filing in 2015. Thanks to Covid-19, we’re subjecting the nation’s retailers to another extreme stress test with similar results. Independents, not large, well-capitalized chain stores, are taking a huge hit. And the firms accelerating changes in retail – Amazon, Target, Walmart – are strengthening while many smaller establishments go to the wall.At the same time, though, the established national retailers that have done the best in these trying times are the ones that, like A&P, have a reputation for logistics and high investments in human capital.(1)Target, which raised its starting minimum wage this summer, has seen record sales. So, too, has Costco, another massive retailer with a reputation for prioritizing employees.While it’s too soon to know whether these trends will hold, there’s a good chance that the pandemic may unleash a wave of creative destruction on retail the likes of which has not been seen since the 1930s. That may be overdue given the surfeit of retail space in this country. But this destruction won’t be indiscriminate. If past patterns hold, some well-established but sophisticated national chains that put a premium on human capital are going to come out on top. The rest will be lucky to survive.(1) To be sure, companies have mostly avoided extending hazard pay to workers on the front lines of the pandemic, while also proceeding with stock buybacks.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia, is a contributor to Bloomberg Opinion.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Depression-Era Secrets of Retail Survival

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Thursday's Q1 earnings announcement.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Costco Wholesale analysts model for earnings of $2.0 per share on sales of $41.70 billion. In the same quarter last year, Costco Wholesale reported earnings per share of $1.73 on revenue of $37.04 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on COSTIf the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, earnings would be up 15.61%. Sales would be up 12.58% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2019  EPS Estimate 2.83 2.04 2.07 1.71  EPS Actual 3.13 1.89 2.10 1.73  Revenue Estimate 52.08 B 37.52 B 38.22 B 37.25 B  Revenue Actual 53.38 B 37.27 B 39.07 B 37.04 B  Stock Performance For a full 12 months, the return has risen by 27.36%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

2020-12-10,"ISSAQUAH, Wash., Dec. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today announced its operating results for the first quarter (twelve weeks) of fiscal 2021, ended November 22, 2020.Net sales for the first quarter increased 16.9 percent, to $42.35 billion from $36.24 billion last year.Comparable sales for the first quarter fiscal 2021 were as follows:      12 Weeks 12 Weeks       Adjusted*                  U.S.14.6% 17.0%                  Canada16.2% 16.8%    Other International18.7% 17.7%            Total Company15.4% 17.1%            E-commerce86.4% 86.2%      *Excluding the impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange.      Net income for the quarter was $1,166 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared to $844 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, last year. This year’s first quarter included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per diluted share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend, to the extent received by the Company’s 401(k) plan participants; and $0.17 cents related to stock-based compensation. Last year’s first quarter included a $77 million or $0.17 per diluted share tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This year’s results reflect an expense for COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax or $0.35 per diluted share.Costco currently operates 803 warehouses, including 558 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 102 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom, 27 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France, and China.

One of the retailers that reported, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), is the PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day.Costco Bottomed In February, Not In March: After ending 2019 at $283.92, Coscto sprinted to new all-time-high in February at $315.25, but exhibited weakness along with the broad market in late February.While the S&P 500 index did not find a bottom until March 23, Costco bottomed on Feb. 28 at $261.28.That marked the lowest level for the issue since it bottomed in August 2018 at $252.72.Costco became a ""stay-at-home"" stock as the coronavirus pandemic took hold this year. Costco's Relentless Rally: Costco was higher in eight of the nine months following its February low, with the one outlier being a decline of just over $5 in June ($298.47 to $293.21).The issue did make it all-time-high this month at $388.07, but is now trading below its November close of $381.77.Costco Rewarding Shareholders: After the close Nov. 16, Costco declared a special $10-per-share special cash dividend, for a payout of $4.4 billion funded by existing cash. All shareholders as of Dec. 2 were eligible for the dividend, and it was payable Dec. 11. Interestingly, the issue peaked at $388.07 and made an all-time closing high price ($387.56), the day prior to the eligibility date, as investors piled into the issue to get the special dividend.Yet depending on when one bought the shares, they may be in the red, as the issue has shed over $10 based on its price ($375) in Friday's session -- and Friday being the payout date.

Co-host Dennis Dick did not expect to see a lot of upside in the issue or Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), which also posted an EPS and sales beat. ""All the good news has been factored into Costco -- how can it get any better for them, unless the vaccine fails?"" Dick said. Costco Price Action During The Regular Session: As it turns out, Costco's much higher opening print of $379.77 Friday has turned out to be the exact high for the session.Since that elevated open, it has drifted lower, but has yet to reach Thursday's low ($371.56), as $372.54 stands as the low for the session.Costco shares were trading up 0.71% at $375.43 ahead of the close Friday.

2020-12-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks Covid-19’s impact on trade. Sign up here, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis on the pandemic.Container shipping, the backbone of the global trading system, is showing signs of fatigue as the pandemic descends into its darkest days.Carriers reaping the biggest profits in at least a decade are struggling to operate reliably as bottlenecks worsen around ports from southern England to Shanghai, contorting supply chains for everything from car parts to cosmetics and medical equipment.Just 50.1% of container vessels arrived on time in November, down from 80% a year earlier and the lowest level in records dating back to 2011, according to a service reliability index compiled by Copenhagen-based Sea-Intelligence. From Asia to North America, on-time arrivals dropped below 30%, less than half the long-run average globally.Delays can add costs, induce operational headaches and restrain revenue for the shippers of cargo -- companies like Costco Wholesale Corp. The Issaquah, Washington-based chain of 803 warehouse-size stores on four continents expects the situation involving container shortages and late deliveries to persist for a few more months.“There are instances of 50% or 100% or even more sales increases of an item, and if we could procure more we’d have even higher sales,” Richard Galanti, Costco’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call earlier this month. “We’re managing through it, and expect relief not until March or so of 2021.”Slowly clogging up since September, the main artery for trade between China and the U.S. is still choked. Anchored off the coast of California over the weekend were almost 20 container ships waiting to offload at Los Angeles and Long Beach, up from about a dozen at the end of November. The Port of L.A. expects to handle 152,000 inbound containers this week -- a 94% increase from the same week a year ago.Read More: Bloomberg’s Coverage of the Crisis of Stranded SeafarersWeston LaBar, the CEO of the Harbor Trucking Association in Long Beach, last month expected container volume through the L.A. ports would stabilize by mid-February, when Chinese factories typically shut down for Lunar New Year. “Now we’re hearing already about a lot of bookings through June and July,” he said.Alan Murphy, CEO of analysis and data provider Sea-Intelligence, cautions that the current imbalances in containers are concentrated in North America and says the strength of demand probably won’t be sustained if Covid-19 vaccines enable U.S. consumers to quickly shift spending back to services like travel and hospitality.The shipping disruptions should calm down in the first half of 2021, Murphy says, but don’t expect the container liners to make their overcapacity mistakes of the past, which included under-bidding in freight rate contracts to below break-even levels.“The game has changed fundamentally -- not because of coronavirus but because of how the carriers responded,” he said, referring to a sharp reduction in sailings in the pandemic’s early months. “They are now capable of tailoring their supply to the available demand at a tactical level that they’ve never been able to do before.”That’s what worries freight forwarders and other shippers, and the concerns extend beyond the troubles in the Pacific. The European Shippers’ Council, a Brussels-based group representing cargo owners, is crying foul about “degraded services” and surcharges, and wants the European Commission to look into the market dynamics.The main sticking point: Spot rates to transport goods, which typically fade in the final weeks of the year, are still soaring despite the service disruptions. The rate to ship a container of goods from China to Europe jumped 17% last week, tripling from a year ago to more than $4,400, according to Hong Kong-based Freightos, an online shipping marketplace.“Of course we want the shipping lines to be healthy,” said Jordi Espin, the council’s policy manager for maritime transport. “However, to make these kinds of profits when we’re in pandemic rescue mode, we don’t think it’s fair.”Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of German container line Hapag-Lloyd AG, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday that he expects freight rates will remain strong at least for the first quarter. While he expected some easing of the market going into the second quarter, he said visibility that far out is low.Shippers and container liners are always sparring over prices and reliability. But the pandemic has spotlighted the upper hand the liners now have after a decade of consolidating and forming alliances among themselves, said Olaf Merk, head of ports and shipping at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s International Transport Forum.“That is something that the competition authorities will have to look at, I think, and some are also doing it now,” Merk said, referring to the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission’s investigation into the carriers’ role in American port congestion. “The situation in which we are now gives a lot of possibilities to the carriers to coordinate capacity and that of course increases the risks for shippers.”‘Stress Test’The world’s top container line, Copenhagen-based A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, this month called the challenges “the most dramatic stress test of the past 75 years.” Other industry representatives say there are multiple reasons on land why the system is straining, like trucker shortages, surging e-commerce purchases or Brexit stockpiling.Stuffed with 20%-30% more cargo than it’s used to handling, the pipeline is bound to face some snarls.“Even with this Covid cargo crunch that we’re now in the middle of, things continue to move,” said John Butler, president of the World Shipping Council in Washington, which counts the big liner companies among its members. “When you so significantly overload the system, it doesn’t immediately snap back.”Butler dismissed the notion that the industry lacks competitiveness, calling it “cutthroat frankly.”Meanwhile, shares of Maersk are flirting with an all-time high and the industry more broadly banked profits of $5.1 billion in the third quarter, a four-fold increase from a year earlier. With a solid fourth quarter, the cumulative red ink of the past five years will become net profitability, according to figures compiled by John McCown, a container-industry veteran and founder of Blue Alpha Capital.He said the pandemic gave the container carriers a lesson about how to hold firm on capacity as they shift into a longer-term period of slower demand growth.“It’s been a major learning experience about having more control over their destiny,” McCown said. “But it’s not been without its struggles.”Among the turmoil of 2020: overworked mariners and cyberattacks. But one of the more remarkable events happened on Nov. 30, when the Japanese-flagged ONE Apus hit rough seas sailing from China to the U.S., sending more than 1,800 containers overboard.The ship and crew returned safely to Kobe, Japan, but the incident probably doused some shipper’s hopes of ending a turbulent year with a bang: 54 containers that plunged into the water were filled with fireworks.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bottlenecks Wear Down World Economy’s Fleet of Container Ships

Let’s look at three recent high-profile initial public offerings and consider how to play them for a more secure and risk-adjusted outcome.
It has been a hot market this year and IPO stocks have seen great success as a result. With the major indices at record-setting highs there has been a groundswell of offerings as company’s cash-in during a friendly market environment. But it works both ways, right?
IPO’s also hold the promise for investors of being the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Buying shares just as the stock enters life as publicly traded company seems like a great opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s not that easy though. The reality is most IPO’s won’t ever come close to the fantastical long-term returns of AAPL, COST and similar mega-caps whose tickers easily roll off our tongues. Still, there’s a chance. Isn’t there?
There’s also the truth that right here, right now and without passing judgment, some IPOs are dearly held. It’s also true that some of them are Wall Street’s version of a shiny new, must-have toy to own. But at the same time, other newly listed stocks appear ready for permanent exile to The Island of Misfit Toys.


					7 Short-Term Stocks To Buy for a Happy New Year  				

With that in mind, here are three recent IPO stocks to keep an eye on:
Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB)
C3.AI (NYSE:AI)
DoorDash (NYSE:DASH)

IPO Stocks to Trade: Airbnb (ABNB)
.
Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our IPO stocks to trade is private-stay giant Airbnb. It’s a buy despite its current challenges — at least to a point.
ABNB stock has had its work cut out for it in 2020. This is no Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in a novel-coronavirus-driven environment. But despite the threats and expensive-looking price tag, ABNB has rallied.
Lockdowns and tough restrictions throughout the pandemic certainly haven’t helped Airbnb’s business model. That’s hardly a surprise. An undesirable trend of weaker urban rental markets as people pack their bags and head to the hills to work remotely has been another issue. And there’s more.
Airbnb also faces the underlying trust factor for the rental host, as well as would-be guests. That could be a significant problem from either party. Lastly, ABNB stock is no Hilton (NYSE:HLT), let alone a Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) or Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) when it comes to value.
Ultimately, shares of this IPO stock currently have more questions than answers. And they’re pricey. But the best growth stories often find a way to remain at nosebleed multiples and defy skeptics while padding shareholders wallets as they grow into their earnings over time. ABNB stock looks like one of those situations.
Technically, I’d look to pick up exposure to ABNB on a shallower pullback. As a momentum play, a move towards $155 has trendline and Fibonacci support to help a low form. Any additional weakness puts the idea of a momentum strategy into question.
My Favored Strategy Here: Confirmed pullback low in conjunction with Feb $175/$190 Bull Call Spread.

C3.AI (AI)
.
Source: Charts by TradingView
The next of our IPO stocks to trade is C3.AI. It’s also another industry giant that I’m looking for momentum to persist despite the warnings. AI stock is the only pure play artificial intelligence stock in the market today. And with early Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) exec and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) pioneer Thomas Siebel at the helm, the company’s leadership is a proven commodity as well. Need I say more? Much like ABNB, there are obvious risks that aren’t going unnoticed and are receiving their share of attention.
Barron’s hailed AI stock as the market’s “Priciest Tech Stock.” Apparently, it has taken the top spot from another recent IPO, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW). I’m less sure with AI shares fetching about 50x sales and valued at $11 billion versus roughly 200x and nearly $100 billion for SNOW. If nothing else, AI’s price chart looks like one where respecting the trend in motion could pay off.
Technically, given no signs that AI is anything other than a persistently bullish IPO stock to buy, purchasing strength rather than second-guessing simply “what is” or the “here and now,” makes sense. Specifically, I’d look to gain exposure on new highs as long as C3.AI’s determined uptrend remains intact.

My Favored Strategy Here: Jan $180/$200 Bull Call Spread.

DoorDash (DASH)

Source: Charts by TradingView
My final IPO stock to trade is DASH. And unlike ABNB and AI, DASH stock is delivering a short to the doorstep of bearish investors.
DoorDash has Wall Street universally worried. It’s not profitable and shares are expensive. That may actually sound like ABNB and AI. And for good reason too. Still, well-followed short-seller Citron Research went so far as to call DASH “the most ridiculous IPO of 2020.” And James Cramer warned his audience that it only has his blessing at $100 or less.
Even if those warnings prove overly bearish, a lack of customer stickiness, more reasonably priced competition from Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) and potential government market oversight make this an IPO stock for the bear radar. And, technically, the price chart today agrees.
While our other IPO stocks have set new highs, DoorDash shares have traded lower and are now setting up for another down leg. A small bearish flag pattern set against the 50% – 62% retracement levels was confirmed Tuesday. I’d take the opportunity to position for new lows and only exit if shares muster the strength to break the flag’s high.
My Favored Strategy Here: Feb $140/$125 Bear Put Spread.

Source: by InvestorPlace

	
That is how we started our write up on Disney (NYSE:DIS) last year. Little did we know just how tumultuous a year 2020 was going to be.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Yet here we are. 2020 is behind us — with DIS up more than 20% on the year — and 2021 waits on the horizon. So what do we think now?
We’re sticking with DIS as our favorite stock pick for 2021. The coronavirus pandemic proved that all of the reasons we liked the company before are even more important now.
Subscription-Based Revenue Models
Wall Street loves companies that can tap into the monthly/annual subscription model to generate revenue. Why? Because the revenue is consistent. You know it’s going to keep coming in month after month, year after year.


					Grading 10 of 2020's Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year				

These companies operate in a variety of sectors. Here are just a few and the way they take advantage of the subscription model:
Retailers, like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)…annual membership fees
Application software providers, like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)…monthly/annual subscriptions
Media giants, like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)…monthly subscriptions
DIS hasn’t always taken advantage of the subscription model to generate consistent revenue. It used to be much more reliant on big one-time product launches and movie releases. But it has been slowly building into a subscription model powerhouse during the past few years.
So how does DIS leverage the subscription model? Let’s take a look.
Disney+ and Hulu
DIS started its direct-to-consumer subscription gambit by joining the Hulu group in 2009. There were some growing pains, but Hulu ended up pummeling the subscription services most other individual networks were trying to offer.
In March 2019, DIS became the majority shareholder in Hulu when it bought many of the assets of 21st Century Fox. Shortly after, in May 2019, Comcast relinquished its remaining interest in the company to Disney.

But gaining control of Hulu wasn’t enough for Disney. It decided to take Netflix , HBO and others head-on with Disney+, and it knocked it out of the park.
After its first day of operation in November 2019, the company delighted Wall Street by announcing Disney+ had more than 10 million subscribers.
Fast forward to Dec. 10, when DIS announced it has attracted a jaw-dropping 86.8 million subscribers, and you can see why traders have pushed the stock up to new all-time highs.
And that’s just the beginning. Management believes Disney+ is going to continue adding millions of new subscribers in 2021 as the coronavirus continues to force people into socially distanced activities.
Certainly that rate of acquisition won’t last forever, but the more subscribers DIS can bring in now, the more recurring revenue it’s likely to enjoy down the road.
Movie Franchises & New Releases
The company is driving its Disney+ success by coupling the streaming service with its movie franchises and new releases.
DIS used to be in the one-and-done movie making business. Snow White had no overlap with Robin Hood, which had no overlap with The Lion King. But then the company realized it could capitalize on its own success by making movie franchises.
For example, Frozen was a smashing success so why not make Frozen II?
Everybody seemed to like Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 so why not break out of the bounds of a standard trilogy and make Toy Story 4?
Fans can’t seem to get enough of Star Wars so why not round out the third, yes third, trilogy in the series with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker?
But don’t stop there. Why not create even more spinoffs, like The Mandalorian, that will only be available on Disney+?
By combining movie franchises and new releases — like Mulan and Soul — with its Disney+ streaming service — that has everything from the Marvel movie catalog to The Simpsons on it — DIS has found the holy grail of subscription-based entertainment revenue models.

Theme Parks and Hotels
Now, it’s important to remember that DIS is trading near its all-time highs at a moment when Disneyland, and most of the company’s other theme parks, are closed. Walt Disney World in Florida is open to a reduced number of visitors, but theme park revenues are nowhere close to what they were before the coronavirus pandemic.
We expect this to change this year as the various coronavirus vaccines become available and state governments begin to ease their restrictions.
Just imagine the amount of pent-up demand there is to go see company’s new Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge area at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. In a post-pandemic world, people will be happy to pay the ever-rising prices for admission and in-park purchases.
Before the pandemic, DIS’s U.S. and international theme park and hotel business was responsible for more than 34% of the company’s revenue and 37% of the company’s earnings. If that segment of the business can bounce back to those levels in 2021, the sky’s the limit for DIS stock this year.
Bottom Line on DIS Stock
After bottoming out in March 2020, DIS began clawing its way back and eventually rocketed higher at the end of the year.

The stock recently broke above the up-trending resistance level it has been interacting with since early-2019. We expect this up-trending level to serve as support while DIS climbs even higher during 2020.
We anticipate DIS will break above $200 before the end of the year.

2021-01-07,"Warehouse giant Costco reported a 10.7% rise in its December comparable sales, while overall sales grew 12.3% year-over-year to $19.1 billion.Costco’s (COST) December comparable sales exceeded analysts’ consensus estimate of 9.5%, but the figure reflected a slowdown compared to comps growth of 13.4% and 14.4% in November and October, respectively. Looking at the regionwise growth, Costco’s comparable sales in the US, Canada and other international markets were up 9.6%, 8% and 19.4%, respectively. E-commerce comps rose 62.5% in December.Costco has been experiencing strong trends in groceries and items like furniture and mattresses as people are spending more time at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Last month, Costco reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Nov. 22), with revenue rising about 17% to $43.2 billion and EPS increasing 38% to $2.62. (See COST stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the December sales report, Robert W. Baird analyst Peter Benedict maintained a Buy rating on Costco and a price target of $410. The analyst noted that while December core comps marked the 7th consecutive month of double-digit growth, it was a deceleration from November.The 5-star analyst stated that softer traffic was the main reason for the slowdown, along with less robust growth in food and sundries amid smaller holiday gatherings. That said, Benedict remains positive on Costco's loyal membership base and structural cost advantages.Overall, 16 Buys and 4 Holds add up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus on Costco. Shares have risen 26.8% over the past year.

2021-01-14,"The COVID-19 pandemic made 2020 quite an eventful year for supermarkets and grocery chains. The likes of Walmart, Costco, Dollar General and Target adapted quickly to changing consumer behavior by offering several contactless delivery options. They also ramped up efforts to ensure adequate supply as Americans stockpiled groceries and essentials amid lockdown fears. What's more, the retail space saw unprecedented e-commerce sales. It would be unfair to expect top-line growth rates experienced during the lockdowns to repeat this year. That said, Wall Street experts see continued upside in certain retailers even as the pandemic tailwinds subside. Let's stack up BJ’s Wholesale against Costco using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, and pick the stock that could offer better returns this year. BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ) The demand triggered by the pandemic provided the kind of push BJ’s Wholesale needed after generating lackluster revenue growth of 1.4% in FY19 (ended Feb. 1, 2020). Stock-piling tendencies and shelter-at-home orders drove an 18.2% rise in the warehouse club’s revenue in the first nine months (ended Oct. 31) of FY20 and helped it gain market share. Notably, BJ’s beat the Street’s expectations, with overall revenue growing 15.6% to $3.73 billion in 3Q. Net sales increased 15.7% to $3.65 billion and membership fee income rose 11% to $85 million. Excluding gasoline, comparable club sales grew 18.5%, with digitally enabled sales exploding 200%. What’s more, adjusted 3Q EPS jumped over 124% year-over-year to $0.92. The improved business boosted cash flows and helped bring down BJ’s debt levels. Furthermore, the company is gaining new members at a strong rate. Its membership base at the end of 3Q reflected an increase of 630,000 members year-over-year on a net basis, which was way higher than the 200,000-250,000 membership additions experienced historically. To ensure its growth beyond the pandemic, BJ’s is expanding in underpenetrated categories like fitness equipment, household goods, select consumer electronics categories and indoor furniture. It has also enhanced its food business with more healthy and organic options. (See BJ stock analysis on TipRanks) Compared to giants like Costco and Walmart’s Sam Club, BJ’s has a smaller geographic presence. It operates 219 warehouse clubs and 149 BJ's gas locations in 17 states in the Eastern US. With four club additions in FY20, the company intends to expand further. Following a discussion with senior management, Merrill Lynch analyst Robert Ohmes noted that BJ plans to open clubs in both new and existing markets and he expects the retailer to target new markets in Midwest cities with “disproportionate population growth (e.g. Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville).” The analyst feels that accelerated store openings will boost growth in both membership fee income and comps over the long-term, as new clubs scale over time. In line with his optimism, Ohmes reiterated a Buy rating on BJ’s with a price target of $59 and concluded, “While difficult comparisons and a “return to normal” present risks to membership metrics in 2021, we expect increasing higher-tier penetration, improved merchandise offerings, and increased customer frequency / basket sizes to power renewal rates going forward. The membership base and business overall also both remain meaningfully stronger than they were in 2019.” BJ’s scores the Street’s cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 5 Buys and 4 Holds. The average price target stands at $51.13, implying 33.8% upside potential from current levels. Shares have risen by an impressive 67% over the past 52 weeks. Costco Wholesale (COST) Pandemic or no pandemic, Costco is considered to be one of the most consistent retail players. It operates 803 warehouses, including 558 in the US and Puerto Rico. From food and sundries to appliances and apparel, the warehouse chain offers a wide range of products at low prices to its members. Costco’s revenue grew 16.7% to $43.2 billion in 1Q FY21 (ended Nov. 22) as the company continues to experience heightened sales amid the pandemic. Net sales grew about 17% to $42.3 billion, while membership fees increased 7% to $861 million. Comparable sales grew 15.4% in the quarter. Overall, robust revenue and operating margin expansion drove a 38% increase in EPS to $2.62. Membership growth and retention rates are key metrics for Costco as membership fee has a material impact on its profitability. Renewal rates of 90.9% for US and Canada and 88.4% worldwide in the first quarter are a clear indication of the customer loyalty that the company enjoys. Costco ended 1Q FY21 with 59.1 million paid members, reflecting an 8% rise. Last week, Costco reported growth of 12.3% and 10.7% in its December net sales and comparable sales, respectively. (See COST stock analysis on TipRanks) Commenting on the December performance, Robert W. Baird analyst Peter Benedict notes that Costco delivered its 7th consecutive monthly double-digit core comps (excludes gasoline and foreign exchange impact) gain. That said, he pointed out that December core comps of 10.9% reflected a deceleration from November's 14.6%, mainly due to softer traffic and less robust growth in food and sundries. Despite the slowdown, Benedict remains optimistic about Costco's loyal membership base and structural cost advantages. He reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $410 price target. Looking ahead, Costco continues to enhance its e-commerce capabilities given the rapid sales increase since the pandemic (86.4% growth in 1Q FY21 alone). E-commerce sales accounted for just 6% of the FY20 topline. The acquisition of logistics provider Innovel Solutions last year will help in driving further online sales of “big and bulky” items like appliances and furniture. Costco is also expanding its store footprint and added eight new (net) units in 1Q FY21, with it hoping to open up to 23 units in the full-year. Shares have gained 22.4% over the past year and the average price target of $404.53 indicates upside potential of 10.2% in the 12 months ahead. The Street is bullish on the stock, with 15 Buys and 4 Holds adding up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. Conclusion Costco’s proven track record over the past several years and its strong business model make it an attractive play for the long-term. That said, right now, the improvement in BJ’s Wholesale’s performance, the possibility of expanding its presence and the attractive upside potential in the stock make it a better retail pick.

2021-01-25,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) is joining the grocery curbside pickup trend with a pilot program at a few stores in New Mexico.What Happened: According to Costco's New Mexico webpage, consumers can place orders for curbside pickup at three Albuquerque, New Mexico warehouses.All grocery items, including fresh and select non-food items, are available for sale.Consumers go to Costco.com, select ""grocery,"" order food, then choose a one-hour pickup window with updates via text message about when the order will be ready.Consumers drive to a reserved part of the parking lot for their orders.Prices on items are the same online as in stores. Each order must total at least $100, and there is an additional $10 pickup fee.Related Link: Albertsons CEO: Changing Consumer Habits Are Positive For GrocerWhy It's Important: Costco is among the last major sellers of food to offer curbside options, although this was within the company's abilities. Costco is known for keeping costs as low as possible, and offering curbside pickup posed logistical problems in its parking lots.Costco customers tend to also be more affluent, and in-store promotions like free samples were designed specifically to maximize sales.Impulse purchases could decrease when orders are placed online as consumers are more likely to stick with only what they need to purchase.It shouldn't come as much as a surprise that Costco is years behind its grocery rivals, as digital initiatives have never been part of its core DNA.Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), as an example, started testing in-store pickup options in early 2014 and emphasized building out all aspects of digital business.Walmart, unlike Costco, has been working on a grocery delivery initiative for years.In April 2020, the company announced an Express Delivery option that promises delivery of groceries and other items to customer doors in less than two hours.Costco only started testing same-day grocery delivery options via Instacart at Canadian stores in July 2020.What's Next: Costco hasn't officially confirmed a pilot program of curbside pickup in a press release, although details are offered on its website.COST Price Action: Costco shares were down 1.04% at $358.55 at last check Monday.

Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q1, Costco Wholesale posted an ROCE of 0.09%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. View more earnings on COST Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. In Costco Wholesale's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions. Q1 Earnings Insight Costco Wholesale reported Q1 earnings per share at $2.29/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.05/share.

2021-02-09,"Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $360.23. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-02-19 Strike Price: $360.00 Volume: 1171 Open Interest: 2701 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-02-26,"Thursday was painful for the bulls on Wall Street. Ironically, the riskiest of them all GameStop (NYSE:GME) was up big. The word is that its sharp rallies may have contributed to the downside in indices. Speculators shorting it may have had to sell good stocks to cover their losses in GME. Regardless, “red” happens as part of normal price action. More on this later. Today’s focus is to determine if Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a knife worth catching. COST stock has value and at some point that plays a big factor. Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Yes, is my short answer. But first we have to acknowledge the fact that equity markets are in danger. We’ve been on a bullish run way too long and under terrible conditions. What’s propping us up are the artificial measures and the trillions of dollars from the government. The magnitudes of the safety programs they’ve deployed are enormous. This should tell us that there’s something wrong.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nevertheless, the safety nets are out so the bulls are comfortable. They say BTFD (buy the f—— dip), from what I gather Thursday’s action was indeed a “freaking” dip. I expect the bulls to step up soon. Costco stock has given back a lot of its upside already. It’s down 15% from its recent highs. Fundamentally, it’s cheap and that should lend it support. It has a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 35 and a price-to-sales under 1. 8 Stocks to Buy for March Owners of the stock today give it less than one year’s worth sales in credit. Meaning, they don’t have a lot of hopium built into COST stock price. That makes the investors hard to disappoint. In any case, management has been beyond reproach. They were quick to act and adjust for operating under quarantine rules. I felt safe walking around their stores since this mess started. That’s why they’ve been busier than ever. COST Stock Has Support Source: Charts by TradingView Technically, the stock triggered a bearish pattern once it lost $350 per share. The downside target of this could extend $13 lower than yesterday’s close. However, the whole zone between here and there is supportive. This has been the area in contention since last March. Pivot ranges like this usually serve as support for prices. I believe the easy work for the bears is over. For more significant downside they are going to need to work a lot harder. Coming down from almost $400 per share is easy, digging deeper here is not. On the other hand, having support and value doesn’t mean it will experience an immediate recovery. New investors expect everything to bounce in a V-shape. I’m here to remind them that that is not the norm. Bottoming should be a process, not a flashpoint event. This is to say that on the way up there will be resistances. This will be especially true when it approaches the $350 neckline. There will be sellers lurking. Create a Buffer Zone On bad days like Thursday when COST stock was falling precipitously, I prefer selling puts rather than buying shares outright. In addition to falling stock prices, The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) exploded 35% up. This balloons put option prices making my safety net even bigger. For example, instead of spending $33,400 to buy 100 shares of COST stock, I would have sold the April $300 put. For this I would collect a net credit of $300. In return I promise to buy the shares at $300 each. If that happens my break-even point for owning them would be $297. In comparison, someone who bought the shares outright would be down 11% when I break even. I don’t sell puts in a stock that I don’t want to own shares. I have great confidence that Costco stock long term makes for a sane financial decision. During the pandemic crash, the stock traded heavily between $320 and $290 per share. Support like this is a solid floor even on the worst of days. The stock could fall all the way down to that but I think that would need depression-like conditions. The pandemic shutdowns should be as bad a test as it gets for decades. No one was working on the entire planet and those are conditions that are hard to match. If COST stock bounces and then fails to hold $330 per share, a second leg lower then starts. The downside risk from that would take it closer to $310 per share. This is not my forecast but it is a scenario that the bulls need to acknowledge exists.

2021-03-01,"Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) will open the week on Monday after market close whereas big-box retailers highlight the week's other big releases, led by Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) on Tuesday and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NYSE: COST) on Thursday. Zoom Video Communications According to Financial Times, researchers at Stanford University have confirmed what millions of remote workers already knew, that ""Zoom fatigue"" causes greater stress than meeting in real life because of the ""non-verbal overload"" of endless video calls. Not to mention that users are seeing reflections of themselves at a frequency and duration that hasn't been seen before in the history of media and the history of people. Although some problems could be solved with trivial changes to its user interface, such as automatically hiding the ""selfie"" window. The bigger problem with Zoom is that behavior that is ordinarily reserved for close relationships, such as faces seen close up, has suddenly become the way we interact with casual acquaintances and even strangers. This new way of communication takes a toll on our minds and that could eventually hamper Zoom's success with the stocking already having lost its luster due to vaccine developments. Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX) is preparing to launch its COVID-19 vaccine after 33 years of failed attempts and facing delisting from the Nasdaq as it couldn't deliver a single approved shot. We will get a new chapter in a fairytale-like story of a little company that was on the verge of potentially closing getting the chance to play with the big boys in the race for the Covid vaccine. As soon as its vaccine gets approved, it is ready to produce 150m doses a month. Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) will pop the hood after the market close. Earlier, it stated that Q4 deliveries were at a record of 17,353 vehicles which is an increase of 111% YoY and over the upward end of its guidance. But, when it comes to EVs, profitability has frequently taken a back seat and despite the encouraging deliveries, the company has been in the red. Tuesday Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) and Target are due to report before the market open. Last week, a group of activist investors pressured the department store to address stagnant sales and operating margins, so it will be interesting to see how the story continues as critics find the company isn't moving fast enough to turn itself around. On the other end, Wall Street expects Target to post a profit of $2.54 per share on $27.4 billion in revenue which would be an impressive 50% profit increase. Some of its biggest peers have already reported fourth-quarter earnings but investors have big expectations for its holiday quarter. We already know Target had a good season as it revealed that sales grew 17% during the holidays which on its own is enough to outpace Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), which just reported a 9% holiday quarter boost. However, this is a slight slowdown from its third quarter's 21% growth, so we'll learn whether Target continued to win market share in each of its core selling categories. Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) and Box Inc (NYSE: BOX) will board the reporting train after market close. Wednesday Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) will report before the market open with Okta Inc (NASDAQ: OKTA), Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) known for its ‘too hot to handle IPO', Vroom Inc (NASDAQ: VRM), Splunk Inc (NASDAQ: SPLK) will reveal their earnings after market close. Thursday Kroger Co (NYSE: KR) will report before market open with Opendoor Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: OPEN), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), SmileDirectClub Inc (NASDAQ: SDC), Costco, and Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS) closing the earnings week after market close. This week will be full of retail that was dramatically changed by the pandemic. We will also get a better idea if Zoom can maintain its success beyond the pandemic as, despite its many benefits, digital communication didn't measure up to in-person socializing.

2021-03-03,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) remains the wholesale leader, but smaller rival BJs Wholesale Club Holdings Inc (NYSE: BJ) is showing superior metrics. What To Know: Costco entered 2020 on a strong note but the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic quickly shifted buying habits, according to the foot traffic analytic firm Placer.ai report. Since early 2020, Costco has seen inconsistent foot traffic trends to the point where it saw year-over-year growth in just four months -- all of which were in the back half of the year. BJs, on the other hand, saw a stellar 2020 with year-over-year foot traffic growth in every month except January. The smaller wholesale chain averaged 13.8% monthly year-over-year growth in visits in the back half of 2020. The momentum continues into 2021 with an identical 13.8% growth rate in January. Related Link: Can Grocers Sustain The 'Pre-Christmas Bump'? Why It's Important: Foot traffic trends are only one part of the equation as it's possible that customers are visiting Costco less often but spending more per trip. In Costco's case, visits were down 1.7% from November 2020 to January 2021 while visits per visitor were down 28.9%. ""A massive decline in visits per visitor alongside a fairly minor drop in overall visits shows that Costco may actually be stronger than it's ever been and that the brand is likely adding new members at a very high rate,"" according to the Placer.ai report. What's Next: BJs deserves credit for a strong 2020 performance but it's unclear if it can sustain momentum in 2021 and beyond, according to Placer.ai. The company continues to offer the compelling value that stands out amid economic uncertainty. BJs Wholesale's stock is up nearly 60% over the past year, while Costco's is up about 4.5%.

2021-03-03,"On Thursday, March 04, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) will release its latest earnings report. Check out Benzinga's preview to understand the implications. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Analysts expect Costco Wholesale earnings of $2.45 per share. Revenue will likely be around $43.78 billion, according to the consensus estimate. In the same quarter last year, Costco Wholesale posted EPS of $2.1 on sales of $39.07 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on COST If the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Thursday, quarterly profit would be up 16.67%. Sales would be up 12.05% from the same quarter last year.

2021-03-11,"The global health crisis has changed consumer preferences with shoppers spending more on essential items such as food and home goods along with buying more online, both of which benefited Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) over the past year. However, the warehouse club titan's earnings growth came crashing to a virtual halt last quarter. Last week, the warehouse club giant reported that its sales momentum remained strong last quarter but the earnings miss led its shares to surrender all of their gains of the past 12 months. However, investors shouldn't worry too much as the company's long-term earnings growth trajectory remains intact. The Q2 FY 2021 The three-month period that ended on February 14th 2021, the retailer saw strong sales but disappointing earnings. Costco has continued to report strong sales growth in recent months, including an impressive 15.7% increase in adjusted comparable sales during January. During the latest quarter, comparable sales rose 13% YoY and net sales grew 14.7% to $43.9 billion. But Costco's net margin weakened from last year's 2.42% to 2.17% a year earlier and managed to offset the increase in sales and earnings per share increased just 2% YoY, from $2.10 to $2.14, which was below expectations of $2.45. The retail giant had substantial COVID-19-related costs, including the $2/hour wage premium it began paying a year ago that reduced its EPS by about $0.41 this time around. But this cost didn't stop EPS from jumping 32% in the prior quarter, the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Gasoline Is A Big Business What drove the drop in profitability were the lower margins on gasoline sales. Gross margin in its core categories increased YoY but overall gross margin decreased because gasoline margins weakened significantly over the quarter. Gasoline produces volatile profits. In the recent months, gasoline costs rose and Costco was deliberately slow to raise its prices to foster customer loyalty and drive traffic to its gas stations and, by extension, its warehouses. However, this strategy comes at the cost of profitability. Conversely, when gasoline prices are falling, Costco tends to earn higher margins from its gas business and the recent rally in gasoline prices should peter out soon, so Costco's profitability from this segment will improve in the near term. Profitability Should Improve Costco tends to raise membership fees every five or six years, and the last increase took place in June 2017 so the next one should come within a year or two. Membership fees make up a bulk of the warehouse club's profits, so any increase should drive a significant increase in earnings. Outlook Costco is likely to continue gaining market share as it capitalizes on its growing member base and its new delivery capabilities for bulky goods like appliances and mattresses. Additionally, it will benefit from smaller retailers being forced to close shop as many don't have the resources to survive the pandemic and await the aftermath. The latest earnings miss doesn't change the fact that Costco has been a big winner as the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the retail landscape and consequent events should drive increases in its top and bottom lines.

2021-03-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Instacart Inc. appointed Snowflake Inc. Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman to its board of directors, another sign the grocery delivery startup is getting serious about going public.Founder and Chief Executive Officer Apoorva Mehta said he has been speaking for months with Slootman -- who last September led his cloud software company through the biggest U.S. initial public offering of 2020 -- and considers him a “coach.”“He really likes to drive clarity on what the one thing is to focus on,” Mehta said. “Internally, there’s a lot of focus on what that one thing is.”Citing legal restrictions, Mehta declined to state what that “one thing” was. He also declined to answer additional questions about the company’s ambitions to go public.“In 20 years, they won’t care whether we went public through a DL, an IPO or a SPAC. They will care about the value we’re creating,” Mehta said, referring to the choices of a direct listing, initial public offering or merging with a special purpose acquisition company.Instacart last week announced a $265 million funding round that lifted its value to $39 billion, almost three times its value last June. The coronavirus pandemic has driven a surge in demand for grocery deliveries from homebound customers.Instacart said it generated net revenue of roughly $1.5 billion in 2020 and saw monthly transaction volume increase 300% in December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The company also said it was profitable on an adjusted basis for the last three quarters of 2020.In a hedge against whether food delivery will remain as popular after the pandemic abates, the San Francisco-based startup is bolstering two other businesses: advertising and enterprise services.Instacart said it increased the number of advertisers on its platform by 500% to more than 1,300 consumer packaged-good companies in 2020. The startup also builds the technology for grocery retailers like Wegmans, Costco Canada and Smart & Final, powering their apps, websites, coupon programs and ads.“We are in the very early stages of the first inning,” Mehta said. Groceries “is a trillion dollar category in the United States and worldwide it’s 10 to 12 trillion.”Slootman is an enterprise veteran who has led three companies through IPOs. Instacart formally announced his appointment on Thursday. Last month, the company added Fidji Simo, a Facebook Inc. executive, and Barry McCarthy, former chief financial officer for Spotify Technology SA and Netflix Inc., as directors.While at Spotify, McCarthy helped pioneer the then-novel approach of directly listing shares of a company on the public market and bypassing a traditional IPO. Unlike an IPO, which lets companies sell new shares to raise money, a direct listing allows a startup to simply begin trading existing shares on the public market.Instacart doesn’t necessarily need to raise money by selling shares. The company has more than $1.5 billion in cash after last week’s fundraising round, according to a person familiar with the matter, which placed Instacart as the second-most valuable startup in the country after SpaceX.(Updates with Slootman formal announcement in the 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Instacart Adds Slootman to Board; Signaling It May Go Public

2021-03-24,"Stocks of retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) are likely to get a seasonal boost around the Easter holiday, according to Jim Cramer, CNBC reported Tuesday. See also: Buy Costco (COST) Stock What Happened: The “Mad Money” host expanded on the stock analysis from trader Larry Williams and said that a “rising April tide will be able to lift all retail ships.” Cramer noted stocks of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP), in addition to Costco and Amazon as likely candidates for such a holiday surge. The former hedge fund manager made a note of how these retail stocks tend to rally around Easter, in reviewing the chart analysis from Williams. Why It Matters: With the exception of Shopify, which is up 2.7% on a YTD basis, all other stocks that Cramer discussed are down for the year. Shopify closed 3% higher at $1,165 on Monday. Costco is down 9.7% since the beginning of the year. The stock ended Monday 1.91% higher at $342.25. Amazon and Walmart have fallen 3.7% and 7.1%, respectively, since the year began. The Jeff Bezos-led company traded 0.5% higher at $3,138 and Walmart closed 0.41% higher at $134.35 on Monday.

US-stacked comp trends also accelerated to an adjusted +25.4% in March from +21.9% in February.

2021-04-09,"(Bloomberg) -- After carrying the weight of the global economy since World War II with little fanfare, the lowly shipping pallet is finally commanding some respect.Demand for the platforms used to haul nearly every consumer good or industrial ingredient is soaring amid a surge in e-commerce, forcing retailers and manufacturers to expand warehouses or pile inventories higher. At the same time, two keys to production -- cheap lumber and labor -- are scarce, and even nail costs are rising.The result: Pallet prices have hit record highs, according to a U.S. Labor Department index, and European gauges show big jumps from the U.K. to Germany. The market may stay hot through the peak construction season in the springtime and as Covid-19 vaccines help revive restaurants and event venues -- adding to inflationary pressures rippling across supply chains.“Supply is just barely keeping up with demand,” said Howe Wallace, chairman and CEO of PalletOne Inc., a Bartow, Florida-based producer with facilities across the Southeast. “It’s a pretty dicey situation.”At Virginia Tech’s Center for Packaging and Unit Load Design, the nation’s foremost pallet laboratory, “the companies we work with, every single one of them, said they’ve had their best year,” said Associate Professor Laszlo Horvath, the center’s director.Pallets serve as the base of a so-called unit load, a standard way to ship products so they’re easy to move with forklifts and jacks. They are generally bought or leased by product makers and get baked into transport packaging costs. When a retailer or other end user is finished with pallets, recycling companies collect, repair and resell them. Some industries like bottling companies manage their own pallet pools.Wood’s DominanceThere are roughly 5 billion pallets in use worldwide, and an estimated 2 billion in the U.S. alone -- enough to go two-thirds of the way to the Moon if stacked on top of each other. About 90% are wooden and the rest are made of plastic, metal or cardboard. Each year, some 513 million new wood ones are built in the U.S. and another 326 million are repaired and put back in circulation, according to Horvath.Depending on the region, the usual price tag of $9 to $12 per wooden pallet may approach $15 this year. On Friday, U.S. government data showed the wood-pallet component of the producer price index jumped in March by the most since 1993.“New pallets, used pallets, rental pallets -- they’re all raising their prices,” said Chaille Brindley, editor and publisher of Pallet Enterprise magazine and Pallet Profile, a market report.Pallets are made with a lower grade of hardwood and softwood than the timber used for construction and furniture. In the mid-Atlantic region, the price of pallet-grade hardwood rose to $635 per 1,000 board feet in March from $530 a year earlier, and a Southern California softwood more than doubled, to $520. Meanwhile, nail prices gained between November and March along with a 36% jump in the cost of wire rod, Brindley said.Adding to the squeeze is a dearth of workers willing to do the tough job of constructing pallets. “The market’s right for a second shift, but there are no people to add a second shift,” Wallace said.Plastic’s PotentialSuch strains would seem to provide an opening for plastic pallets, which are lighter, built to last longer, easier to sanitize, and pose fewer hazards like splinters and protruding nails. The downside to plastic pallets: They’re about three times more expensive, meaning a shift from wood to plastic turns what most companies view as throw-away packaging into pricey assets that need to be managed.Before the pandemic, the overall pallet market was growing at about 5% to 7% annually.“After the pandemic we believe that’s even higher,” said Jeff Pepperworth, CEO of Orlando, Florida-based iGPS Logistics LLC, the U.S.’s largest plastic-pallet pooler. “We are seeing, especially in the plastic-pallet space, there’s more demand than there is supply.”Pepperworth said the shift to robotics and artificial intelligence in warehouses and distribution centers favors pallets with more consistent dimensions and tracking technology -- top selling points of plastic.“In the past, automation looked at the pallet as the dumbest asset in the process,” he said. “In the future, the pallet is going to be the smartest asset in the process.”The wood-pallet lobby has heard such arguments before about their venerable product. “Companies will always look to build a better mousetrap,” said Brent McClendon, president and CEO of the Alexandria, Virginia-based National Wooden Pallet & Container Association. “They keep coming back to wood.”With lumber prices so high, the logistics world is intrigued by a pilot program this year using plastic pallets by Costco Wholesale Corp., the Issaquah, Washington-based chain of warehouse stores where pallets are fixtures on the sales floor. In an email reply to questions about the trial run, Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said “we wouldn’t have any comments.”The leasing company working with Costco is CHEP, a unit of Sydney-based Brambles Ltd. that traces its history back to Australia’s role in the Second World War.Brambles CEO Graham Chipchase indicated on a conference call in February that CHEP -- known for its pool of bright-blue wooden pallets -- is proceeding cautiously into the plastic variety so it doesn’t weaken the wood business.“Because plastic pallets are so much more expensive than wooden ones, we feel that if this is a solution for Costco, we don’t think it’s likely to spread across the whole system quickly because of the price premium,” Chipchase said.Marshall White, a Virginia Tech professor emeritus and a developer of pallet-design software, said it’s reasonable to expect plastic could reach 10% of the market over the long term, from about 5% to 6% now.“Wood pallets will continue to dominate, until the time that we find the physics to dematerialize toilet paper at Procter & Gamble and rematerialize it in my house with some magic device,” he said.(Adds pallet prices from PPI report in 8th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",The Forgotten Shipping Pallet Stages a Pandemic-Era Rally

2021-04-14,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales probably swelled in March thanks to faster hiring, the distribution of federal stimulus checks, a steady pace of Covid-19 vaccinations and fewer restrictions on stores across the country.Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department will show retail receipts surged by 5.8% in March after a 3% decline in February, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Several forecasters project at least a 10% gain, which would be the largest since May -- when the economy began emerging from initial pandemic lockdowns.“I really think it’s going to be a pretty spectacular report,” Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp., who estimates a 11.5% gain. “The question will be what comes next, we can’t repeat these gains, we won’t have stimulus checks every month.”Personal incomes were boosted during the month by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks from the latest federal pandemic aid bill, signed by President Joe Biden on March 11. Further, the labor market added more than 900,000 jobs last month.“Stimulus was pumped into the economy in March and consumers have responded to that by increasing spending,” Meyer said. “And more people were put to work in March and are more comfortable with their job security. It’s a very powerful combination.”In addition to rising incomes, “rapid vaccination and gradual reopenings across the country should drive sales that have been particularly depressed due to the pandemic, including restaurant spending and apparel,” James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a note.The data represent a sharp snapback from February, when retail activity was hindered by sub-freezing temperatures and winter storms that overwhelmed power grids in Texas and the Great Plains. Warmer temperatures in March allowed for more outdoor activities, likely benefiting restaurants and service businesses.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“A sharp unwind in retail sales from the inclement weather-driven drop in February was augmented by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks and a broader reopening of the economy, reflected in the near-1 million payrolls gain in the March jobs report.”-- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby, Eliza Winger, economistsFor the full note, click hereAlternative data also point to firmer retail sales. Compared with the pre-pandemic trend, Chase credit card spending was down just 5% in March, compared with down 10% in February, according to data from economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Meanwhile, a measure of same-store sales from Johnson Redbook was up 9.8% from the prior year during the last week in March compared with 4.6% at the end of the previous month. Restaurant reservations measured by OpenTable are also improving.Stimulus, Spring BreaksMerchants ranging from restaurants to apparel stores have also reported better results in March. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw U.S. comparable-store sales excluding gas rise 11.3%, while customer traffic improved 3% from the same month last year, a time when shoppers began flooding to Costco locations to stock up on home essentials when the pandemic began.Dave & Buster’s Entertainment Inc., whose arcade-studded restaurants have been hit hard by the pandemic, said demand has been improving after the final “tough months” of 2020.Brian Jenkins, the company’s chief executive officer, attributed a March improvement in demand to more economic stimulus, earlier spring breaks for students and better Covid-19 trends.“We’re seeing a little bit of pent-up demand,” Jenkins said on a March 31 earnings call. March is going to be “better than we saw in the month of February.”In the coming months, retail sales should continue to be positive, but it will be difficult to sustain growth in the double-digits, Bank of America’s Meyer said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Some Economists Project ‘Spectacular’ U.S. March Retail Report

2021-04-15,"Costco Wholesale Corporation raised its quarterly cash dividend by 12.9% to $0.79 per share. The big-box store company previously increased the dividend by 7.7% to $0.70 per share in April 2020. Costco (COST) announced that the new dividend will be paid on May 14 to shareholders of record as of April 30. The company’s annual dividend of $3.16 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 0.87%. Last month, Costco reported fiscal 2Q results. Including certain one-time items, the company’s 2Q earnings inched up 1.9% year-over-year to $2.14 per share but missed Street estimates of $2.44. Net sales increased 14.7% to $43.9 billion and exceeded analysts’ expectations of $43.78 billion. (See Costco stock analysis on TipRanks) On April 7, Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh increased the stock’s price target to $400 (9% upside potential) from $370 and maintained a Buy rating. Parikh said, “We are lifting our forecasts to reflect today’s March sales results and our latest thinking.” Furthermore, “COST remains a top pick for us, but we still believe investors should take advantage of weakness vs. chasing strength as a volatile trade likely continues amidst upcoming difficult comparisons,” the analyst added. The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buys versus 4 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $386.50 and implies upside potential of 5.3% to current levels. Shares have gained almost 18% over the past year.

2021-04-21,Don't overlook this dividend stock because of its low dividend yield. There's more to the story.,1 Top Dividend Stock to Buy Now
2021-04-23,"Not all dividend stocks are equal. One of the traps that investors fall into is the yield trap. That is, they buy a stock because it has a high dividend yield. But a dividend yield is really just a math problem. That is, the dividend yield is the announced per share annual dividend divided by the current share price. So a company with a $2 annual dividend and a share price of $35 has a dividend yield of 5.7%. That’s actually an awesome yield. However, the company has true control of only one aspect of that equation. And, as we learned in 2020, when things get rough, a dividend is often the first thing to get cut.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A better way to shop for dividend stocks is to look for companies that are increasing the amount of their annual dividend. With an increasing dividend the cash you generate from that stock will continue to increase no matter what happens to the stock price. And investors that don’t need that income right away can, in many cases, reinvest the dividends back into the stock to maximize their total return. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In Many stock screeners let you sort for companies that have, or will be, increasing their dividends. Here’s a list of eight stocks that have recently increased their dividend, or will be soon. And some of the companies on this list have increased their dividend quite significantly. Nucor (NYSE:NUE) Ternium (NYSE:TX) Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) Costco (NASDAQ:COST) Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Dividend Stocks: Nucor (NUE) Source: Shutterstock The first of the dividend stocks on this list is Nucor, the largest steel producer in the United States. Steel prices began rising in 2020 fueled by a lack of supply and surprisingly high demand. A proposed infrastructure plan is likely to keep demand high. What the final infrastructure plan will look like is anyone’s guess. But it’s certain to create a favorable environment for steel demand. And that demand should put a floor under NUE stock even if steel prices move lower as production continues to come online. Nucor has increased its dividend for 48 consecutive years. This makes it a dividend aristocrat and puts it two years shy of being in the even more exclusive club of dividend kings. The average increase of the company’s dividend over the last three years has been 6.61%. By applying the Rule of 72, that means the company will double its dividend payout in approximately 10 years. Ternium (TX) Source: Shutterstock Sticking with steel stocks, I’ll offer up Ternium as a complementary stock to Nucor. Ternium is the leading steel company in Latin America. The company is becoming more cost competitive and has taken steps to increase its liquidity and overall balance sheet during the pandemic. The stock is near its all-time high. Ternium reports earnings in late April and is expected to show earnings growth of 154.4% for the quarter. Both of these indicators give support to TX stock getting ready to push into record territory. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In Ternium pays out an annual dividend. The company did not increase its dividend in 2020, but just raised it 90 cents on April 15. This averages out to 41.81% of the company’s trailing 12-month earnings. Normally, investors should be cautious when a company breaks a string of dividend increases. However, 2020 was a difficult year for most companies. Ternium didn’t cut its dividend, nor did it suspend it. It simply kept it the same and had a history of increasing it prior to the pandemic. Dividend Stocks: Procter & Gamble (PG) Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Consumers are expected to continue the deep cleaning rituals they initiated during the pandemic. That’s a positive catalyst for Procter & Gamble. As a defensive stock, the company had a great year in 2020 as more Americans made sure their medicine cabinets were well supplied. In fact, at one point, PG stock was acting like a bona fide growth stock, soaring 41% from its pandemic low. The stock has since given up those gains, but it still sports a 14.5% gain over the last 12 months. However, this is an article about dividend stocks and that’s where PG stock continues to shine. The company recently announced a 10% increase in its dividend, raising the dividend from 79 cents to 86 cents per share. That makes it 59 consecutive years of raising its dividend payout for this dividend king. And the company has been raising its dividend at a pace of 13.87% over the last three years. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Source: Niloo / Shutterstock.com Don’t let the recent pause in the company’s vaccine rollout deter you from taking a close look at JNJ stock. Unlike the other biotech companies that brought a novel coronavirus vaccine to market, Johnson & Johnson has a host of other revenue streams. Those revenue streams in addition to its vaccines propelled the stock to its all-time high in late 2020. The company is only up about 8% in 2021, but it’s up 38% since the onset of the pandemic. And the company just posted a double beat on earnings that may serve as a further catalyst for the stock. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In JNJ recently increased its dividend by 5% from $1.01 to $1.06. That matches Procter & Gamble with 59 consecutive years of dividend growth. And over the past three years, the company has been increasing its dividend by an average of nearly 20% (19.88%). Dividend Stocks: Tractor Supply Company (TSCO) Source: Shutterstock After delivering strong results in 2020, Tractor Supply Company is benefiting from a couple of recent analysts’ upgrades that may present investors with another year of growth, albeit at a slower rate than in 2020. However, a little bit of slower growth shouldn’t be a huge concern when the company rewards its shareholders with a whopping 30% dividend increase. An increase of this magnitude would normally be a red flag. Sometimes company’s will issue a sizable dividend increase to make up for a bad growth story. However, in the case of TSCO stock, the company has a regular pattern of increasing its dividend payout. In fact, this increase makes it 10 straight years for the company and gives it an average increase of 42.86% over the last three years. A good course of action would be to accept the company’s generosity and jump on board the stock for some share price growth and to capture what amounts to a $2.08 annual dividend. Costco (COST) Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com Costco was another retailer that was a pandemic performer. But the company has been giving investors a lot to be excited about even before 2020. The warehouse club operator has averaged revenue growth of nearly 9% in the last few years. And it achieves this growth while still expanding into different locations (its footprint now includes more than 800 stores). Plus, the company enjoys a membership retention rate of more than 90%. During the pandemic, the company added e-commerce to its bag of tricks. This positions it for future growth even as competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) continue to nip at its heels. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In Costco is a good example of not being too hung up on a yield. COST stock has a pretty meager one; it yields only about 0.72% at the time of this writing. However the company just increased its dividend by nine cents in April 2021. And over the past three years, it’s delivered 41.03% dividend growth. On top of that, Costco issued a $10 per share special dividend in December 2020. Dividend Stocks: Whirlpool (WHR) Source: Shutterstock As a Michigander (yes, that’s a term) I felt like I needed to include Whirlpool on this list of dividend stocks. But it’s not like they haven’t earned it. WHR stock is up 136% in the last 12 months. And the reason why is obvious. When people buy new homes, they tend to buy new appliances. And that, along with cost-cutting measures applied by the company, is translating to strong growth on the top and bottom lines. In the company’s first-quarter earnings report, the appliance manufacturer earned $7.20 in adjusted EPS and posted revenue of $5.4 billion. Analysts were expecting a $5.40 EPS on revenue of $4.9 billion. Whirlpool also rewarded its shareholders with a 12% dividend increase. This comes on the heels of a five cent per share increase that the company delivered to shareholders in the third quarter. The company has now delivered 12.79% dividend payout growth in the last three years. Anthem (ANTM) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Healthcare has remained a red-hot sector. Anthem is the largest for-profit managed health care company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) Association. ANTM stock is up 45% in the last 12 months and 20.7% in 2021. Anthem recently issued an 18.95% dividend increase from 95 cents per share to $1.13. This brought the company’s three-year dividend growth to 40.74%. This is another example where if you just pay attention to the yield, you’re missing the underlying story. Anthem just reported first-quarter earnings and beat earnings expectations. Quarterly revenue came in as a slight miss, but was still 9% higher than the prior quarter. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In In a sector like healthcare, long-term trends can say a lot more about a stock’s prospects than short-term performance. In Anthem’s case, the company has seen its annual earnings grow at a 16.5% clip over the past five years. This is significantly higher than the 11% industry average. And more impressively it outpaces the broader market which averages 12%.

But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified.

2021-05-15,"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has relaxed mask-wearing rules for those fully vaccinated against COVID-19. According to the CDC, fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws, rules and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. The CDC says people are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series, such as the Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) or Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) vaccines, or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) Janssen vaccine. At present, about 59% of American adults have received at least one shot, while 45% have received both. Here is how some major retail chains across the U.S. are responding: Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) said masks will no longer be required for fully vaccinated Walmart employees or customers starting from this coming Tuesday. Some local ordinances could still require masks. The company has also announced that a $75 bonus will be given to those employees who are or get vaccinated against COVID-19. Trader Joe's said fully vaccinated customers no longer need to wear masks in stores. However, it still requires its employees to wear masks. Related content: Benzinga's Full Guidance Calendar Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) also said it is removing mask requirements for shoppers inside stores on Friday. But customers will still have to wear face masks in its pharmacy and optical departments. Retail chain Publix said it would no longer require masks for vaccinated people starting Saturday.

Home Depot Inc (NYSE: H.D.) has not changed its rules regarding wearing masks for its customers and workers.

2021-05-23,"On CNBC's ""Options Action,"" Carter Worth said Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) is going to pop up on earnings. The company is going to report earnings on Thursday and the stock is trading close to its December highs. Worth analyzed Costco from a technical standpoint and noticed a bullish wedge pattern and a hedge and shoulder bottom pattern on its chart. He sees the stock as a breakout candidate on the earnings catalyst and he is looking for a 3% to 5% move. Mike Khouw said the stock is trading right now at a little more than 35.50 forward earnings and that is expensive as the range has been between 26 and 34, with an average multiple of 30. The options market is implying a 3.2% move in either direction, which is exactly what the company has averaged over the past eight quarters, said Khouw. He expects to see a modest move higher in Costco after the report so he wants to use a calendar call spread to make a bullish trade. Specifically, he wants to buy the July $385 call for $10.30 and sell the June $400 call for $2.57. The trade would cost him $7.73, which sets the break-even at $392.73 or 3.15% above the closing price on Friday. f the stock trades below $400 at the June expiry, the June $400 call would expire worthless so Khouw could sell another call to reduce the break-even level.

Parikh said, “We look very favorably upon COST’s long-term prospects. A few key factors underpin our views: 1) unique and improving consumer value proposition; 2) open-ended worldwide growth prospects; 3) leading competitive position poised to continue to drive share gains… However, given still difficult upcoming compares, cost pressures, and positive stimulus spending, the setup has gotten even more trickier. As a result, we view COST shares as appropriate for longer-term players.” The Wall Street community has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Costco’s stock. That’s based on 18 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $408.38 implies 5.4% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 1.9% year-to-date. Costco scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
