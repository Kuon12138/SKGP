Dobre raised his rating to outperform, after being at neutral for at least the past three years, and boosted his stock price target by 23% to $191 from $155. The stock had underperformed year to date, falling 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 7.8%, amid investor worries over trade wars and that growth had peaked. But Dobre said that while some of Caterpillar&apos;s end markets are close to peaking, he believes that more than 60% of sales are &quot;at or below mid-cycle levels.&quot; He also believes capital deployment remains a catalyst. Dobre also upgraded Manitowoc Co.  and Sun Hydraulics Corp.  to outperform from neutral.

## Stock market soared

After a massive sell-off on January 3, the major US indexes made a sharp recovery last Friday on several pieces of good news, thereby helping the market to end the first week of 2019 on a positive note finally. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ Composite gained 3.3%, 3.4%, and 4.3%, respectively, on January 4. The indexes ended the first three trading days of the year with returns of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.6%, respectively.

All 30 Dow Jones components recorded a sharp upswing on January 4. With an increase of 6.1%, Intel (INTC) stock was the biggest gainer among the Dow 30 components last Friday, followed by Caterpillar’s (CAT) and Boeing’s (BA) intraday gains of 5.5% and 5.2%, respectively.

Apple (AAPL) also bounced back with a 4.3% rise last Friday. The stock had plunged nearly 10% the day before after warning about a possible quarterly sales target miss due to trade tensions between the US and China. Apple’s sales target miss forecast and weak US factory activity data had triggered a massive broader market sell-off on January 3, sending all the three major US indexes down by over 2.5%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) invests 16.8% of its funds in Apple.

## Factors driving Friday’s rally

Last Friday’s stock market rally was a result of a trifecta of good news: a strong US job report, encouraging remarks on the interest rate policy from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and progress with the US-China trade talks.

The first positive news came in the form of the December 2018 job report published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which says the domestic economy created a significantly higher-than-expected job report last month. According to the data, non-farm payrolls surged by 312,000 in December and surpassed economists’ consensus estimates of 176,000 polled by the Dow Jones.

Additionally, monthly wages increased 3.2% from the year-ago quarter and 0.4% from the previous quarter. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor discarded concerns of a slowdown in the US economy. Later in the day, Powell at the American Economic Association event hinted that the central bank is ready to shift its stance on monetary policy and is flexible in deciding the timing of interest rate hikes. At the end of December, Powell had suggested raising interest rates three times in 2019. However, last Friday’s remarks pointed to a more liberal monetary policy from the Fed, and analysts and investors are expecting fewer or no hikes this year.

Additionally, news of trade talks between the US and China, which are slated to begin today, also made investors think that the two largest economies may resolve their trade dispute this time.","Powell, Jobs, Trade Talk News Helped Markets Jump on January 4"

But CAT is a cyclical stock, which means investors need to consider much more than just one- and two-year growth periods. After all, Caterpillar earnings are rising 200%+ over two years but they had declined 60% over the previous four.

Revenue dropped each year over that period. It was the first time ever (including during the Great Depression) that Caterpillar sales had fallen for four consecutive years.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



In theory, a cyclical stock like Caterpillar stock should be cheap at the top of the cycle. And the weakness in broad markets, along with an inverted yield curve, strongly suggests that the U.S. and global economies indeed are near a top.

If that's the case, the CAT stock price isn't nearly as cheap as it looks. But there are other factors to consider when it comes to Caterpillar stock. Three other key questions will help determine whether the market was right in selling off CAT or if the decline from January highs has created a buying opportunity.

### 1&#92;. Where Are We In the Cycle?

Again, the most important question for the CAT stock price is understanding where we are in the cycle. In theory, a cyclical like CAT or John Deere (NYSE:DE) should see its earnings multiple contract at the top of the cycle and expand at the bottom. That same phenomenon helps explain why chip stock Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) trades at less than 4x earnings.

Indeed, even when the CAT stock price hit multi-year lows in early 2016, the stock still traded at a high-teen multiple to what investors believed were depressed earnings.

Now, investors see something closer to a peak coming in 2019 or 2020 or worse if the economy turns. Few stocks have more political risk than CAT, as I wrote last month. And so the compressed multiple makes some sense.

Of course, that multiple only makes sense if the cycle actually is turning. And for all the worries in the market right now, there isn't a lot of evidence that turn is coming yet. In fact, Caterpillar posted a blowout Q3, with operating profit growth of 41%. YTD, revenue in Asia has risen 36% - with particular strength in China

For investors who believe the recent market sell-off is overdone, Caterpillar stock at least has to be given a long look.

### 2&#92;. Can Margins Go Any Higher?

From a cyclical standpoint, however, there is a concern in Caterpillar's numbers. Operating margins are at a peak. In fact, they're higher now than in 2012, when Caterpillar benefited from the so-called &quot;commodity supercycle&quot;.

For a cyclical stock, that's not necessarily good news. Peak margins generally aren't sustainable. Indeed, adjusted margins are 16.6% over the past four quarters, according to the company's Q3 presentation. They were just 7.2% in 2016 - and averaged 11% over the past six years.

If those margins settle back in even the 13-14% range, earnings drop over 10%, and the CAT stock price looks closer to 13-14x earnings. That's not far from the stock's historical rang, and in that context Caterpillar stock isn't all that cheap.

That said, it's possible that margins can at least stay around current levels. Caterpillar took billions of dollars in cost out of the business over the past couple of years. Those costs have risen of late - Caterpillar has added flexible workers of late - but been leveraged by revenue growth.

As such, margins probably should be higher than even the salad days of 2011 and 2012. The question is how much higher and for how long.

### 3&#92;. Will Cost Cuts Have a Cost?

That said, one interesting question is whether those cost cuts will have an impact at some point. Caterpillar's workforce dropped 20% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2017.

It's risen 7% over the past year, as sales have rebounded. But Caterpillar still is making the same amount of revenue on the back of roughly 15% fewer workers.

Is that, itself, sustainable?

I've long worried it might not be but performance over the past seven quarters would seem to suggest otherwise. It's possible if not likely at this point that Caterpillar simply is leaner. But even that means that there's likely little room left for improvement and not much the company itself can do to move margins much higher.

### 4&#92;. Is Caterpillar Stock the Best Cyclical Play?

Overall, it does look from here like the CAT stock price is a bit too cheap. Even assuming the ~$12 EPS this year is benefiting from cyclical help, recent cost cuts look sustainable at this point. Tax reform has helped net profit as well. It's not hard to model 'mid-cycle' EPS of $9-10, with a mid-teen multiple suggesting the CAT stock price should be in the $140 range, up ~10% or so from current levels.

The biggest issue, though, is whether Caterpillar stock is the best cyclical stock for investors who believe the sell-off has gone too far. As David Schawel pointed out on Twitter this week, cyclical stocks never have been as cheap on a relative basis as they are right now.

Construction industry stocks have been hammered, and several look cheap, including homebuilders like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and distributors like GMS (NYSE:GMS) and Beacon Roofing Supply (NASDAQ:BECN). CAT is a bit of a China play at this point - and there's no shortage of value stocks with exposure to that market.

A 2.7% dividend yield does help the case for Caterpillar stock, admittedly. Cyclical risk probably isn't quite as large here. Still, there are a number of good, cheap cyclicals out there. Caterpillar stock is one of them. But I'm skeptical it's the best or necessarily the cheapest.

As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of GMS Inc. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

View full report here!

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for CAT with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting CAT.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Positive

ETF activity is positive. Over the last month, growth of ETFs holding CAT is favorable, with net inflows of $24.14 billion. This is among the highest net inflows seen over the last one-year and the rate of additional inflows appears to be increasing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. CAT credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

On January 10, 2019, Deere (DE) announced that it had received six AE50 awards. The reward is presented by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers for innovative product-engineering designs in agriculture. It recognizes 50 innovative products chosen by international engineering experts. Deere received awards for the following products:

  * Command Pro joystick for 6R tractors
  * Bale mobile app
  * 2660VT, a variable-intensity tillage tool
  * Tracks

These kinds of innovations help Deere to launch new products and further help farmers to save time, costs, and labor. Joel Dawson, director of production and precision agriculture for Deere, said, “This year’s AE50 Awards reaffirms the innovative spirit of our employees and illustrates our company’s commitment to bringing those linked to the land the most useful, high-quality products possible.

## Summary

  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for CAT with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting CAT.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Neutral

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. CAT credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Morgan Stanley-One of most bearish S&P 500 target

Morgan Stanley’s (MS) chief equity strategist, Michael Wilson, is the most bearish on Wall Street regarding the projection for the S&P 500’s (SPY) target for the end of 2019. He thinks that stocks (VTI) (QQQ) will continue to struggle in 2019. Wilson kept his target for 2019 unchanged from 2018, which doesn’t imply any growth. According to CNBC, Wilson said he “sees more of the same” stagnant performance from major stock indexes in 2019.

## Rolling bear market

Wilson said, “After a roller coaster ride in 2018 driven by tighter financial conditions and peaking growth, we expect another range-bound year driven by disappointing earnings and a Fed that pauses.” Wilson has repeatedly characterized this market as a “rolling bear market.” He expects the S&P 500 to trade within a range of 2,400–3,000.

## Earnings deceleration

Investors have been concerned about the coming earnings cliff. For most of 2018, US equities have outperformed the rest of the world. However, the momentum seems to be stalling. According to FactSet, the earnings growth is expected to cool off from 20.1% in 2018 to 6.9% in 2019.

The S&P 500’s (SPY) net profit margin reached 12.0% in the third quarter. The margin expanded by 1.6 percentage points year-over-year and marked a record since FactSet started recording the data in 2008.

As pressure increases with higher raw material, energy, and labor costs and we see the impact from tariffs, the margins are expected to come off. The sugar high from the tax impact could wear off going into 2019. Several companies including Caterpillar (CAT), Ford (F), and 3M (MMM) have cited trade tariffs and China’s slowdown as headwinds for 2019 in addition to margin pressure in 2018.

2019-01-15,"Stocks are continuing to struggle with the 24,000 level on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as investors deal with various crosscurrents.

Parts of the Federal government remain shuttered. U.S.-China trade talks continue to grind on as the Chinese economy shows signs of slowing. The fate of Brexit remains unknown. And the Federal Reserve seems scatterbrained, unable to decide if it's dovish or hawkish after the harrowing market environment in December.

In keeping with the directionless feel, stocks opened strong on a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) price hike, but it is now cutting gains as trade talks seem to have hit another impasse. Bank earnings have also been disappointing with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) reporting the worst mortgage loan numbers since the financial crisis as the housing market slams into a wall.

  * 10 Companies That Could Post Decelerating Profits 



As a result, a number of iconic Dow Jones stocks look vulnerable to renewed downside pressure. Here are five such stocks to sell now:

### Caterpillar (CAT)

Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares look vulnerable to a reversal as CAT contends with resistance from four-months of overhead resistance. As such, CAT stock has set up a test of the recent lows near $117, which would be worth a decline of 10% from here as the U.S.-China trade talks go nowhere fast. This is poor timing for Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, who recently upgraded the stock to Buy.

The company will next report results on Jan. 28 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.98 per share on revenues of $14.3 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 23 earnings of $2.86 beat estimates by a penny on an 18.4% rise in revenues.

### Disney (DIS)

Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares are suffering a sharp reversal lower, falling back below its 50-day moving average to form a &quot;bearish engulfing&quot; candlestick that presages more weakness ahead. Not exactly the behavior investors were looking for ahead of the opening of the eagerly awaited Star Wars theme park areas in Disneyland and Disney World.

  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into 



DIS will next report results on Feb. 5 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.6 per share on revenues of $15.4 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 8, earnings of $1.48 per shear beat estimates by 13 cents on an 11.9% rise in revenues.

### Goldman Sachs (GS)

Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have stalled out near resistance at the $180-a-share level, setting up a likely reversal that tests the lows set in late December. Financial stocks overall are showing weakness this morning after earnings results from WFC and JPM revealed problems in mortgage loan activity and fixed income trading.

The company will next report results on Jan. 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $5.4 per share on revenues of $7.9 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 16, earnings of $6.28 per share beat estimates by 94 cents on a 3.8% rise in revenues.

### Home Depot (HD)

Shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are rolling lower after testing highs previously set in November and December. HD stock is remaining below its 200-day moving average as the one-time momentum favorite succumbs to the realization that the U.S. housing market is in trouble -- plagued by a combination of higher mortgage rates, absurd pricing and impacted affordability.

  * 7 Video Game Stocks on Steep Discount 



The company will next report results on Feb. 12 before the open. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.2 per share on revenues of $26.6 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 13, earnings of $2.51 per share beat estimates by 24 cents on a 5.1% rise in revenues.

### JPMorgan (JPM)

Shares of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are struggling to stay above the $100-a-share level and remain well below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The company reported results before the bell. Earnings of $1.98 per share missed estimates by 21 cents on an 8.1% rise in revenues. Management cited a decline in fixed income trading revenue, which dropped 16% from last year.

When the company last reported on Oct. 12, earnings of $2.34 per share beat estimates by 8 cents on a 7.8% rise in revenues. Watch for a test of the late December low as shareholders realize that loan growth and credit quality is vulnerable, setting up a 10% drop from here.

As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In the options pits, call volume jumped yesterday as traders took to the derivatives market to express their enthusiasm. Specifically, about 20.9 million calls and 16.3 million puts changed hands on the session.

The ramp in call trading made waves at the CBOE as well. The single-session equity put/call volume ratio plunged to 0.52 -- a new low for 2019. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average sunk to 0.63.

Here are three key stocks that landed on the most-active options list. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was flooded with activity ahead of today's ex-dividend date. Square (NYSE:SQ) benefited from news that it was releasing a free debit card to complement its payment processing system. Finally, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) saw increased trading ahead of last night's hotly anticipated earnings report.

Let's take a closer look:

### Caterpillar (CAT)

Caterpillar shares broke above short-term resistance amid a groundswell in volume. Its technical posture has improved considerably since the industrial giant was beaten senseless on recession fears following its last earnings release. Now it stands above a rising 50-day and 20-day moving average.

  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Rise of Menswear 



The breakout no doubt helped spur options demand, but the real reason CAT landed atop the most-actives list was the looming dividend payout. Caterpillar is trading ex-dividend today, so Thursday's dash for derivatives was aimed at controlling shares to capture the dividend. Shareholders of record at the close yesterday will be eligible to receive the upcoming dividend payout of 86 cents. CAT currently trades with a yield of 2.6%.

Traders came after calls with a vengeance. Total activity jumped to 512% of the average daily volume, with 157,361 total contracts traded. 81% of the trading came from call options.

Implied volatility slipped lower on the day to 37%, placing it at the 47th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves $3.11, or 2.3%.

### Square (SQ)

Momentum stocks are making a comeback, and it's arguably one of the best signs that the broad market is returning to healthy status. Square scored a high volume breakout that lifted it back above the 200-day moving average to complete its budding trend reversal attempts.

The news drove yesterday's bullish narrative. Square reported an expansion in its product offering with the creation of a free debit card allowing merchants to immediately spend money that was processed through Square without having to transfer it to a different bank account first.

On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts by a wide margin. Total activity jumped to 185% of the average daily volume, with 170,700 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 68% of the day's tally.

With the budding recovery, uncertainty is fading and implied volatility is falling accordingly. It now sits at 53% or the 34th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are  pricing gin daily moves of $2.31

### Netflix (NFLX)

Traders finally got their first look at whether or not this year's insane rebound in Netflix was justified. The media giant stepped up to the earnings plate last night and reported satisfying results to the Street. Rather than unwinding its recent rally or tacking on more, Netflix shares are almost unchanged in after-hours trading. As I type, NFLX sits down a mere 1.80%.

Here's a rundown of the numbers. On Q4 revenue Netflix missed analyst estimates reporting $4.19 billion versus the Street's expectation of $4.21 billion. Earnings per share came in at 30 cents versus estimates of 24 cents. Finally, total paid subscriber growth for the quarter was 8.8 million versus analyst expectations of 7.6 million.

On the options trading front, call and put activity was balanced on the day. Total trading ramped to 164% of the average daily volume, with 310,978 total contracts traded. Calls added 52% to the day's take.

Ahead of the earnings release, options were pricing in a move of $27.23, or 7.7%. So, with the stock only down $7 premarket, the earnings reaction was a snoozer. Premium sellers are waking up to a big win this morning.

Short interest is extremely low for CAT with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting CAT.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative and may be weakening. The net inflows of $18 million over the last one-month into ETFs that hold CAT are among the lowest of the last year and appear to be slowing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. Although CAT credit default swap spreads are decreasing, they are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-25,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.

This looks like one of the biggest earnings seasons in years. And next week, the earnings calendar is particularly crowded. Some of the market's largest stocks -- and best stocks -- report full-year earnings. If ever there was a time for earnings reports to lead the broad market higher, this is it.

Indeed, three of the four largest companies in the world by market capitalization -- with over $2 trillion in combined value -- are on next week's earnings calendar. And they represent just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has one of its most important earnings reports in years, as it tries to reverse a long slide. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) will give a key read on industrial demand and the health of the Chinese economy. Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) should give a hint as to how retailers will perform when they hit the earnings calendar next month.

  * 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



This is a week that will move the markets and likely determine trading for weeks to come. If the 2019 rally is going to continue, it's going to be the biggest and best stocks that will have to do the heavy lifting.

### Apple (AAPL)

Earnings Report Date: Jan. 29, after market close

The actual numbers in the fiscal Q1 report from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be somewhat anticlimactic. Apple already gave downside guidance for the quarter earlier this month, which led AAPL stock to plunge.

But Q1 earnings will matter. Quite clearly, the story around Apple stock has changed. The old bull case -- that Services growth could offset iPhone concerns -- has broken. And it's not clear what can replace it.

If there is a story that can re-inspire confidence in Apple stock, CEO Tim Cook needs to start telling it on Tuesday's conference call. Strong Q2 guidance would be a step in the right direction.

So even though the Q1 numbers won't be a surprise, investors still will have a lot to unpack from the report. And given Apple's size, and how many suppliers rely on the company for significant chunks of revenue, the takeaways are likely to reverberate across the tech sector.

### Microsoft (MSFT)

Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Jan. 30, after market close

I argued earlier today that the fiscal Q2 report from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might be the most important one on the earnings calendar this week. That's not necessarily for MSFT stock, but in terms of projecting how the market as a whole will trade in the coming months.

After all, there's little argument that Microsoft stock is one of the best stocks out there. The argument, rather, is over valuation. MSFT plunged in December with the broad market -- but it has rallied over 10% off those lows.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



So the reaction to Microsoft earnings on Wednesday afternoon will be telling. Are investors ready again to pay 24x forward earnings for a quality stock? Or is the market going to sell the news, as it did after a blowout Q1 report in October? How investors trade MSFT on Thursday and Friday might give real information as to how they plan to trade the market in February and March.

### Amazon.com (AMZN)

Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Jan. 31, after market close

There's an argument that earnings from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) aren't quite as important as the others on this list. AMZN stock isn't necessarily valued on 2018 or 2019 earnings. This is a case where the premium still applied to Amazon -- which trades at a whopping 62x 2019 EPS estimates -- is based on the company's long-term potential.

But there have been some signs of late that the story is cracking a bit. AMZN has rallied 30%-plus off brief December lows, but it's still almost 20% off its highs. Meanwhile, the stock fell after a disappointing Q3 report in October, one which may have accelerated the sell-off in higher-multiple tech names.

We've seen with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which has pulled back of late despite a strong earnings report, that valuations are starting to matter again. If Amazon's Q4 isn't better than its Q3, the 60X-plus forward P/E multiple may not hold. And investors very well may start asking if paying those kind of prices for any stock is worth it -- a question which could affect a number of smaller high-flyers as well.

As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-29,"What a run! The S&P 500 is up 5.5% for January, and higher by a hefty 12.7% since hitting a multimonth low in late December. Both are unusually big gains given the limited amount of time stocks have had to dish them out.

The rally, however, has left some stocks vulnerable to a pullback, while the names left out of the marketwide advance have been exposed as perpetually, habitually weak. Both groups are likely to lose ground -- or lose more ground -- no matter what lies ahead. But should the broad market falter here, these equities could really lose some ground.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of 10 stocks to sell as soon as possible. They're either overextended, in unstoppable downtrends or have a history of poor February performances. In no particular order…

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Xilinx (XLNX)

Up 62% since the end of 2017, and up 28% this year alone, the momentum that Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) has exhibited is intoxicating. Unfortunately, it probably wasn't built to last.

XLNX stock jumped 18% last Thursday in response to an incredible third-quarter report. The chipmaker has made the most of the advent of 5G, and said it expects more of the same kind of growth for the foreseeable future. Investors were still buying in on Friday.

As of Monday, though, the sheer weight of the oversized gain and the gap left behind on Thursday are forcing traders to rethink everything about this name and its forward-looking P/E of 28.5. The good news, past and projected, is now priced in, and then some.

### Mondelez International (MDLZ)

Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) hasn't earned a spot in a list of stocks to sell because it's overextended … quite the opposite actually. Although it has moved higher with the market since late December, it has suspiciously lagged behind. A look back over the course of the past couple of years, in fact, reveals Mondelez remains more likely to make lower highs and lower lows than not.

Investors just don't see the company overcoming its core problems anytime soon.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



Besides, February is rarely a good month for MDLZ stock. On average it loses a percentage point for the month ahead, and even in a good year, shares fall short of breaking even in February.

### United Continental Holdings (UAL)

United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) is another name that, for seasonal reasons, struggles during the second month of the year. On average, UAL stock loses more than 6% in February, and nothing about its performance so far in 2019 suggests the airline stock will be a screaming exception to the norm.

Admittedly, it's not an outlook that jibes with the recent headlines. Just a few days ago, United Continental capped off an outstanding 2018 with a fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat.

The headwind isn't about reality though. It's about perception. And right now, between an ongoing tariff war, a government shutdown and rebounding oil prices, the market is at least a little worried about the current quarter's likely results.

### Caterpillar (CAT)

Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is in a similar boat. That is, the impact of the trade war with China isn't exactly taking a massive toll on the company's bottom line. But, as long as the company is able to say steep tariffs -- coming and going -- are presenting problems, investors will assume the worst.

And that's exactly what Caterpillar did with its fourth-quarter report posted on Monday morning. While stopping short of outright blaming it on the war of tariffs and the subsequent economic slowdown in China, the company did concede weakness in China was the cause for the 4% slump in sales for its Asia Pacific arm.

  * 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



Though CAT stock fell measurably on the report, in the grand scheme of matters, they weren't terribly shocked. Caterpillar stock is still just trending lower from its early 2018 peak, and there's little on the radar that might reverse that trend in the coming month.

### Exact Sciences (EXAS)

Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) has been a champ of late, rallying nearly 60% from its late-December low, and up more than 70% over the course of the past twelve months.

EXAS stock, however, is a name with a history of major ebbs and flows. The big move we've seen since Dec. 26 has been made two, and arguably three, times since early 2018, and in each case a huge swath of that gain was given back. It's unlikely this time will pan out differently. It's just a habit this cancer diagnostics stock has developed.

Conversely, though due for a sizeable setback soon, the pattern Exact Sciences has developed also says it would be a compelling buy after a tumble.

### Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

It's difficult to bet against the company that essentially owns the gateway to the internet. But, add Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to your list of stocks to sell before getting too deep into the month of February. On average, GOOGL shares lose a little more than 2% during the second month of the year, and more than half the time it loses ground in February.

It doesn't appear to be in any major technical trouble right now, but it rarely does in late January.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



As was the case with Exact Sciences stock though, any dip from here could be a buying opportunity. GOOGL stock tends to start recovering in March or April to kick off a phenomenal second half of the year.

### Illumina (ILMN)

Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) is another name that's suspect simply because it has failed to rebound with the rest of the market.

Of course, the doubters had some help coming to their lackluster conclusions. In early January, the company cautioned investors that while its fourth-quarter revenue would be better than expected, 2019's sales wouldn't. CEO Francis deSouza was willing to offer 2019 earnings guidance slightly in excess of analysts' estimates, but for a stock priced at more than 40 times its forward-looking earnings estimates, investors need more assurance the premium they're paying is justified.

The fiscal outlook might be changed after Tuesday's post-close report. But, with ILMN stock already below all of its key moving average lines and in a well-framed downtrend, investors are hinting they're ready to see the glass as half-empty.

### Fiserv (FISV)

The knee-jerk reaction to the news that Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) would be acquiring First Data (NYSE:FDC) was a decidedly bearish one. Shares fell as much as 8.6% on Jan. 18, with many shareholders convinced the company was overpaying for an asset it didn't exactly need. Things took a dramatic turn beginning that very day though. The intraday loss was cut in half, and as of Tuesday FISV stock was 22% above the low made on Jan. 18. As it turns out, investors love the prospect of the pairing after all.

  * 7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy Now 



Still, the big move is overdone. As of Tuesday, would-be profit-takers are testing the waters, and it's unlikely the stock's going any higher until investors get a clear idea of what a combined Fiserv and First Data would look like.

### AbbVie (ABBV)

There's nothing inherently wrong with AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Though it missed its fourth-quarter revenue and earnings estimates, it's still a cash cow that's expected to grow its top and bottom lines this year. It's dirt cheap too, valued at only 8 times this year's expected profits.

Nevertheless, like a handful of the other stocks to sell in the coming month, AbbVie is facing an uphill battle of perception. Most drugmaker stocks are losing ground on fears that new drug-pricing legislation could be forthcoming. Meanwhile, ABBV has developed a strong downtrend of its own since peaking a year ago on worries about the fading patent protection of its blockbuster drug Humira.

### Keysight Technologies (KEYS)

Finally, Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) is one of a handful of stocks to sell for February after an incredible January rally that won't likely last.

Since its late-December low, KEYS stock has gained more than 28%, mostly thanks to the market's realization of the company's role in the rollout of 5G wireless connections. Once Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) launched an at-home 5G broadband platform in October, the technology became very real for investors. On the hunt for overlooked names in the business, investors found and fell in love with Keysight.

They arguably overshot though. Since it's now overbought much like it was a couple of different times last year, a reversion to the mean looks likely.

Options activity was a mixed bag on Monday. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) saw renewed options interest after cratering on weaker-than-expected earnings. Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) surged after a positive mention from Jim Cramer. Finally, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were slashed after the struggling chip company cut its revenue guidance.

Let's take a closer look:

### Caterpillar (CAT)

Caterpillar added legitimacy to global economic slowdown fears with yesterday morning's earnings report. The results were worth worrying about and sent the industrial giant's shares down 9.1% on the session. The downdraft echoed last quarter's beatdown, which saw CAT stock drop a similar amount.

For the fourth quarter, the struggling feline earned $2.55 earnings-per-share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Both measures missed the Street's estimates of $2.98 and $14.37 billion, respectively.

The plunge sent CAT shares back below the 20-day and 50-day moving average. Bad things happen on the south side of these smoothing mechanisms. With bears now dominating, I see little technical reason for optimism moving forward.

On the options trading front, calls dominated the session. Total activity swelled to 512% of the average daily volume, with 169,476 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 55% of the day's take.

With earnings out of the way, implied volatility fell to 36% and now sits at the 45th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $2.83 or 2.3%.

### Cronos Group (CRON)

Cronos Group was already high on hopes surrounding the potential of the growing marijuana market. But yesterday the sentiment shifted from optimistic to euphoric, sending CRON stock into the stratosphere. The catalyst appears to be the company scoring a mention from Jim Cramer, the host of &quot;Mad Money.&quot; After Friday's trading session he said Cronos Group was the second best company in the industry after Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC).

The endorsement was all the approval traders needed to pile into the Canadian cannabis producer. CRON shares have now gained 78% year-to-date.

On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Total activity jumped to 382% of the average daily volume, with 103,451 total contracts traded. 59% of the trading came from call options alone.

The demand surge drove implied volatility higher on the session to 107% -- a six-week high.

### Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia shareholders received a nasty surprise yesterday when the company pre-announced a reduction in its revenue expectations. Rather than waiting for its next quarterly report on Feb. 14, NVDA slashed its revenue guidance from $2.70 billion to $2.20 billion.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy With High ESG Momentum 



The once high-flying chip maker blamed &quot;deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China,&quot; for its revenue woes. Chart watchers will find the timing of Monday's 13.8% loss particularly annoying because it upended what was beginning to look like a clear bottoming pattern in the stock. NVDA had risen above the 50-day moving average for the first time since last October.

On the options trading front, calls and put volumes were balanced on the day. Total activity did increase to 270% of the average daily volume, with 499,285 total contracts traded. Puts accounted for 51% of the session's tally.

Implied volatility slipped slightly to 54%, placing it at the 52nd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $4.74 or 3.4%.

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock have seen outflows over the last one-month 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for CAT with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting CAT.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

## Economic sentiment

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. CAT credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-31,"What a difference a month can make! For years, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled its intentions to raise benchmark interest rates to cull prior monetary excess. Up until last December, the Fed maintained its hawkish stance. However, an about face suddenly brings up a new question: With this change, what are now the best stocks to invest in?

No one can overstate how important this announcement is for Wall Street. Upon the dovish shift, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.8% against the prior session. Before the Fed's change of heart, the markets traded relatively sideways. But with this fundamental overhang out of the way, the list of best stocks to buy just got bigger.

While the sudden swing may have taken investors off-guard, in fairness, the Fed didn't have much choice. Yes, the domestic economy is doing well, especially compared to international markets. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell didn't anticipate the continued economic hostilities between the U.S. and China.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As a result, the central bank had to respond in a way that wouldn't upset the markets' delicate balance. However, China isn't the only concern. Other pressing issues include surging dollar strength, recently softening consumer sentiment, and a tough housing market. With the Fed now acknowledging these headwinds, it's breathing new life into the best stocks to buy.

But don't think that the Fed has gone rogue. Powell expressed the importance of &quot;patience.&quot; In other words, if inflation isn't rising dramatically, there's no need to overreact. This prudent approach should help navigate our economy and calm unnecessary jitters in the markets.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



Plus, the Fed symbolically waved the green flag. So here are seven of the best stocks to buy off this dovish policy:

### American Electric Power (AEP)

Typically, utility firms don't immediately come to mind as among the best stocks to buy for a dovish Fed. If Powell is genuinely concerned about dollar strength, he's not going to mind the currency weakening against its international competitors. However, such a move raises energy and commodity costs, thus impacting names like American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).

But here's the thing: as a utility company, AEP stock enjoys consistent, recurrent demand. In fact, as we dive further into the information age, we're going to see increased demand for utilities, not less. So a rise in costs due to an inflationary dollar won't hurt AEP's profitability. Instead, they'll just pass on the costs to the consumer without consequence.

That might sound cynical, but I'm speaking with positive intentions. For one thing, American Electric Power is a well-run organization with an eye towards future industry developments. Moreover, AEP stock features a nice 3.4% dividend yield.

Even if the markets stumble against the Fed's best efforts, AEP will still bring something to shareholders.

### Exxon Mobil (XOM)

While President Donald Trump loved boasting about the markets when they were moving higher, individual stories forwarded questionable results. For instance, several construction-related companies like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) took off when Trump won, presumably because of the border-wall project. But for others like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), they have a more nuanced perspective.

Immediately following the election, XOM stock enjoyed a massive burst of bullishness. However, that sentiment quickly faded once 2017 rolled around. Despite some big, singular moments, Exxon Mobil has largely disappointed shareholders. Later in the fourth quarter of 2018, macroeconomic concerns dropped XOM from most people's short list of best stocks.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



Trump must take responsibility for some of the bearishness. Throughout his presidential campaign, he sharply rebuked former Fed Chair Janet Yellen's accommodative monetary policies. But with the world's most powerful central bank reversing course, XOM stock has a chance to rebound.

Source: Qualcomm 

### Qualcomm (QCOM)

In recent years, technology firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has given shareholders fits. In one moment, the company appears like one of the best stocks ever. But after a brief spell, QCOM stock comes crashing down to earth, only to repeat the cycle later.

Most recently, the tech icon slipped on the worsening U.S.-China trade war. But another overriding headwind has worried shareholders: a rising dollar. As the greenback gains in strength, it limits Qualcomm's competitiveness overseas. More than once, we've heard the impact about unfavorable currency exchange rates during an earnings report.

For QCOM stock, this matter takes on a greater urgency. Last year, 67% of total revenue came from China, including Hong Kong. The Chinese already play tough, and some would argue dirty. A currency headwind is therefore the last thing you want as a Qualcomm stakeholder

But if I'm reading the Fed correctly, the central bank understands these challenges. If so, QCOM stock may have received a lifeline.

### DR Horton (DHI)

Prior to the Fed coming to their senses (as some might argue), homebuilder DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) was among the worst stocks to buy for purely understandable reasons. The fallout from the sub-prime-mortgage crisis has made home ownership increasingly difficult. But with a hawkish monetary policy, DHI stock appeared dead in the water.

Indeed, shares slipped badly in the beginning of 2018, then meandered aimlessly until another big drop. Based on the technical charts, it's difficult to argue against a correlation between DHI stock and Fed policy. But when Powell released his statements, DR Horton suddenly found a second wind.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



Undoubtedly, real estate has a long way to go. A substantial headwind comes from the millennial demographic, which haven't warmed to home ownership like prior generations. Surely, the Fed's dovish stance won't change this factor overnight. However, it does give DHI stock a chance.

### LGI Homes (LGIH)

Similar to DR Horton, LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH) fell off most people's list of best stocks to invest in for 2018. From the get-go, LGIH stock experienced significant volatility. Eventually, the narrative completely collapsed in September, sending shares down into the doldrums.

That said, LGI Homes has started to win back the investors it lost during last year's pummeling. Against the January opener, LGIH stock has gained over 29%. And of course, with the Fed backing off from its hawkish threats, shares don't have the overhang to worry about.

Additionally, LGIH has one potential ace up its sleeve: Chinese buyers. As China's wealthy class increases in number, the astute among them are seeking stable investments to protect their money. Western real estate, particularly in the U.S. market, appeals for obvious reasons.

A critical advantage that LGI levers is location, location, location. Primarily featuring in the coastal areas, as well as burgeoning inland markets, the company offers an exceptionally-attractive portfolio.

### AngloGold Ashanti (AU)

It's a predictable but generally reliable strategy: when the economy hurts, gold is king. Even with the Fed addressing fundamental headwinds, precious metals can have a viable place in your portfolio. That's because a dovish monetary policy is usually inflationary for the dollar, thereby driving gold prices.

But if you don't want the hassle of physical bullion, miners can be some of the best stocks to invest in. Among them, AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU) stands out sharply. AU stock has gotten off to a strong start in 2019, gaining over 10%. That was before the Fed changed its outlook. With a dovish policy, AU could jump even higher.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



Better yet, a bullish market in gold should help boost AngloGold's financials. After commodities and energy got blitzed in the middle part of this decade, AU stock is on the recovery track. With the Fed aligning with AngloGold's interests, we're in for an interesting 2019 and beyond!

Source: Shutterstock 

### Sibanye Gold (SBGL)

If the Fed maintains its dovish monetary policy -- or even magnifies it -- you'll want to consider Sibanye Gold (NYSE:SBGL). Despite its name, SBGL stock is more than just a gold miner. With its acquisition of Stillwater Mining, Sibanye has exposure to the critical platinum market.

Often times, the best stocks to buy achieve that lofty status due to their potential for strong demand. However, with SBGL, the supply-demand picture is already extremely favorable. To illustrate, all the platinum that has ever been mined could fit inside an average living room.

What's more, platinum has significant industrial, technological and biochemical uses. Naturally, if platinum is used for these purposes, it's difficult if not impossible to recover. That only boosts mining companies like SBGL that specialize in this precious metal.

Still, like any player in this sector, you want to approach cautiously. Sibanye Gold has sharply rising debt levels, which may not be suitable for conservative investors. But if you want to speculate on the Fed, SBGL stock has the right stuff.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold and platinum.

2019-01-31,"Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) popped after the global air and defense giant reported robust fourth-quarter numbers which were essentially flawless across the board. You had the biggest earnings beat in several quarters for Boeing, and the biggest revenue beat in several years. You had record revenues and profits in Q4, and record revenues, profits, and cash flow in 2018. Every operating segment reported above-average and double-digit revenue growth, alongside robust margin expansion. The guide was strong. BA stock jumped 6.25%.

Overall, it was simply a fantastic quarter. And it came on the heels of other industrial giants like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) reporting weaker-than-expected numbers.

In the big picture, strong fourth-quarter numbers and a healthy 2019 guide together imply that Boeing stock will hit all-time highs in 2019. The share price peaked a year ago. Then, as 2018 wore on, global growth concerns stung the stock, driving down the shares some 25%. BA stock has since rebounded but it's still not near those record highs.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Frankly, there's no reason this stock shouldn't be at peak prices. The company is firing on all cylinders and underlying trends imply that this strength will persist for a lot longer. Against that backdrop, Boeing stock should trade north of $400.

It will. As 2019 rolls on, equities will broadly head higher and Boeing stock won't be an exception. By the end of the year, this stock could be closing in on $450. As such, buying here below $390 seems like a pretty good idea.

### Boeing's Q4 Numbers Were Great

Across the board, Boeing's Q4 report was nothing short of exceptional.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



To cap off a year that had record revenue, profits, and cash flow, Boeing reported quarterly numbers that included record revenue and profits. Revenue rose 14% year-over-year, and operating margins expanded 310 basis points (bps). The commercial airplane deliveries grew by 14%, above the 6% 2018 pace. Margins expanded 400 bps due to a favorable product mix, and the backlog remained enormous at ~$410 billion.

The defense, space, and security business grew by 16% in the quarter, better than 2018's 13% growth rate. Margins expanded 60 bps, also thanks to a favorable product mix. The backlog remained robust at ~$60 billion. It was the same story in the global services business. Revenue growth was big (29%) and above average (17% growth in 2018), while margins expanded 30 bps.

The guide was also strong. All three businesses (airplanes, defense, and global services) are expected to grow revenues next year at a healthy clip (3% to 13%), while margins at all three segments are also expected to expand, including about 500 bps of margin expansion in the defense group. Total revenue growth is expected at 9% next year, and core EPS is expected to rise 25%.

Overall, the quarter was phenomenal. While the global economy is slowing, Boeing isn't. At all. If anything, things are getting better at the company. This speaks to the strength of Boeing's secular growth narrative, and the company's (and BA stock's) ability to withstand broader economic noise. That's a good thing which positions Boeing stock for further gains in 2019.

### Secular Drivers Imply Continued Strength

Boeing is well entrenched in several secular growth industries.

On the airline front, global travel demand is expected to surge over the next 20 years due to global urbanization and a shift towards an experience-driven consumer economy that values travel. As this demand grows, demand for new equipment will increase, too, and Boeing's airplane numbers will only get bigger.

Meanwhile, defense spend is another thing that won't go away anytime soon. While it may be volatile depending on the geopolitical situation, defense spend won't ever dry up or drop in a big way. Instead, it will grow fairly consistently with the broader global economy.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



When it comes to space, investment into commercial space travel will only pick up over the next several years, thanks to improving technological capabilities and growing consumer interest in space travel. This growing interest will inevitably push Boeing's numbers higher. Also, the air mobility market is a highly undervalued and underappreciated aspect of Boeing that could provide a huge boost to BA stock.

With its reach into such a broad range of secular growth industries that won't slow in the foreseeable future, Boeing's growth trajectory should remain healthier for longer.

### Prices Above $400 Make Sense In 2019

In the big picture, Boeing stock deserves to trade above $400, and it will likely hit those levels this year.

The company's airline business is a 3%-5% grower over the next several years, while the defense and space businesses are probably 5% growers. Flying cars could add a few billion dollars in revenue, while the global services business should continue to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate.

Putting all that together, roughly $135 billion in revenue seems achievable by 2024. If revenue does head towards that level, that will allow for natural operating leverage, while gross margins should also trend higher due to favorable product mixes. Consequently, $135 billion in revenue by 2024 could happen alongside 15% operating margins. That combination -- plus buybacks -- makes $33 in core EPS seem doable by 2024.

Based on a historically average 18x forward multiple, that equates to a 2023 price target for Boeing stock of nearly $600. Discounted back by 8% per year (10% average discount rate less 2% yield), that implies a 2019 price target for BA stock of right around $440, or almost 14% upside.

### Bottom Line on BA Stock

Boeing's blowout fourth-quarter earnings report underscores that the BA growth narrative isn't entirely dependent on global economic growth. Instead, because demand for the company's products are benefiting from secular trends, the Boeing growth narrative will remain healthy for the next several years, even if the global economy slows.

That reality implies that Boeing stock should trade at all time highs. It will in 2019. Eventually, BA stock will break above $400, and trend toward $450.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BA.

2019-02-04,"A grizzly earnings report in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is warning investors off and on the price chart that all is not well. And following a helpful and less-menacing dead cat bounce, it's time for bearish traders to dig in with a well-placed short in Caterpillar stock.

Let me explain.

It has been a week since machinery equipment giant CAT stock announced a damaging profit miss and issued much weaker-than-forecast earnings guidance for 2019. Citing trade war tariffs and weaker demand from China, Caterpillar shares were bulldozed lower by more than 9% in the report's immediate aftermath.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

By the numbers, CAT offered adjusted earnings of $2.55 per share compared to Street views of $2.99. The profit miss was somewhat tempered by in-line sales of $14.34 billion which grew by 11% year-over-year. Still, at the end of the day, literally and figuratively, Caterpillar's quarterly revenues proved no match for the company's weak profit outlook of $11.75 to $12.75 per share versus estimates of $12.73.

To be fair, with U.S. markets clawing higher to their best levels in nearly two months by week's end on items such as a temporary halt to the government shut-down, dovish Fed action and mostly better-than-feared earnings elsewhere, CAT did cut its immediate post-earnings loss by more than half and finished off 4.35% for the five-day period.

The price action in Caterpillar stock and more recent market supports may force traders to wonder about the difference that a week can make. The answer is that sometimes it makes a big difference. Since markets are cyclical, they're known to abruptly shift directions often enough. However, I don't think that's the situation with CAT stock. Despite a substantial correction in 2018, I believe CAT shares are poised to move lower.

### Caterpillar Stock Weekly Chart

  
Following six straight weeks of respite for the broader averages and what appears to be a dead cat bounce that has more or less filled an earnings hole on turf owned by the bears, it's game on for a short in Caterpillar stock.

Bottom or squiggly-price line, shares of CAT have signaled a fresh lower high pattern on the weekly price chart slightly beneath the 200-day simple moving average. That's bearish and should serve as a nice pattern entry set against resistance for traders willing to commit to a short in Caterpillar shares.

There's more too. Following its own five-week-long rally, Caterpillar's drop in price could be a canary in the coal mine, similar to its leading bearish action in 2018, and warning of more downside to come. For traders agreeable to shorting CAT stock, I'd recommend using a stop above $138.75. That currently amounts to risk of around 6%.

The amount of exposure with this short entry is manageable on a percentage basis, but it also serves to give bearish traders a bit of extra wiggle room above the recent high of $137.72 and longer-term moving average. This should help traders avoid getting shaken out of a position prematurely, while at the same time, not overstaying their welcome.

2019-02-14,"Yesterday analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares of global agricultural equipment giant Deere (NYSE:DE) on concerns that the market wasn't looking at DE stock correctly.Namely, the analysts pointed out that Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been the poster child for the U.S.-China trade war, and that CAT stock has consequently been hit. But Deere has been viewed as less vulnerable to the conflict, and DE stock has consequently weathered the trade war much better. But the analysts argued that this discrepancy makes no sense, and that DE is just as vulnerable as Caterpillar to the U.S.-China trade war.This note resonated with me for two reasons. First of all, DE stock has performed much better than CAT stock, yet both have broad exposure to the trade war. Secondly, and more importantly, the valuation discrepancy between DE stock and CAT stock is nearing levels that have boded badly for DE stock in the past.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Should You Buy, Sell, Or Hold These 7 Medical Cannabis Stocks? As a result, I think the Bank of America analysts are right. Deere is a great company. But DE stock is out over its skis. The technicals, valuation, and sentiment of DE stock are hitting ceilings.Overall, DE stock is maxing out. Deere stock may not fall sharply. But it will likely trade sideways for the foreseeable future. Deere Has Plenty of Trade-War ExposureOver the past year, Deere stock is up 3%, while Caterpillar stock is down over 10%. Meanwhile, so far in 2019, as of yesterday, DE stock had risen nearly 10%, while Caterpillar stock was up less than 5%.Given those metrics, one would reasonably assume that Caterpillar has far more exposure to trade-war headwinds than DE. But that's not entirely true.China, the world's largest soybean importer, used to buy most of its soybeans from the U.S. But as the U.S.-China trade war heated up in 2018, China started relying more heavily on soybeans imported from Argentina and Brazil. Indeed, China didn't buy any soybeans from the U.S. during a six-month stretch in 2018That boycott caused the U.S. to accumulate record soybean inventories. China is slowly starting to buy U.S. soybeans again. But it's not buying enough of them to meaningfully dent the record inventory levels. Thus, heading into the spring planting season, U.S. farmers have way too many soybeans. That means they aren't incentivized to plant that many soybeans this season, and that could ultimately prove to be a major demand headwind for DE.In other words, there will not be adequate demand for Deere's farming equipment this year unless China buys a ton more soybeans. That's anything but certain. Consequently, DE stock can be badly hurt by a continuation of the trade war, and those risks don't seem to be priced into Deere stock. DE Stock Is Maxed OutFrom almost every standpoint, DE stock looks like it is getting ready to reach a ceiling soon.On the valuation front, CAT stock historically has almost always had a larger trailing price-sales multiple than Deere stock. Every once in a while, DE stock rallies when CAT stock doesn't, causing DE's sales multiple to surpass CAT's sales multiple. That rarely happens (it's only occurred once in the past five years), but when it does, it's a leading indicator that DE stock is topping out.Now DE's sales multiple is just a fraction below CAT's sales multiple. As a result, the relative valuation of DE stock looks close to a high pointOn the technical front, DE is nearing the top end of its 52-week trading range. The stock has tested these $160-plus highs multiple times over the past year, but it's never stayed at those levels very long. The Relative Strength Index of Deere stock is also nearing overbought territory, and the stock is about as far above its 50-day moving average as it's been in the past year.On the sentiment front, analysts have grown increasingly skeptical about DE stock as it has risen over the past few months. Back in December and January, the consensus, sell-side rating on the stock was &quot;buy.&quot; In February, though, a bunch of &quot;buy&quot; ratings have shifted to &quot;hold&quot; ratings, and now most analysts have &quot;hold&quot; ratings on DE stock.Overall, it simply looks like Deere stock is getting close to a high point. The Bottom Line on DE StockDeere is a great company. But in light of the underappreciated and misunderstood trade-war risks that DE is facing, DE stock has hit levels which simply aren't supported by the fundamentals. As a result, DE looks like it's about to hit a ceiling.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(NYSE:CAT) trade as well as an alert when it's time to take profits, sign up for a risk-free trial of Strategic Trader today.This morning, we're recommending a bullish trade on Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the manufacturer of construction and mining equipment.Like most industrials, CAT has been the victim of the &quot;trade war,&quot; which has put pressure on the stock as it consolidated between $120-$135 per share over the last few months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are short-term signs that the stock is starting to break out of that consolidation range, and we think this is a good opportunity for us to take a position. CAT's Fundamental Outlook is ImprovingFrom a fundamental perspective, CAT has been increasing free cash flow and earnings per share since the contraction in the energy sector in 2016. We think the stock is undervalued, especially considering the improving prospects for a U.S.-China trade deal.This is also the beginning of another round of production cuts by OPEC and OPEC+ members that is designed to send the price of oil higher again. They were eventually successful at a similar campaign in 2016-2017, which was good for U.S. domestic producers and heavy equipment manufacturers as rising prices increased demand for equipment. Inverted &quot;Head-and-Shoulders&quot; PatternFrom a technical perspective, CAT is just breaking through an inverted &quot;head-and-shoulders&quot; pattern that has bullish implications. The last time CAT completed a technical pattern like this, it rallied through most of September 2018.Daily Chart of Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT) -- Chart Source: TradingViewNow, with the fundamental picture looking good, CAT could break out of the $120-$135 range it has been in since November. We think a position in CAT makes sense, but doing it through a hedged position using short-puts allows us to control our risk to a greater degree.We can sell puts on CAT and collect premium as CAT rises. If it finds support at the upper end of its consolidation range, our puts will expire worthless, and we will keep all the premium from selling the options.To find out which CAT puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

2019-02-26,"Will bulls find a little more gas in the tank to push stocks higher or will equities take a much-needed breather after the S&P 500's 19% two-month rally? Either way, we're still seeing strong moves in individual stocks, as highlighted by our list of must-see stock trades. Must-See Stock Trades 1: Home DepotDespite a consistent and dependable business, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) shares are under pressure after a disappointing earnings report. Shares were coiling nicely below $192.50, ready to launch higher had the report been more well-received.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Instead, HD stock gapped down to $182.50 before reversing higher. Despite the rebound, shares are still below the 200-day and 21-day moving averages, as bulls look to see if they can erase the post-earnings deficit in the stock price.So what now? In a non-catastrophic way, HD stock is sort of in no man's land right now.Below the 200-day and above the 50-day, the stock is clearly searching for direction. With that in mind, over the 200-day and $190, bulls can be long HD and look for more upside. Below the 50-day and the stock is likely heading for the $170-ish level, where buyers have traditionally stepped up to buy the name. Must-See Stock Trades 2: CaterpillarA double-downgrade to sell from UBS has Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) under pressure on Tuesday. While selling off, buyers were quick to step up and keep CAT over the 200-day. That's encouraging action.Unfortunately though, it may take time for Caterpillar to push higher. While the economy is holding steady in the U.S., China is quite suspect at this time. Earnings last month were mixed at best and short of a trade deal between the two countries, CAT stock is lacking catalysts at the moment.The action here is encouraging though and so long as CAT is over its major moving averages and uptrend support (purple line), I'm not going to get overly bearish. Over $142 and CAT could make its way up to $155 resistance. Must-See Stock Trades 3: Shake ShackWe're seeing a lot of similar action across the board, which is ill-received news to a particular stock and buyers bidding them up off the lows. It will be interesting to see if that post-earnings momentum can continue in a name like Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) or if the bears will undo the bulls' effort.In the case of SHAK, the stock continues to hold up over short-term uptrend support (purple line) and prior downtrend resistance (blue line). Over the two-day high (call it $54), SHAK could make a run at the 200-day near $56. Above that and a run to $60+ is in the cards.On a pullback, I really want to see $46 hold. Near that area, it could be a great risk/reward long trade with the 50-day moving average, prior downtrend resistance and level support all in that area. Below is obviously bad news for the bulls. Must-See Stock Trades 4: J.M. SmuckerA series of lower highs has J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) again testing the $100 level. Over the years, we have been buyers of this dividend stock at or a below $100 and riding the pops higher. However, that trade is happening with increasing frequency and that has me worried about the validity of this $100 level.You know how the old saying goes, &quot;the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to break.&quot;Even with Tuesday's spunky earnings rally, SJM is again logging a lower high. That may be premature, as the stock can continue higher in the ensuing days to negate the pattern, but as of now, it doesn't look promising. Ordinarily I'm a buyer of SJM at $100, but I'm considering being a seller below $100. On a close below this mark, shorts can use the 50-day or 200-day as their stop-loss, whichever they're most comfortable with. Must-See Stock Trades 5: HertzI've never been a big fan of Hertz (NYSE:HTZ), at least when it comes to the stock.

2019-03-05,"U.S. equities are pausing for breath on Tuesday as major technical resistance levels fail to relax their grip on the major indices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit an air pocket around the 26,000 level. The S&P 500 has hit a pocket near 2,800. These are the first major pauses since stocks bottomed on Christmas Eve.A number of factors are in play. Weeks of positive rumors have failed to develop into a hard trade agreement between the United States and China. Profit takers have suddenly emerged. Some of the economic data, particularly out of Europe, has been disconcerting. And President Trump is the target of a new series of investigations out of the House of Representatives, raising political risk.But there is good news as well, suggesting the upswell could soon resume. Retailers have been reporting good results. The job market remains red hot. And the Federal Reserve is maintaining its newly dovish tact.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 3 Consumer Finance Stocks to Buy for the Future of Fintech As a result, a number of large-cap stocks that missed out on the initial surge higher are looking ready to run. Here are four to watch: Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares have recently popped up and over their 200-day moving average and are now consolidating the move, building a base of support near its early December high setting up a possible attempt at the early October levels. Such a move would be worth a gain of 15% from here. The move comes despite a recent downgrade by analysts at UBS citing concerns about revenues and margins in 2020.CAT will next report results on April 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.86 per share on revenues of $13.3 billion. When the company last reported on January 28, earnings of $2.55 per share missed estimates by 44 cents on an 11.2% rise in revenues. General Electric (GE)As far as large-cap stocks go, not many people have been talking up General Electric (NYSE:GE) recently. But shares are closing in once again on their 200-day moving average, setting up an upside breakout for the first time since late 2016 -- after which shares suffered an epic 80% meltdown. Since bottoming in early Decembers, the bulls have cobbled together a 60%+ rally on glimmers of hope management's turnaround plans are finally getting traction.  * Why NOW Is the Time to Buy Gene Therapy Stocks The company will next report results on April 18 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 13 cents per share on revenues of $28.11 billion. When the company last reported on January 31, earnings of 17 cents per share missed estimates by five cents on a 5.3% rise in revenues. Walmart (WMT)Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shares are in the midst of a long sideways consolidation range going back eight months, but should be good at the very least for a rally to the November highs -- which would be worth a gain of more than 7% from here. The level is also associated with the early 2018 highs, so I would become a seller of this large-cap stock near those levels.The company will next report results on May 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.02 per share on revenues of $124.4 billion. When the company last reported on February 19, earnings of $1.41 per share beat estimates by eight cents on a 1.9% rise in revenues. Walt Disney (DIS)Shares of Disney (NYSE:DIS) have been trading within a range going back to July, which in turn caps a range going all the way back to the summer of 2015. Investors haven't had a lot to be excited about since the relaunch of the Star Wars franchise and the consolidation (and great success) of creative universes like Marvel. But new things are coming, from the launch of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge theme parks to an upcoming streaming service.  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound The company will next report results on May 7 after the close.

A dovish outcome is expected, with the &quot;dot plot&quot; expected to come down to reflect only a single rate hike in 2019 and another single hike in 2020.The bulls are feeling confident, once again pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average up and over the 26,000 level for the fourth time since prices peaked back in October 2018. Will this rally in Dow Jones stocks have staying power?It looks that way, with global central banks doing all they can to paper over the volatility suffered late last year. With inflation at bay, they don't have much reason to play the tough cop act the market hates so much.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary With that in mind, here are five Dow Jones stocks that have lagged the market's rise -- and will be critical in helping push the Dow definitively past the 26,000 threshold. Boeing (BA)  Click to EnlargeBoeing (NYSE:BA) shares have stabilized after hitting major turbulence in connection to the two fatal crashes of 787 MAX aircraft because of what looks like a design flaw connected to an anti-stall system.

Goldman Sachs (GS)  Click to EnlargeShares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are emerging from a three-month consolidation range, pushing towards its 200-day moving average in what looks like a possible end to a downtrend that traces back to early 2018.

2019-03-25,"Last week's plunge in bond yields is fanning the flames of recession fears once more. Bulls are cowering in their hidey-holes and bears are finally starting to feast -- really for the first time this year. And that gives us an attractive backdrop to begin seeking out weak stocks to trade.Finding stocks to sell has been a challenging endeavor in 2019. Ever since the early-January transformation of the Federal Reserve from hawk to dove, it's been game on for risk assets. But last week's yield curve inversion has investors spooked.  * 3 Things to Watch for Cronos Group Stock Ahead of Earnings My weekend scanning found numerous bearish looking charts that are worthy of mention. Today I'll mention the top three stocks to trade. They remain vulnerable to further downside as long as recessions and inverted yield curves dominate the market narrative.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  FedEx (FDX)The bear case for FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares is compelling on both a technical and fundamental front. To fully feature the depravity of its downturn, I'm featuring a weekly chart. Since topping in early-2018, the transportation titan has cratered 37% and now rests below all major moving averages.The January-February rebound created a classic bear retracement pattern that already triggered to the downside.On the fundamental front, earnings are deteriorating, and during last week's quarterly report the company cited slowing global growth as one of its key concerns moving forward.To bank on continued weakness, buy the May $175/$165 bear put spread for around $3.70.  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  Caterpillar (CAT)The price action in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has echoed the bearish steps of FedEx. CAT stock was demolished in the fourth quarter amid economic slowdown fears, and it has yet to find its footing. Indeed, the daily chart is a volatile mess -- making it one of the top stocks to trade right now.January's large earnings miss and subsequent down-gap in the stock is keeping the sluggish global economy talk in the forefront. With Friday's high volume drop taking CAT back below its 50-day moving average, a new down-leg is upon us.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend The recent uptick in implied volatility is breathing new life into option premiums. So let's create a cash flow play. Sell the April $138/$142 bear call spread for 55 cents. If CAT sits below $138 at expiration, you will capture the max gain of 55 cents.  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  Bank of America (BAC)For our stock to trade, we're turning to the banking sector. Banks are particularly vulnerable during times when the yield curve inverts due to the pressure it puts on their profitability. Remember, short-term interest rates signify what banks pay depositors and thus represents an expense. Long-term rates represent what they charge when lending and thus represent income.During periods of yield-curve inversion, their income potential drops while expenses stay the same or rise. That's a toxic brew for any company. Tack on the inverted yield curves' impeccable track record for predicting recessions and it's no wonder why banks bit the dust on Friday.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) upended its recovery efforts by shattering support last week. It's oversold, yes, but there remains little reason to be bullish here.Bet on more pain by purchasing the June $27 puts for around $1.45.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bearish positions on FDX.

2019-04-10,"U.S. equities are under pressure on Wednesday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi failed to reassure investors amid evidence of an economic slowdown across Europe. Trying to recapture the magic of his 2012 &quot;whatever it takes&quot; statement, he said the institution wasn't worried about recession risk since it was ready to use &quot;all instruments&quot; to support growth with monetary policy.Markets yawned. Central bankers suddenly seem less than omnipotent.Adding to the pressure is ongoing problems for Boeing (NYSE:BA) with a lawsuit filed for allegedly defrauding investors after two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft.

2019-04-12,"Stocks were back and forth all day on Thursday, and by the time the closing bell rang, the game ended in a tie. The S&P 500 only mustered an 0.11 point gain yesterday, which wasn't even enough to register a percentage change. Underscoring the lack of conviction behind the action is the fact that yesterday's was the lowest-volume day in months.Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) wasn't fazed by the broad lethargy. Its budding recovery effort was bolstered by whispers that it would soon be putting itself up for sale, sparking a 3.9% advance. At the other end of the spectrum, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) fell 4.3% on the heels of growing political uncertainty regarding the future healthcare. Thursday's jaw-dropper was the 10% tumble Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WTW), now called WW, took after JPMorgan analyst Christina Brathwaite rang the alarm bells about the company even louder than she had been.Headed into the week's final trading session, the stock charts of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) are worth the closest looks. Here's why, and what's about to happen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips ConocoPhillips (COP)Most oil stocks are doing reasonably well, catching a tailwind driven by the rising price of oil. That dynamic, however, hasn't applied universally. The oil names that aren't being picked up by that rising tide stand out -- and do so for the wrong reason.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives ConocoPhillips is one of those names, and worse, is knocking on the door of a major breakdown. One more poor day could push COP over the edge.  Click to Enlarge • The line to watch is right at $65, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart. That's where ConocoPhillips has made lows since February, and where it found support before the December drubbing.• There may be even more to that technical floor than readily meets the eye. Plotting Fibonacci retracement lines from the well-established floor at $42 from 2017, the $65.60 area is also a key 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line. Notice the other Fibonacci line at $56.60 has also been a key support level.• It's subtle, and perhaps means little. But, yesterday's small pullback took shape on huge volume. There could be a lot of sellers just waiting in the wings for a triggering event. Caterpillar (CAT)Last year was a tough one for Caterpillar, and by extension, for CAT shareholders. After a fantastic 2017 that served up promise of a major earnings revival, fears of rising steel prices and a tariff war put Caterpillar shares back in a downtrend. From its January-2018 peak near $173 to October's low of $112, CAT stock lost a total of 35% from high to low.Over the course of the past few months, however, we've seen hints that the downtrend has been snapped. The new uptrend isn't fully formed yet, but the lines in the sand are very well defined.  Click to Enlarge • The key from here is getting above $142.80, where Caterpillar peaked a couple of times since October's capitulatory low. That resistance level is plotted in yellow on both stock charts.• At the same time, since October's bottom, the bulls have managed to form a clear rising support line, plotted in red on both stock charts.• While a move above $142.80 is still the make-or-break event, the possibility of that happening is bolstered by the golden cross that formed on Thursday. That's where the purple 50-day moving average line crosses above the white 200-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS)When we last looked at Morgan Stanley back on April 5, we were impressed by the breakout thrust that attacked the 200-day moving average line, but were concerned about a gap that had been left behind in the process. It was a perfect setup for the bears to push back.And they did, as would be expected with any fresh encounter with a major moving average line. It's what happened in the meantime and what's about to happen that makes MS worth a refreshed look.  Click to Enlarge • Morgan Stanley danced with the 200-day moving average line for a day, but slipped back under it. That slide, however, was just enough to almost close the gap that had been left behind on the April 3.• At the same time, the technical ceiling around $45, marked with a yellow dashed line on both charts, still stands and augments the potential resistance made by the 200-day moving average line.• Though not yet over that one last hump, if Morgan Stanley shares can clear that line, there's little left to hold a rally back.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-16,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Far too often, investors view stocks through a one-dimensional lens. A search for dividend stocks may lead one to only consider current yields, for instance, while ignoring the pace at which that company's payout improves over time. At the other end of the spectrum, many solid growth stocks may have been overlooked only because investors didn't factor in an impressive dividend or dividend growth history.In other words, there's often more to the story, and those details can really matter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of some of the market's top dividend growth stocks … names that aren't getting the respect they deserve because traders are ignoring details that matter. They may not lead either the dividend or growth categories as they stand, but on a bigger-picture basis, these picks ultimately offer up better, risk-adjusted bottom lines. They just need time to prove it.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile In no particular order… United Technologies (UTX)Dividend Yield: 2.23%United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) presents investors with something of a choice -- or will soon anyway. That is, by the end of next year it's going to be split into three separate companies. They'll each be standing on their own once that happens, for better or worse, relying on their unique strengths and working to abate their weaknesses.Still, the same management teams that made each division a part of a great whole will remain intact, doing their thing, and achieving the same success they're achieving now. At least one of the three will keep the company's streak of 25 consecutive years of dividend increases alive. And, odds are good the most dividend-oriented unit's payout will become even (relatively) bigger as each division goes its separate way, upping the combined company's current yield of 2.23%.Most likely, it will be the aerospace and defense arm that continues to carry the torch. Becton Dickinson (BDX)Dividend Yield: 1.23%The current yield of 1.23% is anything but a jaw-dropper, but Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) can't fairly be boiled down to one metric. The medical equipment maker has a long history of above-average revenue growth and even more impressive earnings growth. Sales are expected to improve a little more than 9% this year, driving a 10% increase in per-share profits.But still, does BDX stock offer anything to income-minded investors? Actually, it does. It has upped its dividend for 47 straight years, with the most recent one by a respectable 2.7%.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Paying it is a quite comfortable matter too. Its average payout ratio is historically only about one-fourth of its profits. Outfront Media (OUT)Dividend Yield: 6.06%Outfront Media (NYSE:OUT) isn't exactly a household name. The company offers a variety of outdoor advertising options well beyond billboards, but as an organization that makes a point of featuring clients' brands rather than its own, consumers rarely even think about who's making those ads possible.Still, as an REIT, it's a name built from the ground up to pay dividends. Its current yield is a head-turning 6.06%, and its total payout has grown slowly but reliably since early 2016. Revenue and income growth have been almost as steady.The secret of Outfront Media's success has been overwhelming market domination. It's established in 140 markets with a variety of traditional and non-traditional assets, and in areas where it's not as strong, it's able to buy its way into consumers' views. Case in point: Early last year the company began the deployment of more than 50,000 &quot;liveboards&quot; in New York's most-traveled transportation stations. Broadcom (AVGO)Dividend Yield: 3.5%The market has been doubting Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) since late 2017, when the stock stopped rallying and spent the better part of last year dwindling its way to lower lows.Big mistake. Revenue never stopped growing. Neither did earnings. In fact, both reached record levels in 2018. Investors now recognize the mistake, and are working to correct it. Even with the 36% gain since July's low, though, AVGO is still a bargain by almost any standard. The  forward-looking earnings multiple of 12 is cheap.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Best of all, the yield of 3.5% is downright incredible by tech stock standards. Indeed, it's even high compared to the most typical, garden-variety dividend stocks. Illinois Tool Works (ITW)Dividend Yield: 2.7%Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is trying to put a tough 2018 behind it. The stock fell from a January 2018 high of $179 to a low near $118 in December of last year.This is another case, though, where doubts in this dividend stock have been mostly unmerited. Organic revenue growth reached 1% in Q4, driving a 70-basis-point increase in operating margins. It's not stellar, but it's more than good enough to support the current yield of 2.7% … an annualized dividend that has expanded for more than 50 consecutive years. Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR)Dividend Yield: 2.65%Don't come to the wrong conclusion about Cullen/Frost Bankers (NYSE:CFR). It offers traditional consumer-facing banking services through its Frost Bank. Its strengths lies in business banking though, and less traditional banking activities like investment services and insurance.Regardless of the revenue and earnings mix, Cullen/Frost has earned its spot on a list of the market's top dividend stocks. Its yield of 2.65% is in line with its peers, but the bullish case is bolstered by 25 years' worth of dividend increases that have proven more than affordable.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Earnings of $5.51 per share in 2017 improved to $6.90 last year, and are expected to reach $7.09 this year. With four straight earnings beats to its credit though, that outlook may underestimate what the company's actually got in store in terms of future profits and dividend improvements. Sherwin-Williams (SHW)Dividend Yield: 1%It's still a paint company, but Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) isn't just a paint company any longer. The outfit offers a variety of coatings that cater to the special needs of several industries including automobiles.Its product diversity hasn't helped a whole lot of late. Sherwin-Williams missed its fourth-quarter earnings estimate, and the company couldn't soothe worried investors with a compelling 2019 earnings outlook. The dividend yield of 1% isn't much to write home about either.All the same, this is a name that is still logging steady increases in its payout, and if you can look past its acquisition-related expenses, is still growing its top and bottom lines. Same-store sales were up 5.1% in Q4, and full-year operating cash flows reached a record-breaking $2.04 billion in 2018. A.O. Smith (AOS)Dividend Yield: 1.63%A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) may not have the clout it used to, as the world has moved on and left old-guard industrial names behind. This &quot;old school&quot; manufacturing outfit still has a few tricks up its sleeve though.The numbers confirm it. Last year's top line of $3.2 billion was up from 2017's $3 billion, and earnings improved from $296.5 million to $444.2 million. Both were records.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Where A.O. Smith really shines among dividend stocks, however, is when you look at it as a dividend growth stock. Not only has it boosted its payout for 13 straight years now, it has boosted them in a big way.  Caterpillar (CAT)Dividend Yield: 2.45%This dividend stock may be surrounded by concerns about the tariff war with China, but take a good look at the results Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has achieved of late. For all the caterwauling it and its peers have dished out, revenue has grown every quarter since the beginning of 2017, and operating income has grown almost as reliably.Dividends have continued to grow as much as they ever have too. CAT has had 25 straight years of dividend growth, and the industrial machinery outfit has never really struggled to pay it.One big upside to the unmerited doubt -- the stock's big pullback from the early 2018 peak translates into an attractive yield of 2.45%. Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Dividend Yield: 2.7%Finally, auto parts retailer Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) -- you may know it better as NAPA -- currently yields a healthy 2.7%. That's a dividend, however, that has grown for 62 consecutive years.It has been big-time growth too. The trailing-12-month payout of $3.05 is markedly better than the annualized payout of $1.15 from just ten years ago, but only reflects the company's earnings growth for the same timeframe.Those who know the company well will know earnings growth has stagnated over the course of the past three years, with a frenzy of new auto sales crimping demand for repairs. A huge swath of newly made automobiles are now between three to five years old now, however, and will start showing some wear and tear that drives sales of replacement parts. At the same time, nearly half the cars on U.S. roads now are at least 12 years old, and as such are also flirting with the need for a repair.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Both trends play right into Genuine Parts Company's hands, making it one of the smart dividend stocks to look at now.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Broadcom and Illinois Tool Works.

2019-04-22,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Is it finally over? Are China and the United States finally going to be able to come to trade terms both parties can live with? Nothing is ever certain in the current political environment. But both countries seem to have grown weary enough of the tariff war to seriously come up with a solution that takes the brakes off the global economy.The next obvious question: What are the best stocks to buy now that China and the U.S. are starting to look like potential trade partners again, rather than trade foes?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe knee-jerk answer is the same companies that suffered the most when the trade war became a reality. But,the list doesn't necessarily have to end there. The impact of tariffs has shaken things up on a fairly permanent basis, and some new players have slipped into more meaningful roles thanks to some rather serious shakeups in the trade landscape.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability Here's a rundown of nine of your best bets if China and the U.S.  look like they're going to ink a deal very soon. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)It's a bit off-the-radar, as its wares are found inside the world's most popular consumer electronics with someone else's logo on the outside. But, without Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), your iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and other smartphones may not work quite as well as they do.Although it has been tricky at times to figure out just how subject Skyworks is to the tariff war that may be winding down soon -- in that it's supposed to apply to finished goods and not components -- such details haven't mattered entirely. An estimated 83% of its revenue comes from Chinese customers. One way or another, the expanded trade war has created a problem that an end to the trade war could quell. Caterpillar (CAT)Truth be told, the rising costs of raw materials stemming from increased tariffs has been more bark than bite for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Although the company didn't comment on their fiscal impact in the fourth quarter, during the third-quarter recently-imposed tariffs only added $40 million worth of expenses. That's roughly one-third of 1% of Q3's revenue -- more than absorbable.That's not to say the trade war isn't taking a toll on the heavy equipment maker though. While Q4 sales grew everywhere else, revenue driven by the Asia-Pacific market during Q4 were down 4% year-over-year. Some analysts fear that a continued trade war could take an even bigger bite out of the bottom line this year.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability Yet, it's fear more than anything else that's holding CAT stock back. Qualcomm (QCOM)We'll never really know for sure if the endeavor to unite Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) was blocked solely to make a statement at the onset of new tariffs, or if China's would have barred it under any circumstances. It would be naive, however, to believe the ruling wasn't at least politically motivated.Since then, surprisingly enough, Qualcomm has largely escaped the brunt of new tariffs. Its fiscal Q1 sales and earnings both fell year-over-year, but both also exceeded expectations as the company and its Chinese partners worked past usually contentious problems to find a royalty arrangement that all parties can accept.The stock has thus far been non-responsive to the company's success, with most investors likely fearing its relationships with Chinese partners are strained. If the rhetoric changes for the better though, that unmerited doubt could leave, and lift QCOM stock with it. Tyson Foods (TSN)It has been a largely overlooked victim of the trade war, not being nearly as sexy higher-profile tech names. The relatively few investors that watch or own Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), however, know the true depths of the problems the tariff war has created for the company.Chief among those problems is the waning price of meat.Mostly priced out of overseas market thanks to retaliatory tariffs, the United States is suffering from a glut of meat -- and chicken in particular -- that's crimping market prices. The end result? Profit margins on chicken sales should roll in at only 6% this year, down from 2018's 9.4%.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability Tyson Foods has somewhat sidestepped the challenge by looking to acquire more international exposure. But, such dealmaking isn't always as cheap or as effective as organic, home-grown growth that includes rekindled sales to overseas customers. An end to the trade war would facilitate just that. Ford Motor Company (F)To be clear, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was fighting an uphill battle anyway, even before President Trump was elected. Automobile sales reached a cyclical peak in 2015, and the iconic carmaker's stock actually topped out before that.Nevertheless, tariffs on materials imported from China coupled with tariffs on vehicles exported to China has created a headwind the company just doesn't need right now. In September of last year, CEO James Hackett suggested steel tariffs had already reduced the company's profits by a total $1 billion just since going into place in 2018. Meanwhile, Q3 revenue from its China arm was lower by 15% year-over-year thanks to retaliatory tariffs.Already sporting a rock-bottom, forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1, even a half-hearted trade agreement could position Ford as one of the market's best stocks to step into. Ctrip.Com International (CTRP)Ctrip.Com International (NASDAQ:CTRP), for the unfamiliar, is China's equivalent to Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) or Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).Online travel agents weren't much of a need in China just a few years ago. But, global economic growth gave rise to a new level of consumerism there, growing paychecks to the point where a huge swath of new entrants into the country's middle class could afford to travel.No sooner had China's middle-class consumerism reached full speed before tough tariffs slowed the country's economic engine down last year. The nation's consumer confidence, after peaking a year ago, has fallen substantially since then, as workers increasingly realize President Donald Trump wasn't bluffing.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability An end to the trade war could easily light a fire under Ctrip shares. Deere & Company (DE)While Caterpillar is the machinery company that's made the most noise in response to new tariffs, farm implement outfit Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) is arguably a bigger victim. It's also, however, better positioned to recover once the tariff war comes to a close.The company is fighting not one war, but two.On one front, it's bearing the added cost of materials needed to manufacture tractors and pickers, while struggling to keep its wares affordable enough to China's farms that need high-throughput farm equipment.The second -- and arguably bigger -- hurdle Deere faces right now is diminished demand from U.S. farms that suddenly find themselves struggling to sell their goods overseas. The 25% levy China imposed on U.S. grown soybeans, for instance, has all but halted sales of U.S. soybeans there. Farmers aren't interested in buying equipment that won't at least pay for itself. Walmart (WMT)Add Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to your list of the best stocks to buy if and when the trade war finally cools off, for the obvious reason.To its credit, the world's biggest retailer has made a deliberate effort to procure and sell more goods made in the United States. There's only so much inventory U.S. companies can supply though. For goods like luggage, vacuum cleaners, furniture and electronics accessories, China may be the only viable source. It has been estimated that as much as three-fourths of the merchandise sold in Walmart stores is made in China.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability Thus far, the company has been able to navigate tricky tariff waters, keeping most prices at palatable levels. There's no getting around the reality, however, that an end to the tariff war would be a huge relief to owners of WMT stock. A. O. Smith (AOS)Finally, A. O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) may end up being one of the biggest winners of an end to the increasingly nagging trade war.It was already noted that the rise of middle-class consumerism in China proved to be a boom for Ctrip, but the nation's cultural shift didn't end there. For some of China's residents, better-paying jobs meant growing demand for water heaters. For some families, it was their first hot water tank.So far the company has managed matters reasonably well. Although its third-quarter report was lackluster, it could have been worse. Last year's top and bottom lines were still record-breaking.Nevertheless, the company fears a prolonged trade war could increasingly weaken results. CEO Kevin Wheeler added to the organization's 2018 report &quot;Assuming relatively flat consumer demand in 2019 and without the impact of the previously disclosed channel inventory build we experienced in 2018, which we estimate was at least 5 percent of 2018 China sales, we project China sales will decline by 3 to 6 percent in 2019 in local currency terms and 7 to 10 percent in U.S. dollar terms.&quot;An amicable end to the trade spat, of course, would turn that headwind around.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Ford.

But the S&P 500 defied the odds, clawing its way back out of the red to leave behind a 0.16% gain. It's clear, however, the weight of the gains since late December aren't going to be easy to shrug off.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Investors can thank General Electric (NYSE:GE) for doing a great deal of the heavy lifting. Shares of the struggling industrial giant were up 2.5% after Melius Research analyst Scott Davis claimed a top industrial investor is stepping into the beaten-down stock.At the other end of the spectrum, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) fell 1.5%, extending a sector-wide selloff that largely stems from an uncertain future for healthcare. Most Democratic Presidential candidates are developing a platform on government-managed healthcare, while Republicans aren't offering much in the way of alternatives.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Cheap Stocks That Cost Less Than $10 Neither of those names is a particularly great trading prospect as the new trading week kicks off though. Rather, take a look at the stock charts of CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW) for your best bets. Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar shares have been losing ground since early 2018. Although 2017 was almost heroic, fear of tariffs followed by the actual implementation of those tariffs took a sizeable toll on CAT stock.Things have changed since October's low though. We've seen a string of higher lows, and as of the end of last week, higher highs. There's just one more hurdle to clear before Caterpillar stock is in full-blown breakout mode.  Click to Enlarge  * The breakout trigger would be a thrust above the upper edge of the falling trading range plotted in white on the weekly chart. One or two more good days could get the stock past that ceiling.  * In the meantime, CAT stock has cleared a horizontal ceiling at $142.83, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. Shares hit highs there a couple of times before pushing above that resistance last week.  * If the breakout takes hold, the most plausible upside target is around $159, where CAT peaked several times in the middle of last year. That level is marked with a dashed blue line on the daily chart. Lamb Weston Holdings (LW)You may be more familiar with Lamb Weston Holdings than you realize. The company supplies potato products to the restaurant industry. Restaurants sell 80 million servings of Lamb Weston-supplied fries every single day. It may also be unfamiliar simply because it has only been a publicly traded entity since late 2016, when it was spun off by ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG).LW stock had a pretty good post-spinoff run too. As of last week though, it's pretty clear the post-spinoff euphoria has run its course. LW stock is one bad day away from a major meltdown.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever   Click to Enlarge  * Thursday's low lines up with the last two major lows, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts.  * Although the intermediate-term support is still intact, the horizontal support at $68.00, where Lamb Weston stock found a floor a few times in February and March, failed as a floor on Thursday.  * It's subtle and not yet convincing, but Friday's bearish volume in LW stock was above average. It's a hint that there may be a lot more nervous investors waiting in the wings to dump their stake should things get any worse. CF Industries Holdings (CF)A month ago, CF stock was close to a breaking point. It was moving back toward a low around $89 for a second time after falling to that level in early March, with some momentum behind the effort.The stock never slipped over the edge though. Rather, it pushed up and off that floor at $89 to make a double bottom. Now shares are within striking distance of a couple of different technical ceilings that could prove quite catalytic.  Click to Enlarge  * The first of those technical ceilings is $45.40, marked with a red dashed line. That's where shares peaked in February, and so far where they've peaked in April.  * Bolstering the bullish case is the amount of buying volume that materialized the last two days of last week. There are willing buyers out there.  * Further bolstering the bullish case is the way CF stock found support at a well-established support line plotted in purple on the weekly chart. It has tagged all the key lows going back to late 2016.  * At this point, the make-or-break line is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Caterpillar's caution could be more boilerplate than it seems on the surface, and China may not be in the dire straits some investors have been led to believe.That's the long way of saying the pullback may ultimately serve as a good entry point into an underestimated and now undervalued Caterpillar stock, if …InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Quarter in FocusThe broad numbers were solid enough. Sales of $13.47 billion just topped expectations of $13.46 billion, but were up 5% year-over-year. Per-share earnings rolled in at $2.94, up two cents from the year-ago's $2.82, and handily topping analyst estimates of $2.86 per share of CAT stock.It was the fine print that failed to thrill investors. Namely, its overseas business was a letdown. Sales to Latin America's construction customers fell 7%, and Europe-Africa-Middle East constriction business slumped 6%.It was China, though, which makes up roughly one-tenth of Caterpillar's business, that spooked investors. Sales of construction equipment to the world's second-largest economy slumped 4% year-over-year, underscoring the impact of largely unpopular U.S. tariffs on China that have stymied trade between the countries.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Those tariffs have proven to be a two-way challenge. Tariffs on steel imported from China into the U.S. have kept prices high after they nearly doubled between 2016 and 2018. But, Caterpillar must also still account for fees paid to sell goods in China. The rhetoric in the meantime has evolved into chatter that the tariff war itself has hurt China's economy, crimping demand for heavy construction equipment regardless of its cost.The headwind that's proving problematic for Caterpillar though -- or at least owners of CAT stock -- may be more unique to the company than suggested. Stronger Than It SeemsThe tariffs have worked as planned, to be clear. China is seeing measurable slowdowns of its economic engine, which were meant to bring the country to the negotiation table and ultimately prompt it into lowering admittedly steep tariffs on U.S.-made goods shipped there. Last year's economic growth was the slowest China had seen in decades.The country's hardly been brought to its knees, though, and not every segment of its economy is in trouble.China's manufacturing industry, for instance, returned to growth in March after a four-month hiatus. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index improved from 49.9 to 50.8, and now stands at its highest level since the middle of 2018 when the tariff wars had just begun in earnest.It was artificially induced growth, to be clear. China has introduced stimulus and offered bailouts to critical entities. Nevertheless, those efforts appear to be working.China's headwind also delivered a blow to the nation's construction industry, where Caterpillar was vulnerable. Sales of cranes and excavators improved by more than 60% during January and February though, fueled by its government's stimulus package. Sales of heavy trucks grew 4% in March.  * 10 Dow Jones Stocks Holding the Blue Chip Index Back But, those buyers just weren't buying Caterpillar-made equipment as they had in the recent past. Bottom Line for CAT StockCaterpillar isn't completely alone in its struggle to figure out how to handle its China problem. Water heater company A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) projects sales in China will slump between 3% and 6% this year, largely leaving the company out of whatever construction and replacement business is being mustered by China's stimulus. Dow mainstay 3M (NYSE:MMM) announced on Thursday it would be cutting 2,000 jobs after falling short of last quarter's earnings estimates, mostly thanks to weakness in sales to China.China isn't universally the liability it's being made out to be, though. It's dented and dinged to be sure, but not down for the count, and not yet past the point of renewed growth.To that end, should the political standoff fueling the trade war abate, CAT stock immediately becomes a compelling investment prospect again. China is already/still doing reasonably well enough. It just needs a good enough reason to consider Caterpillar's wares again.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

While shares have more than doubled from where they were at the start of 2016, they're nearly 20% below their early 2018 peak. They will rise and fall, but if the dividend stays strong, you are in good shape.Now may be the best time for a conservative investor to strike.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-10,"General Electric (NYSE: GE) stock is up 38% year-to-date in 2019, giving some investors reason for optimism that its problems are finally over. However, even with General Electric stock down 64% overall in the past three years, buying on the dip is far from a guaranteed money maker.Source: Shutterstock Even if all of GE's problems are finally on the table and solutions to them are being implemented, GE has a long way to go to get its business on track. Trading under $11, General Electric stock may look cheap to some investors. However, General Electric stock may still be a value trap. Here are five reasons  why $11 is not necessarily a bargain for GE stock.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days  1&#92;. GE Stock Doesn't Have a Low Earnings MultipleGeneral Electric stock plummeted in recent years, driven partly by s large drop in the company's earnings. Prior to the large decline of GE's profits in recent quarters, GE stock  historically traded at a PE ratio in the mid-teens. Today, GE's forward PE is about 15. Not only is that in-line with its long-term range, but it is also roughly in-line with the average PE ratio for the industrial sector as a whole., which is 16.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn fact, given all of GE's problems, a 15 PE is actually pretty generous. GE stock trades at a steep discount to its previous price, but its valuation hasn't changed much, despite its struggles. 2&#92;. GE's First Quarter Wasn't as Good as It SeemedGE stock rallied hard after the company's first-quarter results exceeded expectations. Investors were hopeful the results indicated that the company had finally turned the corner. However, analysts were quick to point out that the Q1 numbers may have looked better on the surface than they actually were.GE Capital turned a surprise $135 million profit in the quarter. GE management noted &quot;tax law changes&quot; and &quot;lower impairments&quot; as among the reasons for the higher than expected bottom line. These are not the type of core business improvements that investors should be excited about. In addition, GE Industrial's free cash flow also exceeded expectations. GE cited the &quot;timing of certain items&quot; as the cause, which is not particularly inspiring for the owners of GE stock. 3&#92;. 737 Max Creates Even More UncertaintyAs if GE didn't have enough of its own problems, the company recently said that it has now inherited another company's problems. GE delivered 424 engines to Boeing (NYSE: BA) in Q1 for use in BA's 737 Max fleet. Unfortunately, the 737 Max fleet is currently grounded while Boeing scrambles to update its software following two deadly 737 Max crashes. GE's management said it is working closely with Boeing on the issue, but the situation creates &quot;a new risk&quot; to GE's near-term outlook. GE Capital has about $1.5 billion in aviation-leasing assets tied to the 737 Max. 4&#92;. Expectations May Still Be Too HighGE stock has bounced off its lows so far in 2019. But that relief rally may simply be a sign that investors' expectations are creeping back up into unrealistic territory. GE is guiding for negative free cash flow from its industrial segment in 2019. While long-term investors are willing to wait a year or two for GE's industrial free cash flow to recover, Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch says the recovery may not be coming.&quot;Considering GE's divestitures of high cash generating businesses coupled with Power's substantial long-term challenges, this aspirational target screens as both dubious and lacking basic intuition,&quot; Inch recently wrote.Given the current state of GE's business, Haskett estimates GE would need to double its EPS from current levels just to get back to $1 in overall free cash flow per share. Haskett said it's fairly unrealistic to suggest a company that is aggressively selling off assets to shore up its balance sheet will somehow also be able to double its earnings power. 5&#92;. There Are Better Choices for Investors Than General Electric StockThe final reason why GE is not a good value stock is the most practical one for any investor. GE is an industrial stock with earnings struggles, accounting issues, credit concerns and a 0.3% dividend yield. Almost any other member of GE's industrial peer group is a better, safer bet at this point.Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) is trading at a 12.4 earnings multiple, reported 18.6% EPS growth last quarter and has a 3.1% dividend yield. Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR) grew its revenue by 8.6% last quarter and has a 2.9% yield.Emerson and Caterpillar are just two examples of safer industrial investments than GE. There's simply no reason investors need to take a gamble on a risky name like General Electric stock, especially when there are so many better choices out there.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-13,"It's finally happening. After a six-month reprieve from the volatility that first appeared early last year, Wall Street is being rattled by a combination of pretty much everything going wrong at a time when stocks were priced for everything going right.We're facing the worst-case scenario on U.S.-China trade, with President Trump vowing to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports into the United States while Beijing is retaliating with threats to cut its imports of U.S. farm products, energy and Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft. There are reports of possible Iranian attacks on oil infrastructure in the Persian Gulf. The Uber (NYSE:UBER) IPO is face planting, undercutting years of VC-funded hype.And, most critically, the Chinese are also threatening to dump U.S. Treasury bonds, which could push up long-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve could be constrained in how it responds if energy-push inflation, driven by Iranian responses to energy sanctions placed on it by Trump, results from higher crude prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever As a result, the market is melting lower with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling below its 200-day moving average for the first time since February. A number of widely held mega-caps are getting caught in the whirlwind, including these five widely popular stocks. Apple (AAPL)  Click to EnlargeApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are falling below their 200-day and 50-day moving averages in one fell swoop, threatening to decline back to the lows seen in March. The company is not only affected by the trade tensions -- Trump's widened tariffs will impact iPhone imports and Chinese consumers will likely boycott Apple's products to show nationalistic pride -- but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the company in an App Store antitrust lawsuit claiming the company artificially raised app prices.The company will next report results on July 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.1 per share on revenues of $53.4 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of $2.46 per share beat estimates by 10 cents on a 5.1% decline in revenues. Boeing (BA)  Click to EnlargeBoeing shares are crashing back to earth, wiping away the January-February gains, as the company continues to contend with the fallout from its 737 MAX grounding as well as threats of import cuts by China -- a critical market for the aircraft maker. This returns shares to the middle of a two-year-long trading range and sets up a test of the late 2018 lows, which would be worth a loss of roughly 15% from here.  * 10 Stocks That Could Squeeze Short Sellers, Including CGC The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.8 per share on revenues of $21.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $3.16 per share missed estimates by 3 cents on a 2% drop in revenues. Caterpillar (CAT)  Click to EnlargeCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares, like Boeing, are falling hard as the company is vulnerable to a cut in its exports to the Chinese markets. The heavy equipment maker is seeing prices fall back to levels not seen since January, marking a decline of nearly 14% from its April high. Management tried to change the story earlier this month, with an increase to its quarterly dividend and a guidance update. But the company can't escape the broader, macroeconomic trends that will likely weigh on its plans to boost its share repurchase program as well.The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.12 per share on revenues of $14.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $2.94 per share beat estimates by 8 cents on a 4.7% rise in revenues. Amazon (AMZN)  Click to EnlargeAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are threatening to fall below their 50-day moving average, setting up a test of the 200-day average which could give way to a drop back to the $1,600 level. This drop would be a loss of more than 12%. The struggle marks a turnaround from double-top resistance near $2,000 -- a level that was reached to great fanfare last summer.  * 7 Bond ETFs to Buy The company will next report results on July 25. Analysts are looking for earnings of $5.2 per share on revenues of $62.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $7.09 beat estimates by $2.43 on a 17% rise in revenues. Bank of America (BAC)  Click to EnlargeBank of America (NYSE:BAC) shares are dropping hard below their 200-day moving average, threatening to return to levels last seen in late March, which would be worth a loss of more than 7% from here. Shares have been stalled near current levels since late 2017, and could well end up falling back to post-2016 critical support near $22, which would be worth an additional 15% loss from here.The company will next report results on July 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 72 cents per share on revenues of $23.2 billion. When the company last reported on April 16, earnings of 70 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents on a 0.4% drop in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-20,Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 14% in the last month...,"Introducing Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), A Stock That Climbed 74% In The Last Three Years"
2019-05-21,"The trade war with China has reignited, and while the tech companies may be getting the headlines, export-oriented industrials have also felt immediate effects. China is an important market for heavy construction and agricultural equipment, and the imposition of protective tariffs has made a mark on the import-export trade.We’ll dive into TipRanks’ analyst database to look at two major industrial companies feeling the pain from China, as well as one strong defensive play to minimize the hurt on your portfolio. Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT – Research Report)Despite beating expectations in the China market earlier this year, Caterpillar now says it expects full-year China-sales results to come in flat at best. This is a serious setback, as Caterpillar makes 10% of its global sales to China. Combined with a drop in operating margin – reported at 18.5% last month, down from 19.7% one year ago – the company is facing a serious headwind in East Asia.Quoted in Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper, five-star analyst Stephen Volkmann (Track Record & Ratings) noted both points, saying, “Caterpillar has most exposure to China in their construction industry business and that business was just a bit disappointing on revenue and margins.”Caterpillar stock has had a difficult time gaining traction in recent years, as its share price peaked in January 2018 and has been on an uneven downward slope since then. With the end of Q2 2019, the company moved to placate shareholders, by boosting the dividend 20% to $1.03 per share ($4.12 annualized), which increased the yield to a respectable 3.37%. Shares gained $4 in the next session but are down $17 since.While CAT is facing headwinds, the outlook is not entirely gloomy. Oppenheimer’s Noah Kaye (Track Record & Ratings) set a ‘Hold’ on the stock, but his comments acknowledge that the company has extensive resources: “We got much of what we were looking for from CAT’s Investor Day last week. The company provided an updated view on its structurally improved cross-cycle margin and cash flow metrics… We believe CAT’s O&E model has successfully enabled the company to deliver stronger cash generation peak-to-trough and supported its strong balance sheet, enabling a more shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation.”Overall, CAT retains a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus, including 9 buy, 3 hold, and 2 sell reviews. Shares sell for $122 as of May 20, and the average price target of $150 suggests a 22% upside potential.View CAT Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Deere & Co. (DE – Research Report)Nothing runs like a Deere, but investors ran away from Deere shares after the May 17 Q2 earnings report. The manufacturer of agricultural equipment (from backyard riding mowers to giant agribusiness harvester combines, plus everything in between) missed the EPS forecast by 2%, reporting $3.52 against the expected $3.61. Despite the earnings miss, net equipment sales revenues came in just above the $10.12 billion expectation, at $10.3 billion.According to the company, however, investors should not expect to keep seeing revenue beats this year. Deere lowered guidance on 2019 net income from $3.6 billion to $3.3 billion. Company CEO Sam Allen said of the lower guidance, “Although the long-term fundamentals for our businesses remain favorable, softening conditions in the agricultural sector have led Deere to adopt a more cautious financial outlook for the year. The lower forecast is partly a result of actions we are taking to prudently manage field inventories, which will cause production levels to be below retail sales in the second half of the year.”DE shares dropped 7.5% after the earnings report.Wall Street’s analysts have also seen the weakness in DE, even those setting ‘buy’ ratings on the stock. From RBC Capital, Seth Weber (Track Record & Ratings) says of the lowered income guidance, “…the revision is not surprising in light of the U.S.-China trade tensions and bad weather.” He lowered his price target by 10%, to $175.Stanley Elliot (Track Record & Ratings), of Stifel, also notes the softness in the agribusiness sector. He says the lowered income projection is driven by “a cocktail of negative developments in terms of trade, late plantings and swine flu.” His price target, $171, suggests a 26% upside for the stock.Deere holds a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating on the analyst consensus, based on 5 buy, 4 hold, and 1 sell rating given in the past three months. The $155 average price target that indicates a 14% upside potential from the current share price of $135.View DE Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Johnson & Johnson (JNJ – Research Report)Consumer health care companies, emphasizing the everyday items that everyone needs no matter the state of the economy, are among the stocks usually seen as ‘recession proof.’ This doesn’t mean that they won’t drop when the market drops; rather, it means that they’ll experience less volatility. You can expect these defensive stocks to outperform when the major indexes fall or make slow gains, but they’ll also tend to lag a bit when the markets see a sharp rise.Johnson & Johnson is a classic case. JNJ released its Q1 earnings, missing the EPS by 2 cents, on April 16. Since then, the stock has slipped, risen, and slipped again, and is flat overall. On a longer-term view, JNJ is up 7.3% year-to-date and 11.4% over the past 12 months. The S&P 500, for April, is down over 2%, and in the last 12 months is only up 4%.Outperforming market slips is not JNJ’s only defensive attribute. The stock pays out a regular dividend, currently 95 cents per quarter for a 2.75% annual yield. The company has made a policy of steady, if modest, dividend increases, dating back to the early 1990s.The analysts, of course, have taken note of JNJ’s dependability in delivering profits and rewarding shareholders. Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford (Track Record & Ratings), just after the earnings report, raised his price target to $147 (for a 6% upside), and said, “Growth was still much better than expected, which gives us more confidence in our estimates.”More recently, five-start analyst Joanne Wuensch (Track Record & Ratings) of BMO Capital, noted JNJ’s attraction in a down market. In her note on the stock, she said, “J&J's discipline to acquire and divest assets in its health care portfolio, its pristine balance sheet and its high dividend yield make the stock a strong defensive choice.” Her price target, $157, suggests an upside potential of 13%.JNJ maintains a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus rating, based on 6 buys and 5 holds given in the past three months. Shares sell for $138; the average price target of $148 indicates a modest upside potential of 7%.View JNJ Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Enjoy Research Reports on the Stocks in this Article:Caterpillar, Inc.

As a result, a number of large-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are looking vulnerable to a selloff.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere are four stocks to sell now: Dow Jones Stocks to Sell Now: United Technologies (UTX)Shares of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have crossed back below their 50-day moving average, down more than 10% from their early May high, after hitting double-top resistance from the late September levels. Watch for a test of critical support near the 200-day moving average, which would give way to a possible test of the late December lows, which would be worth a further loss of more than 20% from here.The company is scheduled to next report results on July 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.03 per share on revenues of $19.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 23, earnings of $1.91 per share beat estimates by 19 cents per share on a 20.5% rise in revenues. Caterpillar (CAT)Shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) continue to melt lower, falling further away from their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The result is an ongoing retest of the late December lows, setting up a possible fall to the lower levels plumbed in October. That would be worth a loss of nearly 10% from here as investors brace for a decline in sales into China.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend The company is scheduled to next report results on July 24 before the bell.

International Business Machines (IBM)International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) stock, which has been desperate to stay above its 200-day moving average for months, appears to be on the verge of a major breakdown, setting up a filling of the gap from January in what would be worth a loss of nearly 8% from here. In its most recent quarterly call, management reaffirmed its fiscal 2019 guidance, which was disappointing considering a persistent inability to boost revenue growth after years of malaise.The company is scheduled to next report results on July 17 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.10 per share on revenues of $19.2 billion. When the company last reported on April 16, earnings of $2.25 beat estimates by a penny on a 4.7% decline in revenues.

The largest maker of construction equipment is coming off a May loss of just over 13%, so Monday's modest gain for shares of Caterpillar could be taken as a positive sign.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the stock has some work to do to snap out of a technical scenario known as the &quot;death cross.&quot; That is when a stock's 50-day moving average slides below its 200-day line, something that occurred in Caterpillar stock last week. Why It's ImportantCaterpillar's technical woes are important for several reasons. First, the company resides in the cyclical industrial sector, the Dow Jones' largest sector weight at 20.43%. Cyclical sectors are usually good gauges of investors' willingness to embrace riskier assets. Second, Caterpillar is the 15th-largest stock in the Dow, meaning its place in the blue-chip index is not small enough to buffer the rest of the benchmark from this stock's struggles.Perhaps more importantly is this final reason: Caterpillar is not the only Dow stock knocking on the door of a death cross. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), three other Dow members, are also close to death cross territory.&quot;Sixteen of the 30 names in the Dow are now in some sort of bearish technical setup at this point in time. If you do the math on the S&P 500, you've got about 15% of the S&P 500 now below its December lows,&quot; said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, in an interview with CNBC.As it pertains to Boeing, technical erosion in the aerospace and defense giant is particularly problematic for the Dow Jones because the it is a price-weighted index, meaning the member with the largest price tag is the benchmark's largest component. That honor currently belongs to Boeing, which represents 9.33% of the Dow.Combine Boeing with Caterpillar, Exxon Mobil and Johnson & Johnson and we're talking about 18.11% of the index being on the cusp of a death cross. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayStocks remain in a tenuous place, which is not the best of news when considering the historically weak tendencies of major U.S. benchmarks in the month of June.Consider this: Just seven of the Dow's 30 components notched gains in May. None of the four Dow stocks mentioned in this article so far were among them.One of the Dow names currently impressing is property and casualty insurance behemoth The Travelers Cos. (NYSE:TRV) The ninth-largest member of the blue-chip index jumped 1.74% last month and resides near record highs.Shares of Travelers yield 2.25% and the stock appears attractively valued relative to some other marquee Dow names, but those may not be the best reasons to consider the insurance stock right now. Perhaps the best reason for investors to consider Travelers right now is that the company, as the stock's recent price action suggests, is not vulnerable to the trade war being waged on multiple fronts by the White House.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Industrial component Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the largest maker of construction equipment, was the Dow's best performer on a percentage basis today.

The stock is trying to work its way out of a bear market (still 19.90% below its 52-week high) and if it can gain another 4.4% to reclaim its 200-day moving average, there could be something to see here.Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) added 1.16% after iPhone supplier Foxconn said Tuesday that is the capability to shift iPhone assembly out of China if needed and that it has capacity in other locations to meet U.S. demand for the popular smartphone. About a quarter of Foxconn's production capacity is found outside of China.Apple is now on a six-day winning streak. CEO Tim Cook said last week he does not expect China to overtly target his company as a result of the trade war and analysts seem to think tariff talk as it pertain to Apple is mostly noise.&quot;The fundamental impact on iPhone production and the potential cost increases are thus far containable with shares baking in a much more draconian/worst-case scenario,&quot; said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a recent note.As was noted here yesterday, the Dow's financial services components have been solid recently.

2019-06-12,"Between 2016 and 2018, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) earnings more than tripled. Unsurprisingly, the stock price soared. Caterpillar stock started 2016 near $60; it started 2018 roughly one hundred points higher.Source: Anthony via FlickrThere were several factors at play in earnings growth. Easy comparisons helped, certainly. Revenue fell 18% year-over-year in 2016. That was the fourth straight year in which sales declined, a first for the company. Not even during the Great Depression did Caterpillar's top line stay negative for so long. Those four years of declines also led to a great deal of pent-up demand, which has benefited results over the last nine quarters.In addition, Caterpillar aggressively cut costs: its headcount shrunk by 20% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2017. Corporate tax reform boosted EPS. Almost everything has gone right of late - but that hardly seems reflected in Caterpillar shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Indeed, over the last eighteen months, Caterpillar stock now has declined over 20%. Yet earnings still are expected to grow, if at a slower rate. Caterpillar is guiding for adjusted EPS this year (excluding a one-time tax benefit) of $11.75-$12.75, 5-14% above 2018 levels. Investors don't seem to care: the CAT stock price touched a 2019 low just week, and now sits at a little over 10x the midpoint of that guidance range.The issue is that investors aren't looking at 2019, or 2016. They're looking at 2020 and beyond. To some investors, that might present an opportunity. To others, it explains why the CAT stock price continues to fall and may have further to go. The Cyclical CATAlong with John Deere (NYSE:DE), Caterpillar is one of the most widely-held cyclical stocks. That's been particularly true this decade. Back in 2012, the company generated nearly $66 billion in revenue. That year, the so-called commodity supercycle driven in part by Chinese growth peaked, and Caterpillar sold billions of dollars of equipment to miners worldwide. Commodity prices collapsed, demand dried up, and the overhang of barely used equipment pressured sales for years.Indeed, Caterpillar's Resource Industries segment saw revenue drop by over 70 percent between 2012 and 2016. Operating profit went from over $4 billion to a loss of $1 billion. That business now has recovered - but a $1.6 billion profit in 2018 obviously sits well below early-decade peaks.That volatility explains, at least in part, why Caterpillar stock looks so cheap at the moment. Investors always know Caterpillar is a cyclical play, but the roller-coaster ride of this decade remains fresh in their memories. In theory, a cyclical stock should see its earnings multiple expand at the bottom as was the case in 2016 when savvy investors started buying CAT stock ahead of its rebound.Of course, that also means multiples should contract at the top, and it's the fear that we indeed are at, or near, the top that explains why the CAT stock price sits at barely 10x 2019 earnings per share. The Cycle Weighs on Caterpillar StockTo be sure, there are some company-specific factors as well. Caterpillar cited a $70 million direct impact from tariffs just in the first quarter, and trade war fears no doubt have weighed on CAT. Like other American firms including Deere, 3M (NYSE:MMM), and even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company also cited market share struggles in the Chinese market.But China only accounts for roughly 10% of Caterpillar revenue. Potential market share issues in one region don't offset the fact that Caterpillar earnings have soared - or that the company seems to be performing exceedingly well everywhere else.CAT's cheap multiple is a function primarily of cyclical worries. To be sure, it's not alone. Banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) look cheap. Homebuilders Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), too, trade at single-digit multiples, even after solid YTD rallies.Investors in these stocks, and in Caterpillar, are looking to ahead to looming trouble. That might be a trade war. It might just be the natural end of a U.S. economic expansion heading into its eleventh year. Caterpillar is a more global play. Over half of its sales come from outside North America, but the logic is the same. A slowdown is coming and investors don't want to own the stocks most likely to be affected. The Bet on CAT StockAnd so investors aren't really focused on 2019 results and they're not going to be. An extra dime or two in 2019 EPS doesn't matter much, if at all, if those earnings start declining in 2020 anyhow. UBS (NYSE:UBS) made that case last week, cutting its CAT stock price target to $115 while projecting a decrease in earnings next year.That's the problem for Caterpillar stock right now: there's not much Caterpillar can really do. It's cut costs so significantly of late that there's probably less room to react if sales do start turning negative. What growth it does muster in 2019 could well be overshadowed, or ignored, amid fears of what comes next. Moreso than other cyclicals, CAT is going to be held hostage to the broader sentiment toward the global economy.Of course, that's precisely what makes CAT so interesting, particularly near YTD lows. There is a nice case here for the stock. As Dana Blankenhorn pointed out last month, CAT is an attractive pick for income investors. The dividend already yields 3.3%, and Caterpillar management has promised further hikes going forward.Those hikes are presumably dependent on some degree of cooperation from the broader economy, but at least for now the dividend is well-covered.But even a 4% dividend isn't quite enough to turn bullish. An investor has to trust the global economy to go long CAT, even at these levels. And if an investor does see global macro worries as overdone, there are few better plays than Caterpillar stock.Another leg up in the global economy and particularly in demand for commodities like minerals, oil and natural gas would allow earnings to keep growing. CAT's earnings multiple likely would expand as well thanks to increased investor confidence. It's not unreasonable in that scenario to see Caterpillar stock clearing $200, something like 14-15x adjusted EPS of $14-$15. For what it's worth, the high Wall Street target price is exactly $200.It's not quite that simple but it's close. CAT is a bet on the global economy being better than feared. It's not a bet I'm quite willing to take but I can see why other investors might.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-18,"Value stocks are so out of fashion at the moment that despite being cheaper than they've been in the past 30 years, some experts suggest they're still not the stocks to buy.&quot;We could've had this story 10 years ago and talked about the 20-year anniversary of it being a bad market for value,&quot; Dave Nadig, managing director of ETF.com, said recently on CNBC. &quot;We could go another 10 years and it could be a bad market for value. I'm not sure that value and growth as an investing paradigm makes that much sense anymore.&quot;Another expert who appeared on the same CNBC show as Nadig suggested that you should only buy value stocks heading into a recession or in the first year coming out of one. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUntil either of these situations comes around, Datatrek Research co-founder Nick Colas believes investors ought to stick with growth stocks.I say, not so fast.  * 5 Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less I'll select seven stocks to buy for the second half of 2019, all from the top 50 holdings of the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEARCA:VTV), the biggest value ETF in the U.S. with $48 billion in assets under management.   Value Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B)Source: Shutterstock Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) is the largest of the 338 holdings in VTV with a weighting of 5.6%. Warren Buffett's company continues to have a bad year on the markets, up just 2.2% year to date.However, when you consider that Berkshire had a total return of 3% in 2018, Buffett's working on a 17-month losing streak. That's why I recently provided InvestorPlace readers with seven ideas to make Berkshire Hathaway stock more attractive. I'm as enamored with the holding company as the next person, but it is having a hard time convincing investors who've never owned its stock why they should get on board. With all the talk of it underperforming the S&P 500 in recent years, its sum-of-the-parts valuation still makes it one of the best value stocks to buy inside or outside the index. Long-time investors know this, hence why they continue to hold despite going into a second year of single-digit returns.  Also, it's essential to add that its poor performance in 2018 was 739 basis points higher than the index.      Verizon (VZ)Source: Shutterstock Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is the 10th-largest of VTV's 338 holdings with a weighting of 1.9%. The second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. is having a bad year, up just 4% year to date. Worse still, VZ stock is getting pulverized by AT&T (NYSE:T), which is up 14% year to date.In late May, I highlighted the reasons why I thought Verizon was a better buy than T stock.For me, it all comes down to the balance sheet. Verizon's is much healthier due to AT&T's massive purchase of WarnerMedia. AT&T supporters might view Verizon's advantage as a temporary one given HBO's future cash flow generation -- and I get that argument. However, because AT&T has long-term debt that's 71% of its market cap compared to 45% for Verizon -- with price-to-cash flow ratios almost identical -- if I'm a value investor, I have to go with the smaller of the two companies.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today AT&T might deliver in the long haul, but the bigger margin of safety lies with Verizon. Caterpillar (CAT)Source: Anthony via FlickrCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is the 37th-largest of VTV's holdings with a weighting of 1.1%. The maker of heavy equipment for mines and construction is also having a bad year, up just 4.5% year to date through June 12. That's on top of a 17.3% decline in 2018.The problem for Caterpillar is that the construction industry, its most significant revenue source, could be slowing down. Furthermore, the Asia/Pacific market isn't performing well, and that's got investors worried about the future. As a result of these worries, Caterpillar stock lost more than 14% in May. The issues plaguing CAT stock at the moment have little to do with the company itself and more to do with the global economy. It's something that shareholders can't control. However, with a dividend yield of 3.1%, free cash flow of $4 billion, a free cash flow yield of 3.9%, and a forward P/E of 10.1, CAT stock appears to be trading at below fair value, making a bet on its stock a winning one over the long haul. Morgan Stanley (MS)Source: Shutterstock Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is the 52nd-largest of VTV's 338 holdings with a weighting of 0.82%. The global investment bank is having a decent year, up 11% year to date. When Morgan Stanley reported Q1 2019 results in April, they were nothing to write home about. That said, both its revenue and profits beat analyst expectations. The consensus was for earnings of $1.17 a share on $9.94 billion in revenue. MS delivered $1.39 a share in earnings on $10.3 billion in revenue.  More importantly, the company's wealth management business, the company's largest, delivered revenues of $4.39 billion in the quarter, $200 million higher than the estimate. Since taking the reins, CEO James Gorman has focused Morgan Stanley on wealth management and that's ensuring it continues to generate significant revenues and profits.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 Yielding 2.8% and trading at 8.1 times forward earnings, MS stock is cheaper than a lot of the mainline banks.    CVS Health (CVS)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is the 40th-largest of VTV's 338 holdings with a weighting of 0.94%. Both CVS and its biggest competitor, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), are having terrible years on the market.  CVS and WBA are down 16% and 22% year to date. CVS has been bogged down getting approval from regulators for its $69 billion takeover of Aetna in November. The retail pharmacy chain is transforming its business into a one-stop shop for health and wellness. Aetna's insurance plans will allow CVS to provide its customers with vertically integrated medical care. A report surfaced June 11 that suggested the federal court judge considering whether to allow the merger is leaning toward blocking it from happening. However, CVS strenuously denied that the rumor had any merit. I like CVS' transformation plan and fully expect the deal to go through. Trading at just 7 times cash flow and 8 times forward earnings, CVS is too cheap to ignore. Walt Disney (DIS)Source: Baron Valium via FlickrWalt Disney (NYSEDIS) is the 24th-largest of VTV's 338 holdings with a weighting of 1.56%. After three sub-par years in the markets -- up 0.6%, 4.7%, and 3.6% in 2016 through 2018 -- DIS stock is delivering like gangbusters for shareholders, up 30.2% year to date.I was a fan of Disney before it closed its $71-billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox and I'm still a fan. That being said, I did suggest in March that the Fox deal would do little to boost the company's share price. My feeling is that we won't be able to quantify the success of the deal for at least 3-5 years. In the meantime, Disney's going to be spending like a drunken sailor to ensure Disney+ is a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) killer. I'm facetious, of course. No one, not even the world's largest entertainment company, is going to take Reed Hastings down. At least not overnight. InvestorPlace's Tom Taulli recently wrote a great piece about Disney and artificial intelligence. I recommend you read it. For me, Taulli's article exemplifies why you should own Disney stock -- its use of technology to entertain people is the best on the planet.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 Disney's got a lot of moving parts and Bob Iger and the rest of its management team will continue to do what it takes to remain the world's biggest and best entertainment company. It's not dirt cheap, but it's worth every penny. PepsiCo (PEP)Source: Shutterstock PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is the 17th-largest of VTV's 338 holdings with a weighting of 2.4%. Since long-time CEO Indra Nooyi stepped down in October, Pepsi stock is up 26.7%, an annualized total return of 40%.Before you get any ideas Nooyi was holding back PepsiCo stock; she delivered a cumulative total return of 136% over 17 years in the top job, including a significant stretch through the 2008 recession which saw PEP stock drop to below $20. The work she did to get the beverage and snack food maker in fighting form in recent years helped her successor, Ramon Laguarta, hit the ground running. Laguarta joined Pepsi Europe in 1996, moving up the ranks until becoming PepsiCo president in September 2017; ascending to the top role when Nooyi retired a year later. Nooyi built an exceptional bench of talent. Case in point: PepsiCo chief commercial officer Laxman Narasimhan just took the CEO job at Reckitt Benckiser (OTCMKTS:RBGLY) -- whose brands include Lysol, Woolite, Calgon, Scholl and Clearasil -- less than three months after being appointed to the newly created role at Pepsi. Pepsi reached on to its deep bench to appoint Ram Krishnan to replace Narasimhan. Krishnan currently runs the company's Greater China business. Trading near a 52-week high of $134.71, PepsiCo stock looks ready to continue moving higher.  At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-08,"Following up on the notion of sometimes good news is bad news, a theme highlighted here last Friday, stocks struggled to start the week. Market participants increasingly speculated last week's strong June jobs report means the Federal Reserve will not proceed with cutting interest rates anytime soon.Source: Shutterstock To start the week, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.78% while the S&P 500 lost 0.48%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.43% with more than two-thirds of the blue-chip index's components pointing lower in late trading.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Something else that has been discussed here in recent days is the shift away from trade concerns to company-specific issues. That was very much the case today as a slew of big names in the Dow were punished for a variety of stock-specific reasons. Let's have a look at some of those names here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (AAPL)Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest components in all three major U.S. indexes, slid 2.06% after Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang issued a rare &quot;sell&quot; rating on the stock. Apple, the largest technology member of the Dow, does not garner &quot;sell&quot; ratings with any level of frequency, but if iPhone sales disappoint, analysts could ratchet down ratings on Apple.&quot;We believe Apple will face fundamental deterioration over the next 6-12 months,&quot; said Zhang in a note. &quot;We believe new iPhone sales will be disappointing [and] iPad sales growth will slow in the second half of 2019.&quot; Verizon Inc. (VZ)Verizon (NYSE:VZ), usually a defensive name, was somewhat offensive today, losing 0.70% after Citigroup lowered its rating to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy,&quot; citing risks in the broader telecommunications space.&quot;The opportunities for further multiple expansion have narrowed, in our view, as we close in on different wireless merger scenarios from what we previously envisioned and Verizon is less likely to pursue bolder strategic moves to accelerate its network and 5G strategies over the next 6-12 months,&quot; said Citi analyst Michael Rollins in a note. Looking For Good News?Investors looking for positive vibes on a day when those were hard to come by can focus on at least two Dow stocks. Let's start with UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare component in the Dow. Shares of the beleaguered health insurance provider could be second-half winners.&quot;That's at least according to technical analyst Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors. With UnitedHealth shares down nearly 14% from their 52-week highs made in December, Newton said Friday that this Dow dud is poised for a breakout,&quot; reports CNBC.A cyclical name to consider may just be Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), shares of which are up just 7.35% this year.&quot;Caterpillar has created a virtuous cycle by manufacturing superior quality equipment that has fostered a premium product reputation,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;The equipment therefore is highly fungible with known resale values. It also has a robust support infrastructure, which creates a lucrative aftermarket business.&quot; Bottom LineWith it appearing increasingly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this month or perhaps even this quarter, investors will likely be beholden to company-specific events over the near-term. That will be even more true as second-quarter earnings reports start trickling in over the coming days.This week, however, hope burns eternal for encouraging news on the rate cut front.&quot;Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to give testimony on monetary policy before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, which some investors expect will provide clues regarding the likelihood of a rate cut from the U.S. central bank when it meets at the end of the month,&quot; reports Reuters.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-10,"The following are not Dogs of the Dow stocks in 2019, but risky looking price charts hint at looming dogged price action in 3M (NYSE:MMM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And the always real possibility of these companies making that list next year is a strong reason to short MMM, CAT and AAPL stock today.Dow Jones stocks sometimes go up and at other times, they go down. Mostly these days, it happens to be the case the bulk of these blue-chips go up. For its part the bellwether average is up nearly 15% on the year and roughly 1% removed from its recent all-time-highs.At the same time, leading Dow constituents Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), American Express (NYSE:APX) and Visa (NYSE:V) are up roughly 30% to 35% in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe gains are certainly nice, as are AAPL stock's own outperformance of nearly 27%. Still, what goes up does eventually go down. And CAT stock's relative under-performance of 5% and MMM stock's decline of nearly 13.50% are testaments of this cyclical certainty. And if the price charts allow, sometimes investors are even offered a well-placed short stock opportunity.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on College Students' Radars With that in mind, MMM, CAT and AAPL stock are in this technically perilous situation right now and ready for shorting. And if today's bearish price patterns behave really dogged in 2019's second half, these three shorts might even land on next year's yield-driven Dogs of the Dow list for buying. 3M (MMM)  Click to Enlarge3M is our first bearish Dow Jones stock to short. MMM stock is the worst performer of today's three names. And right now, the chart is offering a good entry point to profit from continued weakness.The weekly chart points to MMM stock following through on the downside out of a bearish flag. The pattern has formed inside a former support area comprised of key Fibonacci levels which failed this past spring and have turned into staunch resistance.The MMM Stock TradeWith shares already confirming the pivot high within the bear flag and stochastics forming a bearish crossover from neutral levels, MMM stock looks like a short today. I'd suggest a stop loss of 8% to contain potential losses and smartly exit if resistance is overcome. Optimistically though, a profitable trend for bears could put shares back toward the 2016 lows near $125. Caterpillar (CAT)  Click to EnlargeCaterpillar is our next Dow Jones stock to short. CAT stock is already showing relative weakness this year. But if a weekly price chart showing lower highs and a couple bullish trend failures since late last year have any say, conditions are going to get worse.Bearish operators also have a nice spot to short this Dow Jones stock with limited risk and potentially outsized rewards. Following June's rally, shares have formed a pivot top within a countertrend rally against resistance.The CAT Stock TradeMy recommended strategy in CAT stock is to wait on a short through last week's topping candle low of $133.22. That price confirmation should also help a stochastics set-up that's currently on the cusp of turning lower and signaling a bearish crossover.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half For this Dow Jones stock short I'd suggest a 9% stop and size the position accordingly. Similar to MMM stock, this exit limits losses and closes the position if pattern resistance fails. On the downside, I'd look to take partial and much larger profits on a test of last year's corrective low near $110. Apple (AAPL)Apple is our third and final Dow Jones stock to short. AAPL stock's gains this year are nothing to sneeze at, but a second lower high pivot on the weekly view doesn't look good. And with price action set against a former trend line, the current cycle's 76% resistance level and a mostly favorable-looking stochastics position, an AAPL short looks even better.The AAPL Stock TradeWith Apple stock confirming a pivot high this week as shares moved through $200.65, shares could be shorted today while using a stop-loss above the pattern's candlestick high of $205.08.But I'd wait.Since this Dow stock finished Tuesday modestly above the short signal price, I like placing Apple shares on the radar for shorting on a bearish re-cross of $200.65 for additional confirmation. The entry is also contingent on last week's high remaining intact and of course, using it for keeping risk well-managed off and on the price chart.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-11,"Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has risen by nearly 5% over the last month. Though that leaves CAT stock still within its trading range, it offers some hope for the owners of CAT stock who have seen CAT do little over the last two years.Source: Shutterstock However, an ongoing trade war, as well as a perceived economic slowdown, have weighed on Caterpillar stock. As a result, CAT stock not only has a low valuation, but is also facing questions about how long it will take to move beyond its early 2018 highs. Considering the price action of CAT stock and the state of the global economy, only income-oriented investors should buy CAT at these levels. CAT Stock Is Primarily a Dividend StockGiven CAT's sector and its long-term track record, most investors who buy CAT stock will probably do so because of its dividend. The payout has risen in most years since 2003. The one exception was 2009, when the company maintained the same payout. The dividend has not been reduced since 1992.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo achieve &quot;dividend aristocrat&quot; status, a company must have hiked its dividend for at least 25 straight years. CAT stock does not fit this description. Still, the company's consistent annual dividend growth since 2010 means investors can treat CAT like a dividend stock. Moreover, with a current yield of nearly 3.1%, I agree with my fellow InvestorPlace columnist, Dana Blankenhorn, that CAT stock is a buy for income investors. But a Case for Growth Exists as WellHowever, I disagree with Blankenhorn's assessment that investors seeking  capital gains should not buy CAT stock. Investors should note that CAT stock price fell as low as $21.71 per share in 2009. At today's price of almost $133 per share, that represents an increase of more than six-fold.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for Less Than Book Also, CAT is very well-positioned from a competitive standpoint. It's much larger than its competitors Terex (NYSE:TEX), CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI), and Komatsu (OTCMKTS:KMTUY).Moreover, it trades at a price-earnings (PE) ratio of about 12.4. History has shown that CAT stock rarely falls to such a low multiple. Consequently,  Caterpillar stock is currently cheap. Growth-Oriented Investors should Wait for a PullbackDespite CAT's low valuation, I think Caterpillar stock is less of a slam dunk for growth investors. Given current global economic conditions, CAT stock is cheap for a reason. Thanks to the U.S.-China trade war, CAT stock has fallen by nearly 18% since January 2018.China accounts for only about 10% of Caterpillar's revenue. Still,  an ongoing geopolitical dispute between the U.S. and China would not serve the company well.The trade war has slowed the growth of CAT's Construction Industries division. Also, with oil trading around $60 per barrel,the results of CAT's Energy and Transportation unit have only been improving modestly. The one bright spot within the unit came from the Resource Industries division, whose revenue grew by 18% year-over-year. Unfortunately, the division accounts for less than 20% of CAT's revenue.For investors focused on growth, I would wait for a slight pullback of Caterpillar stock price. Over the last year, CAT stock price fell below the $120 per share level three times and quickly recovered each time. I see this level as its floor. I also think the ongoing trade war and concerns about the economy could easily take CAT stock back to that level. While Caterpillar stock will be a winner over the long-term, winning with CAT stock in the shorter term will take patience.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth in the Second Half of 2019  Final Thoughts on CAT StockAt its current levels, CAT stock remains a clear winner only for dividend investors. Under current conditions, I would not discourage income investors from buying CAT right now. The current CAT stock price of around $133 per share is well above the average of the last two months. However, it still gives income investors a low-cost entry point to achieve a 3%-plus cash return.On the other hand, investors who want both growth and income should wait. Current macro conditions and the trade war will probably keep CAT stock at a low PE ratio for the foreseeable future. Still, CAT has established a price floor just below the $120 per share level. For those with the courage to buy the shares at those levels, CAT stock could become both a growth and income play over the longer term.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The report highlighted the stock as the member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the most potential upside over the next 12 months.The research firm sees Dow stock climbing more than 22% over the next year, a move that would take the shares over $60.Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) jumped 3.28% today.

2019-07-17,"In advance of important earnings reports coming Thursday from some big-name members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the major U.S. equity indexes did a whole lot of nothing Wednesday.Source: Shutterstock The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 lost 0.46% and 0.65%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged lower by 0.42%.On World Emoji Day, investors probably were not throwing around a lot of smiley emojis. The earnings reports that were out today, though not from members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were concerning.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBank of America (NYSE:BAC) echoed a refrain that we've been hearing a lot of during financial services reporting season: expect lower net interest margins.Adding to the concern, at least for industrial stocks, a bellwether sector due to its cyclical nature, was a roughly 10% plunge for railroad operator CSX (NASDAQ:CSX). That's a tumble that occurred on more than seven times the stock's average daily volume.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip CSX &quot;earned $1.08 in adjusted earnings per share from almost $3.1 billion in sales, about 2% worse than analysts predicted. Weak volumes were to blame. Shipments fell 4% year over year in the second quarter. What's more, CSX lowered its 2019 sales guidance and now expects revenue to fall about 1% this year,&quot; according to Barron's. Wednesday WinnersIn what could be an encouraging sign, some of the members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that report earnings tomorrow were among the index's better-performing names today. For example, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) jumped 0.76%. The managed care provider delivers second-quarter results Thursday before the open of U.S. markets.Analysts are expecting earnings of $3.45 per share on revenue of $60.6 billion. UNH has endured its share of politically-charged struggles this year, but the shares have been on a torrid pace of late and enter the Thursday earnings report up more than 8% this month.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) lost 0.59% today. The software giant reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday as well with analysts expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.21 on revenue of $32.8 billion.Much of the story here will revolve around Microsoft's comments on refreshing existing products, new offerings and the company's commentary on Azure, its booming cloud business. The stock is up nearly 36% year-to-date, good for one of the best showings among mature, mega-cap technology names.It wasn't one of the Dow winners today and it doesn't report earnings tomorrow, but Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a name worth discussing briefly. As an industrial stock and one of the larger ones at that, Caterpillar slumped 2.39% today, a decline largely tied to the aforementioned glum earnings report from CSX.Shares of Caterpillar could be boosted by an interest rate cut, any progress on the trade front with China and some market observers note the stock is attractively valued relative to other well-known industrial names. Bottom Line: Some HopeOne more thing to watch: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), another member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reports earnings after the bell today. The stock fell 0.31% in advance of that report. Wall Street is expecting earnings of $3.07 per share on revenue of $19.16 billion.In the good news category, this earnings season may prove to be better than previously expected if the reports revealed prior to Wednesday are accurate indicators.&quot;The earnings season began this week, with 43 S&P 500 companies reporting as of Wednesday morning, and a whopping 84% beating analysts' estimates,&quot; according to CNBC.Analysts were expecting an earnings contraction, but the reports to date indicate the S&P 500 will likely see a modest uptick in second-quarter profits.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-22,"If there's any one company that should benefit from President Trump's administration, it's Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Although several organizations have flourished under the general Republican ethos of less government restrictions, Trump himself routinely mentioned CAT stock on the campaign trail.Source: Shutterstock For him, it was a great juxtaposition for his somewhat anachronistic world view. On one hand, we have Caterpillar stock, an icon of American industry, but one that has faded under liberal policies. And on the other hand, we have the &quot;bad guys,&quot; or Japanese firms like Komatsu (OTCMKTS:KMTUY).These foreign companies are out on the prowl, stealing American jobs through unfair trade platforms and currency manipulation. Thus, the message was that the CAT stock price had nowhere to go but down.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Of course, nuance has never been the President's strong suit, or at least he doesn't reveal much of it publicly. That said, his fiery brand of conservatism obviously worked. Enough Americans bought into the us-versus-them message, handing the former real estate mogul an unexpected victory. What's more, he has done a great job for Caterpillar stock.Since election day Nov. 8, 2016, the CAT stock price has gained nearly 73%. Although that's nothing to write home about considering the time length, it's a remarkable turnaround. Following an initial recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, Caterpillar stock entered a choppy, but largely sideways consolidation pattern.The second half of 2014 devolved into an ugly downtrend. In the following year, nothing changed.Thus, Trump's election gave CAT stock a fundamental boost. But is there enough juice left for a repeat performance following a year of lackluster performance? CAT Stock Needs a Compelling Earnings ReportOn Wednesday before the opening bell, Caterpillar is on schedule to release its second quarter of 2019 earnings report. While all quarterly fiscal performances are important, this one could be especially crucial to the CAT stock price. For the trailing 52-weeks, shares haven't gone anywhere.Clearly, investors haven't gotten over the electoral narrative that first skyrocketed Caterpillar stock. Now, they want to see substance. Can management deliver the goods?For Q2, covering analysts peg consensus earnings-per-share at $3.12. This figure is just slightly toward the bullish end of the estimate spectrum, ranging from $2.99 to $3.25. In the year-ago quarter, Caterpillar produced an EPS of $2.97 against a consensus $2.73 target.On the revenue front, analysts anticipate a consensus haul of $14.4 billion. This is much more aligned with the optimistic end of estimates, which range from $13.5 billion to $14.9 billion. In Q2 2018, the industrial-equipment maker rang up $14 billion.Can Caterpillar produce a beat? Based on historical performances in the Trump era (Q1 2017 through Q1 2019), I don't think a beat is unreasonable. For instance, if Q2 sales comes in as forecast, it would represent a 2.8% year-over-year lift. During Trump's administration, the average YOY sales growth is 16.4%.  Click to EnlargeHowever, I believe that Caterpillar stock will need much more than a solid beat to interest prospective buyers. During the Obama administration, quarterly revenue peaked at $14.24 billion in Q4 2014 before immediately tumbling thereafter.In the Trump years, Caterpillar revenue has peaked at $14.34 billion. It's an improvement over Q4 2014's sales haul, but not by much. And, overall, the company has only brought revenue to its last high point, and not above it. That's got to be concerning for stakeholders of CAT stock. Caterpillar Stock Is An &quot;Avoid&quot; Prior to Q2 EarningsInterestingly, Zacks Equity Research doesn't predict that CAT stock will produce an earnings beat for Q2. The research firm uses various proprietary mechanisms to forecast which companies are likely to bring home the bacon. Apparently, Caterpillar isn't one of them.  * 7 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy for 2019 Before you call me a hater, I don't think it's all bad news for the company. Certainly, speculators can gamble on certain bullish subsegments, such as mining. Recently, gold and silver prices have skyrocketed, which draws positive interest to the mining industry.However, that's just one segment. Overall, I don't like the lack of substantive progress that Caterpillar has made. In the nine quarters of the Trump administration, the company has rang up $113.7 billion in top-line sales. In the nine quarters prior to Trump, Caterpillar generated $99.8 billion.But here's the thing: the $99.8 billion was during a downtrend. The $113.7 billion, though, was during an uptrend. And at just a 14% increase during the Trump administration, it's nothing to write home about. So, unless you feel there's a compelling driver here, I'd sit Caterpillar stock on the sidelines.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-25,"Some stocks are destined to change the world. Today we examine three stocks to trade that definitely changed how the world works: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), and Boeing (NYSE:BA), all three deeply impacted humanity as we know it in major ways. Boeing changed how we commute long distances, Caterpillar made it easier to develop societies, and most recently Facebook changed the way we connect with loved ones friends and families across the globe. Each in its own right made the planet smaller and more user-friendly.But did earnings make them more trader friendly? Each of these stocks to trade has also had its share of less-than-savory headlines.  * 10 Small-Cap, Up-And-Coming Stocks to Keep on Your Radar All three of these stocks to trade recently reported earnings and the reactions in their stocks varied. Nevertheless these three stocks are still good ones to accumulate or hold. But keep in mind that U.S. stock markets are near all-time highs so taking any bullish position now has inherent risk. So I don't recommend taking full positions all at once. This leaves room to add on dips. And I never risk more than I can afford to lose.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock Last night, Facebook reported earnings and FB stock soared to all-time high levels. This after a day that started really red for Facebook. The night before, news broke that Facebook would be of a record $5 billion over privacy breaches as well as be subject to additional government oversight. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also announced &quot;some major structural changes to how we build products and run this company.&quot;Even though these were unprecedentedly bad headlines, this Facebook stock shrugged them off and rallied more than 1% into the close. And then the earnings came out and it spiked FB to all-time highs as they beat all metric expectations leaving very little for the bears to sink their teeth into.Simply put, it is hard to deny great results and to do so in the face of so many headwinds political and otherwise is truly jaw-drop inspiring. Clearly Facebook management team is doing all it can to satisfy its investors and the public opinion alike. The fundamentals of the Facebook stock are solid even though it sells at a high multiple to its forward sales. It does have the cash to support it and the growth to inspire it.This is a company that has not yet disappointed back-to-back with its efforts. So the bulls will continue to buy the dips. Sure there are still political hurdles, but in the end the politicians will get tired of the I hate Facebook meme and move on to another soapbox that is fresher. Boeing (BA)The Boeing situation is very similar to that of Facebook. This is a prior star on Wall Street whose sheen has dimmed of late. The tragic crashes that killed so many people are reason enough to warrant severe scrutiny.To that, the Boeing stock has suffered tremendously -- as it should have. And the momentum that should have followed earnings results has been severely hampered. Recently BA set a price tag of $5 billion to the extra costs stemming from the 737 Max debacle. Although this is not a fixed cost, it does alleviate most of the uncertainties around it for investors.But Wall Street hates the unknown, so when BA announced the charge last week the stock rallied. Yesterday BA stock fell 3% on their earnings report but it could have been much worse given the circumstances.Management missed the mark, so in light of the absence of any good news investors acted very tamely with the BA stock. Especially that the delays for the 737 Max continue to persist. They may even cut production levels more.  * 3 Ways to Play the Historic Bargain In Chinese Stocks Yet and in spite of the deluge of bad news and the complete absence of any good news, BA investors still buy the dips and the stock is 18% from its all-time highs. So this is reason enough to hold the stock for the long term. It may even be a good time to start building a position if not in it already. Once the Max model is allowed to fly, BA stock should also soar with it. Caterpillar (CAT)Source: Shutterstock This one is a bit trickier since CAT stock has been struggling for so long. In April of last year, the Chief Financial Officer Bradley Halverson told investors that they may be be at a &quot;high watermark&quot; for the year. His words were prophetic because the stock started a 25% slide in spite of a great earnings report and it hasn't yet recovered.Unlike for BA or FB stock, investors are selling the rips in CAT stock. But on a wider span of time. The stock has been recovering from January 2016 lows and even though it has been falling since January 2018, this is part of normal price action. The CAT bulls did a great job rebounding off 2016 lows and they are now retesting the half-back test of this rally. Fibonacci levels are important for Wall Street traders as they tend to repeat themselves. So as long as Caterpillar stock stays above the $117 per share zone then the 2016 recovery efforts are still ongoing.So why own it now?The technical make up on the charts. CAT has been setting lower highs and bouncing off a floor just above $120 per share. This is a long term pivot level so it is likely to hold. Then the bulls would have sure footing to break through the descending trend line of lower highs and rally and try to recover better levels gone by.CAT was once a beloved stock and it can be that again. The fundamentals support that theory since it only sells at a 13 trailing price-to-earnings ratio and 1.4 times sales. These are humble valuations that leave very little fluff. There is no more fat on this bone, and soon, the meat will attract the fundamental buyers once more.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-07-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- 3M Co.’s decision to maintain its sales guidance for the year leaves the company dependent on a second-half turnaround that seems unlikely to materialize.The maker of Post-it notes and industrial adhesives reported second-quarter earnings per share on Thursday that were significantly better than analysts had expected as the company’s cost-cutting plan took hold. But sales declined 0.9% in the period after backing out the effects of M&A and currency swings. That’s in line with CEO Michael Roman’s comments in May that the second quarter was trending toward a decline similar to the 1.1% drop that 3M saw in the first quarter. That performance leaves the company with a 1% organic sales decline for the first six months of the year. And yet the company is still holding out hope that it can get to a 2% gain for 2019. That seems a bridge too far.   Yes, the year-over-year comparisons get easier in the third and fourth quarters. But to push organic sales growth into positive territory, 3M likely needs to see a stabilization in China and automotive markets and avoid fresh trouble spots, RBC analyst Deane Dray wrote in report before the release. Other companies are much less sanguine about the prospects of such a recovery. Rockwell Automation Inc. also released its results on Thursday and noted weakness in markets with shorter sales cycles, including automotive, semiconductors and food and beverage. Rockwell is cutting its organic sales and earnings guidance for the full year because “uncertainty with respect to global trade is impacting some customers’ investment decisions.” Ford Motor Co., which released its results late Wednesday, did shrink its operating loss in China to $155 million in the second quarter, versus a loss of $483 million in the year-earlier period. The company said it was encouraged by that, but the Chinese economy and the vehicle market in particular are under “recent and persistent stress.” Ford’s second-quarter earnings and an updated full-year outlook both fell short of analysts’ estimates. Caterpillar Inc.’s results released on Wednesday also showed a significant slowdown in Asia amid competitive pricing pressure in China.Taken together, it’s more evidence that a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut alone may not be enough to spur investment in manufacturing activity or counteract negative trends overseas and damaging trade policy. Industrial companies have thus far borne the brunt of fallout from the U.S.-China trade war, both through the cost of tariffs and the demand slump wrought by the associated uncertainty. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  are set to travel to China on Monday for the first high-level, face-to-face negotiations since President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a tentative cease-fire at the June G-20 conference. But there remain significant differences of opinion and there’s little sign the protracted conflict will be resolved in a tidy fashion any time soon.On the bright side, 3M’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings will go a good ways toward rebuilding the company’s reputation as a top notch operator that can defend its margins even in downturn. And CEO Roman avoids the credibility hit of yet another guidance cut (before this, the company had lowered its sales or earnings outlook five times in just one year). But the risk is that 3M has only kicked the can down the road.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-07-25,"Recently announced buybacks and dividend hikes might be tempting, but don't dig a hole going long Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). More than ever and following a weak earnings report, CAT stock is a dog with fleas worthy of shorting.Source: Shutterstock Blame it on what you will. From rising manufacturing costs, a soft global economy or the U.S. China trade war, there's some solid choices for what's ailing CAT stock. More to the point, on Wednesday, the Dow Jones constituent and machinery giant did disappoint investors with its second-quarter results, which sent shares tumbling lower by nearly 4.5%.Headlining for the bears, tepid profit growth of less than 1% missed Street forecasts calling for 5% growth as earnings of $2.83 per share came in well short of forecasts of $3.12. Revenues also came up light. Sales climbed by 3% to $14.43 billion compared to consensus estimates of $14.52 billion on growth of 4%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe good news, if any, is Caterpillar reaffirmed its 2019 profit guidance of $12.06 - $13.06 per share. The range compares favorably to the Street's mid-point of $12.22. However, one canary in the coalmine could be management now expects earnings to be at the lower end of the range.The other canary warning investors to not be complacent and dismiss the report as old information already priced in, is the CAT stock chart. Now more than ever it's time to position as a bear for big-time profits down the road.  * 10 Small-Cap, Up-And-Coming Stocks to Keep on Your Radar  CAT Stock Weekly Chart  Click to EnlargeA weak year for CAT stock now has the back half of 2019 looking even stronger for bearish shorts. Prior to Wednesday's pressure, the weekly chart shows shares have already carved out a series of lower highs since setting an all-time-high in early 2018.More recently, two lower highs formed in 2019 also failed to overcome trendline resistance, which previously acted as uptrend support. Now, and following yesterday's decline, CAT stock has confirmed the latter weekly doji high when shares traded beneath the pattern's low.With shares of Caterpillar less than 1% below the signal price of $133.02 and a bearishly positioned stochastics confirming the pattern weakness, CAT is offering bears a nice shorting opportunity with reduced risk and potential outsized rewards. The CAT Stock TradeThe recommended strategy in CAT stock is to short shares today. If all goes and shares do continue to crater in 2019, I'd look to take partial and much larger profits on a test of last year's corrective low near $110.For containing risk I'd suggest a stop-loss placed 7.5% above-the-market. This minimizes exposure, but also exits only if bulls can muscle shares above $141.80. That's 1.6% above last week's pivot high and sufficient wiggle room to warrant closing the position without overstaying a deteriorating price chart for bears.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in Caterpillar stock, its derivatives or any other securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-25,"We are in the heart of the first-quarter earnings season, with results coming in hot and heavy. After solid numbers from the early reporters -- primarily in the technology and financial sectors -- we are starting to get statements from the industrials and other manufacturing names. And boy, the results aren't pretty, as many of the macroeconomic headwinds, including a global slowdown in manufacturing activity, hit these issues square in the jaw. Blue-chip stocks are not immune from the damage.Remember, expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are predicated on uneven economic growth. That is tied in large part to the trade tensions between the United States and China. And that is having a real impact on the bottom line of many of the largest companies listed on U.S. exchanges.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Here are four blue-chip stocks suffering declines:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Blue-Chip Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares are down hard, losing nearly 5% on Wednesday, testing below their 200-day and 50-day moving averages. This sets the stage for a possible drop back to the lows set in late May, which would be worth a loss of roughly 10% from here and would extend a long, slow downtrend pattern that's been in play since January 2018.The company reported earnings of $2.83 per share, missing estimates by 28 cents per share on a 3% rise in revenues. Management lowered forward guidance as well, looking for modest sales growth as trade tensions with China continue. Dealer inventories have also been a drag. Boeing (BA)Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell more than 3% on Wednesday to drop back below their 200-day moving average after topping near $380 on resistance going back to March. The company reported a large miss and announced a delay to its 777X program, adding to its woes on the 737 MAX program. The non-GAAP loss totaled $5.82 per share on a 35.1% drop in revenues. Management has continued to suspend full-year guidance.  * 7 Stocks to Buy This Summer Earnings Season What really tripped the stock up, however, was word the MAX grounding would impact cash flow beyond 2019. Watch for a decline back to the December low, which would be worth a loss of nearly 20% from here. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are down more than 13% today after reporting disappointing numbers. A loss of $1.12 per share was 76 cents worse than expected despite a 58.7% rise in revenues. Gross margins fell 1.3% to 18.9%. While capex spending plans were reduced slightly, the company remains on track for the start of production on the Model Y and the opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory.What's troubling is that despite the company's aggressive growth efforts, its push downmarket hasn't quelled its cash burn rate or bolstered its profitability. That calls into question CEO Elon Musk's desire to be an increasingly mainstream company rather than a maker of high-end specialty sports sedans and SUVs. Deere (DE)While Deere (NYSE:DE) hasn't reported earnings this week, it's vulnerable to the selling pressure hitting Caterpillar as it bumps up against resistance from its late-April high. Watch for a possible drop to test support from the January-May, which would be worth a loss of roughly 8% from here, on worries the trade tensions with China continue to weigh on U.S. farm products and thus, agricultural equipment sales.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund The company last reported earnings on May 17. Earnings of $3.52 missed estimates by 11 cents on a 5.4% rise in revenues. The company will next report on Aug. 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.86 per share on revenues of $9.4 billion.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-26,"(Bloomberg) -- They’ve carried the world’s largest economy through a tough patch before. History suggests American consumers could do it again.Friday’s report on U.S. growth underscored how much the expansion -- which this month became the longest on record -- now largely relies on Americans staying happy and spending, while global weakness and President Donald Trump’s tariffs eat away at contributions from business investment.It’s a replay of 2015 and 2016, when an oil-led slowdown in manufacturing put shoppers in the same spotlight. At the time, consumers kept the expansion rolling thanks to a robust labor market that’s only tightened since then.The question is whether they can sustain it now, as the U.S.-China trade war could further curb business investment, potentially spilling over from manufacturing to service producers that make up the majority of the economy and labor market. The grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max jet and lower oil prices that hit producers are also weighing on company spending.Economists and investors expect Federal Reserve policy makers to cut interest rates next week to guard against risks. One positive sign: wages and salaries rose in the first half at the fastest rate since 2007, and the saving rate remains relatively high, providing plenty of fodder for consumers, whose spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.“The thing you’d like to see is a balanced growth profile, where the economy is standing on three solid legs -- consumer, businesses, and government spending,” said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG. “The onus is on the consumer to keep things going at this point.”The Commerce Department data Friday showed gross domestic product expanded at a 2.1% annualized rate in the April-June period, topping forecasts for 1.8%. Still, that was down from 3.1% in first quarter.Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, increased 4.3%, while government spending climbed 5% and offered the biggest boost in a decade. Nonresidential investment fell 0.6% for the first drop since 2015 and residential decreased for a sixth straight period.What Our Economists Say“While growth slowed relative to the first quarter, this is not necessarily negative news, given that its composition is more sustainable.”-- Carl Riccadonna and Eliza WingerClick here for the full note.There are some signs consumers will lead the way. McDonald’s Corp. grew at a blistering pace in the latest quarter, with same-store sales bolstered by a jump in its home market, the company’s earnings report showed Friday. Starbucks Corp. on Thursday said U.S. comparable-store sales soared from a year earlier.Other indications that the consumer is in good shape: Sentiment is near historical highs, and retail sales have advanced for four straight months, the longest streak since early 2018.It’s reminiscent of the 2015 growth picture, when Americans came through to save the expansion. Corporate profits had dropped for the first time in seven years, while consumption kept humming at a solid pace.Friday’s report “shows we are not seeing shocks to the U.S. consumer,” Denise Chisholm, a strategist at Fidelity Management, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It’s positive from the framework of, we may see a prolonged expansion cycle continue.”Other data have highlighted the cooler pace of growth, with manufacturing figures showing tepid conditions and bellwether Caterpillar Inc. reporting a lackluster second quarter. A measure of U.S. production has declined in consecutive quarters, the common definition of recession, while a gauge of global factory activity contracted in May and June.Trump targets growth of about 3%. Economists have seen the pace remaining under 2% through at least the end of next year -- though unlikely to get much worse.“We have pockets of weakness in manufacturing, business investment, but as the consumer goes, so does the U.S. economy -- the fundamentals for the consumer are very, very good,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. “Unless the consumer starts to hunker it in, I think the U.S. economy is going to get through this little soft patch.”&#92;--With assistance from Kristy Scheuble, Sophie Caronello, Ryan Haar and Vince Golle.To contact the reporters on this story: Katia Dmitrieva in Washington at edmitrieva1@bloomberg.net;Reade Pickert in Washington at epickert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Scott Lanman at slanman@bloomberg.net, Jeff KearnsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Future of U.S. Growth on Consumers’ Shoulders in Replay of 2015

2019-08-01,US announces 10% tariff on additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods Continue reading...,US Indexes Close Lower Thursday With China Tariff Announcement
2019-08-01,"Underscoring the highly fragile nature of the U.S.-China trade relationship, stocks tumbled late Thursday after President Donald Trump took to Twitter to voice his dissatisfaction with the trade talk while threatening to apply a 10% tariff on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods starting Sept. 1. That would be in addition to the current levy of 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S.Among other issues, Trump is irked by China's refusal to increase purchase of American agriculture products and the country's inability to stop exports of the deadly synthetic opioid fetanyl.&quot;Additionally, my friend President Xi said that he would stop the sale of Fentanyl to the United States - this never happened, and many Americans continue to die!,&quot; said Trump in one of several tweets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 A wide array of sectors were plagued by Trump's Twitter trade barbs, resulting in the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 shedding 0.79% and 0.90%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled lower by 1.05%.Safe-have plays were in style today. As just one example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD), the largest gold ETF, continued what has been remarkable a ascent, adding 2.39% following the trade news. First, the Bad News for the DowIn what may be a delayed, gloomier reaction to yesterday's news that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) was the worst Dow loser today, sliding 3.87%. If that is indeed the case, today's sell is probably a bit too much too fast for a quality name like Goldman.The 3.71% decline in shares of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the Dow's second-worst performer today, was more understandable because that company has significant China exposure and has previously warned about its sensitivity to U.S.-China trade talks. Not only does Caterpillar's Thursday slide come after a rough July for the industrial machinery maker, it nearly wipes out the stock's year-to-date gains.In what is not a surprise to seasoned investors, oil prices tumbled on the trade news, amplifying concerns ahead of some marquee energy earnings reports Friday before the bell. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), both Dow components, report tomorrow. Recent price action in these names suggests investors should be betting on big upside surprises. Standouts in the DowThursday was another day when Dow winners were in short supply. When the closing bell rang, just seven of the Dow's 30 members closed higher and just three of those names were up more than 1%.Give some credit to International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). Big Blue added 1.42% after Morgan Stanley made bullish comments on IBM due in part to the company's recent Red Hat acquisition.&quot;On Thursday, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty resumed coverage of IBM shares with an Overweight rating and $170 price target,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;She wrote that normalized growth accelerated in the most recent quarter, and with Red Hat now part of IBM, that should drive sustainable annual growth of 2%--a rate that the stock's current valuation doesn't seem to reflect.&quot;Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) lost 0.02% after the company said it added 451,000 postpaid subscribers in the second quarter. The company still expects to earn $4.71 a share this year. Dow Jones Today Bottom LineThursday serves as a reminder that with a simple visit to Twitter, President Trump can move markets. It is also a reminder that until real progress is made on the trade front, investors may want to focus on sectors that generate big chunks of their revenue on a domestic basis. Those just happen to be some groups that also benefit from lower interest rates - real estate, telecom and utilities.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-02,"Do headlines of a slowing global economy or raised trade war threats have your attention? It may be time to look at the price charts of infrastructure stocks U.S. Steel (NYSE:X), Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and Cemex (NYSE:CX) to build long-term profits shorting and buying X stock, AA and shares of CX in your portfolio. Let me explain.Are you mulling why the Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in over a decade? Or does the latest news of an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese goods by the U.S. government have you worried? Well, you're not alone.These macroeconomic and geopolitical environment have Wall Street's undivided attention, while earnings season has quickly been shown the exit. But in order to profit from today's headlines, you have to look at the big picture. And that's where X stock, AA and CX come in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now Along with large-cap tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or an industrial play like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), infrastructure stocks are obviously a group worth watching. And within this market area X, AA stock and shares of CX are companies to put on the radar for selling and buying based on what their price charts and not today's headlines are telling us. Infrastructure Stocks: U.S. Steel (X)U.S. Steel is the first of our three infrastructure stocks. The provided weekly chart shows X stock has formed a bearish flag beneath lateral resistance dating back to the financial crisis. Even U.S. Steel's better-than-expected earnings report hasn't been able to put a bid in this one!That's not the only bearish evidence in X stock either. Today's pattern is the second time where shares have fallen below support. Coupled with a failed uptrend attempt in 2018, this second attempt at breaking through this critical area looks all the more ominous. The X Stock Trade Short this infrastructure stock now and look for an eventual move towards the 2016 low. To keep losses contained and prevent fighting a bearish trend, I'd recommend a stop-loss slightly above the pattern high. Alcoa (AA)Alcoa is the next of our infrastructure stocks to put on your radar. However, I'm watching AA stock for a purchase. The monthly chart in AA stock does a good job of displaying a large broadening pattern that has developed over the past decade. Shares of Alcoa are near support and that's bullish.The formation isn't perfect, but life rarely is either. More importantly, I see the spirit of this corrective base as being intact. And with a bullishly diverging stochastics setup, a bottom should be closer, rather than farther away. The AA Stock TradeShould a confirmed candlestick low in this infrastructure stock form in the coming weeks, AA stock offers plenty of upside and bang for the buck.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 Based on the most recent pattern highs and angular resistance, a long in Alcoa could see $65 to $70 over the next 12 to 18 months. Cemex (CX)You'll have to be the judge of whether I left the best infrastructure stock for last. Mexico-based Cemex never quite recovered from last decade's financial crisis. And conditions could get a great deal worse for CX stock.Now, as a victim of slowing global growth and trade wars, CX stock has broken neckline support on its monthly chart. And with shares trading at $3.25 it's hard not to see this bearish pattern as possibly being the final straw for shares of CEMEX. The CX Stock TradeMy recommendation on CX stock is to gain short exposure today. I'd personally suggest a longer-term option such as the January 2021 $3 put. Priced for 55 cents, this bearish contract greatly reduces and limits risk in the event of an adverse pattern failure. And optimistically, if we're right this could be a near five-bagger.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-07,"Interest rates act as a driver (or sometimes a detriment) to the performance of a stock. On July 31, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. However, those looking for cheap stocks to buy faced only disappointment, at least for now. Interestingly, the rate cut didn't lead to stock buying, but a stock selloff in Wednesday trading.Despite that short-term reaction, the first rate cut since the financial crisis should lower interest costs across the board. Also, depending on a company's offering, lower rates can change the value proposition on many products. Further, this will likely improve corporate balance sheets, many which hold dangerous levels of debt.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip As a result of debt, many equities have become cheap stocks to buy. With lower interest costs, some could gain the catalyst necessary to send stock prices higher. These five stocks to buy could see such gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock AT&T (NYSE:T) has become one of the cheap stocks to buy that is safe and dangerous at the same time. The company owns one of three nationwide 5G networks. Several of the latest technological advances such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT) will not advance as quickly as 5G. This will put AT&T along with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)However, unlike its peers, T also invested heavily in a content strategy through ownership of DirecTV and WarnerMedia. The content strategy helped to leave AT&T with the largest long-term debt load among its peers. These obligations stood at almost $164 billion as of the end of the first quarter. That leaves debt levels nearly as high as the company book value of just over $185.1 billion.However, lower rates can help lower interest costs, thus increasing their profit. It also makes capital more accessible as it continues to spend on 5G buildouts.Further, the company maintains a 34-year streak of dividend increases. Despite a yield of around 6%, ending the streak would devastate T stock despite a modest 9.3 forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. The lower borrowing costs ease the burden of this dividend. A lower debt burden could lead to more buying of AT&T as investors begin again to believe in the company. Caterpillar (CAT)Source: Shutterstock Real estate gets a lot of attention after a rate cut, but often forgotten are stocks like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), whose equipment plays a crucial role in building construction. Nonetheless, Caterpillar has not only suffered from slowing real estate sales, but the uncertainty brought about by the U.S.-China trade war. Moreover, CAT stock actually dropped after the Fed announced its interest rate cut.Before earnings, I warned investors that CAT stock only made sense for dividend-oriented investors. Shareholders have long benefited from a rising dividend, and nothing on the horizon looks like a threat to this payout.However, the lower price makes it an even better buy for income-focused investors. Thanks to the lower share price, CAT stock now yields 3.25%.Also, I mentioned that CAT had recovered from the $120 per share level three times. This current pullback has taken it to about $124 per share as of the time of this writing. That could indicate a limited downside.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Further, I list CAT as one of the cheap stocks to buy by virtue of the forward PE ratio which has fallen below 10. Even with lowered guidance, analysts expect 5.3% profit growth. Even if the stock took time to recover, investors would collect a generous dividend while they wait. If the rate cut helps it bounce off the $120 per share price flow, it could make CAT stock an income and growth play again. Chesapeake Energy (CHK)Source: Shutterstock Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) stock is among the cheap stocks to buy for a very good reason. The company maintains a market cap of around $2.7 billion even as it faces debt levels that stood at about $9.17 billion at the end of the first quarter. This debt rose when it purchased Wildhorse Resource Development so the natural gas company could increase its exposure to oil.Such debt levels make it a risky play. However, the company had returned to profitability before acquiring Wildhorse. The ability to refinance some of this debt at lower rates should ease the burden.Moreover, rising demand for oil should mean that Chesapeake can sell its oil and natural gas at higher prices, thus increasing profits. Furthermore, Chesapeake has steadily sold off assets to pay some of the debt off. Higher energy prices also make those properties easier to sell.Lower debt costs also provide lower borrowing costs for an industry CHK stock needs to drive its future, the natural gas export industry. Lower rates should facilitate the construction of planned natural gas facilities, thus further enabling Chesapeake to sell its product in Europe and Asia where natural gas sells for higher prices.Despite improving prospects, investors should still treat CHK stock as a speculative play. However, the odds of paying off debt and earnings profits dramatically increase in an environment of lower rates. Lennar Corporation (LEN)Source: Shutterstock Lennar (NYSE:LEN) brought in more revenue than its peers last year. However, its industry has begun to suffer as home sales have become flat. Interest rates have long served as an essential component of the real estate industry. These flat real estate prices likely helped influence the rate cut.Still, lower interest rates put home affordability within reach, and this should help sales and LEN stock. Due to the slower market in 2019, analysts forecast a 2% drop in profits for this year. However, they expect that growth will reach 8.8% this year. They also predict earnings increases averaging 9.45% per year over the next five years.With a forward PE ratio of around 8.2, we can easily classify LEN as one of the cheap stocks to buy in this industry. Further, with profit growth poised to reach almost 10% per year, such a valuation might give investors a reason to buy.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now LEN stock currently trades at around $49 per share. The home-buying spree in both the current and the last decade took Lennar above $60 per share before it fell back. It may take more than one interest rate cut for LEN to finally achieve a new all-time high. However, with profit growth set to resume, LEN stock looks set to return to historic highs. Newmont Goldcorp Corporation (NEM)Source: Shutterstock Early this year, Newmont Mining merged with Goldcorp to form Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM). The company suffered for years as falling gold prices sent NEM stock tumbling early in the decade. Today, it trades at a little bit more than half of its 2011 peak.However, gold prices have sustained themselves above the $1,400 per oz. in recent weeks as falling market interest rates and a rate cut have propelled investors back into gold. At just above $1,440 per oz., gold trades as its highest level since 2013.Currently, NEM stock trades at about 22.6 times forward earnings. That may not make it one of the more ideal cheap stocks to buy. An 8.2% profit decline expected for the year also does not help. However, analysts expect the benefits of higher gold prices to show up in profit forecasts soon. For 2020, Wall Street predicts that earnings will increase by 44.7%.The effects have yet to reach NEM stock. NEM has traded in a range since 2016. At $37 per share, it sells well above the $29-plus per share lows seen in this range. The critical points come at its 52-week high of $40.33 per share and its 2016 high of $46.27 per share. If it can break through both highs, Newmont Goldcorp could begin to enjoy the multi-year highs now bolstering the price of gold.As of this writing, Will Healy is long CHK stock.

2019-08-07,"The case for 3M (NYSE:MMM) is that an iconic American company has gone on sale. The MMM stock price dropped 27% in less than six weeks following first quarter earnings in April. 3M stock did manage a brief rally, but amid market-wide trade tensions the declines have resumed -- and the sale has returned. MMM sits less than 3% above a three-year low reached in late May.Source: Shutterstock At this lower price, 3M stock looks somewhat cheap at just 17.4x 2019 analyst EPS estimates. Its dividend yields a healthy 3.5%. Given its 100-year-plus history, bulls argue, these problems, too, shall pass -- and the MMM stock price eventually will rally.Perhaps. But as I pointed out in arguing against 3M stock before Q2 earnings, similar cases have applied to a number of disastrous investments in recent years. Investors could have said the same thing about General Electric (NYSE:GE), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), or Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 3 Steps Every Investor Should Take Before the Next Stock Market Crash The world is changing. Companies that don't keep up get in trouble. 3M may be able to get out of this tailspin -- but this isn't a selloff that has come from a simple overreaction. 3M has real problems. At the least, they may get worse before it gets better. Why Did the MMM Stock Price Run So Far?In retrospect, at least part of the problem for 3M stock appears to be that it simply ran too far. Before the disastrous Q1 release, MMM was trading at over 20x the midpoint of what was then its 2019 EPS guidance. That was simply too high -- for two reasons.First, 3M's growth already was decelerating. Organic constant-currency revenue increased just 3% in 2018. Adjusted EPS seemed to grow nicely, at 14% year-over-year. But about nine points of that growth came from a lower tax rate driven by U.S. tax reform. Adjusted operating income rose just 5.4%.Those might be figures that suggest a low-20s P/E multiple, particularly in this market. Indeed, I argued that 3M stock looked attractive last June, albeit at a price below $200. But there was a second issue which colored even that growth: 3M is a cyclical company.Given a strong macro environment in the U.S. -- which drove about 40% of revenue last year, per figures from the 10-K -- 3M should have been growing. And while MMM stock was rising, cyclicals across the board were falling in the second half of last year and (mostly) into 2019. Whether construction-related stocks or other machinery makers like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and John Deere (NYSE:DE), investors were discounting most other companies that had cyclical exposure. For whatever reason, 3M was excluded.The problem for 3M stock now is that it's only 'cheap' relative to the MMM stock price in April. But that price simply looks like it was too high, even ignoring the results since. In a market where the likes of CAT and DE are trading at 11-13x forward earnings -- and many cyclicals have single-digit multiples -- 20x+ seems far too much to pay. 3M Stock Going ForwardIf that's the case, then there's an obvious issue with 3M stock in the near to mid term. If 20x EPS is too expensive -- and that seems like the case -- then 17x+ isn't exactly cheap. Put another way, 3M stock might have fallen quite a bit, but part of the reason it fell is because it went too high in the first place.3M potentially could grow earnings next year, admittedly. Consensus next year is for EPS of $10.22, which suggests 7.6% from the midpoint of updated 2019 EPS guidance.But I'm not quite ready to start baking in growth just yet. That guidance was slashed after Q1 to $9.25-$9.75 on an adjusted basis. That's suggests a steep decline from 2018 levels (about 7-11%). Even worse, the high end of the range is actually below 2017 profit levels, normalized for the company's tax rate.3M isn't growing right now. And while the Street believes that could change in 2020, analysts also didn't see the Q1 guidance cut coming. And some caution is warranted, as there are obvious near-term risks to growth.After Q2, 3M again talked up weakness in China and in automotive end markets. Neither headwind seems likely to fade any time soon. 2018 revenue growth was driven by the company's Industrial and Safety and Graphics segments -- likely the two most cyclical businesses 3M has. Are we sure 3M is simply bouncing back next year, even with easier year-over-year comparisons?We shouldn't be. Because, again, this is a story that has played out before. No one expected GE stock to hit the single digits. Few expected a dividend cut from the likes of General Electric, Kraft Heinz and Anheuser-Busch.To be sure, 3M's situation isn't as dire as those became. But those stories prove how dangerous it can be to ignore real risks because the company has &quot;been around a long time&quot;. New Lows on the Way?From here, it wouldn't be at all surprising if 3M stock headed below $160 -- and potentially well below that figure. From a multi-year standpoint, this looks like a business that has stalled out. Looking forward, there are real risks in key end markets and in a suddenly nervous market. Execution has been spotty, between the guidance cut and an internal bribery investigation. Valuation is acceptable, but hardly compelling.The dividend yield might help the cause for some investors. But it's still 10%+ downside to even a 4% yield, which wouldn't be completely out of line. 3M has been aggressive in growing its payout, which has more than doubled since 2013. It's going to have to pull back on those increases. The payout ratio on an earnings basis is headed to 60%, and the company already has paused share repurchases after its purchase of Acelity.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip Indeed, if 3M hadn't run to $220 in April, it simply wouldn't look all that cheap or necessarily all that attractive right now. And it's probably not going to look either cheap or attractive until performance improves or the MMM stock price drops quite a bit further.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-08-07,"Once upon a time, some of America's greatest companies were based in what looked like the middle of nowhere.Source: Shutterstock Along I-74 in western Illinois, the squat home office of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) dominated the Peoria skyline. Off I-72, to the southeast, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) ruled the small town of Decatur.Both HQs have since decamped to Chicago, but there's big trouble back home. The trade war is unhealthy for the farm economy. Vendors like CAT and ADM aren't getting bailouts like the ones offered to their farmer clients.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThus, these stocks are now among the worst performers, or the biggest bargains, Wall Street has to offer. Caterpillar is down almost 13% over the last year. ADM is down almost 25%.Is it time to give these old farm dogs another look? Caterpillar Grows DividendOn the surface Caterpillar looks like a screaming bargain.With a market cap of $69.5 billion, on sales of $54 billion, Caterpillar sports a price-earnings multiple of just 11x with a newly raised dividend of $1.03 per share yielding 3.25%.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 Caterpillar makes more than farm equipment. Its equipment is also heavily used in construction. China is one of its biggest markets, and the stock took another leg down July 24 after it reported a profit of $1.6 billion, $2.83 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $14.4 billion. Caterpillar is a slow-growth company. Investors buy it for the dividend. During the second quarter the company earned that dividend nearly three times over. There was also $7.4 billion in cash on the books at the end of June. The dividend costs just $600 million per quarter.Caterpillar has been paying dividends continuously since 1981. The dividend has been boosted regularly and was just 70 cents per share five years ago. Before its latest hike last month, the dividend rate was 86 cents.But ask analysts about Caterpillar and they say sell. The chart pattern looks bearish in the short term, bearish in the medium term, bearish in the long run. Caterpillar is America's most successful maker of gas-powered engines. Even their mobile electric generators run on diesel. Can that really be a buy in the 2020s? ADM No Longer AmusesArcher Daniels Midland, meanwhile, looks like a disaster area.ADM bet that the trade war would end quickly. It has lost that bet. On June 30 the company announced earnings of $325 million, 42 cents per share fully adjusted, on revenue of $16.3 billion. The earnings were barely enough to pay the 35-cents a share dividend, with its 3.4% yield.Analysts were not amused. The earnings were down 41% from a year earlier. Bad spring weather was added to the China woes. Shares dropped by $2 each, and are since down another $2, the shares due to open below $38.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long The trade war and competition with other fuels is killing ADM's ethanol business. The company believes the China soybean market may be &quot;closed for good&quot; and it must find other markets for U.S. grain. Bottom Line on Ag-Related Dividend StocksFor income investors, market downturns can be a picnic. Prices go down and yields go up.But you must watch out for the ants, the bugs in the business model that put the dividend at risk.For Caterpillar, the bug is the complete lack of an electrification strategy. That may not look like trouble now, but such machines are coming. Fortunately, management has time and cash to deal with this, if it chooses to do so.ADM's problems are more basic, its margin of safety smaller. There's real trouble in the grain belt, where ADM creates markets. ADM helped create both the ethanol market and the corn syrup market. Can it turn America's grain surplus into meat?For now, ADM has the fatter yield, but CAT is the better bet.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. President Donald Trump took fresh aim at the U.S. currency on Thursday, taking a step closer to scrapping longstanding White House support for a strong dollar.“One would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not!” Trump said in a tweet. “The Fed’s high interest rate level, in comparison to other countries, is keeping the dollar high, making it more difficult for our great manufacturers” to compete, identifying Caterpillar Inc., Boeing Co. and Deere & Co.Trump’s tweets escalate his complaints over the dollar’s value and the Federal Reserve as he wages an increasingly heated trade war with China. The attack comes days after his administration branded China a currency manipulator and the president himself told reporters on July 26 that he had not ruled out intervention to weaken the dollar.Trump vowed to crack down on China during his 2016 White House bid and has placed his economic record at the center of his campaign to win re-election next year.The dollar has gained against nearly all of its Group of 10 peers this year. A trade-weighted index of the greenback adjusted for inflation is close to its highest point since 2003, showing the headwinds U.S. exports face.“With substantial Fed Cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening, the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition,” the president said Thursday. The Fed cut rates last week and ended the gradual shrinking of its balance sheet, which Trump calls quantitative tightening.The dollar slipped following the president’s comments and analysts said investors were concerned that the risk of a Trump currency intervention was growing.“The initial reaction was quite sharp, and probably reflects heightened anxiety around U.S. FX intervention,” said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo. He said the risk is “still moderate and pretty well below 50%, but the developments this week probably raised the probability somewhat.”Contradictory statements from the White House have not helped to clarify the position. Top Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on July 26 that the administration had ruled out currency intervention. A few hours later, the president told reporters “I didn’t say I’m not going to do something” on the dollar. Kudlow doubled down on Aug. 5, repeating during an interview on Bloomberg Television that intervention was off the table.Concern over the trade war has roiled U.S. stocks since Trump announced the day after the Fed cut rates that he was was prepared to raise tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports on Sept. 1. Beijing retaliated by allowing the yuan to slide past the key level of 7 per dollar for the first time since 2008.Global SlowdownFed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that businesses have reduced investment largely because of weak demand and a global slowdown, rather than high interest rates.Companies “don’t come in and say, ‘We’re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high,”’ Powell said at a press briefing following the Fed’s quarter-point interest-rate cut. “I haven’t heard that from a business. What you hear is that demand is weak for their products.”The strengthening dollar weighed on Caterpillar’s second-quarter results, especially with its gains against the euro and Australian dollar, the company said last month during an earnings call.Others have voiced a different perspective.General Motors Co. said currency fluctuations actually helped the company’s second-quarter earnings. The automaker was able to more than recoup price increases for its vehicles as a result of inflation in Argentina and Brazil, which helped operating profit during the quarter.German sportswear maker Adidas AG said it’s more worried about a currency war between the U.S. and China than the possibility that Trump would increase tariffs on footwear.“There is no winner in a currency war,“ Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted said on a call with reporters earlier on Thursday. “Eventually everybody will lose because it will lead to a slowdown in the global economy.”(Updates with market reaction in seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Craig Torres, David Welch, Matt Townsend and Shawn Donnan.To contact the reporters on this story: Katherine Greifeld in New York at kgreifeld@bloomberg.net;Alister Bull in Washington at abull7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Alister Bull, Vince GolleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Trump Voices Dismay Over Strong Dollar, Renews Fed Cut Call"

2019-08-08,"No need to do a double-take on that headline. U.S. stocks really did rally today thanks in large part to some surprisingly strong economic data out of China.The world's second-largest economy said exports jumped 3.3% last month while economists were expecting a 2% drop. Even amid the trade hostilities with the U.S., Chinese imports also fell less than expected in July.Sure, that was just one data report out of China and there is a very real possibility that the U.S. and its rival will butt heads again on trade, but for today, news that the Chinese economy remains firm was enough to lift riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates Buoyed by a resurgence in tariff-sensitive technology stocks, the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.24% while the S&P 500, where technology is also the largest sector, jumped 1.88%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished higher by 1.43%.Let's have a look at some interesting takeaways from the Dow today. Be Careful With This Dow SurpriseI've frequently mentioned industrial machinery maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) in this space and with good reason. Caterpillar is highly tariff-sensitive and is lower by nearly 5% this year, making it one of the worst-performing names in the Dow.Somehow, shares of Caterpillar added 1.03% Thursday even after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; while lower its price target on the shares to $130 from $156.Goldman &quot;believes rising inventories of trucks and construction machines will lead to production cuts in 2020. That will hurt next year's earnings for these companies. And higher inventories is another sign the global industrial economy is slowing down,&quot; reports Barron's.Analyst upgrades and downgrades are not gospel, but as it pertains to Caterpillar, it's hard to endorse the stock with trade tensions running high and the aforementioned factors cited by Goldman very much in play. Rebound Starting?Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is another name that has been getting some run here in recent days. Long story short, I've pointed out that the stock usually falls after earnings reports and that happened yesterday, but there is no shortage of support for Disney shares.The stock surged 2.29% today after Credit Suisse upgraded the ESPN owner to &quot;outperform&quot; while boosting its price target on the shares to $150 from $130, implying some decent upside from Disney's Thursday close around $137. Careful With the HeadlinesOn light news, Visa (NYSE:V) jumped 2.61%, good for one of the Dow's better performances today. I always try to be careful here when it comes to politics, the all views are welcomed policy remains in effect, so I'll just give to you straight about Visa: In an interview with CNBC, CEO Alfred Kelly said Visa will not ban customers from buying firearms with Visa-branded credit and debit cards.However, I doubt those comments sparked the stock today as fellow Dow component American Express (NYSE:AXP) and rival MasterCard (NYSE:MA) both gained on the day, too. Bottom Line on the Dow: Recession RiskNot to be the bearer of bad news, but economists are forecasting a rising risk of recession. That percentage is up to 35% from 31% last month, according to Bloomberg. Those same prognosticators are also saying U.S. GDP growth will average 2.3% this year, down from the prior estimate of 2.5%.Still, they're saying the recession probably won't start until 2021. For investors looking for some silver lining, the U.S. consumer remains healthy and it's hard to envision a recession against that backrdop. Plus, not to be trite, but economists are often wrong.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-08,"(Bloomberg) -- No wonder he’s frustrated: Donald Trump’s intensifying battle with China and other major trading partners is morphing into a global currency war, and it will be hard for him to win both.The president once again bemoaned dollar strength on Thursday, saying in a tweet he wasn’t thrilled with it and calling on policy makers to slash interest rates. Yet the trade tensions he has stoked have supported the currency this year.They’ve boosted demand for the greenback by helping fuel a mammoth bond rally, as investors seek out the safest assets, particularly Treasuries. Foreign ownership of American government debt has swelled to record highs, pushing yields to the lowest since 2016 on 10-year notes, a benchmark for global borrowing.Trump has repeatedly nagged the Federal Reserve to cut borrowing costs while complaining that the dollar is too strong. Should the Fed cut rates further this year, the monetary easing may actually shore up the U.S. economy, supporting the greenback. That may only add to Trump’s frustration. Options traders this week boosted wagers on a weaker yuan versus the dollar.“Whether President Trump can win the trade war and the ‘FX war’ seems rather doubtful,” said Kit Juckes, a global strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “If he wants a weaker dollar, he should want a stronger yuan and euro. Unfortunately for him, this trade rhetoric has had the opposite effect.”The dollar has strengthened about 2.5% against the euro and 2.4% versus the onshore yuan this year and is holding near its 2019 high on a trade-weighted basis. Trump’s latest threat of more tariffs on Chinese goods helped push the yuan past a psychological threshold of 7, the level defended by the authorities in the past.“The Fed’s high interest rate level, in comparison to other countries, is keeping the dollar high, making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like Caterpillar, Boeing, John Deere, our car companies, & others, to compete on a level playing field,” the president tweeted.Hours earlier, the yuan edged higher against the dollar after China’s central bank set the daily fixing stronger than analysts expected, providing some reassurance to traders rattled by a tumultuous week in markets.Options traders are paying more to bet on the dollar strengthening versus the yuan in the next three months, according to currency-options prices. Nordea Bank Abp raised its forecast for the dollar on Thursday, citing factors including the “escalated tariff war.”The question now is whether Beijing will allow that to happen, and what the Republican president may do in response.In the eyes of some analysts, further yuan weakness could raise the risk of currency intervention by the U.S. to weaken the dollar. It hasn’t taken that step since 2000, when it joined an international effort to support the euro.Intervention carried out for more than a few weeks could backfire and become supportive of the dollar, according to an analysis by UBS Group AG. For it to work, U.S. growth and carry advantages must both be blunted while the growth outlook in China and Europe improves, UBS said. That’s not a scenario economists expect.“The more likely outcome of the explicit currency war would be further extension of uncertainty, which ironically could prove to be dollar-positive if risk assets fear weaker growth and volatility pushes higher,” UBS strategists including Bhanu Baweja wrote in a note. It will also “shift rate differentials in the dollar’s favor, albeit with a lag” as other central banks respond with dovishness.Three central banks across Asia Pacific delivered surprise interest-rate decisions on Wednesday. New Zealand and India led with bigger-than-expected interest rate cuts, while Thailand’s 25-point reduction surprised all but two economists in a Bloomberg survey.Chris Chapman, a portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, is keeping most of his non-dollar exposure hedged despite the fact that the market is expecting at least two more Fed rate cuts in 2019. The issue here is that other central banks are cutting rates and easing policy. China looks set to step up stimulus to revive growth, while the European Central Bank has flagged fresh monetary action for as early as September.“The dollar could stay strong, as other central banks are also pursuing accommodative policy,” Chapman said. “The current market feels a little like there is a tug of war between what lower U.S. rates would do to the dollar versus the flight to safety flows.”(Updates with latest Trump tweet.)&#92;--With assistance from Michelle Jamrisko.To contact the reporter on this story: Anchalee Worrachate in London at aworrachate@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net, Todd White, Mark TannenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Keeps Accidentally Igniting Dollar With His Trade War
2019-08-08,"Shares of Caterpillar Inc.  edged up 0.4% in morning trading Thursday, but was still down 7.9% this month, after Goldman Sachs backed away from its 3-year long bullish stance on the machinery maker, citing concerns over lower resources demand and over-supply in the construction business. Analyst Jerry Revich cut his rating to neutral, after being at buy since October 2016, and cut his stock price target to $130 from $156. &quot;First, [Caterpillar's] resource order recovery has slowed significantly earlier than in prior cycles, with segment revenue and orders stabilizing at $11 billion run-rate this year, about 50% below the prior peak of $21 billion,&quot; Revich wrote in a note to clients. &quot;Second, after CAT had significantly reduced dealer inventories--particularly in construction industries--at the trough of the cycle, we were surprised to see the company build North America construction industries dealer inventories in the beginning of the North America construction season this year.&quot; The stock has shed 4.5% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 0.8%.","Caterpillar downgraded, price target slashed at Goldman Sachs"

2019-08-09,"Friday was another rough day for stocks. Guess why? President Donald Trump made some comments about the status of the trade relationship with China. The U.S. and China are set to hold trade talks in September, and though things have been contentious between the world's two largest economies, those talks remain on the schedule.However, President Trump gave market participants more than they wanted to ponder on a summer Friday, noting that he seems to be OK with the talks happening or not.&quot;We'll see whether or not we keep our meeting in September,&quot; said Trump at the White House today. &quot;If we do, that's fine. If we don't, that's fine.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRemember that on Sept. 1, assuming no trade resolution is agreed to before that date, the U.S. will impose a 10% tariff on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. That would go on top of the 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese products already in place.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What On the back of those comments, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1% while the S&P 500 gave back about two-thirds of a percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average headed into the weekend with a Friday loss of 0.34%.As for today's Dow losers, it was a list of the usual suspects thanks to the president's trade comments. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Nike (NYSE:NKE) and all of the Dow's technology components closed lower on the day. Bad Big BlueOn a light news day specific to the stock, IBM (NYSE:IBM) tumbled by 2.84%, extending its weekly slide to over 8%. IBM's Friday woes were likely attributable to the China comments offered by the president. This recent pullback in the stock could give investors reasons to consider the name, particularly as IBM integrates Red Hat into the fold, which is widely viewed as a positive catalyst for the shares. Predictable VictimShares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) slid 2.52% today, meaning the stock is about 23% below its 52-week high. That's a bear market and then some. Semiconductor stocks have been at the epicenter of the trade spat with China because the U.S. is taking a hard line against U.S. technology companies working with controversial Chinese telecom firm Huawei Technologies.A slew of domestic chip makers have pressured the White House to allow them to do some business with Huawei, but these relationships are in a tenuous spot right now, so much that the Chinese company is taking steps to reduce its dependence on American technology. Surprising Refuge on the DowMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded lower today, but shares of the largest U.S. company by market value have been steady over the past week and there are inklings the stock is becoming something of a safe-haven for adventurous, though tariff-weary investors.Software companies like Microsoft are not 100% tariff-immune, but &quot;they may hold up better than some consumer technology names that manufacture products in China, according to Rishi Jaluria, senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson,&quot; according to CNBC. Bottom Line on the Dow TodayMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) was easily the best-performing name in the Dow today, gaining 1.43% on its way to a third consecutive record high. Shares of the burger giant have more than doubled in four years and with stock up about 25% this year, it's safe to say this is another fine avenue for skirting tariff controversy.McDonald's was one of the Dow stocks that closed higher today, but with President Trump again being aggressive on trade, broader benchmarks were surprisingly resilient to close the week.For now, Trump is backing off matching the Chinese with a currency devaluation that gets us back to a familiar place: relying on a Federal Reserve rate cuts to weaken the greenback. The Fed may have no choice to again oblige the president if the trade war heats up or doesn't cool off.Todd Shriber doesn't own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-13,"There's not a lot of mystery at the moment when it comes to railroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX). CSX news of late has been disappointing, thanks to a soft second-quarter earnings report. That report has pulled the CSX stock price down more than 10% -- and trade worries have kept the pressure on.Source: Shutterstock CSX unquestionably is a solid company -- and, at the moment, the premier railroad operator in North America. That alone creates a strong &quot;buy the dip&quot; argument with the CSX stock price now down 17% from its highs.But there are two key questions here. The first is whether even a 17% pullback is enough given factors outside of CSX's control. The second is whether the &quot;buy the dip&quot; case for CSX stock applies just as well to other, cheaper cyclical plays.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now From here, the answers to those questions are somewhat of a split decision. I'd wager the CSX stock price will start climbing again. But I'd bet, too, that other stocks -- maybe even some in the railroad industry -- will do better. CSX News Doesn't Change the Long-Term CaseShort-term weakness aside, CSX still has been a star performer. The CSX stock price has almost doubled since the 2016 United States presidential election. Even after the selloff, it has seen the biggest gains of the seven major railroad stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Railroads Index. The 132% increase dwarfs the 104% gains at second-place Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC).The company has been excellent at controlling expenses. Its 2018 operating ratio -- operating expenses divided by revenues -- was the lowest in that index, at 60.3%. The two Canadian operators, Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) and Canadian Pacific Railway (NYSE:CP), come in next -- at a full point higher.To top it off, after the disappointing CSX news, the stock now is the cheapest of the group. The forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at 14.5x, slightly lower than NSC. It's possible that multiple will rise -- some analysts may still lower 2020 earnings estimates -- but at the least, CSX is valued in line with the peers it's currently outperforming.Given all these positive factors, the selloff looks like an opportunity. And it's not as if the Q2 earnings report was truly that bad. The company did cut full-year revenue guidance, but it left itself room to outperform if second-half demand strengthens. Operating income still increased 2% year-over-year. This wasn't a disaster, but some investors seemed to treat it as such. The Concerns Going ForwardThe performance of CSX stock so far raises one key and seemingly counterintuitive concern. There simply may not be much room left for improvement.Again, CSX's operating ratio is a full point better than that of every other major railroad play. It's three points better than that of Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), and a full five ahead of Norfolk Southern. Is CSX that much better than the rest of its sector? Or is there more room for rivals to catch up -- and drive earnings growth in the process?That concern becomes more important amid the current cyclical fears. Operating expenses for railroads, like those of any business, can be leveraged by revenue growth. But CSX isn't seeing revenue growth coming in the second half of the year. The obvious worry is that declines may continue  if the macroeconomic environment in the U.S. weakens. CSX stock already has a headwind from coal shipments, which may not come back. Its CEO, on the Q2 conference call, called the macro picture &quot;puzzling.&quot;If the economy turns, revenue growth may head south for more than just a couple of quarters. And it may be CSX whose growth and share price lags, as rivals find more room to cut costs in the new environment. Is CSX Stock the Best Play?Those concerns are real. But at 14x-15x forward earnings, they look priced in. At this point, the declines do seem like they've gone too far.But, again, the other important question is whether CSX stock is the best play. And that's a tougher case to make. Cyclical stocks across the board generally have struggled since the beginning of last year, even though many have rallied somewhat so far this year. And many are downright cheap.Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), for instance, trades at 10x forward earnings. Many other stocks in industries like construction, boating and automobiles look even cheaper. The risks in those sectors are higher -- but so are the rewards. If an investor has the stomach to make a contrarian bet against the current macro worries, there are options that go beyond CSX and beyond railroads.So from here, the case for CSX stock looks solid but also a bit narrow. It's for investors who are willing to take on cyclical risk -- but only a little. Long-term, the selloff is an opportunity. But the same factors that drove the selloff could open up intriguing opportunities elsewhere.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-13,Dow component Caterpillar has bounced strongly in reaction to tariff delays after trading within six points of the 2018 low.,Tariff Delays Could Brighten Caterpillar's Outlook
2019-08-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.U.S. stocks rallied after the Trump administration said it will delay tariffs on some Chinese goods until December, while Treasuries fell after a pickup in inflation dented arguments for cutting interest rates. The S&P 500 Index spiked higher after trade officials named a broad swath of consumer goods that would be spared from tariffs at the current Sept. 1 deadline. Apple and Caterpillar surged more than 4%, while makers of computer hardware and chips pushed the Nasdaq 100 higher by 2%. Oil surged and the dollar strengthened.Earlier, stocks were under pressure after an unexpectedly hot inflation reading sent the two-year Treasury yield higher, narrowing its gap to the 10-year rate to the smallest since 2007 in what is commonly seen as a recession signal. Risk assets were also under pressure globally as turmoil in Hong Kong and Argentina persisted.Argentina’s peso fell almost 8% as its rout continued amid rising concern the nation will default on its debt. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index reversed losses sparked by disappointing investor sentiment data in Germany. Asia’s benchmark retreated the most in a week, with Hong Kong stocks the worst hit as anti-government protesters again crippled the airport. Japan’s Topix gauge erased this year’s gain. China’s 10-year bond yield touched 3% for the first time since 2016.The latest risk asset moves are adding to already skittish sentiment across markets during the low-volume month of August. With the U.S. and China offering no respite to their trade war and a slew of data pointing to slowing global growth, traders will look to this week’s euro-zone GDP figures and industrial production reports from both China and America for further clues to the outlook.“You’ve got the problem of the protectionist push leading to this downdraft in the economic data, leading to stretching the cycle,” said Ben Powell, chief Asia-Pacific strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute. “A combination of those two themes is creating quite an unusual and challenging macro investment environment that we all have to wrestle with.”Signs of the trade war’s impact are growing. Singapore’s government cut its forecast for economic growth this year to almost zero. In Europe, Henkel was among the worst-performing stocks after missing quarterly profit estimates, which the detergents maker blamed on the trade conflict and a competitive retail environment.Here are some key events coming up:Companies releasing results include China’s JD.com, Tencent and Alibaba; Cisco, Walmart and Nvidia of the U.S.; the U.K.’s Prudential; Australia’s Telstra; Europe’s Swisscom and brewer Carlsberg.Wednesday brings data on China retail sales, industrial production and the jobless rate.Thursday sees the release of U.S. jobless claims, industrial production and retail sales data.These are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index rose 1.4% as of 9:54 a.m. New York time.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index decreased 1.3%.The MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 1.3%.CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index advanced 0.1%.The euro was unchanged at $1.1214.The British pound was little changed at $1.2078.The Japanese yen was unchanged at 105.30 per dollar.BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries fell two basis points to 1.63%.The two-year rate rose to 1.6%.Germany’s 10-year yield dipped one basis point to -0.61%.Britain’s 10-year yield fell one basis point to 0.482%.Italy’s 10-year yield declined three basis points to 1.671%.CommoditiesGold advanced 0.8% to $1,522.91 an ounce.West Texas Intermediate crude sank 0.8% to $54.47 a barrel.Silver advanced 1.8% to $17.37 per ounce.&#92;--With assistance from Katherine Greifeld, Andreea Papuc and Todd White.To contact the reporter on this story: Jeremy Herron in New York at jherron8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net, Yakob PeterseilFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Stocks Rally on Tariff Delay, Treasuries Fall: Markets Wrap"

2019-08-16,"(Bloomberg) -- On Tuesday afternoon, as virtually all of Texas was facing the prospect of rolling blackouts and electricity prices skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, a small city on the southeastern edge of the state was so awash in power that it was basically giving the stuff away for free.Welcome to Victoria. Population: 63,000. This city, in the heart of the Lone Star State’s “Golden Crescent” region, isn’t known for much beyond plastics factories and chemical plants. A business roster of the local Chamber of Commerce boasts some big names including Formosa Plastics Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. It’s these industrial roots that may have saved it from one of the biggest power price spikes Texas has ever seen.Victoria’s giant industrial complexes are capable of making their own power with on-site generators. They’re handy resources when the state’s entire grid is running out of reserves and electricity is selling for $9,000 a megawatt-hour, more than anywhere else in America. While the rest of Texas was facing a shortage, these plants may have ramped up their own power generation, creating a supply glut in the city because of a lack of space on transmission lines.“Power plants around Victoria went full bore,” said Adam Jordan, an analyst at Genscape. The limits of the grid turned the area into a tiny island where -- as wild as it sounds -- electricity was selling for as low as negative $250 a megawatt-hour.Power grid operators call this phenomenon “congestion.” Indeed, when asked about extremely low prices there on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas said it “related to transmission congestion around the Victoria area.” At one point, a color-coded map of electricity prices on Ercot’s website was covered in bright red -- the shade for power trading at thousands of dollars a megawatt-hour. Victoria stood out as the lone cool-blue spot where electricity was below zero.The region may have been trying to cash in on soaring electricity prices by making their own power and feeding it onto the grid. But the ramp-up threatened to overload transmission lines that export power to big cities like Houston. The negative power prices signal to generators that they need to back off. “Ercot wanted power everywhere but there,” Jordan said.“These plants that self-serve are always looking to capture high prices when they can,” Josh Danial, a BloombergNEF analyst, said in an interview. The swings in power generation from these so-called private-use networks, he said, have actually sparked some controversy in the market as traders and power-plant operators can’t track their capacity, making it challenging to forecast prices.Victoria may have also turned into a power oasis on Tuesday as the region’s industrial giants idled some operations, said Adam Sinn, president of Aspire Commodities LLC. Big customers like them get paid to cut demand when electricity use is soaring, through programs known as demand response.“Either the plants shut off in demand response,” Sinn said, “or they shut off and started using their on-site private generation for the grid.”Caterpillar and Formosa didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.To contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Martin in New York at cmartin11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Pratish NarayananFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",One Small City Beat the Texas Heat That Sent Power Price Soaring
2019-08-16,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock price plunged more than 11% yesterday after forensic accountant Harry Markopolos issued a report accusing the conglomerate of massive accounting fraud and predicted that it could go bankrupt soon. GE stock price is climbing 6.5% today but remains about 20% below its July 24 levels.Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com Known for reporting Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme to the federal government years before Madoff was caught, Markopolos' has earned some credibility with The Street.Yet, for multiple reasons, including Markopolos' history and recent conduct, I'm very skeptical about his conclusions. For these reasons, I recommend that risk-tolerant investors buy General Electric stock on weakness.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Markopolos Can Make Money if the Street Believes His StoryAccording to CNBC, Markopolos said that a mid-sized, U.S.-based hedge fund had agreed to give him &quot;a decent percentage of profits&quot; that it would earn by betting on the decline of GE stock.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Let's say that the hedge fund bet $100 million against GE stock, and that it, using put options, made $50 million on the trade. Let's say that Markopolos' percentage was 20%. He would then of course earn $10 million on the deal. That's a pretty high sum for putting together a report and appearing on a few TV shows.And, if Markopolos' report had not been negative enough to push GE stock price down, it appears he would earn nothing on the deal. So, I'd say calling him pretty biased when it comes to GE stock would be a huge understatement.My confidence in the accountant isn't increased by his refusal to name the hedge fund that's paying him or the exact percentage of their profit he's getting. And in my opinion his statement that  his report was &quot;self-funded&quot; could make some people mistakenly believe that he has no profit motive in this case. As somebody who scathingly criticized GE for a lack of transparency, Markopolos' own lack of transparency is puzzling and disappointing. Markopolos' Past Prophecies Haven't Come TrueMarkopolos, of course, was spot on about Madoff, but his warnings about insurance companies haven't been nearly as prophetic. As CNBC noted, his case centers around GE's long-term care insurance unit.Interestingly, in an interview published by Business Insider in November 2016, Markopolos alleged that all sorts of fraud was rampant across the insurance sector.&quot;I have some large insurance fraud cases that I'm going to make public in 2017. And they're going to be in the tens of billions of dollars each. … Basically the insurance industry is where the banking industry was in 2007,&quot; he told Business Insider.  But over two years later, I can't find any references to insurance fraud exposed by Markopolos. Does anybody else hear a wolf? America Doesn't Crack Down Hard on Illegal Conduct by CompaniesIn his report, Markopolos compared GE to two of the very few large American companies that collapsed due to illegal conduct: Enron and WorldCom.But the reality is that the vast majority of large firms that violate the law do survive, and many thrive. For example, American International Group (NYSE:AIG), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were charged with committing fraud during the financial crisis. Toshiba (OTCMKTS:TOSBF) had its own accounting scandal in 2015. They all managed to survive and thrive since then. More recently, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has admitted to various fraudulent actions. Multiple hospital-chain owners have admitted to Medicare fraud. None of them have gone out of business, either. So even if GE did commit fraud or break laws, the chances of it disappearing are pretty low. Most of GE's Problems Involve a SubsidiaryAs CNBC pointed out, most of Markopolos' allegations of insolvency and lack of liquidity relate to GE's long-term insurance business. He identifies Employers Reassurance Corporation as the source of much of the debt he says GE owes.But ERAC is a subsidiary of GE, rather than part of the company itself. Interestingly, earlier this year, another GE subsidiary, sub-prime lender WMC Mortgage, went bankrupt. Although I'm not a legal or financial expert, I do think it's fair to wonder why GE cannot get rid of most of its debt stemming from ERAC by simply having the unit declare bankruptcy. Apparently, bankruptcies by insurers are not unheard of or illegal. Why Would Culp Join a Corrupt Company?General Electric CEO Larry Culp is in an altogether different situation than the CEOs of Enron and WorldCom were. In the latter two cases, the long-time heads of the companies were involved in fraud for years.Culp, by contrast, just joined GE at the end of last year. At that point, Markopolos alleges that GE had already started their fraudulent practices. By all accounts, Culp was tremendously respected for the turnaround he engineered while he was CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR).If Markopolos' accusations are true, Culp either did not examine GE's financial situation prior to taking the job, didn't understand its financial situation or knew that it was about to crash but, for some reason, didn't care about wrecking his sterling managerial reputation. None of those scenarios seems very likely. General Electric Stock's Fundamentals Are StrengtheningDespite the bears' insistence that GE stock is doomed and its fundamentals are collapsing, there are concrete signs that the company's fundamentals are improving or are poised to improve.The oracle of the GE stock bears, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa, reported that GE's second quarter was an operational miss and that the company's fundamentals had worsened.But, as I pointed out in a previous column, the gas power segment of GE's Power unit jumped 27% in the first half of the year, and the company's overall backlog jumped 11% year-over-year. Culp reported that GE Power would benefit from positive trends going forward, including strong demand for natural gas in Asia. Moreover, despite temporary problems, the company's Aviation unit received a record $55 billion of orders at the Paris Air Show in June.Meanwhile, Greentech reported earlier this month that U.S. wind energy development accelerated in the second quarter, which should boost GE's renewable energy unit. Additionally, New York and New Jersey are going all-in on offshore wind, which also bodes well for GE.Finally, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) reported that the orders of its power business surged 17% year-over-year. Woodward (NASDAQ:WWD), which sells parts to GE, said that its gas turbine business is improving. And Barclays analysts reported that U.S. power turbine orders jumped more than 12% year-over-year.Based on all of those numbers and fundamental catalysts, I really can't see how Tusa can state with confidence that GE's fundamentals are worse. I also am not very confident at all about Markopolos' charges, so I would recommend buying GE stock on weakness.As of this writing, Larry Ramer was long GE.

2019-08-16,"Despite more speculation that recession clouds are gathering, stocks cobbled together impressive gains to close another wild week. I mentioned earlier this week that some of the more important European economies, including Germany, are on the cusp of economic contractions and that are likely to spur the European Central Bank (ECB) into action.That was one catalyst for today's rally: talk that the ECB won't be sitting on the sidelines much longer and will attempt something with monetary policy aimed at perking up the region's sagging economies.Here in the U.S., it still seems like a stretch to say that a recession is imminent, but the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reading out today could be cause for concern for fans of President Donald Trump. That survey indicates independent and republican voters are growing concerned about the economy and could be apt to rein in spending. That data point was revealed just a day after the president spoke glowingly about the economy and the strength of the American consumer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Even with all the recession chatter, the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.67% while the S&P 500 climbed 1.44%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the week with a gain of 1.20%. Fun fact, at least for day traders or those that like volatility: the S&P 500 has had intraday moves of at least 1% for nearly three straight trading weeks. Tariff TalkThese days, it's almost possible to discuss stocks, particularly many of the Dow members, with talking about tariffs. Plenty of stocks are more tariff-sensitive than others, and JPMorgan was talking about a few of those names today.Remember that while President Trump backed off some of the tariffs on Chinese goods set to go into effect on Sept. 1, he did not back off all of those levies. And the ones not going into effect next month were not eliminated. Those were merely delayed until mid-December.As for companies likely to be affected by the Sept.1 tariffs, those names include Dow components Dow (NYSE:DOW) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Somehow, Dow, the chemicals maker, was the second-best performer in the Dow today while industrial machinery maker Caterpillar was a solid gainer as well, adding 0.97%.Regarding Dow members that could be pinched by the December tariffs, assuming those penalties go into effect, JPMorgan includes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) on that list. However, both stocks closed higher today.The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has been receiving elevated trade-related mentions, according to JPMorgan. Still, Home Depot is a heavily domestic company and the shares added 0.92% today ahead of next Tuesday's earnings report. Bad Bank Stocks on the DowEach of the Dow's financial services components, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank, closed higher today. I mention this because, yes, banks are being drilled by declining net interest margin expectations at the hands of lower interest rates, but also because recent price action in the sector confirms investors can be confounded by analyst chatter.Just last week, a Wells Fargo analyst said valuations on bank stocks are attractive, but today the same analyst said &quot;there is no way to sugar coat the negative impact of lower interest rates&quot; on banks' net interest margins and per share earnings.As I pointed out a couple of times during financial services earnings season, the net interest margin issued was raised on a slew of bank earnings calls and at this point, should be baked into these stocks. Dow Jones Bottom LineWith all the aforementioned recession chatter swirling, the good news is that the Federal Reserve will not take that talk lightly and it is becoming increasingly likely that there could be another two rate cuts before the end of this year.While that may be good news, the risk is that with rates already so low by historical standards, the effectiveness of more rate reductions may not be up to investors' current expectations. Time will tell on that front, but the near-term path of least resistance would be for trade wars to cease.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-25,"The US-China trade tensions have taken a turn for the worse in recent days. On Friday, China announced new tariffs on $75 billion worth of imported American goods, and a resumption of the 5% tariff on automotive parts. The new tariffs, to set between 5% and 10% and come into effect in steps on September 1 and December 15, include levies on electronics and machinery. President Trump responded in his customary fashion, by Tweet, saying in part, “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.” He added that the trade situation represents an opportunity for the US.Investors don’t seem to agree. Markets reacted to China’s and Trump’s announcements by plunging. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones averages fell 2.4% in Friday’s trading, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ slipped 3%. The losses were widespread, and not confined to any one sector of the market. Major companies with large exposure to the China trade were especially hard-hit. Here we take a look at three of those casualties. Apple, Inc. (AAPL)The world’s second largest publicly traded company lost 4.62% in the Friday market rout, falling over $9.80 per share. That Apple would prove particularly sensitive to shifts in the ‘trade war’ is no surprise; the Chinese market is Apple’s second largest, accounting for more than 18% of the company’s total revenues. The tit-for-tat tariff actions taken by the US and China have threatened the trade in electronics – and Apple’s supply chain. In response, the company is considering a drastic measure: the shift of 15% to 30% of its production from China to other areas of Southeast Asia. That Apple would consider such a drastic move underlines the risks of the trade war for the high-tech sector.Pointing out that nearly all of Apple’s flagship product line, the iPhone, is assembled in China, 4-star analyst Daniel Ives, from Wedbush, described Friday’s trade-war ramp-up as “a gut punch to Cupertino.” Even with that, however, Ives still sees Apple as a stock worth buying, and his $245 price target on AAPL shares suggest an upside of 20%.Despite the beating it took on Friday, AAPL retains its Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The stock has received 16 buys, 10 holds, and 1 sell in the past three months, with 6 of those buy ratings coming in just the last three weeks. Apple stock is trading for $202, and the average price target o $226 gives it an 11% upside potential. Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT)Caterpillar was hurting before this latest iteration of the trade conflict. The company is a major manufacturer and supplier of heavy construction and excavation equipment, with customers around the world. The general slowdown in the global economy has been eating into Cat’s sales, including in China, and the escalation in the tariff fight has made a difficult situation worse.The deterioration of Caterpillar’s position is made clear by the company’s losses in Friday’s trading: CAT stock fell 3.25%. The Friday losses come after CAT slipped more than 12% in August, following a 10.25% EPS reported for the second quarter.Cat hasn’t got an easy way out of its difficulties, either. According to 4-star analyst Jerry Revich, of Goldman Sachs, the construction industry is seeing rising inventories of trucks and construction machines; he predicts that there will have to be production cuts on the manufacturing end next year. In line with that, he gives CAT a Hold rating and a $130 price target.Stephens analyst Ashish Gupta agrees, saying, “For Caterpillar, excess dealer inventory means lower reported sales in coming quarters.” He goes on to add that, “The U.S. China trade war and Chinese impact on global commodity markets are reasons to avoid the stock right now. China accounts for a huge portion of global metals and energy consumption. A slowing Chinese economy has large ripple effects for the entire resource industry—a key consumer of Caterpillar products.” Ashish rates CAT as a Sell, with a low $100 price target.CAT is the lowest rated of the stocks in this list, with a Hold from the analyst consensus. The consensus rating is based on 7 buys, 5 holds, and 4 sells set in the past three months. The stocks’ share price of $114 and average price target of $136 still give it an upside potential of 19%. Deere & Company (DE)Like Caterpillar, Deere is a major manufacturer of heavy machinery; in this case, farm and agricultural equipment. And also like Caterpillar, Deere has been suffering as worldwide economic conditions have slowed down. And in a final similarity, Deere reported disappointing EPS in its most recent quarter, missing the forecast by 3.32%.China’s largest import from the US is agricultural products, especially soybeans. As the Chinese government cracks down on trade, with retaliatory measures, US farmers are watching their prospects for a profitable year go up in smoke. And that leads them to cut back on sales and maintenance of their heavy equipment, dealing a double punch to Deere in its domestic market. At the same time, the company is facing direct headwinds from the new Chinese tariffs. Deere stock lost 5.37% in Friday's market retreat. Rising factory production costs and bad weather, which would have been news stories in a normal year, have simply dealt additional blows to an already vulnerable company.At the same time, even with this perfect storm working against it, DE shares are getting upbeat reviews from Wall Street’s analysts. Writing from Credit Suisse, 4-star analyst Jamie Cook says of the quarterly report, “…expectations were sufficiently low heading into the print reflecting macro/trade war uncertainty, commodity prices and unfavorable weather which delayed planting,” and reiterates his belief that the company will beat the headwinds in the long run. He raises his price target on Deere to $197 (up 12%), suggesting an upside of 34%.From BMO Capital, Joel Tiss acknowledges slowing North American sales and a flat early-order program, but points out, “…the overall sales value was higher because of better take rates of innovative technologies and bigger machines.” Like Cook, Tiss gives Deere a Buy rating. His $175 implies a 19% upside potential.Deere is another stock with a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, this one based on 9 buys and 4 holds. The stock is selling for $147, has a $167 average price target, and an upside potential of 14%.Visit TipRanks’ Analysts’ Top Stocks tool, and find out which stocks are trending now Wall Street’s top market watchers.Disclosure: This author is long on AAPL.",3 Major Casualties of China’s New Tariffs

2019-08-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Is President Donald Trump serious about forcing American companies out of China? His advisers talk like it.The president would have the authority for such a move, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic director Larry Kudlow said in television interviews while their boss was at the G-7 – though there’s “nothing right now in the cards,” Kudlow added.Trump had suggested the policy in a series of Tweets capping a week marked by tussles with the Fed and China: “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.”There’s a difference, though, between what’s possible and what’s advisable – especially given the way the world economy seems to be teetering on the edge of a downturn. Ten-year Treasury yields fell to their lowest level since 2016 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped the most in nearly four months Monday as fears of a deeper trade conflict ramped up.The U.S. president has extraordinarily wide-ranging powers granted by the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. There are around 29 national emergencies ongoing under the terms of the law, which was originally intended to ensure such decision-making didn’t get perpetually stuck in Congress. The powers were last invoked in May when Trump threatened tariffs on Mexico if it didn’t stop flows of migrants.The question now is whether Trump would follow through or, as in the Mexican case, fold. The likelier result is the latter because, as with the U.S. banking sector in 2008, the investments of American businesses in China are too big to fail.The U.S. had a stock of $107.6 billion in foreign direct investment in China in 2017, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative – a figure that’s likely to be larger now in spite of trade tensions, since FDI stocks rarely fall outright. On top of that, it’s worth considering the $81.2 billion in FDI in Hong Kong and the $2.5 billion in Macau, given the risk that a crackdown by the Chinese government in Hong Kong threatens that territory’s special status – a prospect that’s already been raised by lawmakers and officials in Washington.What would sanctions on China look like? The act has mostly been used to freeze assets of targeted countries and prohibit U.S. businesses from transactions involving those countries; the tariffs proposed in May against Mexico were a relatively novel use of the powers. Either way, the stated intention would be to force American businesses to divest their assets in China, a sum that’s potentially as high as $191.3 billion.That’s an alarmingly large sum. The reduction in the value of U.S. commercial banking sector assets between their peak in December 2008 and their trough in March 2010 was only $801 billion, and that shift was enough to provoke a financial crisis from which the world is still recovering. Much smaller reductions can easily spark downturns: The decline in the value of U.S. commercial and industrial loans from their highest point before the 2001 recession to their low in 2004 was $231 billion, or around $310 billion in 2019 dollars.U.S. businesses forced to sell out of China almost certainly wouldn’t end up writing their assets down to zero – but in such a chaotic fire-sale, they’d be unlikely to get a good price. Beyond that, there would be a loss of revenue for businesses such as General Motors Co., Caterpillar Inc. and Boeing Co., which count China as one of their largest markets. That would compound the problem of servicing loans taken to acquire now-sold assets in the country.Of course, such a scenario is so dramatic as to be improbable. More likely, given the bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Washington, is a scenario where economic relations between China and the U.S. gradually dwindle over the years ahead.Even Trump probably wouldn’t follow through on a sudden stop and divestment, because the effects on the world’s already-shaky economy are simply too serious to contemplate. The idea of a forced withdrawal from China may be scary for U.S. businesses. In truth, it’s a paper tiger.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-08-29,"Earlier this week, stocks rallied on encouraging comments from President Donald Trump about trade talks with China. Of course, the rally was nice, but it was accompanied by doubts, confirmed by some Chinese media, that the president hadn't actually talked to anyone in China about cooling off the long-running tensions.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, that confirmation emerged today that two sides are indeed discussing trade and that helped stocks focus on something other than the second-quarter GDP revision, was pared down to growth of 2.1%. There was some good news in that GDP report that indicates the oft-discussed recession isn't as imminent as previously thought.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Second-quarter consumer spending surged 4.7%, above the 4.3% forecast in July, good for the best reading in five years. That coupled with the trade talks sent the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.48% while the S&P 500 gained 1.27%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average got in on the fun with a Thursday gain of 1.25%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 25 of the 30 Dow members were trading higher, indicating broad-based strength in the blue chip index today. Tech TalkAs always, it's good to see technology stocks lead a rally. That was the case today with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gaining 1.89%. Already one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow this year, Microsoft was boosted today by some positive analyst commentary with Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives reiterating an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the shares, citing strength in the Azure cloud business.&quot;We are bullish on MSFT over the next year given our thesis that Azure's cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out within the company's massive installed base,&quot; said Ives in a note.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another solid Dow technology performer today, adding 1.69% after the company announced a Sept. 10 event to reveal the latest iPhone.&quot;Apple typically puts new iPhones on sale within two weeks following their launch and rolls out the accompanying software update a few days after showing off the devices,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;The new iPhones will be key to Apple's holiday quarter.&quot; Careful With This BounceCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was the best-performing member of the Dow today with a gain of 2.69%, not a surprising move given this stock's level of tariff sensitivity. There are still some structural issues in the industrial sector and President Trump's willingness to rapidly reverse course on trade has previously punished cyclical names like Caterpillar.Another bounce I'd caution on is that of the financials, particularly on a day when Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), formerly though not currently a Dow component, was hit with a downgrade due to rising concern about net interest margins. That is not a scenario that's specific to BAC shares. Dow Jones Bottom LineI wanted to save this for tomorrow, the last trading day of the month, but I'll roll it out today. Historically, September is the worst month of the year for stocks with the S&P 500 averaging a September decline of 1.1% over the past two decades.However, a couple of Dow stocks are among the best S&P 500 performers in September over the past decade.

Once the reality that earnings growth wasn't living up to the lofty expectations finally settled in, shareholders bailed and bears ravaged the land.From peak-to-trough, ATVI stock dropped 53% before buyers finally stopped in to halt the massacre. With valuations reset and price-to-earnings ratios brought back from orbit, there's far less downside at this stage. The past nine months of consolidation has allowed the stock to stabilize and create a base to build its next uptrend on.This week's launch of World of Warcraft Classic reignited interest in ATVI, bringing it on the cusp of an upside breakout.

The fallout cratered BA stock and it remains miles from its all-time high. Thus far, Boeing shares have fallen as much as 28% from their February peak of $446.01.But, a close inspection of recent price action reveals some promising signs. Last week's rally was particularly impressive both in its magnitude and participation. The three-day pop carried BA stock over 11% higher before profit-taking struck.

So with that in mind, today's results were nothing to be concerned about.Source: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com In fact, the results for this Friday, the last trading day of August, weren't too shabby when considering there was a concerning consumer data point released earlier today. Regular readers know that I've been beating the consumer drum quite a bit recently and it is a story worth following for investors.&quot;The University of Michigan's final sentiment index fell to 89.8 in August from a previously reported 92.1 and 98.4 in July,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;The gauge of current conditions dropped to the lowest since October 2016, while the expectations index matched January as the weakest since that same period.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Even with that the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by 0.13% while the S&P 500 eked out a gain of 0.06%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day up 0.16%. In late trading, just over half of the Dow's 30 components were trading higher. Dow Winners With AsterisksToday's Dow Jones Industrial Average winners were not large in percentage terms, but two of the standouts merit caution and not just because they are defensive names. Plenty Dow stocks with defensive leanings have been solid performers for the bulk of this year, but UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) isn't a member of that group.The healthcare benefits giant gained 1.35% today, good for the best performance among Dow stocks, but the shares still finished August with a loss of more than 1.44%. The best-case scenario is that traders were doing some nibbling at UNH shares today in anticipation of a possible rally over the last four months of the year, but my prescription for caution here stems from a looming democratic debate in September, which could stir more Medicare For All talk. That's always a drag on UNH.Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) jumped 1.57% today, but this is another example of a dog Dow stock with fleas. Despite today's gain, this Dow stock also finished August with a loss of more than 7%.Two other Dow stocks that were winners today, each closing higher by about 1% that I'd be careful with are Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dow (NYSE:DOW). These are both tariff-sensitive names that notched double-digit declines this month. Maybe trade talks will progress, providing catalysts for these type of cyclical stocks, but in absence of those headlines, investors considering Dow stocks of this nature are likely making no more than technical bets over the near-term. Defensive DeparturesAs I noted above, there were some bounces in defensive Dow stocks today while some similar names saw departures. Namely, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) were two of the blue chip index's worst-performing names today, each shedding more than 1%.Speculation here, but today's action in those stocks may have been nothing more than some profit taking because McDonald's and P&G posted an average August gain of 3.66%. Given September's reputation for being a rough month for stocks, it would not be surprising to see those Dow stocks do a little better next month. Dow Bottom LineWith all the talk about trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates, investors should not take their eyes off the earnings ball. Unfortunately, the news isn't so hot to this point in the the third quarter.&quot;During the first two months of the third quarter, analysts lowered earnings estimates for companies in the S&P 500 for the quarter,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;The Q3 bottom-up EPS estimate (which is an aggregation of the median EPS estimates of all the companies in the index for the third quarter) dropped by 3.0% (to $41.64 from $42.90) during this period.&quot;On another note, investors looking for sector-level ideas for September may want to consider financial services and utilities, which on a historical basis, are the best-performing groups in the ninth month of the year.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- An army of drones deployed to fight a crop-devouring pest in a southern area of China has recorded a mortality rate of as high as 98%, according to the manufacturer.XAG, a Guangzhou-based drone maker, teamed up with Germany’s Bayer Crop Science in a drone swarm operation to kill the fall armyworm in China’s Guangxi region. The autonomous devices, loaded with low-toxicity insecticide, have also successfully managed the pests in a government-led operation in the southwest province of Yunnan, XAG said.“It is the ‘crop-devouring monster’ that attacks over 80 crop varieties,” XAG said in a statement Monday. Most farmers resort to traditional insecticide sprayers, which not only fail to move fast enough against the “ravenous, fast-moving fall armyworm” that can fly up to 100 kilometers in one night, but also expose them to dangerous chemicals, it said.This Is the Caterpillar That’s Coming for Your Lunch: QuickTakeThe fall army worm, a crop-devouring pest, has spread from the Americas to Africa and Asia, gorging on rice, corn, vegetables, cotton and more. Since arriving in China, it has advanced north, affecting 950,000 hectares of crops in 24 provinces as of mid-August, including parts of Hebei, Shaanxi and Shandong, according to an official report published late last month.

2019-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. A key U.S. factory gauge unexpectedly contracted for the first time since 2016, sending stocks and bond yields lower and boosting expectations for interest-rate cuts as global manufacturing woes deepen.The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August, weaker than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, data released Tuesday showed. Figures below 50 indicate the manufacturing economy is generally shrinking. The group’s gauge of new orders dropped to a more than seven-year low, while the production index hit the lowest since late 2015.The data add to concern a broader U.S. recession is coming and may complicate the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, whose pledges to revive manufacturing have been a signature issue. At the same time, Trump’s escalating tariffs on imports from China have been a major reason behind factory weakness that threatens to spread to consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the world’s largest economy.In the U.S. stock market, the ISM numbers torpedoed a morning rebound and left the S&P 500 poised for its worst loss in seven sessions, down as much as 1.2% to erase almost half of last week’s rally. The 10-year Treasury yield and the dollar fell.Traders of fed funds futures boosted the amount of easing they expect from the U.S. central bank this year, following a July 31 quarter-point cut that was the first since 2008. For the next Fed decision on Sept. 18, investors increased bets on a half-point reduction but continued to lean toward a quarter-point cut.“This piece of data is part of the puzzle that helps to push us into recession,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc. “The ramifications of the trade war show up in the euro zone, in Asia and now in the U.S. If the deterioration in the U.S. continues, it’s going to feed into the overall labor market.”What Bloomberg’s Economists Say“To be sure, economic anxiety related to tariffs and increasing trade tensions is extracting a significant toll on business confidence. However, there was limited direct evidence of tariffs creating upward price pressures or materials shortages in the details of the report. As such, the second-order impacts from the tariffs (i.e. confidence effects and currency appreciation) appear to be having the more substantial impact.”-- Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economistAlthough manufacturing only makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, there are concerns that entrenched weakness -- and any layoffs that may result -- could filter through to the rest of the economy and endanger the record-long expansion.Transportation equipment was one of seven industries in the ISM report to report shrinking business activity last month. Automakers, which report their August sales on Wednesday, account for some of the slowdown. General Motors Co. has ceased production this year at a car plant in Ohio and transmission factory in Michigan, two of the four U.S. sites that it has said aren’t being allocated future product. Other automakers are reducing production shifts, including Nissan Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co.Weakness in the automotive and electronics markets is also impacting 3M Co.’s bottom line. Sales and profit at the diversified manufacturer fell in the second quarter even as earnings topped expectations. At Caterpillar Inc., a slowdown in crude extraction from the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil patch, is reducing demand for machinery. What’s more, the equipment maker’s worldwide machine sales in June and July were up 4%, the slowest in two years.Manufacturing is technically already in a recession in the U.S. with a Fed measure of output declining in two consecutive quarters. The malaise is consistent with developments in the sector around the world. By one measure, global factory activity has contracted for four straight months.The ISM’s measure of new orders, which are tracked by some as a leading indicator of a downturn, declined to 47.2. It was the first time since December 2015 that the gauge fell below 50. ISM’s production gauge also sank below that mark, to 49.5 in August from 50.8.The slump in demand and output spilled over into the labor market as the ISM’s gauge of factory employment fell to 47.4, the lowest level since March 2016. That suggests this Friday’s employment report will show weakness in August manufacturing payrolls, which were surprisingly solid the previous two months.“It confirms that the weakness that we’ve been seeing for a number of months now on the global front and on the tariff front is really washing up to the U.S. shores,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “What’s important here is that it’s not just the current conditions that have deteriorated quite sharply but also the forward-looking components.”A measure of export orders, a proxy of overseas demand, sank to 43.3, the lowest reading since April 2009 during the depths of the last recession.A separate factory PMI from IHS Markit came in at 50.3 on Tuesday, showing manufacturing was barely expanding. Economists and investors tend to more closely follow the ISM report, which dates to 1931.The “shock effect” of the latest ISM report “adds to recession fears, and the components were also pretty weak,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, in an interview. “This does confirm that we’re not bottoming out yet in manufacturing in this country, and that’s significant.”(Adds companies in eighth and ninth paragraphs)&#92;--With assistance from Chris Middleton, Elena Popina, Vildana Hajric and David Welch.To contact the reporter on this story: Reade Pickert in Washington at epickert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Scott Lanman at slanman@bloomberg.net, Vince GolleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Manufacturing Gauge Contracts for First Time in Three Years
2019-09-03,"Just because headlines are terrorizing Wall Street of late, it doesn't mean that investors should be crippled by them. Even amidst this geopolitical whirlwind of uncertainties, there are stocks to buy now. Today we focus on three mega-caps that are proven winners but deserve more attention from investors now. These are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT).Since the short-term price action in the S&P 500 is still in flux and since there is the possibility of another dip near term, we will consider both sides of the argument for GOOGL, AAPL and CAT stock. But for now, my thesis is still bullish so I expect a resumption to new highs once the headlines abate.This is not the same as saying that I expect the politicians to resolve the conflicts. We can make new highs even while the economic push-pull is ongoing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is a short week on Wall Street due to Labor day, but it won't be short of excitement. In addition to the Hong Kong standoff and the new tariffs hitting this weekend, investors have to contend with headlines from the release of many important reports. Mid-week the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book. These are their reports from the economic front lines in each region. Then on Friday, the government will release its official non-farm payroll for the month.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now These are important events because they are line items that the Fed uses to determine their next move on rates. So in effect, the direction in the stock market will depend heavily on this week's progression of headlines. Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOGL)Simply stated, GOOGL stock is trading in a tight range, so a move is coming. The idea is to chase the breaches of either sides of the lines.For the long term, Alphabet stock's fundamentals are solid. Short of a big, sustainable equity market crash, or severe negative change in its operations, GOOGL stock is headed higher for years to come. Meanwhile, there are short-term technical signals to watch.GOOGL stock spiked 10% on earnings but faded back down into the $1,160 per share neckline. Since then, it has consolidated well inside a $60 range, and therein lies the opportunity.Usually when a stock ping-pongs inside a tight box, it resolves itself with a big move once it breaks out of it. In this case, the GOOGL stock traders have not yet committed to the direction of said move. So the best trade setup is to wait for the actual breach of either side of the range and chase it in that direction.So this is a tactical trade on GOOGL stock. If the bulls break above $1,211 per share, then they can rally $30 then another $40 from there. Keep in mind that this is the entire span of the GOOGL stock 7% dip on April earnings.I prefer betting on upside then shorting, But the opposite is also true. So conversely, if the bears are able to push GOOGL stock below $1,150 per share, they could target $1,080 per share. Incidentally, there is a gap there from early July. Also there is likely to be some support around $1119.Although these are tactical trade setups, those interested in owning Alphabet stock for the longer-term can use the upside scenario for timing. Or, I wait for the dip to happen then add the bullish fundamental position in it. Apple (AAPL)AAPL stock is also technically trading in a tight range so here too we should anticipate a move soon. While I am optimistic that it is still in great shape to break through the recent highs, there is also risk below.Last week, AAPL announced an event on Sept. 10. The stock often fades after the fact, so onus is on the bulls to prove that this time it's different. Otherwise, AAPL stock is vulnerable to a 7% correction with some supports at $201 and $198. But if $192.50 fails then Apple could fall another $11 from there.While the Apple fundamentals are not as strong as they used to be, the company still has many more years of prosperity. Currently there is a blemish on that from it being in the direct line of fire in this economic war between the US and China. But eventually it trades on its own merits.The Apple stock price-to-earnings ratio sells at a discount to its peers. Furthermore, management is finally making tangible headway in diversifying their income statement from the iPhone. &quot;Apple services&quot; is the buzzword for the next decade, so AAPL is still a stock to buy for the long term.Just like GOOGL, the short-term AAPL stock trade is binary and stuck inside a range. The bullish setup is to buy Apple stock when it breaks through $212 -- or better yet, $214.50 per share. Those should be triggers to invite more momentum buyers. There are resistance zones above but with a little bit of headline luck the buyers could pierce through them.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off It is also important that if the bulls sustain the buying through $210. Otherwise it would trigger some technical selling that could develop into a nasty multi-leg correction to test the March and May lows. Caterpillar (CAT)Coming into the Labor Day weekend, CAT stock had a great three day bounce off $112 per share. But it is best to wait for confirmation that it can continue its uptrend especially into a binary week like this. So the better setup is to chase CAT stock above $120 or better yet $122 per share for a $10 rally potential.Caterpillar stock is way too cheap, but that alone is not reason enough to chase it. For many reasons, the bulls have failed to sustain rallies causing many fake-out losses. It is enticing because it sells at only an 11 price-to-earnings ratio and it yields 3.5% in dividends. So those who own the CAT stock are indeed suffering from the price action. But they are at least getting some reward from a yield that is twice that of 10-year bonds.The threats to CAT stock stem first from the overall fears that we are headed into a global recession and second from the threat to Caterpillar from the economic war rhetoric. In the past year we've seen this affect the stock price negatively several times.The company is still executing well on plans, but the stock is still acting like death. Even though fundamentally the company looks good, short-term it is best to watch for technical pitfalls.First is that the $120 zone is resistance. This is a long-term pivot area and the bulls recently lost it. So onus is on them to prove that they can recover it. It won't be easy since the CAT stock bears are likely emboldened by the price action.The pattern that developed since the October correction of 2018 resembles a big bearish head and shoulders. If that's the case, then CAT stock has about $20 more to fall. But the bears will have to work for it. Because they would have to slice through a thick layer of support.The bulls have the bounce levels from the December 2018 and August of this year correction bottoms in Caterpillar stock. This is also the 50% retracement from the 2-year long and 200% rally of 2016. Those who believe in Fibonacci will tell you that the 50% retracement is reliable support.More to that, this is also a monthly pivot zone that dates back to 2011. Clearly the bulls and bears like to fight it out there so this creates congestion.Those who are long CAT stock here should know that there is a real threat that if $110 fails. It could lose $25 per share from there. Incidentally, this measured target is also the five year point-of-control. But conversely, any resolution on the tariff front could launch a roaring rally to $133 per share.So of the three stocks today, this is the one that needs a miracle headline the most to get it out of its current funk. So depending on the investor's time frames, traders should use stops. If the goal is to trade CAT stock, then you shouldn't turn it into an investment. Losing $116.34 could fill the gap and overshoot to Aug. 28 lows. Below $112 per share, there's plenty of room the fall.Even though the fundamentals for GOOGL, AAPL and CAT stocks suggest that these are stocks to buy, the short-term price action is tactical due to extraneous reasons.But in the end, I expect that the fear of trade wars and recessions to abate.  So I am inclined to trade the upside scenarios either by chasing the breakouts, or buying the measured targets from the short term dips this week. Tactically, there is something for both bulls and bears to trade in all three stocks here.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-09-03,"September has a dubious reputation among the 12 months when it comes to equity market performance. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has averaged a September decline of 1.1%, making the ninth month of the year the worst one for domestic stocks.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com Of course, seasonal trends don't always hold true to past precedent, giving investors hope that this September will defy past trends. Tuesday's market action suggests otherwise.Following another concerning economic data point and just two days after the U.S. proceeded with a 15% tariff on $112 billion worth of Chinese imports, the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.11% while the S&P 500 dipped 0.69%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started September with a loss of 1.08%. In late trading, 23 of the Dow's 30 members were trading lower.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income &quot;The Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August, weaker than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, data released Tuesday showed,&quot; according to Bloomberg.That report was certainly one of the reasons why stocks swooned in the first trading of the month because ISM readings below 50 are viewed as poor. Unfortunately, ominous economic data points have recently been accumulating, fueling the fires of recession speculation. Cyclical CarnageOn a day like today, it's not surprising to see higher beta stocks from cyclical sectors lead the market lower. That's exactly what happened on the Dow. Even if I categorize Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) as value, not cyclical stocks, because they reside in a value sector, both lost more than 2% today and where joined in that dubious club by the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dow (NYSE:DOW).More market observers are extolling the virtues of defensive names while highlighting potential vulnerabilities in growth and cyclical stocks.Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson noted, &quot;the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist, sees defensive bond proxies outperform growth names by another 10% as the U.S.-China trade war weighs on consumer sentiment, which adds to a long list of recessionary indicators that are already flashing red,&quot; reports CNBC. Dow Smart MovesWalmart (NYSE:WMT) was one of a small number of Dow winners today. The retail giant posted a modest gain after CEO Doug McMillon said the company is moving to substantially reduce its sales of firearms ammunition following a spate of deadly shootings across the U.S. this year.&quot;After selling through our current inventory commitments, we will discontinue sales of short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber that, while commonly used in some hunting rifles, can also be used in large capacity clips on military-style weapons,&quot; said McMillon in a memo to Walmart staffers.He added that Walmart &quot;will sell through and discontinue handgun ammunition; and we will discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, marking our complete exit from handguns.&quot; Tech TimeNot surprisingly, Dow technology names were weak today, including Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). That stock was bludgeoned in August and is now in world of technical distress.Separately, semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also traded lower, but company insiders remain committed to the shares. While the recent round of buys by Intel executives were scheduled, it pays to remember that insiders only buy their shares for one reason: because they believe the stock is going higher. Bottom Line: An Ominous Start to the Dow This MonthThis was not the way to start September, which I noted has a poor reputation at best. Rising volatility coupled with increasingly rough economic data puts added burdens on the White House to ameliorate the trade situation with China and for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but only one of those outcomes can be seen as &quot;reliable.&quot;And not to be discouraging, but here are some more tidbits on the potential for September trouble:&quot;The Dow Jones Industrial Average has averaged a loss of 0.75% in September over the past 30 years, CNBC analysis using Kensho shows,&quot; reports CNBC. &quot;In fact, the 30-stock average trades positive just 47% of the time in September. The S&P 500 does not fare much better either. In September, the broad index loses an average of 0.47% and trades positive just 52% of the time. The Nasdaq Composite averages a marginal gain in September.&quot;Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"It feels like markets have been inching toward this point for some time. The point I'm referring to is some constructive commentary regarding trade between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com News hit the wires last night that representatives of the two  nations will meet in Washington, D.C. next month to discuss trade issues. The news sent markets soaring today. Importantly, the S&P 500 broke past some stiff resistance today, encouraging some technical analysts to opine that this rally might have some legs to it. That would be extraordinary, considering September's dubious reputation.Adding to stocks' gains today was a bullish private payroll survey from ADP, which showed the addition of 195,000 private sector jobs in August, easily topping the 148,000 new jobs economists, on average, had expected. The Department of Labor reveals its August jobs number tomorrow before the bell, with economists on average expecting the addition of 160,000 new jobs, with unemployment holding steady at 3.7% and wages growing 3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Today, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.75% while the S&P 500 climbed 1.31% to put the technically significant 3,100 level back in play. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.41%. In late trading, 27 of the Dow's 30 components were higher. Winners GaloreStoked by the trade news, tariff-sensitive Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was one of the Dow's best-performing names today, gaining more than 3%.Shares of Caterpillar &quot;headed for the biggest gain since April as trade tensions eased, improving the sales outlook for the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment,&quot; according to Bloomberg.Caterpillar's Thursday move wasn't surprising, but it was a pleasant surprise to see International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) keeping pace with Caterpillar for top honors in the Dow today.IBM, a good way for conservative investors to get some tech exposure, is on a torrid pace of late, up nearly 4% this week. With today's surge, the stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average. IBM stock could reach $150 to $155 in the near-term.Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) jumped more than 1% following some bullish analyst chatter. Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr likes United Technologies stock and recommends buying the name right here, right now.&quot;Investors seem fixated on the [Raytheon] merger but under-appreciate major cyclical turns at Otis [and] Pratt, [United Tech's] recession resistance, and likely [second-half earnings] beats,&quot; von Rumohr said in a Wednesday research report. &quot;With [the] separation [and] merger on track, transactional overhang should abate, offering upside to our $150 [price target].&quot;Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), a name I highlighted yesterday, also gained more than 1% today on news that the largest U.S. oil company is selling its Norwegian oil and gas assets for $4 billion. The move should help the company bolster its cash flow. Exxon's cash position is one reason some analysts remain enthusiastic about the stock. Odds And EndsWith investors flocking to riskier assets today, bond yields soared (finally), helping each of the Dow's financial services components trade noticeably higher on the day. That included Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).Underscoring banks' sensitivity to low interest rates, shares of Goldman jumped more than 2% despite noted bank analyst Dick Bove of Odeon Capital cutting his rating on the investment bank to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy.&quot; The analyst noted that GS' trimming some high level executives &quot;suggests an unhealthy level of turmoil.&quot;The Dow offenders today were defensive names Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). All fell by modest percentages. Bottom LineInvestors got significant help today on the trade front. Tomorrow is a new today and one that brings comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. If the jobs number is strong and the trade talks appear viable, investors hoping for more rate cuts may want to pin those hopes on 25, not 50, basis points. As it is, some market observers believe global central banks are close to running out of tools.&quot;The U.S. is not quite there yet, but we will see as soon as next month how much closer the ECB gets to monetary debasement (we think they're still some ways away, as they haven't fully exhausted their negative interest rate path, it seems),&quot; said BlackRock. &quot;Ironically, the beggar-thy-neighbor implications of competitive devaluations will almost certainly incite a response from countries who may not originally even have needed to resort to currency debasement in the first place, raising the potential for full blown currency war.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Technology names got pinched today, but Monday's performances by the broader benchmarks were not too bad, nor where they impressive.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Monday was a lethargic day, reminiscent of many during the summer months, but the S&P 500 entered the day just 1.80% below its all-time high and growth sectors, such as consumer discretionary and technology, were about 2% removed from records, so it wasn't surprising to see modest dips today.When all was said and done, the Nasdaq Composite was lower by 0.19% while the S&P 500 settled down by just 0.01%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the standout of the day, gaining 0.14%. In late trading, 17, or just over half the Dow's 30 members, were trading higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy This week, barring any unexpected Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) activity from President Donald Trump, should be relatively quiet on the domestic headline front, but there are global considerations. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) publishes its monthly demand forecasts on Wednesday, news that could move Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), two names that have recently steadied.On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to reveal a rate cut, a move that could spark moribund European stocks and provide a lift to other riskier assets. Dow Dogs Have Their Day AgainWith ebullience for the Dow last week, some of the blue chip index's laggard names notched some nice gains. That group included trade-sensitive Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Importantly, there was follow-through as the industrial machinery maker added 3.74%, making it one of the best-performing Dow members to start the week.Slack global manufacturing data is a legitimate concern for shares of Caterpillar, but some analysts argue that investors have gotten too gloomy on the stock and that it may be pricing in more downside than is realistic.Caterpillar &quot;could face another 1 to 2 quarters of negative [earnings per share] revisions due to dealer destocking in construction and weakness in upstream oil and gas,&quot; said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ross Gilardi in a note out today. &quot;We advise investors to look through it because global [industrial indexes] are already below 50, central banks are stimulating, and the U.S. service economy (i.e. the consumer) is still humming.&quot;At the end of the resurgent dog spectrum is defensive name Walgreen Boost Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which has easily been one of the Dow's worst-performing components this year. Today, it was one of the best Dow stocks, posting a jaw-dropping (by its standards) gain of 5.76% on seemingly no news other than a recent decision by the company to tell shoppers to not enter its stores with firearms.There was some chatter out today that the recent bankruptcy of smaller rival Fred's could be beneficial to Walgreens, but a gain of this magnitude today seems to overshoot that news. Tech CheckTech was roughed up a bit today, but one day of weakness does not diminish the case for the largest sector in the S&P 500. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the tech names trading lower today. Over the weekend, Evercore ISI raised its price target on the stocks to $160 from $150, sparking some unusual (and bullish) option activity in the name today.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded modestly higher ahead of its Tuesday product reveal, which is expected to include some iPhone enhancements, though not of the stock moving variety. Yes, iPhone 11 will be impactful for Apple stock at some point, but for those watching tomorrow's event, the real near-term catalyst could be updates on Apple + streaming and other entertainment-related efforts. Dow Jones Bottom LineAs I noted above, this week should be light on headline risk, emphasis on &quot;should be.&quot; Ebbing uncertainty could set the stage for more gains for stocks, albeit in incremental fashion, but there are other benefits to removing the overhang of doubt from investors' minds.&quot;Eventually, erratic policy and heightened uncertainty undermine confidence in a way that affects the real economy,&quot; notes BlackRock. &quot;This could happen in a number of ways: a safe-haven bid that drives up the dollar and credit spreads and/or a sharp decline in business confidence that begins to impact spending and hiring plans. Should either start to occur, the risk is no longer just investor mood swings but a more pernicious slowdown and market correction. In the absence of those developments, while easy money cannot eliminate uncertainty it can mitigate the effects.&quot;Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-10,"I've said it before, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a flawed index due to its price-weighting mechanisms, the index still has plenty of value for investors. After all, the index does represent some of America's largest and finest companies. Thanks to their large moats, strong cash flows and big dividends, Dow Jones stocks really are the bluest of the blue-chips and make great portfolio additions.However, the various shades of blue do vary.Thanks to the recent market hiccups, rising global tensions, the trade war and overall economic malaise, not all the Dow Stocks would be considered champions at this point. And in fact, a few of them downright stink. Misreads on trends coupled with the current global economic problems have made several stocks in the blue-chip index chronically underperform in recent weeks and in fact, years for some. That puts them firmly in the &quot;don't buy camp.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September But how can you tell which Dow Jones stocks are big buys and which are downright sells? Luckily, here at InvestorPlace, we've done the leg work for you. Here are three of the Dow's biggest stocks to avoid. Dow Jones Stocks to Sell: 3M (MMM)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 26%The reason to buy industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) stems from the fact the firm is so global in its revenues. A huge portion of its sales come from overseas. That has driven the stock's cash flows and profits in recent years. The reason to sell 3M is also that it's so global in its sales.As the trade war has dragged on, 3M has been hit hard by the overall slowing global economy. A prime example was its last earnings report. Despite a hefty share buyback program, earnings-per-share for this Dow Jones stock slipped over 37% year-over-year, while net revenues declined 2.6%. The vast bulk of the slippage in sales continues to be from Asia, Europe other emerging markets. These are the regions that drove sales in previous quarters. Moreover, the strong dollar and local currency fluctuations continue to hit 3M hard.This is a big deal going forward. With no end to the trade war in sight and major international economies -- such as Germany -- slowing way down/contracting, 3M could be between a rock and hard place. During its last conference call, the industrial stock warned things could get rough. Management is now guiding to earn $8.75 per share on the high-end -- a dip of 3.1% from its last EPS estimate.While 3M isn't in any danger of cutting its dividend and ending its long streak of payout increases, the continued dip in EPS could spell trouble for its pace of dividend jumps. And with a PEG ratio of nearly 2 and forward P/E of 18, MMM stock isn't exactly a bargain.With many of the catalysts for ownership now deteriorating and the stock relatively expensive, this is one of the Dow Jones stocks to avoid for the time being. IBM (IBM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 12%There are plenty of old school tech stocks that have pivoted correctly in the new paradigm. Dotcom leaders like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have successfully changed their operations to better compete in the cloud and across many new trends in tech. And their investors have been rewarded.Then there's IBM (NYSE:IBM).Big Blue should be a leader. Unfortunately, IBM has managed to make plenty of missteps over the last decade. Missing key trends like the rise of cloud computing has continued to hurt the firm's bottom line. Revenues last quarter marked the fourth-straight quarterly revenue decline for the tech dinosaur. Based on full-year estimates for 2019, IBM will have seen its sales drop by nearly 19% over the last five years. That's just terrible.So, it's no wonder why IBM decided to buy out Red Hat to inject some growth into the firm for $34 billion. And there is potential for growth. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel recently mentioned that the Dow Jones stock could be a major contender in open-source software and in the cloud. However, based on its estimates, IBM says Red Hat won't boost earnings until 2021 at the earliest. And given how lousy IBM has been at integrating acquisitions in recent history, the potential may not be realized.What's worse is that Big Blue recently suspended its lucrative buyback program to pay for the deal. Those buybacks have actually managed to reduce its share count by roughly 25% over the last few years.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now In the end, there's a lot of risk for IBM and not much safety net anymore. Red Hat will take a ton of time to integrate and in the meantime, investors are getting nothing but declining sales while waiting. There's better tech stocks out there and this is one of the Dow Jones stocks to avoid. Caterpillar (CAT)Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 25%It's easy to pick on Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) based on the trade war and continued lower demand from China. After all, China's massive expansion and infrastructure upgrades have long been a huge driver for construction equipment. So, with China slowing, CAT is in some hot water.The issue for the heavy-machinery firm is that it's not just woes from China that are hurting its bottom line. It turns out, construction spending across the board is starting to wobble in a big way. Both Cummins (NYSE:CMI) and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) both recently warned that CAPEX spending is dropping in the U.S. as well. That CAPEX spending is also coming to the metals and mining industry as well as the sectors. The same could be said for agricultural and forester equipment. Overall demand for powerful diesel engines and other heavy machines is now dropping as the trade war has trickled on.This is a huge problem for CAT. Sales in the U.S. as well as key segments -- like energy -- have helped keep the profit engine growing and they have also helped it overcome many of the woes from China/Asia in general. But with many of these markets now seeing contraction and spending dwindle, CAT could be hit hard. And in fact, management is now predicting EPS come in at the lower end of their estimated guidance. If things continue to turn poor and the recession finally hits, the Dow Jones stock could be in a world of hurt.Now, CAT still pulls in a ton of cash flows and has seen rising sales. This has translated into a big 20% dividend boost and improved buyback program. But now that sales and cash flow growth have been muted in the new tariff-filled environment, that robust pace of dividend/buyback growth could slow if things start to really hit the fan.And for investors, that could make CAT a stock to place on their watchlist for now.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"Stocks traded higher again Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average positioned for a seventh consecutive winning day as the European Central Bank (ECB) delved further into easy monetary, and amid news that trade tensions between the U.S. and China continue to thaw.Source: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com Given President Donald Trump's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) volatility, it's wise to approach good trade news with some caution, but over the course of this week, some green shoots have emerged.The White House pledge to push back some proposed tariffs on Chinese goods while China is promising to rollback some levies on U.S. imports in conjunction with upping purchases of American farm products.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday, reports emerged that the White House has discussed offering some form of a limited trade pact to China. Whether or not that agreement is accepted remains to be seen, but the overarching issue is that both sides, at least for now, are showing willingness to work on trade deals.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now In Europe, the ECB cut its benchmark lending rate to -0.5% and pledged to buy $22 billion worth of euro-denominated bonds per month.Those headlines got us to the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.30% today while the S&P 500 jumped 0.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 0.17%. In late trading, 23 of the 30 Dow stocks, one of the better ratios this week, were trading higher. First, the Bad NewsYes, there were some glum performances among Dow stocks today. For example, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) slipped about 1% after Wells Fargo downgraded the construction machinery maker to &quot;market perform&quot; from &quot;outperform.&quot; The bank also pared its price target on that Dow stock to $143 from $150.&quot;U.S. construction equipment demand is at or near peak, which will put downward pressure on earnings power,&quot; said Wells Fargo.On a technical basis, Caterpillar recently bumped into some overhead resistance and looking at the chart, the shares look primed to pull back over the near-term.Speaking of analyst chatter hurting Dow stocks, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was the worst-performing Dow stock today, sliding over 4% after Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill initiated coverage of the stock with a &quot;sell&quot; rating.Hill had a tepid take on Dow stock UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), starting coverage of that laggard with a &quot;hold&quot; rating. Shares of UNH also finished lower today. Bright Spots on the DowVisa (NYSE:V) was the best-performing Dow stock today, adding 1.71%. It looks like buyers stepped into the name after the shares pulled back following a record close last Friday. The stock had been nearly 4% over the past several days.Shares of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) added nearly 1% after the largest U.S. retailer unveiled an expansion to its grocery delivering service. Priced at $98 annually, or $82 less per year than the fee on Amazon Fresh.Whether its streaming entertainment or food delivery, pricing power matters. Companies that can offer it without disrupting the long case for their stocks usually get a boost from investors. Walmart plans to expand the new grocery delivery service to 200 metro areas across the country.Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) bounced back today as some of the concerns about Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) streaming effort ebbed.Disney has its own streaming plans, Disney +, and Credit Suisse says that if that offering can attract 10 million subscribers by the end of this year, that could bring double-digit upside for the stock. DJIA Bottom LineCentral banks around the world are acting to prop up economies that are in far worse shape than the U.S., and it's likely the Federal Reserve will follow suit to avoid having to act when it's too late.In comments made in Chicago today, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen affirmed that the Fed stands at the ready to shore up the world's largest economy, which she still views as solid. However, she doesn't believe the central bank will follow the ECB playbook of negative rates.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"The S&P 500 is closing in on a record high as optimism returns to the Street. Over the past week, we've seen improving price action and accelerating strength beneath the surface. Sector rotation is afoot, and I've spotted three stocks to buy that should continue to benefit from the shift.A glance at recent sector performance reveals several themes. Small-caps are sizzling, banks are booming and energy is rising from the abyss. Industrials also saw massive inflows. Each area boasts many compelling charts, and today's selections look well-positioned to profit.Some say that sector rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market. The power of laggards leading while leaders lag (or otherwise take a breather) has been on full display this week.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy Let's take a closer look at three ways to capitalize on its continuation. 3 Sector Rotation Stocks to Buy: JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: ThinkorSwim The awakening of the banking industry is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the small-cap-laden Russell 2000 Index has awoken. But it's actually one of the largest banks that has me licking my chops. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is topping off the third week of a robust rally that ushered its shares to the upper end of its two-year trading range.And that means a breakout could be imminent. JPM stock has a history of delivering strong followthrough after weekly breakouts. And with the fourth quarter fast approaching as well as bullish undertones returning to the Street, JP Morgan should keep delivering.Buy the Dec $120/$125 bull call spread for around $1.90. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: ThinkorSwim Energy stocks have been laid low over the past six months, but this week finally saw big buyers enter the fray. The last three days have seen accumulation days in the Energy Sector ETF (NYSERCA:XLE). Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is rising alongside XLE, and though its intermediate- and long-term trends still point lower, the sharpness of this week's ascent suggests more upside is in the offing.I particularly like how this morning's weakness was quickly bought up, confirming that buyers still lurk beneath the surface.Exxon's low implied volatility rank makes long premium plays compelling. Instead of going aggressive with a bull call spread purchase, I like using bull call diagonals instead. They only require a mildly bullish move and set us up to profit from time decay.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now Buy the Jan $67.50 call and sell the Nov $75 call for a net debit of $4.95. Boeing (BA)Source: ThinkorSwim Ever since bottoming in mid-August, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been booming. The recovery reached a fever pitch yesterday with a high-volume 3.6% pop that jammed BA stock to a four-month high. We're seeing some well-deserved profit-taking this morning, but with the short-term trend now pointing higher, I suspect the weakness will prove a buying opportunity.Be aware that major resistance looms heavy at $383, so Boeing needs to clear that level before the party can really begin. But its angle of attack and the strength seen over the past month gives BA the best chance it's had in months to turn its intermediate-trend back up.Buy the Jan $380/$400 bull call spread for around $8.50. Your risk is $8.50, and the potential reward is $11.50.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't have positions on any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-13,"America's nearly two-year-old trade war with China, as well as salvos with Europe and Mexico, has battered a wide swath of stocks. President Donald Trump's tariffs (and retaliatory duties) have weighed on companies in various forms, such as higher input costs and unsold inventory.The pinch is being felt on a wide scale. Global growth was already slowing, though market analysts and foreign leaders alike think the trade war is making things worse. Here at home, manufacturing is thinning, reflecting waning demand. ISM's purchasing managers' index reading for August was just 49.1. Anything under 50 signals a contraction in activity, meaning August was the first month in three years that American manufacturing receded.The result has been a pullback in numerous stocks. Buying these tariff-assisted dips is risky because some of the companies face headwinds outside of trade uncertainty. But a resolution between the U.S. and China would bring much-needed relief to many companies, and perhaps a bounceback in their shares. You can see the potential every time the market rallies on the smallest of optimistic hints.&quot;(These) value stocks will deliver attractive returns after the tariff resolution, like a coiled spring that pops up,&quot; says Michael Underhill, chief investment officer of Capital Innovations in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. He thinks the market could continue to move higher heading into October's negotiations. If more concrete progress is made, a sustained rally will continue, he says.Here, then, are 14 stocks that have already felt the burn from President Donald Trump's tariffs (and retaliatory taxes). Some represent potential should Washington reel in its tariff threats, but they may continue to suffer any time trade tensions reignite. And a few are trying to pivot their businesses out of harm's way. SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the Most",14 Stocks Already Hurt by President Donald Trump's Tariffs

2019-09-17,"Nearly as rapidly as oil prices spiked Monday, they violently retreated Tuesday amid talk that Saudi Arabia will be able to restore production from weekend drone strikes faster than was previously expected.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Oil stood in the way of market upside yesterday and the commodity's Tuesday tumble did not provide much in the way of relief, indicating that many market participants are taking a wait-and-see approach to what comes out of the Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip Even before the rate cut news, the Fed was making headlines today, stepping into the repo market by buying $53.2 billion in securities to ease a sudden spike in short-term interest rates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;The turmoil in the repo market caused a key benchmark for policy makers -- known as the effective fed funds rate -- to jump to 2.25%, an increase that, if left unchecked, could have started impacting broader borrowing costs in the economy,&quot; according to Bloomberg.Regarding the Fed's plans for interest rates, it appears likely that a rate cut of 25 basis points will be unveiled tomorrow, but after that, the central bank could be on pause for the rest of this year.With that in mind, traders pushed the Nasdaq Composite higher by 0.40% while the S&P 500 rose by 0.26%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.13%. In late trading, just 12 of the Dow's components were pointed higher and just four of those names were up 1% or more. Trade TalkWhat was surprising about the logy performances notched by stocks today was that President Donald Trump made some encouraging comments about the potential for a trade deal with China. Perhaps it was the broad time frame that the president gave that kept stocks from rallying. Aboard Air Force One heading to California, Trump told members of the media that a trade deal could happen soon or around the time of the 2020 election.That broad timeline wasn't enough to really jolt tariff-sensitive Dow stocks higher. For example, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) were sporting negligible gains in late trading, and most of the rest of the day's Dow winners were either defensive stocks or companies that are not heavily dependent on China as a source of revenue.Speaking of China, there was some good news on that front for at least one Dow component today. Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the blue chip index's leader, gaining about 1%, after the aerospace giant boosted its China demand forecast.The company said it expects China to purchase 8,090 passenger jets through 2038, up from a prior forecast of 7,690 planes through 2037. Those new orders will also be a boon to Boeing's services business, which is becoming an important driver of top- and bottom-line growth for the firm. Dow OffendersUnfortunately, Tuesday's Dow offenders is larger than we'd like to see. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) can be excused due to the aforementioned drop in oil prices.Home Depot (NYSE:HD) lost about half a percent after Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes cut his rating on the home improvement retailer to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy.&quot; Forbes said the company's current investment initiatives could pay off over the long run, but over short-term, those spending plans could crimp margins.&quot;Bottom line, we find it difficult to see a path to earnings before interest and taxes margin expansion in 2020 as both a) investment spending and b) the associated D&A drag are poised to ramp,&quot; said the analyst.In what is likely a case of profit taking after major run high, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) traded lower today after entering the day with a gain of more than 15% over the past month. The machinery maker has been highlighted as one of the names that could benefit from higher oil prices, so that factor was at play to the downside. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodayToday's market action wasn't all that surprising when considering the backdrop riskier assets are contending with. The pullback in oil prices could be a positive because there's always a sweet spot for oil companies and consumers. High gas prices could pinch consumer spending, something that would be a detriment to the broad economy, so today's oil retreat is, in a broader context, a positive.The Fed probably obliges with a rate cut tomorrow, but the devil will be in the details regarding how many more times this year the central bank will ease. If the tone isn't to investors' liking, riskier assets could be roiled.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc. fell to a one-month low on concern that slowing economies and flagging demand from builders and other customers will weigh on earnings at the bellwether industrial company.Analysts at William Blair & Co. cut their 2019 and 2020 estimates for Caterpillar, citing a “plummeting” North American construction-equipment market, cyclical peaks in end markets and the trade war. Meanwhile, Keybanc Capital Markets said there’s now a higher risk of industrial companies’ third-quarter results missing expectations, driven by uncertainty around global trade and further deterioration of broader macro data.The outlook reflects growing economic gloom as a slowdown in manufacturing and simmering trade tensions undercut growth prospects. Morgan Stanley said a survey of U.S. construction-equipment dealers showed a jump in the number reporting elevated inventory levels, as well as those expecting a collapse in pricing.“As a bellwether, the company typically sets the tone for the season, which is unlikely to be positive,” Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair, said in a note to clients. “Given new data that has come in and healthy skepticism to begin with, we reduced our estimates for the remainder of 2019 and for 2020 as the North American market weakened and further production cuts are probably necessary to align to retail demand.”William Blair now expects 2019 earnings per share of $11.25, which is below the $11.76 a share average of 28 analysts’ estimate compiled by Bloomberg.Caterpillar, which reports its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 23, dropped 1.9% to $117.97 a share in New York on Tuesday, the lowest closing price since Sept. 3.&#92;--With assistance from Esha Dey.To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe Richter, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Sags as Global Gloom Weighs on Bellwether Industrial

2019-10-23,"Caterpillar Inc.  executives may be uncertain about the economic environment, but they seem to be very certain that it's a good time to repurchase the stock. Chief Executive Jim Umpleby and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield used a form of the word uncertain regarding the economic outlook or business environment a combined six times on the post-earnings conference call with analysts. Bonfield said that uncertainty is why they are not providing sales guidance for 2020, but it's not reason enough to slow share repurchase activity. The company bought back $1.2 billion worth of its stock during the third-quarter, after buying back about $2.15 billion worth of its stock during the first half of the year, according to recent filings. Umpleby said he continues to expect second-half repurchases to be similar to the first half, meaning he expects about $951 million worth of shares to be repurchased during the October-December quarter. Caterpillar's stock rallied 1.2% in afternoon trading, despite missing profit and revenue expectations, after being down as much as 2.2% earlier in the session.

2019-10-23,"U.S. stocks closed higher Wednesday, with the major indexes managing to shake off weakness from corporate quarterly results from the country's biggest names. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed up 45 points, or 0.2%, at 26,834, buoyed by gains in Merck & Co.  and Apple Inc. , which finished at a fresh record high, helping the index to overcome declines in components Nike Inc.  and Home Depot .

2019-10-23,"Accounting for the nasty post-earnings tumble in shares of semiconductor maker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), things could have been much worse for stocks on the Dow Jones today than the final tallies showed.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Semiconductor stocks are widely considered to be tech bellwethers, so when one of those names struggles in fashion to comparable to Texas Instruments today, it would be reasonable to expect the broader tech sector to follow suit. And with technology being the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, it can be difficult for broader benchmarks to ward off weakness in that sector.The point is that Wednesday wasn't a great day for stocks, but it could have been worse. And this is clearer when you examine some of the action among members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn what could have been a more eventful Wednesday, a late session rally lifted the Nasdaq Composite by 0.19% while the S&P 500 added by 0.28%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.17%, half of the index's 30 holdings higher in late trading. Bizarre ReactionsIn what can be deemed unexpected surprises, shares of both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) traded higher despite troubling third-quarter earnings reports. Regarding Boeing, plenty of bad news has been available for investors to consume, so the earnings update probably wasn't all that surprising.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With 100% Upside Potential Boeing said it spent $2.4 billion in the third quarter, with much of those costs attributable to trying to the get the 737 MAX jet airborne again before the end of this year. Management did say that's possible, perhaps explaining the modest move higher in Boeing stock today. However, with all the controversy surrounding the 737 MAX, the plane is unlikely to be as profitable for Boeing as previously thought.&quot;The MAX won't be as profitable as Boeing initially envisioned,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;The company is adding $872 million to cost assumptions--spread over a block of 3,100 planes. That's almost $300,000 per plane. A 'block' is an accounting unit aerospace companies use to amortize development cost over.&quot;Give Caterpillar some love. The industrial machinery gained 1.2% today on more than double the average daily volume even after the company lowered its full-year profit forecast, citing weakness in the global economy.News that Caterpillar is cutting production in the face of slack demand appears to be the catalyst behind the stock's decent Wednesday move. As some analysts noted, Caterpillar has a history of being slow to trim production, opting to build inventory into slack markets, but management appears to be taking a different approach this year and it's being cheered by Wall Street. CEO Shift Cripples NikeSometimes, it takes the investment community time to warm to CEO changes. Nike (NYSE:NKE) investors are hoping that's the case because that Dow component was smacked today on news that John Donahoe will replace Mark Parker at the helm of the athletic footwear giant.Analysts noted that Donahoe could prove to be a winning choice for Nike, since it looks to cement its digital/online footprints -- industries the new CEO has experience in. As such, some of today's reaction in NKE stock is likely more about the loss of Parker than it is a slight on Donahoe.  * 10 Hot Pot Stocks to Buy  Another Day At The OfficeIt was another day of gains and flirtations for shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is now up about 10% over the past month. Morgan Stanley boosted its price target on Apple stock to $289, now the highest on the Street. That upward revision comes just days after Raymond James boosted its Apple target to $280. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThursday has the potential to be eventful because today, after the close, Dow component Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) report third-quarter results. And on Thursday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reports after the close, so there is plenty of opportunity over the next 24 hours for markets to comment on animal spirits and the near-term outlook for growth and momentum stocks.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-23,"(Bloomberg) -- A bellwether of the global industrial economy may be sending out distress signals.Caterpillar Inc. is heading for a “mild earnings recession,” according to Morgan Stanley, and analysts expect the heavy-equipment maker to post its first year-over-year decline in quarterly profit since 2016 when it reports results on Wednesday.Margins are shrinking as demand cools and the U.S.-China trade war fuels caution among customers. Machine sales have slipped in Asia and the U.S. on weaker orders in construction industries, just as the Deerfield, Illinois-based company has been trying to raise prices. That helps explain why analysts have pared the earnings outlook five times since August.The following charts show why Caterpillar’s earnings report could bring more bad news for the world economy.Machinery MeterIn June, worldwide machinery sales for Caterpillar grew at the slowest pace in more than two years on a 3-month rolling, year-over-year basis. The company posted the same increase in July and August. The sluggishness is largely due to a slowdown in North America, its largest market, and declining market share in China. Sales in North America expanded at the weakest rate in almost two years in August, and in Asia contracted the most since 2016.Last week, the International Monetary Fund made a fifth straight cut to its 2019 global growth forecast, citing a broad deceleration across the world’s largest economies as trade tensions undermine the expansion. The forecast for this year would be the weakest since 2009, when the world economy shrank.Lots on Dealer LotsWith concern over the sales outlook, the amount of equipment available on sellers’ lots has been in the spotlight all year. The company said in July that dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $500 million in the three months through June, compared with an increase of about $100 million in the same period a year earlier. It’s been counting on dealers working through the buildup to help meet 2019 profit targets. But analysts at William Blair & Co., who pared their earnings forecast on Oct. 7, said dealer inventories are instead rising and more production cuts may be needed.Caterpillar isn’t alone. Manufacturers of durable goods in the U.S. had enough inventory to last 1.69 months in August, the longest since November 2016, according to the Census Bureau.Stock FiguresConcern over the economic outlook and its impact on demand is showing up in analysts’ share-price targets. The rolling 12-month forecast for Caterpillar’s stock is down about 18% from the same time a year ago. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trimmed its 2019-2021 earnings per share estimates by 4% on average. The bank said it expects earnings before interest and taxes to decline year-over-year in 2020, driven by “meaningful production cuts in North America and China construction equipment, while mining demand remains tepid given widespread macro uncertainty.”The stock-price outlook could get help from a resolution in the trade war and further cuts in interest rates among central banks, Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair, said in his report earlier this month. But the uncertainty going into a U.S. election year, generally weaker industrial economy, and cyclical construction equipment markets should ultimately override those potential positives, limiting upside, he said.Softening the BlowTo be sure, there are bright spots for Caterpillar. Earnings are still forecast to reach a record this year, and much of the bad news may already be reflected in the share price. The stock has risen about 5% in 2019, trailing the 15% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also, mining-equipment demand has held up, and should help soften the blow from a slowdown in construction, according to Karen Ubelhart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.“Mining equipment should lead segment growth, yet is only 15-20% of sales and earnings,” Ubelhart said in a note last week. When Caterpillar reports earnings, “commentary on China will remain a focus, as will significant deceleration in North American construction equipment demand. ”&#92;--With assistance from Vince Golle.To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe Richter, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar’s ‘Earnings Recession’ Points to More Bad News for World Economy

2019-10-23,Warnings from chip maker Texas Instruments and mining equipment giant Caterpillar weighed on U.S. stock futures on Wednesday,U.S. Stock Are Set to Drop After Earnings Warnings From Caterpillar and Texas Instruments
2019-10-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Caterpillar Inc.’s results show how worry itself can bring on a recession. The industrial bellwether reported its first quarterly earnings decline in nearly three years on Wednesday and cut its full-year profit guidance. It had warned in July that earnings per share were likely to come in at the low end of its previous range, but that was based on an expectation for modest sales growth that seemed overly optimistic. Instead, third-quarter revenue declined in all of Caterpillar’s major business units, including the mining-equipment division that had been a rare bright spot this year amid weakness in its construction machinery operations. The slowdown in shale production as producers prioritize shareholder returns and cost control continued to weigh on sales of fracking pumps. But more than a reflection on any one of those particular markets, this was a macroeconomic story, and a poor one at that. Caterpillar blamed its slumping sales and earnings on customers holding off on equipment purchases. With the trade war, Brexit and increased signs of manufacturing malaise, no one wants to get stuck with a glut of expensive machinery that they can’t sell. So inventories shrank by about $400 million in the third quarter as dealers sold off stockpiles of equipment, rather than replenishing them. Industrial companies ranging from CSX Corp. to United Parcel Service Inc. have offered similar warnings about the extent to which uncertainty is weighing on their businesses, even as parts of the economy remain relatively healthy. This adds to evidence that a trade war resolution may still be able to pull the manufacturing sector back from the brink. Achieving that is, of course, easier said than done.  For now, you’d be hard-pressed to find much news worth celebrating in Caterpillar’s release. The order backlog continued to shrink. Sales for the construction business in Asia declined a whopping 29%, suggesting the competitive pricing that’s eroding Caterpillar’s market share in the area hasn’t abated. At least in the short term, Caterpillar isn’t counting on a turnaround: It expects dealers to continue to wind down their inventory in the fourth quarter amid “global economic uncertainty” and flat demand from the end users of its equipment. In its news release, Caterpillar raised the prospect of curbing production and reducing costs if the weakness persists, which likely indicates job cuts. Such cutbacks, while necessary to respond to declining demand, may only lead to more economic weakness. As has been common this industrial earnings season, investors seemed content to take their hits and keep on chugging along, hoping the worst will soon be behind them. After dipping as much as 7.7% on the 6:30 a.m. earnings release, Caterpillar was actually up slightly by 8 a.m. But such broad-based weakness at Caterpillar should be a reminder that all is not well in the global economy.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The Dow (DJIA) was most recently trading 70 points, or 0.3%, lower, as shares of 3M (MMM) and Cisco (CSCO) are contributing to the index&apos;s intraday decline.","Dow drops 70 points on losses for 3M, Cisco shares"
2019-10-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Another earnings report, another guidance cut. What else did you expect from 3M Co.?The $93 billion maker of Post-it notes and industrial adhesives  lowered its earnings and revenue forecast for 2019, with Chief Executive Officer Michael Roman on Thursday citing a “challenging” macroeconomic environment. Roman has been in his role since July 2018, and he’s had to cut the company’s outlook in some way during every quarter of his tenure but one. The exception was this year’s second quarter, when 3M maintained its forecast for 2019 sales to grow as much as 2%, absent the impact of currency swings and M&A. That depended on a stabilization in China and automotive markets; unsurprisingly, that didn’t materialize, and Thursday’s deep guidance reduction shows the company would have been wise to be more cautious. 3M now expects sales to at best decline 1% for the full year. That will be its worst showing since 2009.The series of guidance cuts under Roman has been sloppy and, at times, illogical. His initial 2019 forecast called for organic sales growth of as much as 4%, even as economic data pointed to a cooling in manufacturing demand. It’s telling that 3M shares initially fell only about 1% on this latest earnings miss. No one really believed Roman when he said in July that 3M’s guidance was still realistic. That lack of credibility should be troubling for the company.But the fact is, there’s a lot to be concerned about in this latest disappointment, both for 3M and for the broader economy, and the stock slumped 5% as investors dug into the numbers more closely. The guidance cut reflects in part a 15-cent per-share negative impact from 3M’s $6.7 billion takeover of wound-care company Acelity Inc., which closed earlier this month. But even when you back that out, the magnitude of the outlook reduction is severe. 3M anticipates fourth-quarter organic sales may decline as much as 3%, a sharp shift from a 1.3% slide in the third quarter that was already worse than analysts had expected. Looking at the U.S. as a region, organic sales declined 1.1% in the three months ended in September, compared with a 0.1% gain in the second quarter. In Asia, sales slumped 4.4% on the same basis in the third quarter. It doesn’t take long for 3M’s products to go from the factory to the end customer, so it’s on the front lines of any economic weakness. Thursday’s earnings report offers troubling fresh evidence that the current manufacturing slowdown is accelerating and deepening.  This follows the first quarterly earnings decline in nearly three years at another industrial bellwether, Caterpillar Inc., on Wednesday, though its commitment to cut production and other costs to adjust to the weaker demand environment helped offset investors’ concerns about its  downbeat profit and sales outlook. Also on Thursday, toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker Inc. cut its full-year earnings guidance below even the lowest analyst estimate and announced a new $200 million cost-cutting plan. That’s on top of a “margin resiliency” program focused on using digital technologies to improve profitability by $300 million to $500 million by 2022.3M lacks the same kind of promise of margin protection. Because of the Acelity deal, 3M has reduced its planned share repurchases for 2019. Meanwhile, its acquisition of artificial-intelligence platform M*Modal for $1 billion earlier this year and other growth investments are pressuring margins in the health-care division. 3M announced a $225 million to $250 million restructuring plan in April, but it’s still grappling with inventory pullbacks in its more industrial-facing units as nervous customers worry about the sustainability of demand. Economic weakness plays a role here, but there are also signs of operational foot faults. Adding another earnings disappointment to CEO Roman’s resume won’t help 3M fix the perception that its days as a safe bet are over, and not soon to return.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

That's not necessarily bad nor is it good. It is what is and it means that over the past several days, investors have been taking cues from factors beyond quarterly earnings updates.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com China is part of that because trade negotiations remain ongoing, but the good news is that the country appears poised to buy a massive $20 billion worth of goods from American farmers.&quot;Investors also watched the latest developments in the ongoing trade dispute.

For those looking for more gauges of risk appetite, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and two Dow components report earnings after the bell today.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up For today, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.82%, while the S&P 500 added 0.21%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the offender among the major U.S. benchmarks, sliding 0.09% with fewer than a third of its 30 components higher in late trading. Egregious OffenderOffenders were easy to spot today, but one that stands out for all the wrong reasons, obviously, is 3M (NYSE:MMM). Mentions of 3M in this space this year have been mostly negative simply because the industrial conglomerate's price action has done little to suggest anything positive.That trend continued today as shares of 3M lost 3.82%, extending its year-to-date loss to nearly 12% while cementing the stock's status as one of the worst-performing members of the Dow. 3M's 2019 outlook led to today's decline.The company forecast 2019 adjusted earnings of $9.09 a share, below the prior estimate of $9.25 and well below the $9.31 a share Wall Street was expecting. In third quarter, 3M sales of $8 billion missed estimates of $8.17 billion and it appears as though per share earnings of $2.72 only topped estimates due to a one-time gain.3M is the latest industrial member of the Dow to issue cautious if not depressing guidance. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) did the same yesterday, but the stock rose. However, Caterpillar shares traded lower today, indicating investors are concerned about the slowing global economy and its impact on that stock. Watch the ThroneInvestors looking for better news among Dow components today should look at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which jumped almost 2% following another stellar earnings report.&quot;For the quarter, the software giant reported revenue of $33.1 billion, up 14% from the comparable year-ago quarter and ahead of the Wall Street analyst consensus forecast of $32.23 billion,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Profits were $1.38 a share, up 24% from a year ago and ahead of the consensus at $1.24 a share.&quot;Azure, the company's cloud computing business, continues growing at rapid rate, notching revenue growth of 59% in the most recently completed quarter. On A Related Note…Perhaps in sympathy with the Microsoft rally or because they are the two Dow components reporting earnings this afternoon, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Visa (NYSE:V) were two of the other Dow leaders today.Following the bloodbath that was the quarterly update from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) earlier this week, the semiconductor industry could sure some good earnings vibes from Intel, one of the group's largest constituents.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Analysts are expecting Intel to report earnings of $1.23 per share and $18.05 billion of revenue. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayEarnings are always important, but these reports are taking on added significance against the backdrop of slowing global. Unfortunately, the likes of 3M and Caterpillar are confirming, not bucking the sluggish growth outlook and that's something to be aware of into year end and heading into 2020.&quot;The IMF's October World Economic Outlook shows world GDP growth slowing from 3.6% in 2018 to 3.0% in 2019 and 3.4% in 2020, lowered from July's interim projections,&quot; according to FactSet Research. &quot;A 3.0% growth rate would be the slowest global growth since the 2008-2009 global economic slowdown. According to the IMF, risks to the global growth outlook skew to the downside as trade barriers and heightened geopolitical tensions disrupt global supply chains and hamper confidence, investment, and growth.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered higher by 0.57%. Give the Nasdaq some credit. Today's gains were built without much from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which was beaten up after its third-quarter earnings report. Or maybe Amazon itself deserves some credit because it closed the day at $1,761, well above the day lows around $1,695. Tech SupportOn Thursday, I mentioned the importance of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report in terms of propping up the semiconductor space in the wake of the disaster that was Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) earlier this week.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up Intel delivered in epic fashion, surging almost 8% to easily rank as the Dow's best-performing member today. The semiconductor giant posted third-quarter earnings of $1.42 per share on revenue of $19.2 billion. Those numbers absolutely crushed what Wall Street was expecting, which was $1.24 per share on $18.1 billion. Dogs BounceTwo of this year's most frequently mentioned Dow dogs, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), were the next best performers in the blue chip index today after Intel. Certainly in the case of Caterpillar, these were probably China news-driven trades. Both companies reported earnings earlier this week and neither report was particularly strong, so today's bounces in these embattled names may be no more than trades, not opportunities to be long these stocks for lengthy time frames. Post-Earnings MalaiseVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) reported decent third-quarter results earlier today, but investors weren't overly enthusiastic about the numbers as the stock was one of the Dow losers on the day.Verizon said it earned $1.25 per share on revenue of $32.9 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.24 a share on revenue of $32.7 billion. Making matters interesting in terms of Verizon's price action today was subscriber growth that beat estimates. In theory, the stock should have been up on that news.&quot;The company's consumer unit added a net 193,000 new wireless postpaid lines and its business segment added a net 408,000,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;That leaves a total of 601,000 new customers who receive a monthly bill, a closely watched metric for wireless companies. Wall Street analysts had been expect 524,000 new postpaid wireless subscribers.&quot; Another Surprise LoserDow high-fly act Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was one of the index's offenders today, which is surprising given the tenor of a Morgan Stanley note out earlier today on the stock.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian said &quot;P&G is likely to be able to increase its revenues faster than its peers even if it raises prices only modestly, given its broad-based strength,&quot; according to Barron's.He reiterated an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $134 price target on the Dow component.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayNext week brings another raft earnings reports, including some big-name technology stocks and some members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With that in mind, this earnings season has been decent relative to earlier expectations.&quot;To date, 40% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q3 2019.

2019-10-31,"Stocks were roiled Thursday by the return of headline risk, which was compounded by the variety of that risk -- it was both domestic and foreign in nature.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Starting in the latter category, China appears intent on adding another chapter to the long-running trade saga with the U.S. Today, the world's second-largest economy sounded cool on the idea of the two sides reaching a more comprehensive trade accord. Beijing appears steadfast in the view that no more concessions will be made until the U.S. budges on hot button issues.&quot;Chinese policy makers are gathered in Beijing for a key political meeting that's set to conclude on Thursday,&quot; reports Bloomberg, citing sources close to the talks. &quot;In meetings ahead of that plenum some officials have relayed low expectations that future negotiations could result in anything meaningful -- unless the U.S. is willing to roll back more of the tariffs. In some cases, they've urged American visitors to carry that very message back to Washington, the people said.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere in the U.S., in what President Donald Trump is calling the biggest witch hunt in our country's history, the House of Representatives voted, mostly along party lines, 232-196 to proceed with impeachment of the 45th U.S. president. Assuming this effort makes it out of the Democrat-controlled House, it will almost certainly die in the Republican controlled Senate.Still, Mr. Market isn't a high school government class expert, but he is an expert in gauging uncertainty. Uncertainty is undesirable in financial markets, but that's exactly what the impeachment proceedings are creating.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November So that gets us to the Nasdaq Composite falling by 0.14% while the S&P 500 retreated by 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.52% with just five of its 30 holdings in late trading, one of the worst ratios seen in weeks. Thank Goodness for AppleInvestors cringing at the thought of how bad things could have been today for the Dow if not Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are right to feel that way. Apple, the third-largest member of the price-weighted Dow, gained 2.26% today and was easily the best performer among the thinly populated club of Dow gainers.Thursday's bullishness in Apple came after the company reported a blowout set of fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close Wednesday. Apple notched earnings of $3.13 on revenue of $64.04 billion while Wall Street was expecting earnings of $2.84 on revenue of $62.99 billion. Declines in iPhone sales moderated and there was solid growth in other areas of the company's businesses.&quot;The company posted 18% growth in services, nearly 17% growth in iPad sales and 54% growth in wearables, driven in particular by AirPod sales,&quot; according to Barron's. On A Related Note…Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), a soon-to-be competitor of Apple's in the streaming entertainment war, was one of the other Dow winners today, albeit in modest fashion. Disney reports earnings for the quarter on Nov. 7, with analysts expecting EPS of 95 cents on revenue of $19.03 billion.News that Disney's European Riviera Resort project is set to be operational by mid-December was viewed as one of the reasons for the stock's small gain today. Sour CyclicalsIt was a rough day for cyclical stocks, such as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM). That pair have endured plenty of rough days this year, but news that the US/China trade issue is, well, still an issue, pressured Caterpillar today. Both of those stocks fell more than 2% today.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and China's PMI, data points released earlier today, were seen as bad and that was enough to weigh on cyclical names.The likes of Caterpillar and 3M could be tested again Friday with the October jobs report and the Institute for Supply Management's October survey due out before the bell. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayNovember starts on Friday, and let's hope history holds true to form because the eleventh month of the year is usually kind to equities. Over the past 20 years, the Dow has averaged November gains of 1.6%, the third-best month of the year for the blue-chip index, while closing higher in the month 70% of the time.Interestingly, industrials are one of the best-performing sectors on a historical basis in November. The aforementioned weakness in 3M and Caterpillar could test that thesis this year.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-01,"October was a great month for the broader averages in more than one way. But as it is a market made up of stocks, November is ushering in three new opportunities for stocks to buy in companies whose shares have done the necessary technical work for a new bull market to appear.Stocks are prone to corrections, and October has historically been a solid calendar month for the broader averages to take a technical respite. But in 2019 as the S&P 500 finished up 2.21% at new all-time-highs, that tendency barely saw the light of day. On the other hand, has that price action made the market too risky for stocks to buy? Not a chance.Despite Wall Street lore, a rising tide hasn't lifted all boats. The fact is, bullish headline feats by the broader market are often linked to a handful of mega-cap stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And that's great news for today's investors looking for opportunities in a market made up of stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November As we enter November I have three fresh stocks to buy. These are just now shaping up for bullish runs after large corrections and are putting together superior long-term bottoms. Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is the first of our stocks to buy. You might think the machinery giant is an odd choice given the U.S.-China trade war and the company's recent all-around earnings disappointment. The company didn't do itself any favors in delivering a profit and sales miss, as well as below-view guidance. And based on that evidence you'd be correct to turn your back on CAT stock, but do so at your own risk.It's important to recognize that stocks often make long-term bottoms when the headline news is still awful-sounding. Bottom-line, this serves the purpose of keeping investors from buying a stock as a meaningful low is established. And given the circumstances, CAT stock looks like a prime candidate of this phenomenon.Technically, shares of Caterpillar have moved from a tenuous bearish correction and into a fully-formed double bottom pattern on the monthly chart. With the formation finding support off the 50% Fibonacci level and stochastics having bullishly crossed over out of oversold territory, CAT is setting up as a stock to buy.CAT Stock Strategy: My recommendation is to buy CAT stock above the April pattern mid-pivot and year-to-date high of $142.54. I'd advise partial profit-taking on a challenge of Caterpillar's all-time-high and a trailing stop-loss of 8%. Square (SQ)Square (NYSE:SQ) is the next of our stocks to buy. Mobile payments innovator Square stock has its share of bearish naysayers. But sales growth of around 44% over the next five years towers over competitor PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and other industry giants like Visa (NYSE:V). And with a market capitalization of just $26 billion and earnings on tap next Wednesday, SQ's bottoming pattern looks like a superior opportunity for investors.On the price chart and after failing steadfast SQ stock investors a year ago, shares have worked to form a bullish higher-low corrective double bottom pattern between Square's lifetime 50% to 62% retracement levels. A longer-term low looks even more attractive given an oversold stochastics crossover and last month's price confirmation of the pattern's hammer-style September pivot low.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Struggle to Continue Payout Hikes SQ Stock Strategy: Shares of Square can be bought today at a modest discount to the September pattern confirmation of $63.98. And with earnings a potential catalyst to move shares aggressively higher out of the bottom, this is a stock to buy. Of course, earnings reactions can be a two-way street and SQ stock is no exception. As much, I'd strongly recommend gaining exposure with a limited and reduced risk strategy such as a vertical spread or collar position with SQ stock options. F5 Networks (FFIV)F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) is our last stock to buy. It has been a while since the broader market's rising tide helped FFIV stock investors. In fact, the mid-cap networking company's shares have been ebbing lower for the last 13 months in a correction. But the tide for bulls looks to be shifting for the better off and on the price chart.A profit and sales beat a week ago sent FFIV stock gapping higher by about 5.5%. More important, the reaction also signaled a successful test of F5's longer-term uptrend and Fibonacci support zone. Along with a bullish divergence in stochastics, FFIV is a name to put on the radar as a stock to buy.FFIV Stock Strategy: I'd propose waiting for a second chance confirmation of August's bottoming candlestick. Specifically, buying FFIV stock above $150 will allow shares to trade above the pattern high, as well as potential lateral resistance tied to F5 Networks former highs. The all-time-high near $200 is recommended for taking initial profits, while a 15% stop-loss looks equally appropriate off and on the price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management currently own positions in Square (SQ) and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.

Gilardi reiterated his buy rating while raising his stock price target to $165 from $154. Among the reasons to be &quot;more constructive&quot; on Caterpillar are favorable inventory comments from Caterpillar's largest dealer, a rebound in Class 8 orders and the resilience of the U.S. service economy, which suggests the recession in U.S. manufacturing will be shallow and short-lived. However, Gilardi acknowledged that &quot;it will all boil down to the signing (or not) of an interim U.S.-China trade deal.&quot; The stock has slipped 0.5% since closing Monday at a 13-month high.

2019-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Add the riots in Chile and political issues in other parts of Latin America to troubles dimming the outlook for Caterpillar Inc.On Wednesday, the world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment reported that its three-month rolling average sales growth in the region slowed to 4% in October, matching the January data that was the weakest since mid-2017.Latin America accounted for about 9% of Caterpillar’s revenue in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Weakness in the region accelerated the slowdown in the company’s worldwide sales growth to 3%, the worst since April 2017.“There’s the social unrest in Chile, which is an important mining market,” Larry de Maria, an analyst at William Blair, said in a telephone interview. “Argentina has a difficult political situation and Brazil hasn’t really improved the way people hoped it would improve.”The shares fell 1.3% to $144.49 on Wednesday in New York, extending this week’s decline.Last month, Caterpillar refrained from giving sales guidance, citing the uncertain global economic outlook. Last week, the company said it’s implementing layoffs of temporary workers at its plant in Michigan and across the globe, in line with its move to cut production to match demand.Security forces in Chile, the world’s largest copper producer, struggled to control riots across the capital Tuesday evening, prompting President Sebastian Pinera to call for a national agreement on peace and a new constitution.In Argentina, Alberto Fernandez’s surprise victory in a primary vote put the leftist on course for the presidency. In Brazil, the largest-ever auction of oil deposits flopped, signaling the region’s biggest economy will struggle to rely on investments to jump start weak growth.To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Takes a Hit as Chile Riots Add to Global Uncertainty

2019-11-14,"This month, the industrial sector finally blasted through a resistance zone that was impenetrable for 18 months. With the ceiling finally felled, the entire space is now basking in record highs. And that makes some industrial stocks attractive buys now.Today we'll highlight three of the best.Breakouts to all-time highs like that seen in the Industrial Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI) this month are bullish phenomenons for a variety of reasons. First, it signals buyers are willing to pay a richer price than ever before, highlighting their degree of conviction. Second, every single shortseller is losing money, which created a powerful urge to buy back their losing positions. Third, there isn't an existing shareholder on the planet that is losing money. No underwater longs are waiting to get back to breakeven so they can sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 Throw it all together, and we have a backdrop for increasing demand and decreasing supply. I've scoured the sector and found these three industrial stocks to buy that stand out from the crowd. Industrial Stocks to Buy: Caterpillar (CAT)Source: ThinkorSwim If you agree that stock prices are the best forward-looking economic indicator there is. And, if you believe that Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock reflects how investors feel about global growth. Then, the mega breakout in CAT stock last month has to have you beating your bullish drums.The 18-month downtrend for Caterpillar finally ended, and the weekly chart is back into an uptrend for the first time since 2017. This week's market pause has allowed CAT to digest recent gains and begin a pullback pattern that is creating a lower-risk entry. While further weakness would be welcome, it's at a point where dipping your toe in the water could make sense.With implied volatility scraping the bottom of its one-year range, I like buying call spreads. You can purchase the Jan $145/$150 bull call for $2.30 and offers $2.70 of reward if CAT rises above $150 by expiration. UPS (UPS)Source: ThinkorSwim UPS (NYSE:UPS) tagged a 52-week high last week and has since formed a textbook bull retracement pattern. Volume patterns show many accumulation days over the past month and zero signs of distribution. Tack on the upcoming holiday shopping season and a broad market that continues to court record highs, and I see little reason why UPS stock won't keep trucking higher.Like Caterpillar, UPS options carry low implied volatility making long premium plays a cheaper bet than usual. Long calls aren't a bad way to go, but I prefer bull calls for additional leverage and higher probability. If you think UPS can run toward $130 by mid-January, then buy the Jan $125/$130 bull call spread for $1.50.  * 7 Inexpensive, High-Dividend ETFs to Buy The risk is limited to the initial $1.50 cost, and the reward is $3.50. Cummins (CMI)Source: ThinkorSwim The final pick of today's trio is Cummins (NYSE:CMI), which is also forming an interesting pullback pattern. Last month's rally carried CMI stock past weekly resistance and places it within striking distance of last year's record print of $194.18. Its price behavior has mirrored that of CAT, with a price rising above 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages.This week's retreat is bringing CMI closer to the 20-day average, which has been a gathering ground for dip buyers in the past. It could drop for another day or two, so wait for a break above a prior day's high before pulling the trigger.Implied volatility is running hotter for CMI than the previous two trade ideas, so I'm switching it up with a bull put idea. Sell the Dec $170/$165 bull put for around 75 cents. You will pocket the reward of 75 cents if the stock sits above $170 at expiration.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-21,"From a long-term standpoint, I still like the case for Micron (NASDAQ:MU) stock. Memory demand should rise over time, thanks to broader trends like IoT (Internet of Things) and 5G (fifth-generation) wireless. Falling earnings don't make Micron stock look all that cheap right now, but estimates for mid-cycle earnings still suggest upside from a current price of $45.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com That said, of late I've been much more cautious from a short-term perspective. Third quarter earnings in June helped catalyze the recent rally, but I was much less impressed by the report than the market seemed to be. The outlook given with September's Q4 release underwhelmed, though Micron stock would get back most of its post-earnings losses.  * 7 Killer Stocks No One Knows About To be sure, I've been far too cautious, as even with a recent pullback MU stock has gained nicely from its June lows. Going forward, however, I still see cause for concern. Recent trading in MU suggests investors are betting on a calendar 2020 recovery in pricing and a sharp rebound in earnings in fiscal 2020. Those expectations leave room for disappointment, and potentially a lower share price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What the Cycle Means for Micron StockMicron might well be the most cyclical company in the world. Full-year adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2016 (ending August) were just six cents. Two years later, non-GAAP EPS was nearly 200 times as high, at $11.95. Profits then fell by nearly half the following year, and Micron guided for first quarter 2020 EPS to decline over 80% year-over-year.Cyclical stocks in general can be difficult to value, given the number of assumptions required. At what point have earnings peaked? When have they bottomed? What is the so-called 'mid-cycle' figure -- an estimate of profitability between those two points?These are all questions that investors can answer very differently, which explains why MU stock has seen some of the same volatility as its earnings, if obviously not to the same extent. It's why Micron stock traded, at one point not that long ago, at less than four times earnings: the market recognized (correctly, as it turned out) that pricing and profits were headed for a steep fall. Of course, it's also why an investor can logically argue that MU stock is cheap now, even though it trades at over 18x consensus estimates for fiscal 2020 EPS.After all, 18x earnings is a steal if those earnings are coming at the bottom of the cycle, just as 4x is a dangerous multiple at the top. Right now, Wall Street at least believes the bottom is in sight. FY21 EPS estimates sit at $5.28 on average, albeit with a wide range: $3 to $8.75. That consensus estimate suggests profits will double. Unsurprisingly, the average target price near $55 implies 20% upside from the current MU stock price.The gains in Micron stock so far suggest that investors are looking ahead to a better fiscal 2021. And that seems like the biggest risk at the moment. Is the Bottom In?What drives most of Micron's earnings volatility is pricing. Industry-wide shortages and big demand led both DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND (short for &quot;not and&quot;) pricing to soar. Micron earnings followed. Pricing on both fronts declined, and so did profits.The long-term case for Micron's unit demand is based on the broader tailwinds benefiting other semiconductor stocks and other tech names. Pricing, however, is a bit of a different story. That depends not just on demand, but on supply. Memory manufacturers (including Micron) too often have built capacity to capture high pricing, leading to oversupply, plunging prices, and falling profits.This time, the industry (which is mostly Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix on the DRAM side) swears it will be different. Micron already is lowering its capacity investments significantly in both NAND and DRAM in fiscal 2020, per the Q4 conference call. That should keep inventories low and pricing stable-to-positive, allowing fiscal 2021 earnings to bounce back after a trough year in FY20.But rivals need to cooperate as well, and historically that hasn't been the case. Going forward, China's Changxin Memory is on track to become that country's first legitimate DRAM producer, and that could add supply at an inopportune time.Meanwhile, Micron itself still seems cautious. The company accelerated its cut in NAND capacity. Management noted that inventories remain somewhat high. The outlook on that side of the business likely drove some of the post-earnings weakness in Micron stock. And MU stock wasn't the only name to stumble after earnings: NAND rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) saw its stock plunge late last month.There's some evidence to suggest that a bottom might take longer than bulls think at the moment. And that could be a near-term problem for Micron stock. The Near- to Mid-Term Worry for MU StockIn theory, cyclical stocks should see their trading somewhat smoothed by the market. At peak earnings, multiples come down. At the trough, those multiples expand.In practice, it doesn't work out that way. Investors get too optimistic near the top, which is what happened with Micron stock in the first half of 2018. They get too pessimistic at the bottom, as appears to have been the case both late last year and in May-June of 2019.But usually, cyclical names start to make their move a few quarters before the underlying earnings trend shifts. That's what happened to MU stock last spring. It's what happened to Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), a classic cyclical stock, at the top in 2012 and ahead of the bottom put in 2016.In recent months, Micron stock has rallied, suggesting that investors are forecasting a recovery next calendar year. But of late, that optimism is cracking. MU stock's technical picture doesn't look all that bullish. That of WDC is even worse.Meanwhile, memory names have rallied while the rest of the sector is soaring. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) both have broken out while Micron stock has struggled. At least at the moment, the market seems bullish on the long-term catalysts for chip demand. But it doesn't seem to believe those catalysts are making their way to memory prices any time soon. On the SidelinesAdmittedly, that could be an opportunity, with MU and WDC joining the rally at some point. But from another perspective, it's a problem. Again, pricing is key for memory stocks, Micron in particular. There's just not much evidence from Micron itself or the market that pricing is coming back as quickly as the MU stock price suggests it will.Simply put, that's a problem. It doesn't mean Micron stock is a short, or even a bad investment at $45. But it does mean that Micron stock could get cheaper, quickly, in the coming months, and that long-term investors at the least might consider waiting for a better entry point. The rally in Micron stock of late has come because many investors believe a rebound is imminent. If those investors are wrong, they may reconsider their thesis -- which would lead to a wave of selling in Micron stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Deere & Co. results show the trouble with reading the economic tea leaves.The maker of tractors and construction equipment slumped on Wednesday after announcing a depressed outlook for fiscal 2020 that caught investors off guard. Deere expects net income to be no higher than $3.1 billion next year, a decline relative to 2019 and well below the $3.46 billion analysts had been modeling. Here was investors’ response:The root of the disappointment is Deere’s expectation that global agricultural and turf equipment sales will slump 5% to 10% next year. Heading into earnings, there was optimism that Deere might even see growth in that division, should the prospect of a trade deal and the Trump administration’s plans to pump financial support into the farming industry incentivize growers to finally swap out aging equipment. Indeed, data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that capital spending excluding aircraft increased in October by the most since the start of the year, adding credence to the idea that the slowdown in industrial growth is bottoming out.With the trade war still lingering in the background, though, it appears Deere CEO John May isn’t banking on much of anything. That seems the prudent path to take. For one, May only just ascended to the CEO role this month and is likely disinclined to set goals he can’t guarantee in such an uncertain environment (3M Co.’s Michael Roman, who’s cut guidance an absurd number of times in his short tenure, should probably take note). But even CEOs who have been around for a while would have trouble predicting how their customers will act six to nine months down the road. This industrial downturn has been different from others in that it’s not a function of supply-and-demand dynamics but of political uncertainty. Manufacturing data can naturally be lumpy given the volatile timing of big projects, or in the case of this year, the General Motors Co. labor strike. But the unpredictable nature of trade negotiations makes the trajectory of any recovery particularly difficult to predict.The tariffs that China and the U.S. have levied against each other have made inventory management something more akin to an Olympic sport as companies try to get ahead of the levies but also guard against getting stuck with a bunch of unwanted goods. That challenge was reflected in Deere’s outlook. Looking at the broader market, Deere expects demand for agricultural equipment to drop 5% in the U.S. and Canada, while the European, South American and Asian markets are seen remaining flat. That’s not as severe as Deere’s forecast for its own business, a dynamic which Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann says likely reflects an expectation that dealers are still sitting on too much inventory and will work through that before placing new orders. An upwardly revised GDP figure released Wednesday of 2.1% for the third quarter also reflected inventory accumulation.   Point being, no one really knows anything, and everyone is afraid of moving in the wrong direction. One reason Deere’s lackluster guidance hit its stock particularly hard is that the forecast wasn’t accompanied by much detail on restructuring that the company had previously indicated would be forthcoming. The company will implement a voluntary separation program for some employees that should save about $150 million annually when combined with 2019 cost-cutting efforts. If the outlook is really as bad as Deere claims, though, you would think we would see something more substantive on cost cuts. But to get aggressive with restructuring, Deere also has to be confident that this market isn’t going to turn around on a dime if there is in fact a legitimate trade deal, lest it end up short-staffed. The Trump administration is quickly running out of ways to describe the trade talks and proximity to a “phase-one” agreement. One day we were down to the “short strokes,” the next we’re in the rather morbid sounding “final throes.” But while investors are more than happy to price in those words as a done deal, CEOs are thinking differently. Deere’s downbeat guidance follows similar outlooks from Caterpillar Inc. and Emerson Electric Co. that in certain lights could be construed as conservative. Or they might just be accurate.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-12-02,"December is usually a pretty good month for stocks and that historical precedent may yet prove true this month, but it was defied Monday as equities tumbled on the back of some weak manufacturing data and another tariff gambit by the White House.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 lost 0.86%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.96%  * The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 1.12%  * On light news, American Express (NYSE:AXP) was the worst performer in the Dow, shedding 2.38% to start the week.One of the main reasons stocks weakened to start the final month of 2019 was dismal factory data. Earlier today, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index reading for November declined to 48.1 in November from 48.3 in October. Economists were expecting a November reading 49.2. That's bad not only because the November reading missed estimates, but also because reports below 50 are seen as bearish.Another reason that traders reacted in bearish fashion to the ISM number is that it could be a precursor to more discouraging data and that's a relevant point to consider because the Labor Department deliver the November jobs report before the bell this Friday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Now On the tariff front, perhaps the best thing that can be said is that today's headlines don't involve China. Rather, President Trump is targeting Argentina and Brazil with new steel tariffs. This is repeat of something the White House did a couple of years ago and the effects were positive for domestic steel producers.&quot;Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers,&quot; said the president on Twitter. &quot;Therefore, effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel & Aluminum that is shipped into the U.S. from those countries.&quot;Overall, today was gloomy for the Dow Jones as just five of its 30 components were higher in late trading. Let's look at some of the best and the worst to start the week. Industrial IntrigueThe aforementioned ISM report proved highly damaging for industrial stocks as none of the Dow's constituents from that sector finished higher today. Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the worst offender among Dow industrial stocks, shedding more than 3%.This could be another eventful month for Boeing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) head Steve Dickson will testify before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee next week about the Boeing MAX 737.&quot;U.S. officials told Reuters last week it is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, that the agency will unground the plane before the end of December,&quot; according to the new agency.United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), the Dow's other industrial names, were all dragged lower by the ISM report.&quot;The guts of the report show just how dismal the industrial sector looks,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;New orders, an indication of demand, dropped for the fourth straight month and at an accelerating pace. The streak is the worst since the financial crisis, and it comes despite seasonal factors that tend to give a lift to orders this time of year, said Tim Fiore, chairman of the ISM's survey committee.&quot; A Retail AffairLast Friday was Black Friday and today is Cyber Monday, two of the most important days of the year for retailers. However, Black Friday has lost some of its cache in recent years due to the emergence of online shopping. Still, some brick-and-mortar retailers are have significant e-commerce footprints, too. That group includes Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Although Walmart, a Dow component and the largest domestic retailer, experienced a rocky road today, some analysts believe it and rival Target (NYSE:TGT) are winners this holiday shopping season and beyond.&quot;We strongly believe that both WMT and TGT's drive up/grocery pick up options offer exactly what the consumer will need as they are increasingly constrained by time,&quot; said Raymond James retail analyst Matthew McClintock in a note out today. Tech UpdateDue to the risk off tenor to today's market action, it wasn't surprising to see the Dow's technology constituents retreat, but several of these names remain &quot;buys&quot; this month and for the year ahead.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded slightly lower despite JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raising his price target on the iPhone maker to $296 from $290.Speaking of the iPhone, Chatterjee says Apple could eventually consider launching more new versions of the popular smartphone to match Android launches. Apple usually has just one launch per year for the iPhone while Android phones are introduced by handset makers throughout the year.  * 10 Great Tech Gifts to Buy for Under $100 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) joined Apple in the red, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya up his price target on the semiconductor giant to $70 from $65 today while publishing a note outlining five reasons to buy the stock. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWith manufacturing data deteriorating, there is some burden on consumer data to pick up the slack and that thesis is being tested as we speak thanks to the holiday shopping season. Broadly speaking, investors should expect the consumer to remain healthy, but not overly buoyant.&quot;Absent a trade or other exogenous shock, the U.S. economy looks to grow again in 2020,&quot; said BlackRock in a note out earlier today. &quot;Real personal consumption has been growing every quarter since the end of 2009.

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Markets are cheering trade progress between the U.S. and China. It’s important to note that a deal isn’t a cure-all — especially for manufacturers.President Donald Trump reportedly signed off late Thursday on an initial trade deal with China that will delay proposed tariffs on some $160 billion of largely consumer goods set to take effect on Dec. 15. The deal presented to Trump also included promises by China to purchase additional U.S. agricultural goods, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. A rollback of existing tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese goods was said to have been “discussed,” but it’s unclear whether Trump agreed to a reduction and and unknown as to how significant it might be.China has balked at previous agreements that it felt were too lopsided and the removal of tariffs was a top priority. Without that, this deal would appear to be less of a “phase-one” agreement and more of a “phase 0.5” deal. But assuming some semblance of an accord finally limps across the finish line, where do industrial stocks go from here?Manufacturers bore the brunt of the initial tariff crossfire, while the uncertainty wrought by the upheaval in relations between the world’s two biggest economies has slowed customer spending to a crawl. Large manufacturers have been relatively constrained so far in their efforts to cut costs, a sign that they believe demand is being artificially restrained by the trade tensions and could bounce back meaningfully in short order. At the same time, the S&P 500 Industrial Index hit reached an all-time high on Nov. 26 and the actual slowdown in most manufacturers’ sales has been relatively shallow. Industrial distributor Fastenal Co., which sits on the front lines of any economic swings, last week said November daily sales rose 5.7% from a year earlier. That’s a deceleration from the pace of growth at the start of the year, but still relatively healthy, meaning there may not be much room to bounce higher.It’s worth remembering that Caterpillar Inc.’s infamous warning of the “high water-mark” for profits actually came in April 2018, and its guidance at the time excluded potential impacts from increased trade restrictions. The immediately subsequent share plunge was as much a reflection of fears around cyclical peaks as it was the trade war. Since then, tariffs have obviously compounded concerns about an industrial slowdown, but there’s an argument to be made that they also added noise and distraction to a slowdown that was already in the process of happening naturally. Point being, there has been nothing normal about this industrial business cycle and the recovery from here remains a question mark.Trade deal or not, tariff rollback or not, plenty of uncertainty still lingers. Left out of the initial agreement are any commitments around the U.S.’s primary reasons for starting this trade war in the first place, including reforms to China’s industrial subsidies, improved foreign access to certain markets and a loosening of technology-transfer requirements. If I was an industrial CEO — or head of any company, frankly, with substantial business operations in China — plan A would not be to assume the waters remain calm. This trade war will continue to unleash a rethinking of supply chains as companies try to gird against future skirmishes, and that may continue to hinder purchasing decisions. And while settlement of Brexit would be a positive development, the impeachment inquiry in the U.S. is still progressing and the 2020 presidential election looms large.After aggressively buying rumor after rumor on the trade front, this may be a situation where industrial investors should sell the actual news.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-12-12,"DOW UPDATE Powered by positive growth for shares of Caterpillar and Cisco, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up Thursday morning. The Dow (DJIA) was most recently trading 153 points (0.6%) higher, as shares of Caterpillar (CAT) and Cisco (CSCO) are contributing to the blue-chip gauge&apos;s intraday rally.","Dow jumps 150 points on gains for Caterpillar, Cisco shares"
2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Agribusiness is increasingly turning to natural and sustainable alternatives to chemicals as consumers rebuff genetically modified foods and concerns grow over Big Ag’s role in climate change.At the heart of the trend are innovations that harness beneficial microorganisms in the soil, including seed-coatings of naturally occurring bacteria and fungi that can do the same work as traditional chemicals, from warding off pests to helping plants flourish, according to a global patent study by research firm GreyB Services.“Both entrepreneurs and investors are saying, ‘Hey, the writing is on the wall, we’re entering a post-chemical world,’” said Rob LeClerc, chief executive officer of AgFunder, an online venture-capital platform. “The seed companies who have billions in market cap are like ‘We need to do something,’ and everyone recognizes the opportunity.”Much of the handwringing over farm chemicals stems from the recent fate of glyphosate, the most ubiquitous weedkiller ever. Regulators around the world are tightening up rules around using the chemical, including Europe and Mexico. Meanwhile, thousands of lawsuits that could result in billions of dollars in penalties are pending against Bayer AG over whether its glyphosate-containing product, Roundup, caused cancer. Bayer insists it’s safe, and some government agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency say it isn’t likely to cause cancer in humans.The global fertilizer and pesticide market is around $240 billion, and grows 2% to 3% a year, according to Ben Belldegrun, a managing partner at Pontifax AgTech, a company that invests in food and agriculture technology. While so-called biologicals including biofertilizers, biopesticides and biostimulants are just 2% of that market, those have been growing closer to 15% a year for the past five years, Belldegrun said.Pressure for less chemical-intensive farming methods is coming from retailers like Walmart Inc., non-governmental organizations and consumers, who are throwing more dollars toward organic and other niche foods with environmental or animal welfare claims.As population increases worldwide, the demand for agricultural products is projected to grow 15% over the next decade with no change in the amount of land available for farming, according to a joint report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization.“There’s a growing world population and how are we going to feed all of these people?” asked Craig Forney, assistant director for licensing and business development at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. “At the same time, we want to protect the environment. We need to use land better and use the resources better.”The answer, Forney said, is “intensified agricultural production to increase productivity of land and do it with minimal chemical support.”Patents give owners the exclusive right to an invention, and can indicate both where research funding is being spent and where companies or universities expect to generate revenue in the future.Companies like BASF SE, Bayer and Syngenta AG have patents on products using naturally-occurring microbes to help crops flourish even when there is low water availability, according to GreyB’s analysis. The microbes can act as catalysts to encourage growth. Biological-based fungicides and insecticides can also help reduce crop damage from insects, slugs and fungi.“Seed-applied biological products can extend the window of disease and pest protection, while some also provide alternate modes of action that can reduce the build-up of resistance, aid with nutrient management and reduce plant stress,” said Chris Judd, BASF’s global strategic marketing manager for Seed Treatment, Inoculants and Biologicals.Evonik Industries AG, Altair Nanotechnologies Inc., Covestro AG and startup Indigo AG have been active in obtaining patents and publishing research in the area of using microbes, as have universities like China’s Zhejiang University and Nanjing Agricultural University, according to GreyB.Likewise, thousands of patents are being issued to companies like BASF, Bayer and Dow Inc. for more natural ways of managing pests including pheromones that deter breeding and reflective mulches, instead of chemical-based insecticides.Germany’s Bayer, which bought agriculture chemical giant Monsanto Co. in 2018, sees “high growth potential” for biologicals, citing a challenging regulatory environment for chemicals and a growing emphasis on sustainability in agriculture. Bayer has a research and development team solely focused on them. The company also is hunting for partnerships to boost its portfolio. Benoit Hartmann, head of biologics at Bayer, said the increased investments show how the science around microbes has matured in recent years.In 2013, BASF acquired seed-treatment supplier Becker Underwood, which helped the company become a leader in biological agents to fight bacteria and fungi. Judd said the company sees demand for biologicals increasing but maintains that they need “to be compatible with an increasing array of chemistries and to have the ability to survive on the seed for adequate periods.”The increased patenting reflects a trend of researchers looking for ways to help promote organic and non-GMO farming, said Nicole Kling, a patent agent with Nixon Peabody who specializes in the biotechnology field.With biologicals, “You’re not introducing chemicals with the scare quotes around it,” Kling said. “You’re not doing anything that would harm the agricultural workers.”Researchers and companies are looking for new solutions for farming with less chemicals because organic farming, the most popular alternative to modern conventional farming, often results in lower yields. Still, demand for food continues increasing. Iowa State and other universities around the world, using government funding or in partnership with companies, are rushing to deal with those competing demands.“The hope is someday in the future they will merge and you will have organic and non-GMO products that are just as productive as Big Ag,” Forney said.That’s where things like precision agriculture to tailor the application of nutrients, artificial intelligence to monitor soil conditions and the development of new plant hybrids come in.Other emerging techniques that could boost yields while helping farmers use less chemicals is artificial intelligence, which is being used to analyze which seeds and crops can yield the most based on changing soil conditions and weather patterns on a farm. The promise of quantum computers would let companies use massive computing power to develop and analyze new seeds and fertilizers.Scientists also are developing new plant varieties, with applications for new varieties up 9% in 2018, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. China led the growth, with more than a quarter of the applications for new varieties.Much of the research in crop biotech is centered in the U.S., China, Germany, Japan and South Korea, though it’s being adapted to meet local conditions in Africa, Latin America and Asia, according to WIPO, an agency of the U.N.Demand for more food will be greatest in Africa, India and the Middle East. In the developing world, there is little food scarcity because “we did good things with all that ‘better living through chemistry,’” Kling said, referring to a play on an old DuPont motto. It has come at a cost, though.“We’re starting to see some of the effects of that -- all of this wonderful industrialization has contributed to climate change,” Kling said. “We’re starting to see people swing back in the other direction.”(Adds executive comment in fifteenth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Mulvany in Chicago at lmulvany2@bloomberg.net;Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, ;James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",‘Post-Chemical World’ Takes Shape as Agribusiness Goes Green

2019-12-27,"Some believe every dog has its day. But when it comes to investing in some of 2019's more doggish blue-chips, select Dow stocks are ready to pay big-time dividends to investors in more than one way in 2020. Let me explain.It has been a merrier investing season for investors this year following 2018's corrective bag of coal that weighed so heavily on Wall Street's animal spirits. For its part, the benchmark Dow Jones Industrials cruised to all-time-highs and a gain of nearly 2% this month on the back of a Santa Claus rally. The price action has also extended the Dow's year-to-date return to an unusually strong 22%.Bullish participation among individual blue-chips has been solid. But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) takes the cake in price performance. The market's largest publicly-traded company has made it a December to remember with its gain of 8% and year-to-date rally of over 84%. Still, there are other Dow stocks that investors should be even more excited about right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs we head into 2020, rotations among sectors and stocks are nearly inevitable and potentially highly-profitable situations. Having said that, one place to look are blue-chips which have behaved somewhat doggishly this year, while putting in solid technical work to increase the odds of outperformance among Dow stocks in 2020.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way Bottom-line, if you missed this year's big winner, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) gain of 56%, or happily happen to be sitting on big-time profits with less margin for error, celebrate the New Year in Dow stocks ready for technical leadership and that offer healthy dividends to boot. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Charts by TradingViewCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the first of our Dow stocks to buy. The blue-chip stock has under-performed the benchmark index by roughly 12% in 2019 with a gain of about 10.5%. But the New Year is setting up to pay big-time dividends in the form of price performance that's sure to delight investors on top of the company's fat dividend of nearly 3%.Technically, shares are shaping up to establish a monthly bottoming candlestick within a key longer-term support zone comprised of price congestion, Fibonacci, and trendline analysis. As CSCO's correction has also maintained this Dow stock's uptrend and stochastics are just now forming a bullish crossover in oversold territory, buying on weakness looks even more compelling.CSCO Stock Strategy: The recommendation in Cisco is to buy shares in January on price confirmation December is a bottoming candlestick. Set a stop-loss beneath the pattern low and look for this Dow stock to challenge its 2000 high of $63.94 for taking initial profits. Caterpillar (CAT)  Source: Charts by TradingViewCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is the next of our Dow stocks to buy. No doubt it's been a tough couple years for CAT stock investors. But now there's more than just dividend relief of approximately 2.8% to take the sting out of holding this blue-chip investment.Technically, CAT's weakness since 2018 has produced a high-level double-bottom consolidation pattern. With the corrective lows successfully testing the 50% Fibonacci level and remaining above the Dow stock's lengthy basing pattern from 2011 - 2017, there's strong pattern evidence in place for Caterpillar to trade aggressively higher in 2020.CAT Stock Strategy: For this Dow stock, shares can be purchased right now. CAT stock affirmed its bottom with a breakout last month through the pattern's April mid-pivot of $142.54. Now and with Caterpillar just 4% higher and stochastics quickly confirming the bullish price movement, there's no time like the present to go long.  * 7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks for 2020 I'd recommend a stop-loss beneath $137, which looks like sufficient leeway off and on the price chart. On a rally, given the size of CAT's consolidation work, I'd allow a breakout to new highs take this Dow stock towards $200 before reducing exposure and locking in profits. Chevron (CVX)  Source: Charts by TradingViewChevron (NYSE:CVX) is the last of our Dow stocks to buy. The energy giant's 3.95% dividend puts shares firmly on the radar of income investors who follow the Dogs of the Dow buying strategy. But it's CVX stock's healthy base-on-base pattern within an uptrend that's caught our eye.After two failed monthly breakout attempts (highlighted in yellow) followed by a successful test of the prior cup's highs, a third try with stochastics leading the way looks promising for bullish follow-thru in 2020 for CVX stock.CVX Stock Strategy: Buy this Dow stock on a breakout above the July high of $124.48. A stop-loss below $117 or 6% risk looks approachable both off and on the price chart. Likewise, I'd allow profits to run in CVX stock towards $150 before reducing position size.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-12-27,"Shares of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) have been struggling over the past several weeks. CAT stock has gone nowhere since the rally stalled in early November. This even with the overall market making new highs on a seemingly daily basis. While the melt up in stocks may continue, at some point a pullback is inevitable. When it does, look for CAT stock to lead that pullback lower.Source: astudio / Shutterstock.com Caterpillar missed earnings once again last quarter and lowered guidance. EPS came in at $2.66 per share, well shy of the analysts estimates of $2.88. Revenues also were a miss at $12.8 billion versus expectations of $13.3 billion. The full year outlook was lowered from between $10.90 and $11.40 per share from a previous $12.06 to $13.06 per share.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way Yet CAT stock has rallied over 11% since that earnings release. Apparently lowered guidance and earnings misses are now a bullish sign for a stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What This Means for Caterpillar StockThe combination of a higher stock price plus lowered earnings means that the P/E multiple has necessarily expanded. This makes valuations less attractive. CAT stock is back at the highest P/E ratio over the past year at over 14. The last time it was at such a rich multiple led to a sharp pullback in CAT stock.CAT is looking a little tired from a technical take. Caterpillar stock is having difficulty breaking out past the major overhead resistance area at $148.50. 9-day RSI reached overbought levels but has now weakened. MACD continues to flounder while momentum has turned lower. CAT stock is trading at a big premium to the 100-day moving average which has led to pullbacks in the past.  Click to Enlarge Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. In my previous analysis on Caterpillar stock from Oct. 7, I had a bullish outlook for CAT. This was based on attractive comparative valuations and improving technicals. This proved to be the case as Caterpillar stock has rallied over 20% since then. Now, however, my outlook is decidedly more bearish -- because price does matter.CAT carried just a 11.3 P/E at that time compared to over 14 today. The oversold technicals are now neutral to overbought. CAT stock was trading at a discount to the 100 day moving average but is now at a premium. All the tailwinds for the previous rally from a few months back have become serious headwinds. The upside looks limited from here for Caterpillar over the coming months.Analysts seem to echo that somewhat bearish sentiment. The average 12 month price target is $141.40 or over 4% lower. Four analysts actually have a sell rating on CAT with a low price target of $100. Certainly not a bullish outlook for Caterpillar stock. Trading CATStock traders should look to sell CAT stock on any further strength. An initial downside profit objective would be the $140 area where the latest leg of the rally began. The ultimate price objective would be a pullback to the 100-day moving average near $133. A break past the secondary resistance at $158 would be a viable stop out.Option traders may want to look to take advantage of comparatively cheap implied volatility. The February / January $140 put calendar costs roughly $2.00 and positions nicely for a pullback towards the $140 area. Maximum risk on the trade is $200 per spread. Ideally CAT stock closes near $140 at January expiration on the 17th to achieve maximum gain.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-03,"The new year is still, well, new, but President Trump is showing he means business when it comes to dealing with Iran. Late Thursday, a U.S. airstrike killed General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds and one of the most powerful figures in that country.That move brought criticism from Democrats claiming a military operation of that magnitude needs congressional authorization and promises of &quot;crushing revenge&quot; from Iran. As a result, stocks were crimped to close the week.  * The S&P 500 retreated 0.71%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.81%  * The Nasdaq Composite declined by 079%  * Confirming that geopolitical tensions pressured stocks today, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) was the only Dow component trading to the upside late in Friday's session.The Pentagon said the strike that killed Soleimani was aimed at preventing further loss of American life and some Republican senators took to Twitter last night to say the general had American blood on his hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;The Defense Department blamed Soleimani for the deaths of hundreds of Americans, and said he was behind recent attacks on coalition bases in Iraq, including one on December 27 that killed an American defense contractor,&quot; reports CBS News.Speculation is swirling that Trump pushed to have Soleimani vanquished based on intelligence that the Iranian general was planning an attack on Americans or American assets.&quot;General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more … but got caught!,&quot; said Trump on Twitter earlier today. Unpleasant SurprisesOne of the more predictable market reactions to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East is for oil prices to rally, which crude did today. Typically, oil equities will go along for that ride, but that wasn't the case today as Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) both traded lower.In the case of Exxon, the largest domestic energy company, that stock was lower by about 1% even though the company said it's going to realize a gain of $3.6 billion from the sale of some Nordic assets.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers &quot;The Norway deal in September, a part of Exxon's earlier plan to divest about $15 billion in nonstrategic assets by 2021, included ownership interests in over 20 producing fields with a combined production of about 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019,&quot; according to Reuters. Surprise Part IIAnother standard equity market response to the specter of military conflict is for defense stocks to rally. While the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) were steadier earlier in the session, both Dow Jones defense names were slightly lower late in the day. Be Like BuffettWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) has stakes in several Dow stocks with one of his favorites being banking giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Berkshire owns 59.5 million JPM shares, 2% of the total outstanding.Based on Buffett's assumptions about where JPM should trade relative to its book value, the stock, which was hot last year, is currently undervalued.&quot;JPMorgan's tangible book value at the end of the third quarter of 2019 was $60 a share, implying that it could trade to $180 based on Buffett's math. At its current price, the stock trades for nearly 14 times projected 2019 earnings and yields 2.6%,&quot; reports Barron's. More Good News For AppleApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took a modest breather today and the stock may be due for a bit more of that given its recently torrid pace, but Wall Street remains enthusiastic about the stock for 2020.Not one, but two sell-side analysts are boosting price targets on the iPhone maker's stock. RBC analyst Robert Mueller reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on Apple while increasing his price target to $330, from $295.Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on Apple while lifting his price forecast on Apple shares to $330 from $290. Weak DataBroadly speaking, the U.S. economy is on firm ground, but that sentiment doesn't extend to manufacturers, which are struggling.  * 7 Buyout Targets to Watch For 2020 The December reading of the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index checked in at 47.2, well below economists' expectation of 49. Anything below 50 is seen as negative and today's report explains by Dow components 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) were two of the index's worst-performing names today. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTo put things delicately, today was a tricky one for riskier assets, oil being the exception. Geopolitical tensions coupled with the aforementioned weak manufacturing data are tough headwinds to overcome on an intraday basis.However, if cooler heads are able to prevail regarding the Iran situation, admittedly a big &quot;if,&quot; the recent weakness in the dollar should continue. The dollar was drubbed last month and that's good news for domestic exporters, plenty of which reside in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-06,"Even if you weren't paying attention, you couldn't have missed what an unpredictable year 2019 has been for markets both in the U.S. and globally. Our economy represents about 20% of total global output. Economic growth in modern economies depend on several factors, including an efficient financial sector which encompasses well-functioning capital markets. Most economists and researchers would easily concur that U.S. equity markets are an important engine of innovation, technological advancement and economic growth.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Recent research led by James Brown of Iowa State University highlights that &quot;the high-tech sector accounts for the majority of corporate innovation in modern economies. [There is] strong positive connection between a country's equity market development and the size of its high-tech sector.&quot;Therefore, as we start a new decade, I'd like to take a closer look at how the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), one of the most commonly followed equity indices worldwide, has fared over the past year and discuss several themes I'll be watching in 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2019The U.S. has the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. However, a year ago, as we ended 2018, many people were wondering if broader stock markets would have a rather difficult 2019. It would not be an exaggeration to say that there was a lot of nervousness -- or even fear -- in the air.  * 9 High-Risk Stocks to Buy for Massive Rewards Investors were rightfully concerned about U.S.-China trade wars, a global slowdown especially in China and emerging markets, interest rates, oil and gold prices. Eventually, the dust settles in the equity markets and strong stocks shine. And that is what has happened in 2019, too.Not many would possibly have imagined that the DJIA would be delivering a gain of more than 22% during the year. This return does not include the regular dividends paid by all 30 stocks in the index. In fact, many of them are Dividend Aristocrats, or companies that have consistently increased dividends at least once a year for the last 25 years.Thus in hindsight, a combination of growth and dividend income would have made the DJIA an ideal portfolio choice.As we start the new decade, we note that low interest rates, a historically strong domestic labor market and easing of U.S.-China trade war fears have helped send markets to all-time highs.The final quarter of the year was especially strong for many stocks. Individual days when we had some selling pressure in the broader market were quickly followed rather strongly up days.While past performance may not exactly repeat in the months ahead, the track records of the index highlights its growth potential.Now let us see how each stock in the index has done over the past 52 weeks. Dow Jones StocksThere are 30 large-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Most are household names. Here is how their stock prices have changed in 2019 as well as their current dividend yields.1&#92;. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Up about 86% in 2019, current dividend yield 1.1%.2&#92;. American Express (NYSE:AXP) - Up about 30%, current dividend yield 1.4%.3&#92;. Boeing (NYSE:BA) - Up about 1%, current dividend yield 2.5%.4&#92;. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) - Up about 16%, current dividend yield 2.8%.5&#92;. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) - Up about 11%, current dividend yield 3.9%.6&#92;. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) - Up about 11%, current dividend yield 2.9%.7&#92;. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) - Up about 17%, current dividend yield 2.9%.8&#92;. Dow (NYSE:DOW) - (DOW stock is a spinoff from DowDuPont. It started trading in March 2019 at an opening price of $52.75. The return is since that date.) Up about 4%, current dividend yield 5.1%.9&#92;. Exxon (NYSE:XOM) - Up about 2%, current dividend yield 4.9%.10&#92;. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) - Up about 38%, current dividend yield 2.2%.11&#92;. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) - Up about 27%, current dividend yield 2.5%.12&#92;. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) - Up about 28%, current dividend yield 2.1%.13&#92;. IBM (NYSE:IBM) - Up about 18%, current dividend yield 4.9%.14&#92;. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) - Up about 43%, current dividend yield 2.6%.15&#92;. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) - Up about 13%, current dividend yield 2.7%.16&#92;. 3M (NYSE:MMM) - Down about 8%, current dividend yield 3.2%.17&#92;. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) - Up about 11%, current dividend yield 2.5%.18&#92;. Merck (NYSE:MRK) - Up about 19%, current dividend yield 2.7%.19&#92;. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - Up about 55%, current dividend yield 1.3%.20&#92;. Nike (NYSE:NKE) - Up about 37%, current dividend yield 0.9%.21&#92;. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) - Down about 10%, current dividend yield 3.9%.22&#92;. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) - Up about 36%, current dividend yield 2.4%.23&#92;. Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) - Up about 14%, current dividend yield 2.4%.24&#92;. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) - Up about 18%, current dividend yield 1.5%.25&#92;. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - Up about 41%, current dividend yield 1.9%.26&#92;. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) - Up about 9%, current dividend yield 4.1%.27&#92;. Visa (NYSE:V) - Up about 42%, current dividend yield 0.6%.28&#92;. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) - Down about 14%, current dividend yield 3.1%.29&#92;. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) - Up about 28%, current dividend yield 1.8%.30&#92;. Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) - Up about 32%, current dividend yield 1.2%.In short, of these 30 companies, 27 have been good investments, offering a wide range of returns. The three exceptions are MMM, PFE and WBA stocks.However, shareholders in all three of those companies also receive dividends. And that passive income would have made the loss in stock price less painful, especially if those dividends were reinvested. Themes I'm Watching in 2020This year, I expect risk appetite to stay strong, especially amid further hopes of progress on a trade war truce between the U.S. and China. However, if trade frictions resurface, then they could likely weigh on growth and rattle equity markets.The Federal Reserve as well as most central banks globally are likely to remain supportive and maintain the current era of low interest rates -- a factor that would bode well for equity markets. I would not fight the Fed.Consumer spending is likely to stay healthy at least in the early part of the year. However, it is quite impossible to predict when investor sentiment may turn sour.High-quality tech stocks will likely to provide the tailwind for broader markets this year, too. Yet many may not be able to repeat the exceptional performance of 2019. Investors should remember that tech stocks tend to be highly volatile, especially on a shorter-term trading basis.2020 may prove to be another solid year for mergers and acquisitions as several mid-cap companies as well as start-ups may be subject to interest by large caps and private equity firms that have plenty of cash to spare. Similarly the IPO market is likely to be quite active.Needless to say, this is the year of the U.S. presidential election. Therefore broader markets are likely to get choppy as election day draws closer in November. Discourses around regulatory backlash against Big Tech as well as Big Pharma will likely affect the prices of many stock in these industries. On another note, presidential cycles in general mean strong advertising revenue for advertisers.Finally, many investors will likely be paying attention to companies that may benefit from sustainable investing themes, not only this year but throughout the decade. The Bottom LineWe have finished 2019 with the biggest market gains since 2013. Broader indices amd many stocks have recovered from the correction we saw in the final quarter of 2018 and reached new highs.Does being a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average make a stock a good make a good investment in 2020?The answer would depend on several factors, starting with your investing goals and time horizon. Were I to look for quality &quot;blue chip&quot; stocks with reliable dividends, it'd certainly be the first index I'd start analyzing.If and when quality goes on sale some time, as they usually do at some point in most years, I hope you will be ready to do due diligence on those stocks that may be suffering temporary setbacks. Buying the dips may help increase your long-term portfolio returns.Now, it just remains for me to wish you a happy and prosperous 2020!As of this writing, the author has covered calls on CSCO, KO, MRK, PFE (all Dec 10 expiry).

2020-01-07,"The equity markets are showing extraordinary resilience, even when faced with the prospects of World War III. The indices refuse to fall far from their all time highs. Coming into the Monday session, the media was preparing coverage of a crisis. Instead the markets went green and Wall Street is showing no fear. So there continue to be opportunities, especially among the big cap DOW stocks.The volatility index is spiking but has so far failed to hold its gains. Furthermore, the actions on Wall Street suggest that there is no real fear yet. Even on Monday morning when investors were supposed to be fretting the conflict with Iran, there were strong bids for frothy stocks. Scared markets do not buy speculative equities. They hunker down and run for safety like in bonds.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever Under such bullish conditions, today we highlight three DOW stocks that are looking like they want to spike soon. All three are still facing major issues but there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel for each. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) are overcoming tremendous trepidation, so their stocks are near relief zones.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dow Jones Stocks That Are Ready to Pop: Caterpillar (CAT)Source: Charts by TradingView For the last two years it felt like Caterpillar stock had a curse against it. Every potential substantial rally failed. It didn't help that CAT stock was in the direct line of fire from the economic war with China. Now that both sides are playing nice and seem intent on a deal, CAT's bullish breakout setup has a real chance of materializing. This time it has a confluence of at least two technical reasons to spike. There is a breakout from a descending channel, and another from overcoming a prior failure level.Since the October correction of 2018, CAT stock had stalled below $145 per share. Recently, the bulls were finally able to overcome it. Now they can use this neckline to build upon the momentum and recover the highs. If and when they get to $160, the bulls will face stiff resistance.Earnings are coming soon so maybe management can give Wall Street a concrete reason to buy it up with vigor. But this is a knife that can cut both ways because we all still remember how a few words from the CFO can cause a 20% debacle in the stock chart. Maybe now management will deliver an upbeat outlook, especially if they no longer see hindrance from the Chinese economic war.Unlike many frothy stocks that are rallying these days, CAT has value. So the move if and when it comes is justified. Fundamentally, Caterpillar stock is cheap. It sells at a modest 14 price-to-earnings ratio and 1.5 times sales. So owning it here is not likely to be a major financial debacle in the long term. Besides, from the charts, there is proven support through $127 per share. International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Charts by TradingView For years Wall Street has been expecting IBM to make the turn into the new tech world. For some reason they can't seem to make it like say Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) did. Nevertheless, management still gets a pass on the subject so for now we can trade the charts where the opportunity lies.The IBM stock price range is tight. For the last year it has set higher-lows and lower-highs and now it is in a pinpoint jam. It has also consolidated for the last few weeks between $131 and $137 per share. So a breach of either sides of this is likely to have momentum in that direction.Since the pattern of lower-highs has formed a deep wedge bumping up above a set of relatively flat base, the breakout to the upside is more likely than not. So the better bet is to take a position alongside the bulls in this first quarter. Earnings are coming soon, so it is up to management to not foil the setup. These events are binary in the short term, so there is that risk to consider. The last four reactions to earnings were two sharp rallies versus two sharp selloffs.  * 7 Stocks to Sell to Start the New Year Fresh Long term, IBM is cheap in absolute terms. It has a 13 price-to-earnings ratio and it even pays a hefty 4.5% dividend yield. So maybe that is why investors are patient with the turnaround efforts. Even if the breakout fails, then the damage should be contained, especially if investor time frame is long. Boeing (BA)Source: Charts by TradingView There is hardly a day that doesn't bring bad news for Boeing stock. Just this week we learned of potential wiring issues with the 737 Max. Nevertheless, the stock is doing much better than it should given the negativity that surrounds it. This is perhaps because for years, BA stock had been a monster.Investors liked its visibility as it had about a decade worth of backlog. So it is hard to bet against a company that is sold out for ten years, and it only has one other real competitor who is also fully booked. Meaning, the clients have no choice but to put up with BA and its delays.The tragically sad accidents that the Max had may have changed the outlook a little. Even though BA stock is not a catastrophe yet, this time there is real risk of prolonged repercussions. The 737 Max is still grounded and in spite of BA's own optimism, consensus is that it will be out of commission for a long while.But today's opportunity is based on the charts. Despite of all the trepidation that BA stock has had for months, it has proven support below $320 per share. It only broke below $300 during the horrendous market-wide correction two Christmases ago.This is a bet I can make using options to generate income out of thin air. Buying BA shares requires a lot of hopium to profit until this whole mess is behind it. But meanwhile, selling the BA May $280 put brings a potential $6 in profit. The worst that could happen is that you own the shares with a breakeven point at $274. This is a 17% buffer from current price.Compare this with risking $334 today per share without any room for error and hoping for a rally to profit. The upside scenario has about $40 to $50 worth of profits if BA stock is to repeat its see-saw price action inside this weekly consolidation zone.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-01-07,"Broadly speaking, Tuesday was another sluggish day for riskier assets. The dollar rose and oil declined as many market participants wait to see what happens next in the intensifying showdown between the U.S. and Iran.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 lost 0.28%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.42%  * The Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.03%  * With some of the wind coming out of oil's sails today, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) ranked as two of the Dow's worst performers, each losing more than 1%.By no means was it a terrible Tuesday despite the fact that 23 of 30 Dow Jones stocks were lower in late trading. There was some other good news, albeit on an anecdotal level, including that of a well-known market forecast that has notoriously been reluctant to endorse higher S&P 500 targets finally coming around.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Francois Trahan, head of U.S. equity strategy at UBS Group AG, raised his year-end target for the S&P 500 Index to 3,250 from a previous target of 3,000 set in November,&quot; reports Bloomberg.Trahan's prior call of 3,000 was one of the lowest on Wall Street.In economic news, the U.S. trade deficit declined by about $43.1 billion in November due in large part to the trade war with China.&quot;The deficit with China decreased $2.2 billion in November to $25.6 billion owing to a $1.4 billion increase in exports and an $800 million decline in imports,&quot; according to CNBC.  * 7 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now With that, let's have a look at some of Tuesday's winners and losers. Another Up Day For BoeingBoeing (NYSE:BA) added to Monday's gains, jumping as much as 1.38% today after the company said it's recommending pilot simulator training for those who will fly the 737 MAX jet, when that controversial plane finally gets airborne again.&quot;This recommendation takes into account our unstinting commitment to the safe return of service as well as changes to the airplane and test results. Final determination will be established by the regulators,&quot; said the company in a statement.There's also a rumor floating around that Warrren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) is building a position in Boeing. That coupled with the Iran drama boosting defense stocks are factors helping Boeing start 2020 on a strong note. Legal NewsJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) still faces an array of courtroom issues this year, but the company appears to have put at least one element of that to bed amid news that a California talc trial has been halted after the judge told jurors a settlement has been reached. Shares of JNJ posted a modest gain. Rough Day For IndustrialsAside from Boeing, the Dow's other industrial names -- Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) -- were stung today by another slack manufacturing data point.&quot;Latest data showed new orders for U.S.-made goods fell in November, pulled down by steep declines in demand for machinery and transportation equipment, pointing to sustained weakness in manufacturing,&quot; according to Reuters.Should Caterpillar and 3M be Dow laggards again, that puts some burden on Boeing to carry the Dow's industrial exposure and for other groups - namely technology - to prop up the blue chip index this year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayI noted yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings are a potential catalyst or trouble spot for stocks over the near-term and while it's not a marquee report, investors will get an earnings taste from Dow component Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) when the pharmacy operator reports quarterly results tomorrow.Wall Street expects WBA to earn $1.41 per share on sales of $34.6 billion.

2020-01-24,"The latest strain of the coronavirus, a deadly respiratory illness believed to have originated in central China, has spread around that country, forcing Beijing to halt travel for more than 35 million Chinese citizens. Plaguing stocks Friday wasn't just news of the virus's spread in China, but reports of a second U.S. case, this time in Chicago.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 slumped 0.90%.  * The Dow Jones finished lower by 0.58%.  * The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 0.93%.  * On a day when winners were in short supply, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was easily the best-performing Dow stock following a strong fourth-quarter earnings report and exciting first-quarter guidance.Getting back to the coronavirus fears for a moment, there were reports Thursday that a case may have emerged in Texas and that was followed by news that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed at least two cases in Illinois. The CDC said the situation is &quot;rapidly evolving.&quot;While health officials have stopped short of comparing this viral outbreak to the SARS epidemic of 2003 that killed about 800 people around the world, these type of headlines do have a way of plaguing riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy However, history indicates that the negative market reaction surrounding these type of events is usually confined to a short time frame. When fears abate, stocks often rally. Let's hope that's the case, because in late trading only six of the 30 Dow stocks were in the green. Thank Goodness for IntelAs noted above, Intel was the lead of the Dow pack today and it wasn't a close competition. For the fourth quarter, Intel reported earnings of $1.52 on revenue of $20.21 billion, easily topping Wall Street estimates of $1.25 per share and revenue of $19.23 billion.But those numbers are in the past. What really sparked the really in Intel stock today was the company's 2020 forecast of earnings of $5.00 on revenue of about $73.50 billion, ahead of consensus projections of $4.68 per share and revenue of $72.25 billion.The company also offered up strong commentary on data center chip demand, a theme that could also benefit rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).&quot;However, we believe Intel has been ably navigating the headwinds, via concerted efforts to rein in non-essential spending while investing in critical process and design technologies (10- and 7-nm, 5G, Artificial Intelligence, and automotive),&quot; said Morningstar in a note out earlier today. &quot;We are raising our fair value estimate for wide-moat Intel to $70 per share from $65, as we incorporate the stronger near-term performance and outlook. Shares were up during after-hours trading and look fairly valued at current levels.&quot; American Express Charges HigherIntel reported Thursday after the close, leaving American Express (NYSE:AXP) as the lone Dow component delivering earnings today and investors cheered the report, sending the stock higher by 2.81%. That was good enough to make AXP the second-best Dow name today after Intel.American Express said it earned $2.03 a share on revenue of $11.37 billion in the last three months of 2019, slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates calling for earnings of $2.01 on revenue of $11.36 billion.Like Intel, AXP offered strong full year guidance of $8.85 to $9.25 of earnings compared with the consensus estimate of $8.98 per share. It Looked Like a Trade War DayWhile there wasn't wrangling on the trade front today, the group of Dow Jones losers read as though President Trump sent one of his notorious pre-Phase I tweets vilifying China. In other words, the coronavirus plagued a slew of China-sensitive stocks today.That scenario had Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), materials name Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) were among the Dow's worst performers today. Boeing: The Believe It or Not SequelOn another day of challenging headlines, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was tussling with AXP to be the second-best Dow stock today. That's surprising when considering at least one ratings agency sees Boeing's credit rating as vulnerable in the face of ongoing 737 Max delays.&quot;[The delay] will result in a longer period of cash outflows than we expected for 2020, as well as less debt reduction in the latter half of the year because Boeing will deliver fewer aircraft,&quot; said S&P in a note. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayHopefully, China and the other countries affected by the coronavirus are able to limit deaths and a handle on the virus over the near-term because that would be a win for humanity.For the capitalists out there, the virus is clearly affecting markets and markets have other things to contend with, including another earnings avalanche next week. That includes 10 -- a third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- stepping into the earnings confessional.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

It's also the 78.6% retracement from the June low to the recent high.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy For Insulation From Volatility Falling below that puts the 100-day moving average on the table, and potentially the 61.8% retracement near $310. On a rebound, see if SPY can reclaim the 20-day moving average or if it acts as resistance. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Facebook (FB)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) was under pressure Thursday after reporting earnings, and a rally from FANG peer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) wasn't able to generate a sympathy rally, with FB declining again on Friday.Shares are now below prior resistance between $203 to $205, the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). That's not good. If shares lose $200, traders will likely expect a test of the 200-day moving average.If it can work back up to over $205 then FB needs to reclaim the 50-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Luckin Coffee (LK)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comLuckin Coffee (NASDAQ:LK) shares tanked on a short report, but have since rebounding significantly from the lows. And no, today's candle is not a misprint on the chart above.That said, Luckin did lose the $34 level and the 50-day moving average. This name is even dicier due to it being a Chinese business, which is surely going to be impacted by the coronavirus. For many, this makes LK stock a no-touch and understandably so.For those looking at it, though, see how it handles $34 and the 50-day moving average. It will be key to see whether Luckin reclaims these marks or finds them to be resistance. If it's the latter, it puts the $28 to $29 area on watch, which briefly broke on Friday.Below that and $26 remains a notable level. If LK stock falls below all of these marks, investors may want to see where support comes in before getting long as a trade. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Caterpillar (CAT)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock hasn't looked good lately, and Friday's post-earnings action didn't help matters.After shares gapped below $137.50 on Monday, they failed to reclaim this notable area. They have since slipped even lower and on Friday, are losing the 200-day moving average. It seems a little early to call for a decline to $121, but that's what could be in the cards should CAT remain under pressure.On the plus side, that would fill the October gap. Moving above the 200-day keeps $137.50 on the table. But for longs, it's hard to trust CAT below this mark. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a pretty straightforward setup, despite the latest bout of volatility.From here, I would love to see a retest of Monday's low near $232. There it also has uptrend support (blue line) and the 50-day moving average. A drop to this area gives active bulls a reasonable risk/reward dip-buying spot.Falling below that signals that more caution may be needed. On a rebound -- either from current levels or after a retest of this week's low -- see if NVDA can reclaim the 20-day moving average.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-01-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The stock market’s blind optimism is colliding with industrial CEOs’ realism. Caterpillar Inc. and Honeywell International Inc. rounded out a busy week of earnings for the manufacturing sector on Friday, with both companies pointing to a continuing slide in growth in 2020 that flies in the face of expectations for a swift rebound following the signing of the U.S.-China trade deal.“We expect continued global uncertainty” in 2020, Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said in a statement. That will push demand among end-users of its equipment down as much as 9% and encourage dealers to continue chipping away at existing inventory stockpiles rather than replenish them. The company predicted a decline in residential and non-residential construction markets in North America and continued weakness in oil and gas, offset somewhat by a pickup in mining equipment, calls that have wide-reaching implications for much of the industrial sector. Sales in China may decline as much as 5%, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told Bloomberg News. Honeywell’s earnings guidance was in line with analysts’ estimates, but the range was fairly wide for the company, with a 40-cent swing between the best and worst case. Honeywell is “remaining cautious” on the macroeconomic outlook and the risks to its businesses that are among the first to reflect changes in activity. It warned sales may be flat in 2020 after backing out the impact of M&A and currency swings.Honeywell has a history of being conservative, but you’ve heard comments like this from a variety of industrial CEOs over the past few weeks, including CSX Corp.’s Jim Foote, W.W. Grainger Inc.’s DG Macpherson, DuPont de Nemours Inc.’s Marc Doyle and 3M Co.’s Mike Roman. Most are expecting the growth environment to remain lackluster – and for some markets, to get a bit worse – in the first half of the year before improving in the back end. But for many companies, that “improvement” has more to do with easier comparisons than any true demand spike. We’ve also seen this movie before, and forecasts for a back-end-weighted recovery rarely play out as hoped. Heading into the year, CEOs listed the risk of a recession as their top concern for 2020, according to a global Conference Board survey. While the trade deal improved sentiment, corporate profits need to pick back up to drive increased spending, note Bloomberg Economists Andrew Husby and Yelena Shulyatyeva. There are a variety of complicating factors on the horizon, including the U.S. presidential election and potentially the ramifications of the burgeoning coronavirus epidemic. And don’t forget, U.S. tariffs remain in place on some $360 billion of Chinese goods.For now, business investment remains muted, with orders for non-military equipment falling 0.9% in December, excluding aircraft, according to data from the Commerce Department released this week. Arguably, one benefit of elevated stock prices is that buybacks are untenable and that may drive more CEOs to put their money to work on capital investments once the uncertainty clears. Honeywell plans to do both, buying back a minimum of 1% of its shares and spending as much much as $150 million on capital expenditures in 2020. But for industrial companies as a group, earnings gains appear to rely more heavily on continued cost-cutting and productivity improvements rather than true fundamental growth.Caterpillar, which is currently predicting a second straight year-over-year decline in profit, said Friday it has a $200 million placeholder for strategic restructuring and is “prepared to respond quickly to any positive or negative changes in customer demand.” There has also been a troubling increase in below-the-line benefits and earnings adjustments, even at the typically clean Honeywell. Below-the-line items are expected to be as much as a $250 million benefit in 2020, compared with a $57 million drag in 2019, the company said. This impacts perceived quality, notes Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch.And yet investors seem only mildly concerned.  After initially sliding as much as 3.2%, Caterpillar shares were at times little changed and were down only about 1.5% as of mid-morning. Expectations were higher at Honeywell and that stock was down about 2%, but it’s still within spitting distance of an all-time high hit earlier this month. Investors may have the luxury of being more optimistic than CEOs, but I’d listen to the guys who have to make the actual decisions when it comes to hiring and spending. And those guys (yes, they’re all men) are still waving the yellow flag of caution.  To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

Caterpillar shares slipped 1.9% to $132.75 at 9:32 a.m.Profit in the fourth quarter topped analysts’ estimates, with the company citing “strong cost control” as helping to offset its demand issues.“We expect to be sort of flat to down 5% for our business in China, because of general market conditions, competitor positioning and so forth,” Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said in a telephone interview Friday. “It’s a very competitive market, we were down slightly this year, even in an upmarket because of competition. So we got to get out there and fight.”Bonfield said Caterpillar expects U.S. residential and non-residential construction to decline, while investment in state and local infrastructure will be stable. He also said capital spending in mining will continue to increase in 2020, but that the recovery has been “much more slow and steady,” as companies are “maintaining capital discipline.”Caterpillar expects share buybacks in 2020 to be at a “similar level” to those in 2018 and 2019, Bonfield said.The outlook clouds prospects for the company that reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.63 per share, beating the $2.37 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.“Strong cost control more than offset lower-than-expected end-user demand” helping the company report better-the-expected fourth-quarter results, Umpleby said.The company expects the bulk of the inventory drawdown to happen in the first half of the year, Bonfield said on an earnings call with analysts.(Updates shares in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe Richter, Joe RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar’s 2020 Outlook Adds More Gloom to Virus-Shaken Markets

2020-02-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Two of the most recognizable names in U.S. manufacturing are signaling more pain lies ahead for the global economy.Caterpillar Inc. predicted Friday that its 2020 profit will trail analysts’ estimates, while U.S. Steel Corp. reported the worst loss in almost three years and expects similar results this quarter.That’s a blow to markets already reeling from the worsening outbreak of the deadly coronavirus, a factory slump and major cutbacks in corporate spending. It shows how the troubles plaguing the world economy may go deeper than the trade tensions that had dented sentiment through much of last year.“We expect continued global economic uncertainty to pressure sales to users in 2020 and cause dealers to further reduce inventories,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said in a statement.Shares of Caterpillar slid 3% in New York on Friday for a weekly loss of 6.4%, the most since May. U.S. Steel fell 3.5%. An S&P gauge of steel-related companies declined to the lowest since October.While global stocks surged last quarter on hopes that a U.S.-China pact would boost commodity demand and help revive business investment and manufacturing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased its 2020 gains Friday.Caterpillar has been trying to cut costs and trim inventories as demand in some of its main markets trails production. The company’s 2020 outlook signals further headwinds for machine sales, which fell the most in almost three years at the end of last year.The view is consistent with U.S. economic figures showing a dropoff in spending.The U.S. government’s latest tally of fourth-quarter growth showed business nonresidential investment in equipment declined an annualized 2.9% after a 3.8% slump in the previous three months. That marked the worst back-to-back quarters since late 2015-early 2016. Outlays for construction machinery in the fourth quarter were the weakest in more than two years.In the current quarter, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts the coronavirus outbreak will cut American economic growth by 0.4 percentage point.Meanwhile, American steelmakers have faced slowing demand for their products, and U.S. Steel has been particularly hard hit because of aging plants that are less efficient than rivals’ with newer technology. In December, the Pittsburgh-based company said it would shut down most of its Great Lakes Works facility near Detroit and lay off as many as 1,545 workers.Not all of the news was bad from the two producers. U.S. Steel said it expects the first quarter of 2020 to be the “trough” for the year. Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar said that dealers are likely to work down excess inventories in the first half of 2020.&#92;--With assistance from Vince Golle.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Richter in New York at jrichter1@bloomberg.net;Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe Richter, Pratish NarayananFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Manufacturing Titans Portend Gloom for the Global Economy

2020-02-04,"There was plenty of uncertainty to go around today. The coronavirus appears to be getting worse, not better. It's so bad in fact that Macau, the world's largest gambling hub, is closing casinos for two weeks. Here in the U.S., the Iowa Democratic Caucus was hindered by glitches galore and the result still isn't known as of this writing. Markets typically don't like that level of uncertainty, but they bucked that trend today.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 advanced surged 1.50%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.44%.  * The Nasdaq Composite rallied higher by 2.10%.  * File this under a rarity for this space, but in late trading, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was tussling with some other names for top honors in the Dow.Adding to the significance of the U.S. rally today is this interesting factoid: the Nasdaq-100 Index raced to another all-time high despite a roughly 3% post-earnings slide by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), one of the index's marquee components.Obviously, we're discussing U.S. stocks here, but one catalyst for the good fortune to start the week is China being proactive to prop up their markets in the face of the coronavirus epidemic. No, Monday wasn't pleasant for Chinese stocks, but the central bank there has injected almost $243 billion into markets and it's reasonable to expect an interest rate cut beckons.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 28 of 30 Dow stocks were higher, one of the best ratios seen in weeks. Caterpillar CallOn light news, Caterpillar jumped 3.22%. As noted here, the industrial machinery appears poised to raise its dividend again early this year, potentially allaying concerns about cash flow. Following the company's recent fourth-quarter earnings, which was at best a mixed bag, some analysts remain cautious on the name.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends &quot;We believe conservatism is spreading throughout the heavy equipment industry as customers are taking a wait-and-see approach with their capital expenditure investments as uncertainty persists in many geographies,&quot; said Morningstar in a fresh research note. &quot;We believe such a pullback in sales might impede Caterpillar's planned expansion of its aftermarket revenue, and we are reducing our fair value estimate to $156 from $166.&quot; Pleasant SurpriseVisa (NYSE:V) was toward the bottom end of the Dow winners today, but highlights just how strong the index was Tuesday and it's not an indictment of Visa stock, which gained more than 1%.It can be argued that Visa's strength was a pleasant surprise because it's expected that the company will soon unveil significant alterations to its interchange fee program. Some businesses will pay less when they swipe customers' Visa cards, but online retailers are likely to pay more. That could mean more revenue for Visa due to the growth of e-commerce. This Is Getting ConcerningExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) was the worst-performing name in the Dow today, shedding about 1%. That on a day when oil prices rallied and rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX) was among the Dow winners.Today's slide takes Exxon deeper into 10-year low territory and there's an article by Barron's raising concerns about the company's ability to generate enough cash flow to cover its previously sacred dividend. Even if the payout can be sustained, the company would deal a blow to investors by not raising, even modestly. Pre-Earnings RallyDisney (NYSE:DIS) reports earnings after the bell today with Wall Street expecting earnings of $1.46 a share on revenue of $20.783 billion. Under normal circumstances, an update on Disney + would be the issue investors would focus on, but since the company has a theme park in Shanghai, CEO Bog Iger and team will likely need to make some commentary on how the coronavirus is affecting the company. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodaySomething interesting that stood out today was the strength in Dow healthcare stocks. Yes, even UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH).I don't possess a crystal ball, but I suspect the release of the Iowa caucus results coupled with a State of the Union address tonight in which drug prices will almost certainly be mentioned could present some near-term headwinds for the sector. On a related note, Dow component Merck (NYSE:MRK) reports fourth-quarter results before the bell tomorrow.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

A Bernie Bump?With his victory in New Hampshire last night, Sen. Bernie Sanders is -- at least for the moment -- the Democratic front runner. He is a supporter of Medicare For All and that may confuse some investors about why UnitedHealth has recently been steady and soared today.The reason UNH, one of the names most vulnerable to Medicare For All talk, and the market in general may be rising along with Sanders's momentum requires further examination. Strategists for Standard Charter point out in a recent note that if Sanders is the Democratic nominee this year, that increases the odds of President Trump winning a second term, reports Barron's.Sanders is far from a sure bet at this point simply because Michael Bloomberg, the candidate with the deepest pockets, didn't actively campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire. Rather, the former New York mayor is targeting a big delegate haul from the upcoming Super Tuesday primary slate. Let's see how markets react to those outcomes when they arrive early next month. Bad News Becomes Good NewsNike (NYSE:NKE) was in position to be the second-best Dow stock today due to a combination of ebbing coronavirus concerns and a weak earnings report yesterday from rival Under Armour (NYSE:UA).Those are helpful, but fleeting catalysts. Arguably, a better reason for investors to consider Nike is the company's new retail strategy, one that should have longer-ranging, positive implications. Also in the ClubAlong with UnitedHealth and Nike, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was the other Dow component in the 2% or more club today. This is an obvious China-sensitive name and one that has struggled to start 2020 due in large part to the coronavirus issue.The industrial machinery maker was able to reopen its China-based factories a couple of days ago, but the headwind going forward for Caterpillar will be just how much the &quot;Wuhan virus&quot; is going to shave off global economic, particularly in China. Good News Part IISometimes, the mere thought of good news helps a stock and that was the case with Boeing (NYSE:BA) today after Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn raised his price target on the stock to $367 from $321, but he kept his &quot;hold&quot; rating in place. He believes Boeing is entering a &quot;positive news period.&quot;&quot;While nothing material was revealed, the perspectives offered by the company…left us incrementally more constructive on the name,&quot; said Spingarn in a note to clients. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThere are a few more earnings report of note to consider, including Dow component Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) later today and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on Thursday.Clearly, the near-term issues investors need to stay abreast of are the coronavirus because a cure hasn't been found and incremental progress could be set back at a moment's notice.

That raises doubts, including in the White House, that China isn't being entirely forthright with just how bad the situation is there. As a result, stocks meandered Thursday, listlessly drifting between gains and losses.  * The S&P 500 fell 0.16%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.43%.  * The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.14%.  * Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was by far the worst-performing Dow name today, plunging 5.23% after revealing tepid guidance for the current quarter.Overall, these are not dramatic declines considering that it is clear the coronavirus situation is far from resolved. If anything, the scenario may be worsening in China and that presents a potential headwind for riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, with 14 Dow stocks higher in late trading, Thursday wasn't a good day nor was it alarmingly bad. Cisco ConundrumFor tech investors, Cisco just isn't the growth story it once was. Prospects for the networking gear maker partying like it's 1999 again appear grim at this point. The company served up guidance for the current quarter of earnings of 79 cents to 81 cents a share while Wall Street was expecting 80 cents.  * 7 Reasons to Own Taylor Morrison Stock As I noted earlier this month, Cisco feels a lot more like an International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) than a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).What that means is an ultra-conservative investor may like Cisco for buybacks and dividend growth, but don't expect much in the way of capital appreciation over the near-term. Speaking of MicrosoftMicrosoft was trading slightly lower at this writing after Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith approved Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) request for a preliminary injunction on the now controversial $10 billion JEDI contract from the Pentagon.Microsoft, to the surprise of many, particularly Amazon, won that deal and the latter has consistently cried foul since then. Amazon even wants to depose President Trump on the matter.I'm not an attorney or a law professor, but granting the injunction, which halts Microsoft's JEDI work, seems to be a slippery slope. What's to stop any company that loses out on a government contract going forward from pursuing the same action and Campbell-Smith has now established precedent that could encourage sore losers to pursue legal action.There is a $42 million penalty for Amazon should the judge eventually rule the injunction was unnecessary. No, I'm not bearish on Amazon stock. Quite the contrary, but one gets the feeling between the $42 million (assuming it's paid) and legal fees, Amazon could find plenty of better ways to spend capital. Caterpillar AgainCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been getting some run in this space this month and the industrial machinery maker is back again today with good reason.Goldman Sachs upgraded the Dow stock to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral,&quot; while lifting its 12-month price forecast on the stock to $168 from $156. Even at $162, the mid-point of that range, that represents decent upside from today's close around $140. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTaking a break from the intraday conversation, I figured I'd pass along some interesting research I came across that's relevant to owners of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and the other Dow healthcare names.The long and the short of it is, State Street sees opportunity in the group despite this being a presidential election year.&quot;The current negativity towards health care sets the stage for the sector to potentially surprise to the upside, thanks to its fundamental backdrop combined with secular tailwinds,&quot; said State Street in a recent note. &quot;Health care firms are expected to post the strongest earnings and revenue growth in 2019 of any sector, and over the past three months, analysts have been ratcheting up their 2020 earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for the sector.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Tech stock futures fell as traders worked to price in the impact of a revenue shortfall at a company responsible for more than a tenth of the S&P 500’s gain over the last year.While Apple Inc. described the impact of the coronavirus on its sales as “temporary,” slips among big tech companies sit uneasily with investors who have watched many stocks soar 50% or more over the past 12 months. The iPhone maker has a 12% weighting in the Nasdaq 100 Index, which closed last week at 29.4 times annual earnings, the highest in a decade.“This will be an important test,” said Jason Browne, president of Alexis Investment Partners. “Obviously, Apple is a huge weight in major indexes, and one of the most loved companies by investors. That may help as it has generally been better to buy Apple on setbacks than to sell, especially if the market expects the disruption to be temporary.”March contracts on the S&P 500 fell 0.3% as of 10:35 a.m. in Tokyo. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 lost 0.5%. Exchange trading of individual U.S. shares has been closed since Friday for the Presidents’ Day holiday. Both the tech-heavy Nasdaq and Apple itself are already up more than 10% in 2020, after an 86% rally in Apple last year pushed the gauge to its best performance since 2009.In a Monday release, Apple said it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus in China. The company had forecast revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion for the fiscal second quarter ending in March. Analysts on average estimated $65.23 billion.Equity traders face a difficult task in determining how much of the weakness is specific to Apple and whether to project the shortfall on the broader market. The company has always been likely to fare worse given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China. At the same time, the sales warning is one of the most tangible examples of impact on a U.S. company and Apple’s size makes it capable of swaying indexes by itself.“My gut says I think the market probably expects this to some extent, and we know this market tends to look though things pretty well,” said Nathan Thooft, Manulife Asset Management’s head of global asset allocation. “People had anticipation that some of these companies would be affected by what was going on there and they certainly knew there were closures and supply chain issues.”While no rally is straight up, the one that has swollen Apple’s market value by as much as $545 billion since early August comes close, with only three down weeks in 21. The iPhone maker received 18% of its revenue from China in fiscal year 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show, enough to keep analysts worried about the longer-term consequences of the outbreak.Apple’s news will have ramifications for a long list of semiconductors and other suppliers around the world. Its announcement came hours after Dow Jones reported that President Trump’s administration is considering new trade restrictions that would limit the use of U.S. equipment to produce chips for China’s Huawei Technologies Co.“Of all the big companies exposed to China this announcement seemed the most inevitable,” Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co, said by email. “What will this do to the market? It will remind investors that the risks surrounding the coronavirus are still unknown and unquantifiable. There will likely be an increase in volatility this week.”Apple’s most famous profit warning came in November 2018 amid the U.S. stock market’s worst stretch since the financial crisis. Its shares tumbled 7.1% on Nov. 2, 2018, after reporting stagnant iPhone sales and forecasting revenue for the holiday quarter that fell short of Wall Street expectations at the midpoint.

2020-02-18,"(Bloomberg) -- For the second time in as many years, Apple Inc. has had to temper its sales outlook because of unexpected shifts in China, the country that’s served as the engine of its growth and success. First a trade war with the U.S. and now the outbreak of a novel coronavirus have called into question China’s role as a reliable market and supply chain partner for the world’s most valuable maker of consumer electronics.The coronavirus that’s stifled China’s meticulously orchestrated production and logistics has hit both Apple’s supply and demand -- factories are resuming work slower than expected, the company announced, and most of its 42 stores in the country lie dormant -- illustrating how heavily exposed its business is to disruptions in the world’s most populous country. A fall in sales within China is likely to be the most immediate impact this quarter, while widespread production bottlenecks there risk hurting global iPhone revenue in subsequent months.Amid its coronavirus troubles, Apple has been preparing to launch a new low-cost iPhone at around $400, Bloomberg News has reported. The model is still on track to launch in March, though the plans are still fluid, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple has also been preparing updated iPad Pro models with a new camera system for the first half of 2020 and the virus may yet impose delays or constraints on those plans.Apple Won’t Meet Quarterly Revenue Target Due to CoronavirusUpon joining the company in the late 1990s, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook transformed Apple’s supply chain into the efficient juggernaut that’s been the longtime envy of the industry. Products are manufactured in China with the help of low-cost, but skilled, labor and shipped around the world in a matter of days. Relying on Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group to run on-the-ground operations and China’s abundant investment in transport to ensure logistics, Apple has become a trillion-dollar company largely by selling made-in-China iPhones, iPads, Macs and accessories.Responsible for millions of jobs in the country, Cook’s Apple has also garnered enough goodwill with the Chinese government to gain access to its market that is unmatched among U.S. tech heavyweights. Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are looking in from the outside, whereas Apple can sell all of its gadgets there. The Cupertino, California firm brings in more than $40 billion per year from Greater China, shy only of its takings from the U.S. and Europe. This strength is also the source of Apple’s vulnerability.On Monday, Apple cut its earnings guidance for the quarter ending Mar. 31, which was already wider than usual because of the unpredictability of the coronavirus fallout. U.S. stock index futures and shares in Apple suppliers from Japan to Hong Kong fell after the outlook warning kindled concerns about the damage the epidemic is causing global corporations and the Apple ecosystem. Last year, the company adjusted earnings because of a shortfall in iPhone demand in China, which it blamed in part on the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing.Production snarls at Apple’s main iPhone-making base of Zhengzhou may extend well into the June quarter and possibly beyond. Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. only started seasonal recruitment on Monday, weeks behind schedule, and it’s been severely hindered by new policies intended to curb the spread of Covid-19 on campus. One recruiter, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Bloomberg News that the company was only hiring new workers from the local Zhengzhou area, tightening restrictions and eliminating the vast majority of available labor pool.Implementing a rolling quarantine of up to 14 days for returning workers from more distant provinces, Foxconn faces additional challenges in managing the movement of untold numbers of staff. In Shenzhen, as many as 10 workers are packed in each dorm room as they endure their assigned sequester period. The available beds are running short as a growing number of workers travel back, according to one person who helped arrange the program.‘Nightmare’ for Global Tech: Virus Fallout Is Just BeginningVirus contagion has shuttered plants across China for weeks longer than anticipated after the Lunar New Year break, and the nightmare scenario feared by Foxconn and its ilk is the infection spreading across factory floors, which could potentially freeze parts of the supply chain and trigger cascading shortages. Apple’s facilities have all reopened, said the U.S. firm, but evidence on the ground suggests they’re still far from fully operational.Existing iPhone inventories at retailers will soften the immediate blow of slower manufacturing, but analysts anticipate worldwide shortages will follow, extending the impact of the present disruption.“I expect we’re going to start seeing iPhone shortages outside of China, which plays into the guidance,” said Apple analyst Shannon Cross from Cross Research. “In theory, it shouldn’t be demand destructive. It should just mean there should be a larger backlog of demand when these issues are resolved.”The immediate reaction to Apple’s forecast cut has been a drag on Asian tech shares, especially those of suppliers to the company. But some impact on Apple was already widely anticipated.Tech Investors Jolted by Apple Pin Hopes on a Fast Turnaround“We’ve been getting nothing but headlines about the virus for weeks. Starbucks is closing its stores, Caterpillar is shutting its facilities. Company after company has been saying this,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, said by phone, expressing investor optimism for a fast turnaround. “We have been expecting bad sales headlines, this isn’t good, but it’s not surprising.” (Caterpillar closed its plants in China at the beginning of February at the direction of the Chinese government. It is re-opening them as the government allows; currently most are open.)Moving entirely out of China would be practically impossible for Apple in the short term, given the scale of its established network and the country’s incomparable ability to mobilize a workforce of millions. Similarly strong disruption threats to its supply chain arose in 2018 and 2019, largely spurred by trade war conflagrations, but Cook’s team has held steadfast in its commitment to the region and hasn’t shown any significant momentum toward a major move out.“Apple’s supply chain in China is so tight and large, it would be difficult to replicate outside the region,” Cross said. “I think you’ll continue to see small expansions into India, but the vast majority of production will remain in China.”Apple has indicated that its overall business is still strong, saying that it remained on track revenue-wise in regions outside of China for both products and services. The company is engaged in a long-term diversification shift that’s seen it pour billions of dollars into creating its own streaming content for Apple TV+ and building out subscription services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. Its strongest step to reduce its China dependence to date has been this move to be less reliant on pure hardware sales for the bulk of its revenue.Addressing the wider smartphone industry in China, Strategy Analytics this month projected a significant hit to shipments in the first half of 2020, to be followed by a recovery and a slight increase in shipments in the closing months of the year. If Apple follows a similar trajectory, it could see iPhone demand shift into later quarters rather than vanishing entirely.“I think Apple remains in a very good position long-term,” Cross said. “I would assume there would be some pressure on the stock, but assuming this is a short term bump in the road, investors will look through it.”(Updates with comment from Caterpillar in 13th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Joe Deaux.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Outlook Cut Renews Questions About China Over-Reliance

2020-02-19,"The overall news regarding the US economy has been good, there’s no doubt about that. Annualized growth was 2.3% in 2019, which was nothing to write home about but still indicative of expansion. The January 2020 jobs report showed an expanding labor market as more job hunters looked for work, along with upwards revisions to the December and November numbers.However, buried in all of the data, there were some warning signs related to manufacturing. PMI, the purchasing managers index, used as an indicator for future manufacturing growth, was down for the third month in a row, although the 51.9 reading beat the 51.7 expectation. It also doesn’t help that industrial output is down year-over-year.President Trump’s ‘trade war’ policy towards China gets much of the blame for the downward trend in industry. The US and Chinese economies, the world’s first and second largest, are interconnected in a complex web of imports, exports, and reimports, as companies manufacture parts, ship them, put them together into final products, and export those for sale. The Phase 1 agreement between the two governments, promising relief from trade dispute and tariff pressures, gave hope for an industrial and manufacturing recovery. The coronavirus outbreak in China, however, with its quarantines and travel disruptions, is threatening to set back this major sector.Goldman Sachs analyst Jerry Revich, in a major report on industrial stocks, sees potential for a general sector turnaround. He argues leading indicators for US machinery production are rising, along with increases in construction equipment inventories. Making use of the TipRanks database and Stock Comparison tool, we have taken a closer look at three of Revich’s more interesting industrial stock picks.Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT)Caterpillar, long a staple of the Dow Jones index, is known worldwide by its famous yellow logo, and the name ‘Cat’ is instantly recognizable in construction industry. The company manufactures heavy excavation and construction equipment, from bulldozers to excavators and everything in between, and its vehicles are found around the world. The general slowdown in 2H18 was hard on the company, and CAT stock had difficulty regaining traction through most of a volatile 2019. But in Q4, the shares began to gain again.The company reported mixed results in Q4. EPS was $2.63 for the fourth quarter, beating the forecast by 11%, and more importantly, gaining 3% year-over-year. This compares especially well to the Q3 results, which missed expectations by almost 6%. The gains in earnings came even as revenue missed the estimates. Furthermore, CAT has a long history – over 15 years – of maintaining and growing its dividend payment. The current payment, $1.03 per quarter, annualizes to $4.12 and gives a yield of 2.99%. For context, dividend yields average about 2% on the S&P 500, so CAT’s is 50% higher – and it is almost double the yield of US Treasury bonds. With a payout ratio of only 39%, this dividend is secure for the foreseeable future.Back in August, Goldman Sachs' Revich set a Hold on CAT stock. He has since changed his tune, and upgraded this stock from Neutral to Buy. Revich, says, backing his new rating, “We see a combination of (i) tightening US construction equipment capacity utilization, (ii) dealer inventories and backlog approaching trough levels, and (iii) margin tailwinds in 2021 from reduced restructuring and inventory destock.”In line with his Buy rating, Revich put a $168 price target on CAT, implying a 12-month upside of 23%. (To watch Revich’s track record, click here)Like many industrial stocks, CAT has mixed reviews from Wall Street’s analysts. With 6 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell, CAT shares get a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock is currently trading for $137, and the $155.09 average price target suggests room for 13.55% upside growth. (See Caterpillar stock analysis on TipRanks)Cummins, Inc. (CMI)While not a household name, Cummins is a major supplier in heavy industry. The company specializes in engines and ancillary components for heavy vehicles. Its products are split into several categories, including – among others – engines, power systems, filtrations systems (for engine components), and emission solutions.Cummins’ earnings declined through 2019, but Q4 showed an important gain – it beat the both earnings and revenues estimate by wide margins. Top line revenues came in at $5.58 billion, 4.5% over the forecast. While down year-over-year, the revenues supported EPS of $2.56, 5.8% better than expected. In the days since the Q4 release, CMI shares have gained 3.5%.Like CAT above, CMI slipped in 2H18, and was volatile in 2019. The stock is up 12.5% in the last 12 months, however, in a general indication of investor confidence. That confidence is smoothed along by the CMI dividend, which is even stronger than CAT’s. CMI pays out $5.24 annually, or $1.31 per quarter; the 51% payout ratio indicates a sustainable commitment to sharing profits with stakeholders. The yield, at 3.14%, is double that of Treasury bonds and well above the average in the broader markets. CMI has raised the payment 3 times in the last three years.This stock is Revich’s second major industrial upgrade. He has bumped the rating up from Neutral to Buy, and set a $200 price target, suggesting a robust upside of 20%.Defending his decision to upgrade Cummins, Revich points out favorable trends in the trucking industry, which in his view outweigh risks from exposure to Asian markets: “We believe i) US truck leading indicators have inﬂected, ii) estimates have been de-risked following 2020 guidance that embeds a 40% US Truck production cut, and iii) sentiment on vertical integration risk has turned overly negative, in our view.”CMI’s analyst reviews show another deep split, this one with 4 Buys versus 8 Holds. The aggregate is a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $187 indicates a 13% upside from the share price of $166. (See Cummins stock analysis at TipRanks)AGCO Corporation (AGCO)The third stock on our list, AGCO, is the one that Goldman Sachs says to avoid. AGCO is a major manufacturer of agricultural equipment, and owns several well-known brands in the segment: Challenger, Massey Ferguson, and Fend, among others. The company’s products include a wide range of tractors, combines, hay tools, and sprayers, and are mainly marketed to large-scale farms. AGCO has a $5 billion market cap and a worldwide customer base.It also has seen earnings slip badly in 2H19. While the first half of last year saw quarterly reports rise sequentially and beat the estimates, the second half saw an opposite trend. Q4 was particularly bad in that respect, with the 94-cent EPS missing estimates by 39%. Revenue dropped sequentially from $2.59 billion to $2.51 billion, a 3% fall, and missed the quarterly forecast by 5.6%. Shares are down 8.6% since the earnings release.With earnings falling, investor would normally look to the dividend for relief, but AGCO gives minimal relief there. The dividend, at just 64 cents annually, yields only 0.96%, less than half the average among S&P listed companies. Even Treasury bonds, at near-historic lows of just 1.5%, are offer a better yield at present than AGCO shares.Revich, writing for Goldman on this stock, does not pull punches. He describes this company’s path forward as “unclear,” and downgrades the shares from Buy to Neutral. His 12-month price target of $70 implies a minimal upside of 4.8%.In his comments on the stock, Revich highlights the risks that AGCO faces in the South American markets. He writes, “[O]ur belief that ag equipment share of farmer capex is still in the process of bottoming, coupled with the increasingly tightening levels of used ag equipment inventory, makes us view the ag end-market as well positioned for growth in the coming quarters. However, on a micro level, we no longer feel comfortable underwriting a margin recovery in South America where AGCO continues to face further risk of share loss.” (To watch Revich’s track record, click here)Overall, AGCO is another Moderate Buy on the analyst consensus. The stock has 5 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell set in recent weeks. Shares are selling for $66.76, and the average target, $79.50, remains more bullish than Revich’s, suggesting a 19% upside.

China is struggling to get its economy back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain the virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year, which has so far killed over 2,100 in China and spread globally.

Conversely, none of the winners were up 1%. Coke And CoronavirusBefore jumping into Friday's tech wreck, let's have a look at Dow component Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). The defensive stock was up about half a percent in late trading, but investors may do well to not be deceived here.The company became the latest to warn that the novel coronavirus will affect its earnings, warning of a modest impact to first-quarter results. Fortunately, the soft drink giant said it still expects to earn $2.25 a share this year.That's likely the reason why Coca-Cola traded higher today. That and its status as a defensive name. Including Coca-Cola, three of the Dow's four consumer staples residents were in the green today. Usual SuspectsAlthough company-specific news for many of the following names was light to non-existent today, China-sensitive names such as Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were among the Dow's worst offenders.In fact, all of the Dow's technology constituents traded lower today. The only Dow Jones stock with significant China exposure that was higher, and only modestly so, was Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). That was more a sympathy play on Deere & Company's (NYSE:DE) strong earnings report than anything else. Visa VexedVisa (NYSE:V) couldn't escape the tech carnage today, though there was one encouraging news item out on the name. Brazilian state-controlled bank Caixa Economica Federa is working with Visa on credit and debit cards in that country. That bank issues 109.3 million of those cards and Brazil is Latin America's largest economy. Speaking of Credit CardsAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) was another Dow offender and this is very much a coronavirus-to-blame situation. With global travel expected to slump due to the virus, AXP could be pinched.AXP is one of Warren Buffett's &quot;big four&quot; holdings and the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) annual shareholder letter, always widely anticipated, is due out this weekend, so there could be some AXP commentary in there. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayBeyond the coronavirus, there's another issue that could act as a headwind for stocks: they're getting expensive as John Butters of FactSet points out.&quot;The forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.0 on February 19 was above the four most recent historical averages for the S&P 500: five-year (16.7), 10-year (14.9), 15-year (14.6), and 20-year (15.5),&quot; said Butters in a note. &quot;In fact, this marked the first time the forward 12- month P/E had been equal to (or above) 19.0 since May 23, 2002 (19.1).&quot;Of course, equities can get pricey and continue climbing, but a more sanguine environment than one riddled by fatal illnesses is probably necessary for that to happen.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Mentioning that duo as it relates to the coronavirus is relevant due to the China supply chain issues these companies are facing.&quot;The spread of the coronavirus in China is credit negative for US semiconductor companies that generate a large portion of revenues from sales to Chinese manufacturers or depend on end market demand from Chinese consumers,&quot; said Moody's Investors Service. Maybe, But Not YetThere was some chatter that some industrial stocks could be avenues for waiting out the coronavirus issue and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) got a nice write-up from Barron's, which noted the stock is inexpensive. However, that stock along with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) each closed lower today. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTo quantify how bad things were for the Dow on Monday, none of its components finished in the green, none of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher and the days best-performing assets were standard safe havens, such as gold and municipal bonds. That's to be expected on a day that was the worst for the S&P 500 in two years.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- In a further indication of the stress rippling through the construction and mining sectors, Caterpillar Inc. reported its biggest decline in global machine sales since the end of 2016.The report underlines how the coronavirus outbreak is putting a drag on the industries that Caterpillar supplies. Fears about the virus’s impact on global growth have helped send shares of the economic bellwether down 38% this year, off to its worst start since 2009.The downbeat mood in the industry permeated ConExpo, the largest construction convention in North America. In remarks at the Las Vegas gathering this week, Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said the coronavirus hasn’t yet caused major supply snags, and the company was focusing on executing the plan set in place when he first took over as CEO.But Umpleby didn’t offer much detail on how the worldwide move to stamp out the virus will change prospects for the business.“Our guidance was based on the best information that we had at the time, and if we have any changes to that we’ll do it when we put out our first-quarter results,” Umpleby said in an interview.In February, Caterpillar said its machine sales dropped 11% on a rolling three-month period. Isolating the Asia-Pacific region, the sales fell 17%, the largest drop in four years.Oil and gas retail sales fell 3%, marking a sixth straight month of declines in the segment. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said Wednesday that oil-market tumult from the past week will impact the oil and gas business, but said that it’s still too early to tell how strong that may be.Caterpillar fell 8.4% to $92.26 Thursday in New York, the lowest close since March 2017.To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Posts Worst Machine Sales Since 2016

2020-03-13,"(Bloomberg) -- It can’t be an easy time to be a Chinese factory owner. At the turn of this year, with a trade deal with the U.S. about to be signed, the future looked brighter. The global economy seemed to be stabilizing, and the great slowdown in China was under control. Then the coronavirus erupted in Wuhan, and the world changed again.A painstaking process of restarting production after weeks of shutdowns across the country is making progress, according to a range of energy, travel and output indicators.For example, demand for coal to make electricity this week was the highest it’s been since Jan. 21, but it’s still about 20% below where it was this time last year or in 2018.Bloomberg Economics estimates that the Chinese economy was operating at 80% to 85% of normal capacity as of Friday.But the workshop of the world looks to get walloped again. The global economy is shutting down by the day, as the viral outbreak spreads to China’s biggest customers — the developed markets of Europe and the U.S.Manufacturing companies across China told Bloomberg News that the emerging challenge now is demand, not supply. “We are actually more worried about the development of the epidemic in Europe and the U.S., which will affect their domestic consumption,” says Mark Ma, owner of Seabay International Freight Forwarding Ltd. in Shenzhen.The double whammy means China is facing its first quarterly economic contraction in decades and the weakest year since the early 1990s.“The feedback loop is emerging,” said Trinh Nguyen, Hong Kong-based senior economist at Natixis. “As China recovers and resumes its supply chains, it will be hit by demand shocks from its own subdued demand and an increasingly infected world.”Charting the Trade WarToday’s Must ReadsNorth of the border | Canadian officials are looking for reassurance from the U.S. that the border between the countries will remain open despite fears over the spread of coronavirus.

2020-03-16,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average came 400 points of falling to the 20,000 mark Monday, and even after a minor rebound, the index is still down a massive 2,000 points, or more than 9%.Two Dow components were standing out amid the wreckage: Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA).Caterpillar Upgraded Caterpillar's stock opened Monday morning at $89 and not only regained all of its losses, but traded as high as $105.85. By Monday afternoon, the stock was down 0.35% at $99.29. The stock was supported by an upgrade from Stifel analysts who turned bullish. Analyst Stanley Elliott upgraded Caterpillar from Neutral to Buy with a price target lowered from $140 to $137.Many of Caterpillar's markets are either &quot;stabilizing or have returned to growth&quot; after a few years of poor performance, the analyst said, according to TheStreet.Despite some near-term concerns, the company's longer-term picture is backed by a commitment to grow dividends through 2023 and and to conduct share buybacks, the analyst said.

2020-03-16,"Monday's really are the worst for equities as of late. For those that thought last Monday was bad, and it was, today was no better, as all three major domestic equity benchmarks plunged despite the Federal Reserve taking substantial action to shore up the economy.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 plunged 11.99%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 12.94%  * The Nasdaq Composite slid 12.32%  * For those that aren't tired of hearing bad news about Boeing (NYSE:BA), rest assured Monday brought more of the same as the stock was the Dow's worst performer by a wide margin, slumping 21%.As was the case earlier this month, stocks swooned following an epic Federal Reserve announcement: on Sunday March 15, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut interest rates to near zero while unveiling a massive bond buying scheme.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent,&quot; said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in a statement. &quot;The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.&quot;  * 7 Drowning Energy Stocks to Avoid for Now Monday's price action suggests equities weren't thrilled by the news, as all 30 of the Dow stocks were lower in late trading and only Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was sporting a loss of less than 1%. Boeing BadnessWith the aforementioned slide, all the positive returns accrued during prior CEO Dennis Muilenburg's time at Boeing have been erased. Analysts are growing concerned about the company's cash flow and there's essentially no vision as to when the 737 Max passenger jet will return to the skies.Making matters worse is Fitch Ratings putting Boeing and Boeing Capital Corporation on &quot;Rating Watch Negative,&quot; a distinction they see as &quot;reflecting the impact coronavirus is having on the aviation sector:&quot;Boeing's debt nearly doubled in 2019 to $27.3 billion as a result of $10.5 billion of long-term debt issuance and several billion dollars of CP issuance. Debt will continue to rise in 2020, potentially peaking at more than $40 billion, which is higher than Fitch's previous estimate. In late 2020 and throughout 2021, Fitch expects Boeing will pay down debt and reduce much of its CP balance.&quot; Slammed by the FedDue to interest rates being low for a long time in the U.S. and the three rate cuts last year, investors have long been hearing about sectors that favor lower rates, namely real estate and utilities. However, there are groups that are responsive to higher rates, namely financial services.With that in mind, Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) was the second-worst Dow stock today, because lower rates make it hard to generate returns on the large sums of cash insurance companies hold.To that end, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was also saddled with a double-digit loss while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was flirting with entry to that dubious club. Not-So-Golden ArchesPerhaps you're hearing about the coronavirus-induced phenomenon known as social distancing. Admittedly, I'm offering up an over simplified definition, but it basically means to stay as far away from other people as possible due to the virus.As one might expect, this is terrible news for restaurant operators, highlighted by McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) ranking among the Dow's worst offenders today.Large restaurant stocks, including McDonald's, have been sturdy, relatively speaking, compared to the broader discretionary sector and could offer some buffer with their booming delivery businesses, but it's still probably too early to get involved with this group today or tomorrow or anytime soon. Theory of the DayNeither Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) nor Disney (NYSE:DIS) has been immune to the March market punishment, but an old rumor involving the companies got some new life today when Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan floated the idea of Apple pouncing upon Disney following the latter's recent share price retrenchment.In terms of Wall Street rumors, this one is ancient. Outgoing Disney CEO Bob Iger even said in a biography published in 2011 that had late Apple CEO Steve Jobs not passed away, there was a strong chance the two California-based behemoths would have considered a marriage or at least discussed it.Based on Disney's market capitalization after the close today and assuming a somewhat decent premium, an offer in the ballpark of $200 billion would probably be what it takes to get the company to the bargaining table. For those keeping score at home, Apple's largest ever acquisition was Beats for $3 billion in 2014. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThere are some unpleasant facts for investors to mull over today. For example, at its nadir earlier today, the the S&P 500's recent weakness meant all of 2019's gains were erased. Second, many market observers decried the Fed move to almost zero because now, as has long been feared, there's little more the central bank can do to help markets and the economy.Some market observers are throwing in the towel on year-end S&P 500 forecasts while others are saying a decline to 2,000 could be what's needed to end this bear market.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

That accounts for almost half the outbreak nationwide, according to data collected by Bloomberg.New Jersey and California also saw large increases in patients, and smaller hot spots in states like Michigan and Illinois began to grow more quickly.Italian health officials reported 6,153 new cases Thursday, the most in five days, bringing the country’s total to 80,539. The outbreak in mainland China remains the largest globallyWashington’s New Cases Slow (3 p.m. NY)Washington state has seen a drop in the rate of new cases being reported, Governor Jay Inslee said at a press conference, led by improvement in three counties in near Seattle where the outbreak began a month ago. Other counties aren’t seeing the pace of new cases slow, he said.While hospitals are not yet full, the state -- which ranks fourth in U.S. cases -- needs to see a significant further reduction in cases in order to avoid running out of beds and equipment in the coming days, he said.“We should not be within 10,000 miles of champagne corks on this,” Inslee said. Without further decreases to the case count “a lot of people in the state of Washington are going to die.”Inslee called for a national system for buying personal protective equipment and other supplies in order to use the federal government’s buying power and avoid putting Washington in a “mad scramble” with all the other states for supplies.U.K. Helps Self-Employed Workers (2:30 p.m. NY)The U.K. government offered self-employed workers cash grants of as much as 2,500 pounds ($3,040) a month.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced the three-month plan, at a cost the Treasury estimates will be about 9 billion pounds, after his offer last week to pay a portion of citizens’ wages was widely criticized for omitting self-employed workers.About 95% of self-employed workers, 3.8 million people, will be eligible for the grants, Sunak said.Full story here.Latin Bank Offers Aid (2:30 p.m. NY)The Inter-American Development Bank will make $12 billion available to countries for responding to the crisis and its aftermath.

This ranking will help local officials decide on maintaining, increasing or relaxing social distancing and other measures, the president said in a letter to U.S. governors.“Americans across the country are hoping the day will soon arrive when they can resume their normal economic, social and religious lives,” Trump wrote in the letter released by the White House.Read the full story hereItaly Virus Cases Rise, Fueled by Lombardy (1:11 p.m. NY)Italy reported its biggest rise in coronavirus infections in the past five days, as the disease spread further in the northern Lombardy region, even after weeks of rigid lockdown rules.The civil protection agency reported 6,153 new cases on Thursday, up from 5,210 a day earlier.Fatalities from the outbreak over the past 24 hours totaled 662, down from 683 for the previous day, according to figures provided at the agency’s daily news conference on Thursday.

Until the outbreak is under control, Cuomo said officials are focused on reducing the rate of increase, not the reducing the number of cases, so hospitals don’t run out of beds.New York added almost 6,500 cases, for a total of more than 37,000.China Blocks Foreigners (11:55 a.m. NY)China will temporarily suspend the entry of foreigners starting Saturday as cases worldwide surge, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and National Immigration Administration said on its website.China has to take “necessary and temporary” measures in response to the current coronavirus situation, using practices of various countries as reference, the agencies said.

President Hassan Rouhani warned of a second surge of the disease after new cases surged followed the holiday period.Emergency services and cargo vehicles are exempt from the travel ban, the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Iran’s police chief as saying.Europe Shies Away from Retooling Production for Gear (9:36 a.m. NY)The European Union signaled that efforts to increase the supply of medical gear will involve ramping up existing production capacity.

The test is intended to be administered at the point of care and delivers results within 15 minutes from a pinprick with no instrumentation required.Earlier, Robert Bosch GmbH said it developed a test that can diagnose Covid-19 in less than 2.5 hours. The new test uses the Vivalytic molecular diagnostics platform made by Bosch’s healthcare division, used in hospitals, laboratories and medical practices. Patients typically must wait one or two days before they get test results.Separately, U.K.-based Mologic Ltd. has sent prototypes of a 10-minute coronavirus test to laboratories for validation before it can begin full-scale manufacturing.

That financing package is now with TUI’s lending banks, which are expected to sign off in the coming days, they said.BOE Warns of Long-Term Damage; Holds Rates (8 a.m. NY)The Bank of England left rates unchanged, but said it’s ready to provide more support for the economy after warning that a very sharp reduction in activity was likely.

He said “we would tend to listen to the experts” on when normal activity should resume and added that the virus would dictate the timetable.Spain Reports Fewer Deaths, Cases Surge (6:32 a.m. NY)Total cases rose to 56,188 from 47,610 and fatalities jumped by 655, fewer than on Wednesday, to 4,089. Hospitals in the country are struggling to cope with the surge.Europe Accounts for 7 out of 10 Virus Deaths, WHO Says (6:20 a.m. NY)The number of cases tripled in the past week in Europe, with the disease spreading faster in Spain, France, Germany and Switzerland, Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s director for Europe, said at a press briefing in Copenhagen. Italy’s infection rate has slowed slightly, but it’s too early to say the disease has peaked there, he said. The country has 6,200 infected health-care workers, he added.Kluge said Europe needs to attack the disease in solidarity, because if the European Union manages to fight it but it takes hold in eastern Europe, it will just come back.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Is Poised to Top China With Most Infections: Virus Update

That despite a 17% rally by the benchmark equity gauge over the prior seven days.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 lost 1.60%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.84%  * The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.95%  * American Express (NYSE:AXP) capped a tumultuous quarter, falling 4.94% today, after the company said Monday it won't be laying off workers this year, but it's implementing a hiring freeze.One point of emphasis for investors on Tuesday was Congressional plans for a fourth round of coronavirus-related stimulus and what form that could take. These talks come as Americans wait on their $1,200 checks from Uncle Sam.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPerhaps the next round of stimulus will include the infrastructure sector, for which President Trump is pushing $2 trillion in spending. That's double his $1 trillion pledge on the 2016 campaign trail and reports of the new pitch out Tuesday could explain why Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was the Dow's best-performing name today.  * 7 Strong Stocks to Buy to Survive the Coronavirus Crisis Speaking of Dow winners, those were in short supply Tuesday as just seven of the 30 members of the index were higher in late trading. Maybe The Worst Is OverDow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) is one of the smallest stocks in the index of the same name. It has been one of the worst offenders in the first quarter, but the chemical maker delivered one of the better showings in the blue-chip benchmark on Tuesday, gaining 2.72%.Chemical stocks are highly cyclical and, as such, can be pretty good recession indicators. The stocks, including Dow, are pricing in that scenario, prompting some analysts to say enough is enough as there is value in the group. Gloomy CommentaryBroadly speaking, the technology sector was less bad than the broader market in the first quarter, but the group wasn't perfect and there are muddle expectations for how the S&P 500's largest sector weight will perform over the next two quarters.Speaking of expectations, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) traded lower today after Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard cut his price target on the semiconductor giant to $60 from $70, noting he's not enthusiastic about chip makers in the second half of 2020.&quot;We also expect that declining PC unit volume will create excess capacity at Intel pressuring margins,&quot; said the analyst. Dividend ReliefOil put the finishing touches on its second-worst quarterly performance ever and for those that are following the energy sector, you know that there are plenty of concerns about Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and its dividend.Morgan Stanley energy analyst Devin McDermott said today that XOM will pay its 2020 dividend with cash from operations. That's the good news. The bad news is that the company will fund its exploration and production budget with debt.Earlier this month Exxon said it was going to spend $33 billion on exploration and production this year, but McDermott said that number is likely to decline to $25 billion given low oil prices. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThe calendar changes to April tomorrow and whether or not that brings better things for equities remains to be seen, but the fourth month of the year is historically kind to stocks.However, the other issue is the start of first-quarter earnings and just how bad 2020 forecasts can get. In fact, John Butters of FactSet notes it's all but assured the S&P 500 will post a year-over-year earnings contraction in 2020.&quot;During the past week, the aggregate earnings growth rate for CY 2020 changed from slight year-over-year earnings growth on March 24 (+0.6%) to a slight year-over-year earnings decline on March 25 (less than -0.1%),&quot; he said.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus crisis is hitting executive pay at one of America’s most iconic companies.Caterpillar Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby, other senior executives, management and salaried workers will not get a base-pay increase in 2020 as part of the company’s efforts to cut costs during the coronavirus pandemic. They also won’t receive the payout outlined under an annual incentive plan.“These decisions are difficult and were not made lightly, but we must act with a sense of urgency to respond to this extremely challenging situation created by the pandemic,” Caterpillar spokeswoman Kate Kenny said in an email.The decision comes less than a week after the Deerfield, Illinois-based machinery producer pulled its 2020 outlook and announced the suspension of some operations, saying it doesn’t have clarity on how the pandemic will affect its business. Caterpillar earlier confirmed it laid off employees at its East Peoria building KK as part of actions taken to reduce production due to weaker customer demand.“We have faced and overcome many challenges during our 95-year history,” Umpleby said in a note to employees announcing the cuts. “Working together, I am confident we will emerge even stronger after the impact of the pandemic subsides.”Shares of the company rose 3.9% in New York after surging more than 10% last week, the biggest advance since November 2018 amid speculation that a government stimulus package would help bring stability to a market reeling from impact of the virus.While the cut to pay is noteworthy, the company hasn’t announced whether it will eliminate the dividend it pays to investors.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Executive Pay Frozen as Part of Efforts to Cut Costs

Consequently, they are top stocks to buy if you believe an economic recovery is around the corner.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2020: Get Ready for a Roller Coaster Ride in Q2 In no particular, the top 5 stocks to buy for a potential economic recovery are:  * Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)  * Chipotle (NYSE:CMG)  * Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN)  * Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)  * Uber (NYSE:UBER) Top Stocks to Buy for an Economic Recovery: Caterpillar (CAT)Source: Shutterstock What Goldman Sachs Thinks: Goldman Sachs likes Caterpillar's 4.3% dividend yield. They also believe that rising technology content in industrial and manufacturing equipment creates multi-year revenue tailwinds for Caterpillar's business.All together, Goldman thinks that the long-term bull thesis on CAT stock is quite compelling, and that an economic recovery will once again shine a favorable light on this long-term bull thesis.What I Think: As goes capital spending, so goes the industrial economy, and so goes Caterpillar's business. Today, capital spending is depressed because economic activity has come to a standstill. But, companies are sitting on record high cash levels, with borrowing and spending costs as cheap as they've been, ever.So, once the virus passes and economic activity normalizes, big businesses have ample ammunition to significantly re-accelerate capital spending, the likes of which should power a rebound in the industrial economy and CAT stock. Chipotle (CMG)Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com What Goldman Sachs Thinks: Goldman Sachs appreciates Chipotle's robust digital and delivery infrastructure and capabilities.The analyst team believes that these advantages will: 1) help the company weather the coronavirus storm through enhanced delivery, and 2) consolidate share if/when restaurant spending trends recover.What I Think: I agree entirely with Goldman Sachs. Chipotle is &quot;ahead of the curve&quot; in the restaurant industry when it comes to its digital footprint and omni-channel capabilities. Such advantages do position the company for better-than-expected growth in Q2, and robust growth once the economy normalizes.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week Simultaneously, it's important to note that CMG stock has fallen to valuation levels (3.2-times forward sales) which are cheap by historical standards for this stock, and under-appreciate the company's long-term profit growth potential. Regeneron (REGN)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com What Goldman Sachs Thinks: Alongside many other analysts and investors, Goldman is excited about the potential for Regeneron's coronavirus treatments.At present, Regeneron is advancing two treatments for Covid-19. Both treatments are going through trials right now, and at record speed. One of the treatments, Kevzara, could have results by the end of the month. If those results are positive, REGN stock could rally.What I Think: I'd be wary of REGN stock. This stock has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market in 2020. Shares are up 36% year-to-date, and currently trade at nosebleed valuation levels for a stock of Regeneron's ilk (27-times forward earnings).The meteoric rise can be chalked up to hype surrounding Regeneron's ability to treat Covid-19. Such hype is built on hope, and that hope could be dashed by negative trial results. Consequently, I'd tread carefully with REGN stock. Salesforce (CRM)Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com What Goldman Sachs Thinks: Goldman Sachs like Salesforce in an economic recovery, because such a recovery should spark reinvigorated IT spending.Goldman sees Salesforce as an out-sized winner of reinvigorated IT spend, given the company's formidable and broad suite of cloud-hosted enterprise software products. The firm has a 12 month forward price target on CRM stock of $178, about 20% higher than where shares trade today.What I Think: CRM stock will be a winner, regardless if the economy recovers or not, because enterprises will increasingly spend money on their cloud migrations over the next few quarters, regardless if the economy improves.The coronavirus pandemic was a not-so-subtle reminder that every enterprise needs to have virtualized and digitized software offerings, which allow for remote work. Salesforce's offers some of the best enterprise software products in the market. As such, even if the economy remains sluggish for the next few quarters, enterprises that can, will spend money with Salesforce.  * 7 Failing Tech Stocks to Disconnect From Now Of course, if the economy materially recovers, IT spending trends will rebound, and companies will spend more money with Salesforce. In that event, CRM stock won't just head higher. It will surge higher from here. Uber (UBER)Source: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com What Goldman Sachs Thinks: Goldman Sachs likes two things about Uber. First, the bank believes that increased demand for the company's food delivery service, Uber Eats, will help offset slowdown in travel and commuting.Second, Goldman thinks UBER stock is way undervalued. The bank's 12 month forward price target on the stock is $49, almost double the stock's current price.What I Think: I like UBER stock here. There seems to be some notion out there that the ride-sharing market is forever dead. This notion is wrong. Consumers enjoy ride-sharing because it's convenient and saves money. For those same reasons, once the coronavirus pandemic passes, the ride-sharing market will rebound.So will UBER stock.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-04-09,"Stocks gained again on Thursday after Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, dramatically pared his COVID-19 fatalities forecast, saying the respiratory illness could claim 60,000 American lives, down from prior estimates of 100,000 to 200,000.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 added 1.44%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.20%  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.77%  * JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was a leader in the Dow today, gaining 9.37% on news the bank has taken 375,000 requests for small business loans under the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). That's top among all banks.Underscoring the importance of Fauci's comments, the remarks aided equity markets even as another jaw-dropping batch of initial jobless claims arrived. Last week, the number was 6.6 million, according to Labor Department data released earlier today. That means that over the past three weeks, nearly 17 million Americans filed for jobless benefits.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsImportantly, Fauci said in a CBS News interview that he can see life in America returning to normal in the summertime if folks continue adhering to social distancing protocols.  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;if we do the things that we need to do to prevent the resurgence.&quot;Although Fauci didn't pinpoint a specific date, at this juncture in the COVID -19 battle, even a time frame is helpful for stir-crazy Americans, and it was enough to send 19 of 30 Dow stocks to the upside in late trading. It Pays to Give BackCompanies can be charitable, but most aren't known for cutting their customers breaks on pricing, particularly  in the insurance industry. So kudos to Travelers (NYSE:TRV) for joining some rivals and announcing on Wednesday that it's giving auto policy holders discounts for April and May because so many folks are working from home due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, meaning less driving is taking place.Travelers is &quot;giving U.S. personal auto insurance customers a 15% credit on their April and May premiums through its new Stay-at-Home Auto Premium Credit Program,&quot; according to the company.There might be something to being a good corporate citizen because TRV stock was the second-best Dow performer today. Disney Unlocks Some Virus BenefitsDisney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the Dow stocks hurt worst by the coronavirus outbreak. The company's theme parks are closed, no one is going to movie theaters and there are no sports for ESPN to air, among other factors.Along those lines, investors have been waiting for the Disney + streaming service to bring some good news, given streaming is widely viewed as a beneficiary of sheltering in place. That's clearly happened, as Disney said the streaming platform has hit 50 million paid subscribers worldwide after launching last November.What's important about the paid subscribers is that the figure probably doesn't include the Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) customers that are getting Disney + for free for a year, plenty of whom are liable to buy a subscription when their trials expire. Boeing BounceBoeing (NYSE:BA) put together another nice day following a report from UBS saying that if the company pursues help from the government, it won't be through the Treasury Department, but the Federal Reserve.Boeing CEO David Calhoun previously said he doesn't want to borrow from the Treasury if there are strings attached, including giving up equity in the company, but with the Fed buying investment-grade corporate bonds and Boeing still maintaining such a rating, that could be an avenue for the company to pursue.&quot;Boeing should tap an additional $10B for both its own needs but also to provide a conduit of support to suppliers,&quot; writes UBS analyst Myles Walton. &quot;If this is the path that [Boeing] pursues, the market would likely welcome the avenue of liquidity, but we continue to worry about the hangover of the heavy debt load.&quot; Disappointing ReactionIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the worst-performing Dow member today despite a report that emerged yesterday indicating the semiconductor giant is regaining some market share previously lost to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD). Hitting up BanksReports emerged late Thursday that Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is approaching banks for up to $3 billion in liquidity, joining a slew of companies making similar overtures this year. Interestingly, that report comes a day after the company said its dividend will be sustained this year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayOverall, it was a decent though not spectacular day for stocks. As noted earlier and this is a drum I've beaten a few times in recent weeks, markets are clearly reacting to coronavirus news. That doesn't mean reports, including the increasingly gloomy employment picture, are being glossed over, but it is a sign Covid-19 containment is near-term priority number one.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc. is in discussions with banks to raise a new $3 billion 9-month revolving credit facility, according to people familiar with the matter.The deal could be increased to about $5 billion in total and will help boost the construction equipment company’s liquidity, the people said, asking not to be named discussing a private transaction.Representatives for Citibank, which is leading the deal, and Caterpillar declined to comment. Other banks on the deal include Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Societe Generale SA.The new loan follows a $2 billion deal in the bond market on Monday. The company currently has about $10.5 billion in revolving credit facilities.Like many companies, Caterpillar is bracing for the impact of the coronavirus on its revenues. Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby last week sent a letter to employees telling them that senior executives, management and other salaried workers would have their base-pay frozen in 2020.Umpleby also said senior executives wouldn’t receive annual incentive payouts. The decision, which came days after the company pulled its 2020 outlook, represents the company’s efforts to cut costs during the pandemic.Caterpillar’s stock fell 1.86% on Thursday to close at $125.03, the third-worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.In the Americas, companies have raised $50 billion of new loans and tapped $212 billion on existing revolving credit facilities since March 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Read more: Companies are borrowing at slowest pace since the crisis beganOpening pricing on the drawn fees for the new loan are 125 basis points over the London interbank offered rate, the people said. The undrawn fees are 30 basis points and the upfront fees are 20 basis points, the people added. The deal also includes a 75 basis point Libor floor.Commitments are due on April 13 and the loan closes on April 16, the people said.Caterpillar is rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, and A by both S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, placing it comfortably in investment grade.Caterpillar has an existing $3.15 billion revolving credit facility maturing in September, a $2.73 billion revolver maturing in 2022, and a $4.62 billion revolver maturing in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates with stock price in the seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Seeks $3 Billion Loan From Banks to Boost Liquidity

2020-04-27,"Construction-focused companies Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI) have some of the highest exposure rates to U.S. non-residential construction, which is likely to enter a multi-year downturn cycle due to the coronavirus, according to Morgan Stanley.The Analyst Courtney Yakavonis downgraded Caterpillar's stock rating from Equal-Weight to Underweight with a price target lowered from $107 to $93.The analyst also downgraded United Rentals from Overweight to Equal-Weight with a price target lowered from $154 to $110.The Thesis The U.S. non-residential construction cycle is likely to be more protracted than previously expected, driven by declines across Commercial, Office, Amusement/Recreation and Lodging construction in addition to state and local budget cuts, Yakavonis wrote in the notes. United Rentals' exposure to the segment stands at 44% while Caterpillar's exposure is at 22%.Yakavonis said Public and Private non-residential construction spends are likely to fall 10% year-over-year in 2020 and another 7% in 2021. The math behind these estimates points to a $400 billion shortfall over three years. But even if an infrastructure stimulus project is announced and/or incremental state and local aid, it will likely still fall short of offsetting the $400 billion shortfalls.Meanwhile, consensus estimates factors in a &quot;robust&quot; 6% to 9% sales recovery in both companies in 2021 but the research firm's estimates point to a different outlook. Specifically, the research firm's 2021 EPS estimates for Caterpillar are 35% below the consensus estimate while its 2021 EBITDA estimates are 14% below estimates for United Rentals.Price Action Shares of Caterpillar were trading around $113.61 while shares of United Rentals were higher by 3.6% at $109.29.Related Links:Apple And Amazon Earnings, Fed Meeting Among Highlights In Busy Week AheadFed President Warns Of 'Long Hard Road' Ahead, Suggests 18-Month StrategyLatest Ratings for CAT  DateFirmActionFromTo  Apr 2020Morgan StanleyDowngradesEqual-WeightUnderweight  Apr 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-Weight  Apr 2020B of A SecuritiesDowngradesNeutralUnderperform    View More Analyst Ratings for CAT   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Despite 'Once In A Lifetime Opportunity,' Investors Still Need To Do Their Homework  * 2 Dow Stocks Surviving The Coronavirus Carnage(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tuesday was a jam-packed day for earnings across all sectors. In the industrial landscape, I paid closest attention to 3M Co., Caterpillar Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc., each a bellwether in its own right. You can find the specifics on earnings numbers in the companies’ news releases here, here and here, but in this time of unprecedented volatility, what CEOs are saying about how they are running their businesses is more telling. Here are my top takeaways:3M: Like many companies, 3M has suspended its 2020 guidance given the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus outbreak and rolling economic shutdowns, but in an effort to provide more transparency, the maker of Post-it notes is now going to provide monthly sales updates — broken down by geography and business segment — for the foreseeable future. This follows Emerson Electric Co.’s marathon two-hour-plus earnings call last week that featured presentations by not only the CEO and CFO but also the heads of its main business divisions. It’s nice to see companies setting the bar high on disclosures during this period of upheaval; hopefully others follow suit. The second quarter is expected to bring the worst of the virus impact, and 3M is cutting $350 million to $400 million of costs in the period to adjust to lower demand. Notably, however, much of that involves discretionary spending on things like travel, external services and advertising, rather than cuts to payroll, which 3M says it’s trying to minimize. It’s using furloughs, but they’re paid leaves, and in other cases, employees are being asked to take vacation. Bear in mind that 3M had announced a restructuring plan in January, separate from the coronavirus, that would see it eliminate some 1,500 jobs, so it’s hardly a corporate saint. But given its sales of N95 respirators, you’d be hard-pressed to find a company that better understands the toll the virus is taking, and 3M seems to legitimately want to to do the right thing by its workforce. Like others in the industrial sector, the company also appears wary of cutting too deep and being unprepared for an eventual recovery. 3M is clearly conscious of its image after having its name dragged through the mud by President Donald Trump and billionaire Mark Cuban over production and sales of N95 respirators. The company devoted an entire slide in its earnings presentation to the topic. 3M has already doubled global N95 output to 100 million per month and is investing in capacity to double that yet again; it’s directed 90% of production to health-care workers, with the remainder going to other critical industries such as food production; and the company has cut loose some distributors who acted “unethically” and is pursuing numerous lawsuits amid allegations of price gouging. The company also made a point of highlighting its 76 plants and distribution centers across the U.S. in an apparent nod toward calls for a revival of America’s manufacturing might. “3M has never left our home country,” CEO Michael Roman said on the call. CATERPILLAR : The maker of bulldozers and backhoes is also holding off on sweeping job cuts, and it made an interesting argument as to why that’s the case. Caterpillar held headcount as well as administrative, manufacturing and research spending relatively flat from 2016 to 2019, even as sales increased some 40%. That means there’s less to cut when a downturn hits, CEO Jim Umpleby said on a call to discuss the company’s first-quarter results. It also means Caterpillar doesn’t have to use up cash to pay out large amounts of severance, and “cash is obviously king in this environment,” Umpleby said. So the overall effect is that margins and cash flow will be higher than historically, even though the chaotic nature of the coronavirus outbreak and supply-chain disruptions will likely prevent the company from reaching its targets on those metrics. While Caterpillar has suspended share buybacks and is delaying some R&D and capital expenditure projects with less visible returns, it made the decision to continue investing in growing its services business and expanding its product offerings because it continues to view those initiatives as key to its longer-term profitability. That’s a positive sign that the coronavirus hasn’t completely zapped CEOs’ appetite for investment.UPS: The good news for the package-delivery company is that its services have never been more important as store shutdowns and fear of contagion drive more consumers to online ordering. The bad news is that the spike in sales is coming at the expense of its profit margin. Why? It’s partly due to the sporadic nature of residential deliveries, which  makes the process more expensive than shipping to businesses, and also because of the increased expenses involved in keeping workers safe. The knock-on costs of the coronavirus — including the expense of doing extra cleaning and providing workers with protective gear — amounted to $140 million in the first quarter. That’s an important data point to keep in mind as companies across less essential industries start bringing people back to work. Like Caterpillar, UPS will maintain investments in strategic priorities such as automation to help bolster its longer-term profitability. An expected $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures is going to come largely from a rethink of certain facilities projects and a delay in vehicle purchases. The company is also working with its customers when it comes to investing in their supply chains as the coronavirus exposes the flaws in far-flung networks. In many cases, that's going to mean a shift to third-party order fulfillment and logistics services. This is just an acceleration of a reappraisal that began with the U.S.-China trade war, UPS CEO David Abney said on the earnings call. A lot remains unknown about the coronavirus pandemic, but the messaging from most industrial CEOs at this point has focused on staying the course, whether that means maintaining most of the workforce or following through on investment commitments. UPS's Abney may have put it best: “I don't know that we'll ever get back to what we call the old normal, but we're not ready to declare what we see today as a new normal, either.”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Tuesday saw two new milestones in the U.S.: coronavirus cases passed the 1 million mark and deaths topped the 58,220 lives lost in the Vietnam War, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.France plans to begin reopening shops on May 11, while Spain is preparing for a “new normal” as Europe’s hardest-hit nation removes restrictions over the next eight weeks. New infections in Germany fell below 1,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. China’s top scientists said the virus won’t be eradicated, joining a growing consensus that the pathogen will probably return in waves.New York City reported a decline in the number of people admitted to hospitals for the new coronavirus, while the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, laid out criteria necessary for some upstate regions to reopen. President Donald Trump plans to order meat-processing plants to remain open, a person familiar with the matter said.Key DevelopmentsVirus Tracker: Cases top 3.1 million; deaths pass 216,000Testing shortages undermine drive to restart U.S. economyMexico City top hospitals reach capacity, reject virus patientsVirus forces China to rethink Xi’s annual political pageantBack to school brings a bleak new normal for China’s studentsBusiness of survival fuels race for new skills to stay afloatSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus.Starbucks Sees China Sales Falling 25% (5:12 p.m. NY)Starbucks Corp. has opened almost all its locations in China, but still sees the lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic trimming same-store sales there by 15% to 25% this fiscal year. The shares fell in late trading.Same-store sales fell 10% globally in the company’s second quarter, slightly outpacing the average estimate for a 9.7% decline compiled by Consensus Metrix. The measure -- a key gauge of success for restaurant chains -- fell 50% in China, which along with the U.S. is a priority market for the company.With the U.S. likely following China’s path to reopening, but on a delayed timeline, 2020 increasingly is looking like a lost year for the company. Since the pandemic started to affect U.S. sales only at the end of the quarter that ended in late March, impact on third-quarter results will be “significantly greater” and extend into the fiscal fourth quarter “at a more moderate level.”The company has said it will take a store-by-store approach to resuming business activity in the U.S., with locations remaining limited to drive-thru, delivery and takeout activities. Starbucks said this plan will draw on the company’s experiences in China, where 98% of stores are now re-opened and operating under modified schedules or protocols.California Considers Starting School Year in Summer (4:45 p.m. NY)California, which has closed schools for the academic year, is considering bumping up the start of the new school year to late July or early August, Governor Gavin Newsom said. The tools necessary for distance learning – laptops, tablets and reliable wireless internet – aren’t adequately available across the state, he said.“There’s been a learning loss, and you can either just roll over and just accept that or you can do something about it,” Newsom said at his daily press conference. “If we can maybe start up the school year a little earlier, that would help mind that gap a little bit.”Opening schools would also help parents get back to work as the economy restarts. Newsom reiterated that he expects some changes to California’s stay-at-home order will come in “weeks, not months,” with the next phase aimed at bringing back some lower-risk workplaces, including childcare facilities. Still, he wouldn’t commit to any hard timeline, citing an increase in Covid-19 related deaths and confirmed cases on Tuesday as a signal that the virus is still too dangerous for the state to reopen.Trump Ties Aid to Sanctuary Policies (4:30 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump indicated he wouldn’t allow federal aid for states facing budget deficits from the coronavirus outbreak unless they take action against “sanctuary cities” -- municipalities that prevent their police from cooperating with immigration authorities.“We would want certain things” as part of a deal with House Democrats to aid states, he said at a White House event on Tuesday, “including sanctuary city adjustments, because we have so many people in sanctuary cities.”“What’s happening is people are being protected that shouldn’t be protected and a lot of bad things are happening with sanctuary cities,” he added.U.S. Cases Rise 2.5%, Below Week’s Average (4 p.m. NY)U.S. cases rose 2.5% from the day before to surpass 1 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was higher than Monday’s growth rate of 2.3% but below average daily increase of 3.3% over the past week. Deaths rose 3.7% to 57,608. Deaths rose 3.7% to 57,608.New York’s cases rose 1.1%, according to the Johns Hopkins and Bloomberg News data.New Jersey, which has the second-highest Covid-19 rate, reported 402 new deaths, for a total of 6,442, according to the state’s health department.In Texas, cases rose 3.5% to 26,171, almost in lockstep with the rate of increase in testing, according to the state’s health department. Hospitalizations climbed by 119 to 1,682, or 19% higher than a week ago.Florida reported 32,846 cases, up 2.2% from a day earlier, according to the state’s health department. Deaths reached 1,171, an increase of 7.6%.Nebraska had the highest daily increase, with cases rising 16% to 3,507Fauci ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ on Vaccine (1:57 p.m. NY)The U.S. government’s top infectious disease specialist is “cautiously optimistic” scientists will develop a Covid-19 vaccine that can protect against future outbreaks of a virus he said is unlikely to disappear.“The very fact that people can mount a natural immune response that gets rid of the virus in them makes me cautiously optimistic that we can develop a vaccine that can mimic natural infection enough to induce that same sort of response that would ultimately protect people,” Anthony Fauci said Tuesday at a virtual event hosted by the Economic Club.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in the past has shied away from making predictions about treatments.Texas Cases Rise 3.5% (1:19 p.m. NY)Texas cases rose 3.5% to 26,171, almost in lockstep with the rate of increase in testing, according to the state’s health department. Hospitalizations climbed by 119 to 1,682, or 19% higher than a week ago.The increases in caseload and admitted patients come as Governor Greg Abbott moved to reopen the economy and leaders of the state’s biggest metropolitan areas warned that moving too fast could ignite a second wave of contagion.Spain Aims to Lift Lockdown in 8 Weeks (1:15 p.m. NY)Spain aims to remove most restrictions on daily life and return to a “new normal” over the next eight weeks, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.The process will be subject to data on the number of Covid-19 infections and won’t follow a strict calendar, Sanchez said in a televised address. Schools won’t return until September. Each province will ease curbs on activity at its own pace in accordance with its particular situation, Sanchez added.After a six-week lockdown that has crippled the economy, the health ministry earlier reported a drop in the number of new virus cases and deaths, continuing a trend of steady decline in the nation with Europe’s most extensive outbreak.Turkish ICU Cases Fall for Fifth Day (1 p.m. NY)The number of coronavirus patients requiring intensive care fell for a fifth day across Turkey, while the tally of patients discharged from hospitals rose to the highest since the outbreak began 50 days ago.The total figure for confirmed cases now stands at 114,653, or 2.1% higher than Monday, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said in a Twitter post. The ministry reported 92 new fatalities, bringing the death toll from the outbreak to 2,992.U.K. Reports 586 More Deaths (12:23 p.m. NY)A further 586 people are reported to have died from the coronavirus in U.K. hospitals, the government said.That’s an increase from the 360 deaths reported Monday, but U.K. death numbers are usually artificially low after a weekend.Some 3,996 more people tested positive for the disease, down from an increase of 4,310 the day before, according to figures given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday. The U.K. now has more confirmed cases than Germany, and the fifth-highest number of confirmed cases in the world.Putin Extends Russian Lockdown (11:10 a.m. NY)President Vladimir Putin ordered Russians to remain under lockdown through May 11 after the total number of coronavirus cases in the country surpassed China’s.“We have been able to slow down the epidemic,” Putin said Tuesday in a videoconference with officials and regional governors. “The peak has not yet been reached. We are facing the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic.”Putin also ordered the government to prepare a plan for gradually lifting the virus restrictions starting as early as May 12, and said ministers should draw up further programs to support the economy. Easing the measures against the epidemic won’t happen all at once, the president said.Florida Governor to Meet With Trump (10:56 a.m. NY)Florida reported 32,846 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, up 2.2% from a day earlier. Deaths reached 1,171, an increase of 7.6%.Governor Ron DeSantis is in Washington Tuesday to meet with President Donald Trump, an ally -- and technically a Florida resident -- to whom DeSantis has frequently turned for guidance during the pandemic.NYC Sees Drop in Virus Admissions (10:37 a.m. NY)New York City reported a decline in the number of people admitted to hospitals for the new coronavirus, to 112 from 122 as of April 25.The number of people in New York City Health + Hospitals intensive-care units also declined, to 745 from 766 as of April 25, according to figures presented by Mayor Bill de Blasio at his Tuesday virus briefing.In another sign of progress, de Blasio reported that the citywide percentage of people who tested positive for Covid-19 is 27%, down from 29%. Testing positivity was slightly higher at the public health lab, up to 56% from 55%.France to Reopen Shops Starting May 11 (9:46 a.m. NY)Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said a decision on whether to reopen restaurants and cafes will be examined at the end of May, and that pupils can start returning to school from May 11 but with strict rules. Public events of more than 5,000 people are outlawed until September, and working from home is encouraged for at least three more weeks, he said.Ford to Restart Production at European Plants (9:14 a.m. NY)Ford intends to restart initial production at most of its main European vehicle and engine plants beginning May 4, the company said. Manufacturing will resume in a phased approach, and employees will receive personal-care kits including masks and thermometers.Mnuchin Says Loans of $2 Million to Be Audited (9:10 a.m. NY)U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said all loans of more than $2 million in a government relief program for small businesses will be audited to ensure they were justified after large public companies and big chains sparked outrage by taking funds.Mnuchin said the loans of as much as $10 million meant to keep workers on payrolls under the Paycheck Protection Program were intended for small firms that lacked access to other capital, and the U.S. Small Business Administration will check that borrowers who took large loans properly certified it was needed because of the coronavirus outbreak.“I want to be very clear it’s the borrowers who have criminal liability if they made this certification and it’s not true,” Mnuchin said Tuesday on CNBC.The Treasury secretary also said those states that had poorly managed budgets before the Covid-19 outbreak shouldn’t be rescued by the federal government.U.S. Merchandise Trade Slumps (8:54 a.m. NY)U.S. exports and imports of goods slumped in March to the lowest level in almost three years as the coronavirus pandemic shut down economies across the world.Goods exports fell 6.7% from the prior month -- the sharpest decline since 2008 -- led by plunges in auto shipments and industrial supplies such as oil, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday. Imports fell by 2.4% on autos and consumer goods. Combined, U.S. exports and imports were the lowest since May 2017.Germany to Extend Takeover Controls to Health Care (8:48 a.m. NY)The German government plans to extend its protection against foreign takeovers to the health-care industry after the coronavirus outbreak made companies more vulnerable. Angela Merkel’s cabinet aims to lower the threshold for scrutinizing investments in the sector from outside the European Union, the Economy Ministry said Tuesday.Netherlands Sees Fewest New Cases Since March 14 (8:13 a.m. NY)The Netherlands reported 171 new cases, the lowest since March 14, which was a few days before an “intelligent lockdown” was imposed on the country. Confirmed cases rose a mere 0.4% to 38,416, marking the lowest recorded growth rate. Fatalities increased by 48 -- five more than Monday, but still below the triple-digit numbers seen for most of the month -- for a total of 4,566.FDA’s Hahn Optimistic About Plasma Treatment (7:48 a.m. NY)“There are some good preliminary data to suggest that it is a benefit, this is a therapy that we’ve been scaling up over the last two months,” FDA Chief Stephen Hahn told Fox Business. On Gilead and its drug remdesivir, he said: “We’ve been in very close contact with the company and are working closely with them to look at what those data show”U.K. Regulator Warns Banks Not to Use Loans to Win Deals (7:31 a.m. NY)“We have heard credible reports of a small number of banks failing to treat their corporate clients fairly when negotiating new or existing debt facilities,” the Financial Conduct Authority said Tuesday in the letter. “We have heard reports that banks may have used their lending relationship to exert pressure on corporate clients to secure roles on equity mandates.”Providing financial services in return for future business is not an unusual strategy for lenders. The outbreak of the Covid-19 virus triggered an unprecedented demand for banks to provide short-term liquidity and prompted regulators to ease capital buffers. The transactions could include a capital raising, a bond issuance or other types of equity mandates.European Banks Get Break on Leverage Limits (7:15 a.m. NY)A key rule on banks’ indebtedness -- the so-called leverage ratio -- will be relaxed under a European Union proposal announced Tuesday, enabling banks to hold less capital for funds they keep at central banks. Deutsche Bank AG, which had 134 billion euros in cash primarily at central banks at the end of 2019, stands to be a major beneficiary.The softening of the rule is part of the latest plan unveiled by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, that also would allow banks to save on capital when they invest in software and when they fund infrastructure and small- and medium-sized businessesSingapore Virus Trend ‘Improving’ (6:43 a.m. NY)The trend of overall cases is “indeed improving” but the government wants to make sure there is a decisive reduction in local community transmission before moving to relax circuit breaker measures, Singapore Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said at a briefing.As part of the city-state’s strategy to bring down infections in the weeks to come, the government said it has more than doubled its daily testing capacity since early April even as the number of cases. Once touted as an early success in containing the spread, Singapore now has Asia’s highest number of coronavirus cases after China and India. Much of the surge in infections has been driven by hundreds of new daily cases from migrant worker dorms.UPS, PepsiCo Pull Outlook (6:14 a.m. NY)UPS, PepsiCo, 3M and Xerox joined the growing list of companies who have scrapped forecasts because of the disruption caused by the coronavirus. “There is still a great deal of uncertainty that exists in relation to Covid-19, including how geographies, retail channels and consumer behaviors will evolve over time,” PepsiCo said. UPS is suspending share buybacks for 2020 and expects capital expenditure to be about $1 billion lower than expected.At 3M, rising demand for cleaning supplies, food-safety products and even home-improvement items helped propel sales and profit above expectations for the first quarter.Caterpillar Inc. didn’t provide an outlook for the year and said it had taken actions to cut costs, including reducing discretionary expenses and suspending 2020 base salary increases and short-term incentive compensation plans for many employees and all senior executives. Harley-Davidson Inc. is in talks with major U.S. banks to secure $1.3 billion in funding after sales declined in every market worldwideSouthwest Airlines Co. plans to sell $1 billion in convertible bonds and 55 million shares. The company is cutting the number of Boeing Co. 737 Max jets it will take through December 2021 by more than half as the travel outlook remains bleak. Max deliveries will total no more than 48 through the end of next year as the pandemic batters demand for flights, Southwest said. More than 120 planes had been expected.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Covid-19 Deaths Top Lives Lost in Vietnam War: Virus Update

2020-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest maker of mining and construction equipment is predicting that the pain from the coronavirus crisis is far from over.Caterpillar Inc. said the current quarter will be “more significantly impacted” by the pandemic after profits for the first three months of the year trailed analysts estimates. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company also shelved its traditional earnings forecast for 2020 as the fallout from the virus jolts customers in mining, construction and energy.Also read: Caterpillar 1Q Adjusted EPS $1.60 Vs. $2.94 Y/y, Est. $1.69Caterpillar is taking steps to slash costs and pare production in the face of deteriorating commodity markets that stand to crush demand for the company’s signature yellow machines. BofA Securities Inc. analyst Ross Gilardi downgraded the company’s stock this month, and said that weakness in its energy business was “a problem that is not going away.”In a stark departure from his normally staid commentary on earnings calls, Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said he never envisioned the significant effects that the virus has imparted on the company’s business thus far.“The impact of Covid-19 on our business has been significantly more severe and chaotic than any cyclical downturn we had envisioned,” Umpleby said. “The ultimate impact of the pandemic on our 2020 results remains uncertain, and will be based on the duration of the virus and the magnitude of the economic impact on global demand for our products.”Also read: Five Takeaways From Caterpillar First-Quarter EarningsShares of the company declined 1% at 10:04 a.m. in New York. The stock had dropped about 22% this year through Monday’s close.Oil RoutU.S. crude drilling is sliding amid a historic rout in oil prices, Saudi Arabia has started reducing output ahead of the start date for OPEC+ supply cuts, and an immense global surplus means storage tanks are close to capacity around the world.Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said in a phone interview the oil and gas business will be “quite challenged” through the rest of 2020, warning that the company doesn’t expect a recovery anytime soon.Last month, Caterpillar withdrew its earlier 2020 financial guidance and said it would temporarily suspend operations at some facilities as the virus hobbles supply chains.Less than a week after the company said it would suspend some production, it decided to freeze pay for executives and salaried workers. The manufacturer also confirmed last month that it laid off employees at its East Peoria building KK as part of actions taken to reduce output due to weaker customer demand.The company said the second quarter will probably be worse than the previous three months as coronavirus-related impacts increase. CFO Bonfield also warned to not necessarily interpret that to mean that this quarter would be the trough of the crisis.Customer Confidence“Confidence is really important for our customers to be able to make sure they can buy machines in whatever segment they are, and that’s going to take a little while to recover,” Bonfield said. “We can’t be sure that’s just in the second quarter and everything goes back to normal in the third quarter.”Caterpillar got a revolving credit facility of as much as $3.875 billion last week, indicating that it’s beefing up liquidity amid potential fallout from the pandemic.Revenue declines in all three main business segments could reach double digits in 2020, according to Karen Ubelhart of Bloomberg Intelligence, and analysts at Morgan Stanley said the decrease in those segments has the potential to continue into 2021.The CFO struck a slightly upbeat tone about China, where activity is starting to pick back up from February lows. Bonfield said all of its plants in the Asian nation are up and running, the supply chain is working, and that it’s witnessed “some” recovery in April. Though during the earnings call, Bonfield said the company faced competitive price pressures during the first quarter in the country.(Adds CEO comments and updates throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Warns of ‘Severe and Chaotic’ Impact From Virus

2020-04-28,Investors are more interested in what the equipment maker has to say about the outlook than its performance in the first quarter.,Caterpillar’s Earnings Missed Expectations. The Stock Is Rising Anyway.
2020-04-28,"A three-course earnings meal is on the table today, so bring your appetite. Health Care serves the appetizers this morning as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) grab the spotlight, with a little Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE: CAT) on the side for protein and some 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) for a snack. This afternoon's main course is Alphabet, Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) soup, with dessert (and perhaps a shot of espresso) by Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX).Tomorrow's menu is even more packed, but investors might still have a sweet taste in their mouths after Monday's big gains that saw things climb across the board despite very little news. Just the idea that some economies in Europe and here at home might start opening up apparently was enough to see buyers saunter back in to follow up last week's strong close. The strength appeared to spill over into pre-market trading Tuesday.A 3.7% gain for Financials carried the day Monday, but all sectors did well. One bullish development was seeing some investor interest in the Industrials and Materials sectors, both of which have been struggling amid weak demand. Earnings calls from CAT and 3M (MMM) this morning could shine more of a light on the industrial economy around the world, while Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) this afternoon promises a look at the chip sector, which has been leading things higher for a while now.Shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP), CAT, MMM, and PFE all climbed in pre-market trading as investors digested their earnings. The gains in CAT came despite the company missing analysts' expectations, though that was partly due to a special charge. About 75% of CAT's factories are still open because they're deemed essential, and the stock was down 22% for the year going into today. The company did OK in the first part of Q1 but then things turned south. The stock had done so poorly all year that maybe investors see earnings as a reprieve, judging from how shares acted early Tuesday. PEP missed on earnings but beat on revenue, and investors seem focused on the revenue beat for now. MMM and PFE all beat analysts' estimates, and PFE maintained its guidance. MMM had a nice quarter due to its home safety products, and pulled its guidance but kept its dividend.Consumer confidence is the key data to watch today, coming out right after the open. Analysts expect a headline reading of 86.5 for April, according to Briefing.com, down from 120 in March and 132.6 in February. That would be the worst in about six years. Slumbering Banks Wake Up For once, the market did well Monday without Information Technology twirling the baton.Sure, the chip companies resumed their sizzling performance, but some of the software, cloud, and device companies didn't do as well. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) both got left behind, for instance, and so did the high-flying FAANGs in general. It's just one day, not a trend, and you have to consider how far AAPL and MSFT have already come. Still, those two have such huge market caps (above $1 trillion each), that if they lose steam, it could have an outsize impact on the major indices (see more below). That's the &quot;glass half empty&quot; take on Monday's action. The glass half full is seeing how well the downtrodden Financial sector did and how stocks climbed despite crude getting slammed again. Banks provided the leadership, with JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) having a big day and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) and Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C) also doing well. The rally got kicked off by Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE: DB), whose shares surged 8% after it announced it would report a Q1 earnings beat. That excited people, and so did news of European countries like Spain and Italy talking about reopening. You don't want to see the tech names fall apart, but Monday's session shows that we don't always have to hop on their back to carry us along. However, we're so reliant on four or five huge tech firms that it would be good to see Financials take some leadership in this market. For those of you keeping score at home, Financials were one of the worst performing sectors since the pandemic began, and seeing major banks put aside billions against possible loan defaults dented the industry's profits in Q1. Could we be seeing some pent-up demand for this sector? One day isn't enough to really say, but it is a good lesson to investors how a rally in Financials can translate right into a market-wide rally across the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Regional banks helped power the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) higher to start the week, too. Another thing that's given banks problems is the pressure on rates as the Fed continues its bond buying and investors seek fixed income in hope of protection. The Fed meeting starts today, and some analysts say there's no expectation for rate hikes until 2023. That wouldn't be unprecedented when you consider it took until late 2015 for the Fed to raise rates again after lowering them to effectively zero during the 2008 financial crisis. Zero rates can help companies climb out of the deep hole they're in, but they also raise debt worries and put pressure on profit margins for banks. Retail also had a big day Monday, helped by hopes that reopenings can give struggling stores a lift. Though lots of caution remains, it was a hopeful sign that bond prices and volatility both fell to start the week. The dollar, another asset people have clung to recently as the economy weakens, stepped back a little, too. Small-cap stocks continue to gain a little ground.In fact, stocks that would benefit most from an economic reopening led the way higher on Monday. MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) and Carnival Corporation & PLC (NYSE: CCL) both climbed more than 8%. The Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) and Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) gained 12.9% and 17.7%, respectively. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares jumped 10.1%. This is a nice change of pace, but one day is never a trend. Typically, stocks trade in a narrow range during Fed meetings, but that might not be the case today. That's partly because the Fed has already done so much to address the crisis that many market participants don't expect much news out of the meeting when it finishes tomorrow. Still, don't count out the chance that the range could narrow a bit later today and tomorrow, maybe easing back some of the early exuberance.All this talk of the economy reopening in some states but not others raises questions, and in a sense could make things more disjointed than they already are. More on that tomorrow. Crude's Monday Plunge Shrugged Off Stocks rallied Monday despite plunging crude, and crude did pop back slightly early Tuesday from its worst overnight lows.When crude is so weak, there's a point it gets down to where it doesn't matter if it's trading at $11, $13, or $15. No one in the Energy sector is making money at these levels. If you look out onto the futures curve into September and beyond, though, prices suggest a chance of demand coming back. It might be too late for Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (NYSE: DO), a small-cap company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Tomorrow's weekly government crude supply and production report could shed more light and maybe give investors a sense of whether U.S. prices have a chance to fall further as the June contract expiration starts closing in later next month. Normally you wouldn't pay such close attention to the week-by-week crude supply situation if you're a typical stock market investor. That has to change for now, seeing how weak crude torched stocks early last week.To some extent, however, major crude firms divorced themselves from the current soft crude market on Monday, with Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO) doing well. The June crude futures contract has a few more weeks as the front month but then it goes off the board, so it's a matter of getting through this time period. Hopefully sometime soon after that economies start opening back up and demand starts creeping higher, which might take some pressure off of the storage situation.CHART OF THE DAY: WHAT YOU SEE...Some of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index (SPX--candlestick) since the market hit its highs in mid-February have been the so-called &quot;FAANGs&quot; (purple line), which outperformed the SPX easily over that time. These stocks, including Amazon, Apple and others reporting this week, make up a big percentage of the SPX by market-cap, which means its overall performance may be considered worse than it looks if you consider it on an equal-weighted basis rather than a value-weighted one. Data Sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Nasdaq. Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Value Judgment: A lot of times you'll hear analysts and fund managers talk about &quot;value stocks,&quot; meaning stocks of companies that tend to have good bones but for one reason or other are trading below their true worth. This can happen if investors overlook potential new innovations in a company's pipeline, changes in management that bode well, an evolving business model, or a company that's had problems but the stock is down to levels that punish it too much. Some analysts see &quot;value&quot; companies congregated now in the Financial and Industrial sectors, as well as in the small-cap space.These days, value stocks are like a certain famous comedian--not getting much respect. It might seem strange at a time when so many worry about indices coming back too far, too fast, that more investors aren't running to value names, but one reason could be pandemic-related. With so many companies pulling guidance and the near future so uncertain, it's hard to measure value. A downtrodden stock might not deserve to be so low, but who can really tell? This leads many investors to flock where pockets are deepest and the walls against uncertainty are highest, which is why so many of the big tech stocks are doing well and value remains &quot;unvalued&quot; by many at this juncture.Birds of a Feather: When so many people flock to one part of the market, you risk getting blinded by focusing too closely on the broader indices. For instance, the SPX was down around 17% from its February record as of the end of last week, but the median stock was trading 28% below its peak, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing data from Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS). That's in part due to the outstanding performance recently of the market's heavyweights, which tends to make the index look better than if you weighted it equally by each component. The five largest companies make up 20% of the SPX's market capitalization, exceeding the 18% level the measure reached in March 2000 at the height of the dot-com boom. This raises concerns about narrow market breadth leading to possibly lower long-term returns and loss of momentum, GS warned. Investors are putting a lot of faith in a few behemoths to keep this rally going, and if those darlings of Wall Street falter, their outsized capitalization could have an outsized impact on the index. Depth Gauge: Consider this week a huge test of the idea that the biggest stocks set the tone. Four huge companies--Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft--are due to report. Together, these four have a mind-boggling market cap of $4.634 trillion as of Monday. The market cap leader, in case you're keeping score, is MSFT at $1.33 trillion, followed by AAPL at $1.23 trillion and AMZN at 1.2 trillion. GOOGL brings up the rear at a mere $874 billion. These valuations aren't far off where the four stocks were back at the peak before coronavirus, which shows just how much money people are throwing at them as they look for cash-rich, well managed companies in hard times.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-05-15,"Stocks rallied to close the week, again showing resilience in the face of troubling economic data. An extension of the oil rebound and more positive reopening also provided some ballast to equities.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 climbed 0.39%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.25%  * The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.79%  * After being one of the Dow components worst hit by the novel coronavirus, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) was the index leader today on news Florida is taking steps to reopen theme parks, including Disney World in Orlando.Onto the data, which were again dismal. A report released earlier today by the Federal Reserve indicates industrial production plunged 11.2% last month, the worst decline on record (and that data spans more than a century).

Showing Some StrengthNeither of the aforementioned data points would appear to be conducive to success for a stock like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), yet the home improvement retailer was one of the Dow leaders Friday. Today's strength in the name is relevant for several reasons, not the least of which is that the company reports earnings on Tuesday.

Add another bump to that road today following a Barron's article that points out Boeing isn't too big to fail.That doesn't mean Boeing will disappear, but investors shouldn't expect the company will get the same treatment some banks got during the global financial crisis.

2020-06-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc. is keeping some of its plants shut for longer than expected with demand languishing, in a sign that the economic recovery is progressing slowly.Among Caterpillar’s operations across the Americas, its Curitiba Brazil and Campo Largo BCP Brazil plants are idled until the middle of June, while parts of its Piracicaba Brazil facilities aren’t slated to reopen until June 30, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Additionally, the company had more than 10 facilities shuttered at some point during May, the document shows.The shutdowns give a peek inside the impact the global coronavirus pandemic is having on the company, considered a bellwether for parts of the economy. Caterpillar’s plants are typically operating at this time of year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the operations who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The second quarter traditionally is Caterpillar’s highest factory output as it ramps up for seasonal demand.“It’s reasonable to assume that they’re limiting their production schedules to align demand that’s still very muted,” Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co., said in a telephone interview. “In general, we know that demand across construction and mining markets markets and of course energy is still in a depressed state and as a result they’re going to have to have production schedules that are kind of aligned with that.”Facilities ShutMany of the facilities being idled are for two weeks or longer, according to the document. Curitiba is shut from June 1 to June 15, Piracicaba’s motor grader line is down from May 18 to June 30 while the medium wheel loader, medium track-type tractor and soil asphalt and pneumatic compactor line is idled from June 1 to June 30. The North Little Rock facility in Arkansas was closed from May 18 until June 8, and the BCP Clayton and BCP Stanford facilities were shut from May 18 to May 26.Caterpillar spokeswoman Kate Kenny referred Bloomberg to the company’s previous public statements.Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby in April departed from his normally staid commentary on earnings calls to warn analysts of a “severe and chaotic” impact from the crisis. CFO Andrew Bonfield at the time made it clear that the company isn’t necessarily saying the second quarter for sure would be the trough, saying it is “going to take a little while to recover.”During the same call with analysts, Umpleby said it had suspended operations at “certain” facilities due to supply-chain constraints, weak customer demand and government mandates -- referring to the lockdowns. He also warned that the company sometimes has facility closures to align production with customer demand, even when the world isn’t going through a pandemic.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Extending Plant Closures With Virus Sapping Demand

2020-06-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc.’s machinery sales dropped by the most in 10 years last month in a sign of a deepening slump in its Americas businesses, where the company has extended plant shutdowns.Retail receipts in North America fell 36% on a rolling three-month basis, the most since January 2010, the company said in a government filing Friday. Sales in Latin America had the biggest decline since December 2016. Overall global sales dropped by the most since early 2010.The figures underscore concerns over prospects for a halting recovery at the heavy-equipment maker after coronavirus shutdowns dented the profit outlooks for miners and construction companies. The data comes on the heels of a report that the Deerfield, Illinois-based company is keeping some of its plants across North and South America shut for longer than expected.BMO Capital Markets analyst Joel Tiss earlier downgraded Caterpillar’s stock to the equivalent of a hold, citing a “catatonic recovery.” Near-term recovery of the company’s end markets will be challenged by customers’ budgetary constraints and stretched government finances, Tiss said.“These factors will likely overwhelm the myriad internal improvements occurring at the company, at least for the next few years,” Tiss said in the note.Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby took the helm at the start of 2017 with a focus on boosting efficiency and profit margins, and expanding services to help offset the traditionally cyclical nature of the bellwether producer’s markets. In an earnings call in April, Umpleby departed from his normally staid commentary to warn analysts of a “severe and chaotic” impact from the crisis.Caterpillar’s stock is down about 16% this year.

2020-06-19,"The market has made a strong comeback this week, which is enough to force investors to question whether stocks have come too far, too fast. However, amid the hype, three doggish Dow Jones stocks are demonstrating legitimate promise today.If nothing else, it would be hard to deny the market's resilience with the Dow Jones Industrial Average bouncing back sharply from a dizzying correction last week. Since Monday, prior Federal Reserve-induced FOMC jeers and second-wave novel coronavirus fears have given way to burly bargain-hunting and cheers on the back of J.

To be certain though, it's still a market made up of stocks.While the Dow has scratched its way back to within 8% of making index investors whole again, many stocks haven't followed suite. Moreover, some Dow Jones stocks entered what was a record breaking 2019 as attractive investments due to their inability to play ball and participate in the game of ever higher valuations. The top ten contenders are known as the Dogs of the Dow.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStocks correct all the time, even in healthy markets. And when it happens to blue-chips that offer dividends to investors and those income distributions grow even larger than normal, the Dogs of the Dow is a popular 12-month, buy-and-hold strategy for profiting from the divergent price behavior.The Dogs strategy won't guarantee investors have the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in their portfolio for obvious reasons. But historically this method of investing has beaten the returns offered by the Dow Jones. Maybe more amazing, the out-performance has even paid off through a combination of income and stock gains over the course of a record breaking bull market since the low of the 2009 financial crisis.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge A bit more than halfway through 2020 and the majority of this year's dogs are lagging a still underwater Dow. Truthfully, I'd be afraid to touch a couple of today's &quot;canines&quot; with a ten foot stick. But for the following three names, the price charts in conjunction with protective options hedging may just prove to an investor's best friend:  * IBM (NYSE:IBM)  * Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  * Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)Let's examine what makes of these Dow Jones stocks stand out today. Dow Jones Stocks: IBM (IBM)  Source: Charts by TradingViewWhen investors were eyeing the dogs' strategy at the beginning of the year, they may have been licking their chops over IBM's 4.79% income stream. Now it's a slightly more tempting annualized dividend of 5.25%. And technically, today's buyers look to be in a strong starting position for future capital gains.The coronavirus-induced market correction resulted in shares of IBM putting together a well-supported and bullishly diverging triple bottom pattern. With the pattern being four years in-the-making and shares offering investors the opportunity to buy in near April's inside candlestick confirmation, it's time to purchase this Dow Jones stock today.To make IBM's prospects even stronger, I'd go with an open-ended variation on a traditional collar, which uses a bear put spread, rather than a long put for protection. It's riskier on paper, but the price and placement of the combination look worth the increased downside exposure. Specifically, buying the Aug $115 / $100 bear put spread and selling the Aug $135 call for a slight discount of around 0.35% to 0.40% versus purchasing a standalone stock position looks attractive. Verizon (VZ)  Source: Charts by TradingViewVerizon is the next of the stand out Dow Jones stocks to purchase right now. The telecommunications giant should have income investors' attention as its yield has inched its way marginally higher from 4.01% to 4.32% since the beginning of the year. But this blue-chip is also noteworthy for technical trend traders as well.At its worst in March during the market's Covid-19 correction, Verizon managed to confirm a slightly steeper uptrend of around five years. It's bullish. And set inside of its very well-constructed up-channel that's formed since the financial crisis low in 2009, trend traders should be even more upbeat on this blue-chip.Shares confirmed the March pivot and doji candlestick low in April. And similar to IBM, this Dow Jones stock is still stationed near its signal price, while also being backed by a bullish stochastics crossover.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks for Loyal Cannabis Bulls I'd recommend the same type of open-ended collar for VZ stock. Here, buying the Aug $52.50 / $45 put spread, selling the Aug $60 call looks interesting. Along with shares, the play will cost about ten cents more than a simple stock position. That may have income investors stopping in their tracks. Still, we're talking about a dime and the partial protective value afforded by this technically, well-placed vertical looks well worth the cost of entry. Caterpillar (CAT)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe last of our three Dow Jones stocks is Caterpillar. Okay, you got me. Officially, this selection was just more doggish than an actual dog in 2019. Its weak performance landed it in the No. 11 position of high-yielders in the Dow with a 2.79% dividend. That was narrowly behind Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) payout of 2.89%. But today, and with an improved income stream to start of 3.23% in hand, CAT stock looks set to learn a new trick on the price chart called rallying.Technically, Caterpillar's March low appears to be setting the stage for a larger, slightly ill-formed 'W' or double-bottom corrective base. The recent bottoming hammer candlestick successfully challenged the former highs and two Fibonacci levels dating back to key lows from 2009 and 2016. It looks great and the pattern could help shares rally towards new highs in the second half of 2020.As with our other dogs to buy, some weakness the past two months is allowing this Dow Jones stock to be purchased near the initial pattern confirmation price. Likewise, stochastics is supporting a buy entry right now.To go long in CAT stock, another lower cost offshoot of the collar is favored. Once again, there is some open-ended downside risk with this variation. Still, paying a slight discount of about 0.40% for the Aug $115 / $95 put spread and short Aug $140 call combination looks good both fundamentally and techncially.The information offered is based upon Christopher Tyler's observations and strictly intended for educational purposes only; the use of which is the responsibility of the individual.

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As a diplomatic tit-for-tat escalates between Washington and Beijing, millions of Chinese investors — defiant and patriotic — are once again engineering a fast and furious bull market on their home turf. The theme? Self-reliance.Two years ago, when the trade war first hit, China’s $8.5 trillion stock market sank into one of its deepest bear episodes, as worries about the economic damage of decoupling took root. This time, tension with the U.S. hasn't even made a dent. Rather, mainland shares are on fire. The benchmark CSI 300 Index has rallied 14% this year, to trade at a five-year high. The S&P 500 Index, by comparison, is still in the red. Daily trading volume has exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) for three consecutive trading days. The latest frenzy began right after Beijing imposed its national security law on Hong Kong, despite U.S. opposition. Now,  investors have renewed their faith that China is finally recognizing the importance of self-sufficiency. Bullish sell-side analysts are tossing around buzz words like national champions, import substitutes and capital market reforms; ultimately, these boil down the idea that turning inward is good for stocks. There are many examples. Consider Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., a chip foundry that counts Huawei Technologies Co. as its largest client. Rather than languishing as Huawei gets boxed out of U.S. technology, SMIC’s Hong Kong-listed shares are up over 200% this year.On the financing front, SMIC is behaving every bit like a national champion already. On May 15, the day Huawei got slapped with further sanctions, the state-owned China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, which held close to 20% of SMIC as of December 2019, said it would co-invest about $2.5 billion into one of its wafer plants. Meanwhile, securities regulators have fast-tracked the company’s plans to raise as much as $7.5 billion in Shanghai, the largest mainland initial public offering in a decade. Beijing is well aware that chip manufacturing is a capital-intensive business, and it must provide financial support as SMIC races to catch up on technology. In the industrial space, global supply-chain disruption is already benefiting Chinese players. For instance, Sany Heavy Industry Co., China’s largest excavator maker, has seen its domestic market share jump to 27% from 8% in 2010, at the expense of foreign brands, data provided by HSBC Holdings Plc show. No surprise, Sany’s stock is up 24% this year, while Caterpillar Inc., whose mainland market share shrank to 11% from 14% in 2016, is down 13.5%. Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co., a large manufacturer, tells a similar story. It’s up 55% this year. Washington’s  attempt to block mainland businesses’ access to U.S. money — from the delisting of Chinese American depositary receipts in New York, to forbidding federal pension funds from investing in mainland companies — is only forcing Beijing to speed up its capital markets reform. Regulators are already rewriting equity financing rules, including the launch of new registration-based IPOs, and opening new funding venues for young startups. As a result, we can expect China’s stock market to grow to 100% of its gross domestic product in the next five to 10 years, from 60% now, estimates CICC Research.When it comes to stock investing, China and the U.S. face the same set of problems. A slowing economy inevitably eats into corporate earnings growth, narrowing any justification for a further bull run.But President Donald Trump is giving China’s stock market a second wind. Huawei may prefer chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — after the U.S. sanctions, though, it may have no choice but hold its nose and buy domestic. Meanwhile, industry consolidation, which benefits domestic firms, is only accelerating now that Beijing is openly supporting its national champions. Trump is always looking at the stock market for validation. This time, he’s looking at the wrong one.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

(See his track record here.)Early indications on earnings, like the recent results from FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), and the prices of metals like copper and iron ore, have surprised to the upside, the analyst said.The BofA construction equipment dealer survey conducted in June suggests &quot;steady long term sentiment, an improvement in order patterns, somewhat balanced inventory levels, and a softening in pricing,&quot; he said. Construction equipment orders have risen from April's trough, and most dealers did not have elevated inventory levels, Gilardi said. The upgrades follow the severe underperformance of Caterpillar and Herc Holdings stocks year-to-date versus industry leader United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI), the analyst said. CAT, HRI Price Action: Caterpillar stock was up 0.24% at $127.50 at the time of publication Wednesday, while Herc Holdings was up 0.31% at $29.05.

2020-07-24,"Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a great American company, but the current economic conditions do not favor its prosperity. CAT stock depends on global growth. Currently, countries are struggling to stay afloat. The worldwide quarantine in March halted all business at the drop of a hat, so all expansion plans died almost overnight. The problem is that restarting growth is going to be a long slog.Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com The order to reopen businesses is easy, but what won't be easy is recapturing the growth momentum that was in motion before the crisis. Moreover, there will be restrictions going forward as panic has set in and threatens the way we did business before the novel coronavirus.With all this uncertainty in mind, infrastructure stocks will struggle until after the November election.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CAT Stock Is in Good HandsThe Caterpillar team has extensive crisis management experience. But this global quarantine was unique -- and almost all stocks crashed. From the January high to the March low, CAT stock lost more than 40% of its value. The bulls recovered most of it, but the easy work is done.This sounds bearish, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. There are technical opportunities looming just above and below current levels.CAT stock has been setting higher lows and hitting a roof near $141 since the March bottom. This makes for a great standoff, and so far, the bears have won battles at that line. The onus is on the bulls to take it out so they can trigger a spike. The reward for them if they do that is a $20 to $40 overshoot from there. It won't be easy and there is a lot of resistance in the way of that outcome.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever Fundamentally, the setting is not ideal for Caterpillar's business. The macroeconomic conditions are in shambles and hundreds of millions of people are out of work worldwide, so the demand for equipment is definitely depressed. Governments are in the process of reopening their countries but there have been hiccups, especially in the United States. The recovery ramp is not going to be steep. Investors must be humble with their upside enthusiasm.Luckily, CAT stock is not expensive with a 14 times price-earnings ratio. Moreover, there is very little froth in the stock price relative to its full-year sales. This means it doesn't have a lot of fat to shed like say Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) for example. The Stuck-in-the-Muck Trade OpportunitiesSource: Charts by TradingView I last wrote about CAT stock almost two years ago, and at the time, it was trading at similar levels. This is emblematic of how limited its upside potential is. Since it is not overvalued I would be more enticed to sell risk against support then chase potential rallies.Nevertheless, there are two opportunities from here. The first is to buy the stock on the breakout above $141 per share. This would be a momentum trade with a clear upside target. Or the second -- and my favorite -- is to sell premium against what others fear. I find it best to sell puts to generate income out of thin air against proven support zones.Using the options, I can sell the October $110 put and collect almost $2 for it. I don't even need a rally to win. In fact, CAT stock can fall almost 20% and this trade will still deliver its maximum gains. But if it falls below my put then I have to own the shares at $110 with a break-even level of $108. Without a new shoe to drop, owning Caterpillar at that price is not likely to be a mistake in the long run.At $108 per share it would have closed all the chart gaps this year and would be close enough to the Covid-19 low for support.The basic idea of today's setup is to trade Caterpillar stock by either chasing the momentum above $141 per share, or betting on the downside support from the quarantine. Otherwise, investors would be relying on a lot of &quot;hopium&quot; in order to profit.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc. offered little hope of a quick recovery in demand for its machinery, as concern of second waves of the coronavirus weighed on the prospects for the rest of the year.The Deerfield, Illinois-based company’s Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told analysts in a conference call that they shouldn’t expect margins to improve much in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Earlier, Caterpillar said that sales fell across the company’s business units, and it sees a similar percentage decrease in end-user demand in the third quarter.The drop in sales eclipsed a 25% reduction in total operating costs, which helped prop up adjusted profit in the second quarter at $1.03 a share, topping the 65-cent average analyst estimate. Dealers reduced inventories by $1.4 billion during the quarter, and the company expects that to increase to over $2 billion for the full year.Caterpillar fell 4.1% to $131.13 as of 10:21 a.m. in New York. The shares have declined 11% this year.“Analysts are going to be really tempted to extrapolate the earnings beat into the next couple of quarters, but Caterpillar’s management is being cautious and trying to keep analysts from doing that,” Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a telephone interview. “It’s probably appropriate.”Caterpillar, considered an industrial bellwether, has been cutting costs and paring production to shore up profit. But as signs of stabilization and incremental improvement begin to emerge, the focus is likely to turn toward the trajectory of a recovery, Bloomberg Intelligence said this month.The report comes amid tentative signs of recovery in some of the main markets for the company’s signature yellow machines. Miners have expressed a modicum of optimism as they continue churning out metal despite virus outbreaks. And manufacturing indexes are pointing to some gains in major economies including China.To be sure, Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby tempered analysts’ expectations by reminding them a lot of uncertainty remains about the virus.“It’s very much a fluid, dynamic situation,” he said on the earnings call. “It’s difficult for me to really predict any area other than right now.”The second-quarter announcement comes after Caterpillar had extended plant closures for longer than expected, in a signal that the economic recovery was progressing slowly.Bonfield said Friday in a telephone interview that the company will do more factory shutdowns as needed to respond to demand changes.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Sees Little Hope for Quick Recovery in Demand

2020-07-31,"Over the past three months, shares of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) rose by 26.39%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Caterpillar has.Caterpillar's Debt Based on Caterpillar's balance sheet as of May 6, 2020, long-term debt is at $24.37 billion and current debt is at $12.72 billion, amounting to $37.09 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $7.12 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $29.97 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Caterpillar's $75.89 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.49. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: Caterpillar Q2 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For July 31, 2020  * Caterpillar's Earnings: A Preview(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-02,"Shares of Caterpillar (CAT) fell almost 2.8% on Friday despite beating 2Q earnings estimates. Its 2Q adjusted earnings of $1.03 per share exceeded analysts’ estimates of $0.64. Moreover, revenues of $10 billion surpassed Street estimates of $9.38 billion. However, the company's outlook for dealer inventories weighed on its stock.During the second quarter, dealers reduced inventories for new equipment by $1.4 billion. The company now anticipates dealer inventories to decline by over $2 billion in 2020, up from its previous estimate of $1.5 billion.Following 2Q earnings, Oppenheimer analyst Noah Kaye reiterated his Hold rating on the stock. He said, &quot;While decrementals of 32% were consistent with our cross-cycle analysis, sales in construction, mining, and E&T broadly showed resilience.&quot;On July 24, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Stanley Elliott lifted the price target to $150 (12.9% upside potential) from $135 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. Elliott highlighted several “recent data points that suggest some upside relative to expectations for the machinery business.” He argued, “The results of component supplier Carlisle Brake & Friction, as well as Volvo Construction Equipment trends that were better than feared, suggest potential upside to Q2 and Q3 sell-side expectations, particularly in Caterpillar's machinery segments.”Overall, CAT analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock. The average analyst price target stands at $139.89, implying 5.3% upside potential from current levels.

2020-08-05,"Shares of Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $134.61.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-07  * Strike Price: $133.00  * Volume: 729  * Open Interest: 9153 Indications of Unusual Options Activity One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies to Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * A Look Into Caterpillar's Debt  * Recap: Caterpillar Q2 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 6.84%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on CATDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 26.18 in the Farm & Heavy Construction Machinery industry, Caterpillar Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 18.78.

2020-08-21,"At first glance, investors have reason for optimism regarding the nightmare that is the novel coronavirus. First, new daily infections appear to be declining significantly. Just as importantly, major economic data -- such as the national unemployment rate -- have surprisingly ticked lower. This may lull us into complacency when it comes to selecting top stocks to buy.However, investors should remain vigilant for paradigm-shifting developments. While I don't think these forward events are necessarily all doom and gloom, they will probably be enough to warrant serious strategy changes. Whatever were the top stocks to buy prior to this pandemic may not play out so profitably in the new normal.Specifically, the Federal Reserve has little choice but to adopt a dovish monetary policy. Yes, unemployment is down. But the number of permanent job losses remains uncomfortably elevated. If we don't get relief soon, many small businesses could wind up closing their doors forever.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis isn't an empty threat. Earlier in this pandemic, economic experts estimated that more than 100,000 small businesses had already permanently closed. With Congress deciding it's more important to go on vacation than to help the American people, we could see substantial turmoil ahead. Therefore, the Fed will adopt an accommodative stance, which may benefit these top stocks to buy:  * Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)  * Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW)  * Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM)  * Ford (NYSE:F)  * Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)  * 3M (NYSE:MMM)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX)  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)Finally, we're not quite out of the woods with the coronavirus. Yes, cases are down, but medical experts warn that mass-scale testing has also declined. Sadly, this begs for an even greater wave to hit us in the winter, resulting in deeper economic pain. At least with these hot stocks to gain off dollar weakness, you won't be caught off guard. Top Stocks: Newmont Corporation (NEM)Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock If the greenback goes on a weakening spree, there's one asset that shines above the rest. Of course, I'm talking about gold. As a safe haven, gold provides confidence as the universal store of value. However, physical precious metals can be cumbersome, to say the least. Therefore, investors may want to consider blue-chip mining companies like Newmont Corporation.According to its website, Newmont &quot;has the largest gold reserve base in the industry.&quot; With gold prices moving higher based off economic uncertainty and social unrest, NEM stock is in an enviable position. In addition, Newmont generated nearly $2.4 billion in the quarter ended June 30, up almost 5% against the year-ago quarter.I expect shares to represent one of the top stocks to buy for the rest of this year and over the next several years. No matter who is put in charge come November, the next presidential administration will have a doggedly difficult journey. Under these conditions, physical gold is your best bet in my opinion. Next to that are shares of NEM stock. Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)Source: Shutterstock While gold is an obvious play if the U.S. dollar weakens, you shouldn't ignore other precious metals - they're called precious for a reason. For this simple fact, investors should consider adding Sibanye Stillwater to their list of top stocks to buy.Sibanye offers a trifecta of bullishness for metals bugs, as the company is the &quot;world's largest primary producer of platinum, the second largest primary producer of palladium and the third largest producer of gold (on a gold-equivalent basis)…&quot; Of these, I'm particularly interested in palladium and platinum.For one thing, palladium is incredibly rare. Useful as an automotive catalyst, we may see a shift from industrial to monetary demand. With a price tag of over $2,200 at time of writing, palladium is still the most expensive precious metal among the four major ones. However, with Russia owning most of the palladium supply, SBSW stock is well positioned thanks to Sibanye's more favorable location in South Africa.Second, platinum is no slouch either in the rarity department. But the metal also has significant demand from industrial and medical industries. These sectors will be relevant no matter what the state of the global economy, potentially insulating SBSW stock. Top Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com While precious metals clearly have significant upside in a weakened dollar environment, don't ignore other vital commodities. Over the last several years, lithium has gained significant attention due to its use as a power source for advanced electrical technologies. And among the top stocks in this sector is Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile.Currently, SQM stock enjoys two longer-term tailwinds. First, the present economic malaise almost guarantees a dovish, accommodative policy. That translates to an inflationary setup for the U.S. dollar, which is positive for commodities. Second, the electric vehicle revolution means lithium will only rise in demand. Indeed, with so many EV competitors out there, it's difficult to know which one will be the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).With SQM stock, you don't have to play any guessing games. They all need lithium.Further, Sociedad enjoys advantages over other lithium miners because of its geopolitically favorable geography. For the most part, we're on good terms with Chile. Therefore, you should keep SQM on your list of top stocks to buy now and for the foreseeable future. Ford (F)Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com For decades Ford has suffered a perception problem. Though the iconic automaker has made a push recently to improve reliability and quality, it's hard to magically erase a culture of mediocrity. Don't get me wrong -- I know people who swear by Ford's modern cars. But the ghosts of the past have haunted the company and by extension, F stock.But with Ford's pivot to electric vehicles, specifically its Mustang Mach-E SUV, I believe the company has the chance to make things right. So much so that I went ahead and bought some F stock on the cheap. Although I don't like American cars at all, I recognize the potential upside.First, with EVs, they are inherently more reliable than combustion-engine cars because of fewer moving parts. So, throw the reliability stigma out the window. Second, Tesla overwhelmingly dominates the EV market. But people eventually want variety -- we couldn't imagine a world where only one manufacturer produces combustion cars.To this end, I think the Mach-E is very attractive. And I wouldn't worry about criticisms that Ford is doing away with its classic two-door pony cars. Nobody buys those things anymore.Finally, a weakened dollar makes our exports more attractive to foreign buyers. This generation's Ford should finally capture the magic abroad. Top Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT)Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com Amid the drama of this pandemic, it's easy to forget about &quot;boring&quot; names like Caterpillar. While it may not generate headlines during this period, CAT stock has been a high-flier since its March doldrums. Should the dollar weaken considerably from here on out, I expect Caterpillar to maintain its position as one of the top stocks to buy.Historically, Caterpillar has performed relatively well when the Federal Reserve has implemented dovish monetary policies. When the greenback is weaker against other major currencies, American exports are comparatively cheaper. And for CAT stock, this is brilliant news as the underlying company generates more than half its sales from international markets.Should President Donald Trump win reelection, this would be an even bigger signal to trust Caterpillar. In the historic 2016 presidential campaign, Trump routinely talked up the industrial equipment manufacturer. Either way, whoever wins the White House must start rebuilding the economy, which should be a positive for CAT. 3M (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com In previous years when we had a strong dollar, this negatively affected applied science and industrial firms like 3M. Logically, if the situation reverses, we should see some positive trading action for MMM stock. Of course, nothing is ever that cut and dry in the markets. However, it does provide one reason among several to consider 3M.First, the rather ho-hum company suddenly surged to relevance because of the pandemic. When the virus first struck us, people panicked and hoarded N95 face masks. Perhaps this alone isn't a good enough reason to buy MMM stock considering its other vulnerabilities. However, this crisis is unlike any other we've suffered in modern American history in that everyone has been impacted in some way.This is not a lesson we'll soon forget. Therefore, people may buy 3M-branded protective equipment, just in case.Further, 3M products are popular overseas so this action could be repeated across several countries. And with a weaker dollar, that should add up to some hefty sales, making 3M one of the underappreciated top stocks to buy. Top Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Logically, a weakened dollar translates to a favorable environment for American exporters. And one of the top stocks to buy in this space for reliability and consistency is Microsoft. Admittedly, it doesn't quite have the cachet of other elite consumer electronic firms. However, that could be changing because of the pandemic.As I've argued before, Microsoft products are very practical. And that comes into play significantly in the workplace. With so many people forced to shift their operations remotely, Microsoft's dominance in business applications should help lift MSFT stock. In addition, the company has a substantial presence globally. Therefore, with the greenback falling against other currencies, we could see a favorable impact.Finally, I like MSFT stock for its strong position in video games. As you probably know, the company is scheduled to release its latest Xbox console for the holiday season this year. Though competition is very stiff in this arena, Microsoft more than holds its own. Combined with its myriad other businesses, such as cloud computing and hardware, you'll want to keep close tabs on MSFT. Becton Dickinson (BDX)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com A longstanding American medical equipment company, Becton Dickinson offers pertinent exposure to the broader healthcare market. Unfortunately, the novel coronavirus took some of the shine off BDX stock, with investors piling into biotechnology firms as a speculative bet on a vaccine. Still, once some of that corona-fever fades out, Becton Dickinson should swing higher.For starters, the company has enjoyed significant growth in the past three years over its core businesses of medication delivery solutions, medication management, pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care.Second, Becton Dickinson generates approximately 43% of its revenue from international markets. In prior years when the U.S. dollar was rising against other currencies, the company incurred negative exchange rate impacts. As well, BDX stock has been flat in at least some of those years featuring currency headwinds.Intriguingly, though, BDX shares jumped substantially higher in 2017 when the U.S. dollar index plummeted. If the greenback continues its bearish trend -- and especially if Trump wins reelection -- BDX could be one of the surprising top stocks in the healthcare space. Top Stocks: Intel (INTC)Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com Want to go a little crazy? If underlying economic conditions continue to drive the greenback down, you should consider throwing some speculative money at Intel. Of course, INTC stock has suffered all kinds of volatility following Intel's disclosure of delays to its next-generation chips until 2022. That was a huge disaster, which subsequently saw Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jump to record highs.Given the catastrophe to its longtime rival, this is a massive opportunity for AMD. However, one also has to wonder about its equity performance potential from here on out. For those seeking an undervalued opportunity, INTC stock seems a not unreasonable bet.For instance, while the fallout has been ugly for Intel, INTC shares have bounced off a support level that's been in place since late 2017. If the situation was truly untenable for Intel, you'd expect a much steeper selloff.Also, the company has a renowned brand and significant market share across relevant tech sectors. It may take more than a production delay -- no matter how significant -- to take down this beast.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare.

2020-08-28,"The US economy contracted 31.7% (revised estimate) on an annualized basis in the second quarter, marking the steepest decline ever. The COVID-19 pandemic erased millions of jobs and crushed several businesses. The fate of the companies in the industrial sector is closely tied to the economy.Heavy equipment manufacturers like Deere and Caterpillar are significantly impacted by the economic downturn. However, Deere’s recent results indicated that the situation may be better-than-feared.   We will analyze the recent performance of Deere and Caterpillar and use the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.Deere (DE)Deere impressed investors with its better-than-anticipated results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended August 2) and a better outlook for the full fiscal year despite continued uncertainty. The company’s fiscal third-quarter revenue declined 11.1% to $8.93 billion and EPS fell 8.5% Y/Y to $2.57 as shipments dropped amid the crisis.The farm equipment company, which derived about 68% of its last year’s net sales from the Agriculture and Turf business, stated that the demand for small tractors remained strong in the quarter due to an increase in projects for home and property owners amid the pandemic. The segment’s sales declined 5% to $5.67 billion due to lower shipment volumes. But the decline was lower than anticipated supported by higher pricing.It now expects fiscal 2020 sales for the Agriculture and Turf business to fall 10% compared to the previous forecast of 10% to 15% decline. That's thanks to the benefit from replacement demand as the farm equipment fleet continues to age out.Deere’s Construction and Forestry segment’s sales fell 28% to $2.19 billion reflecting lower shipment amid the crisis, partially offset by higher pricing to some extent. The company is now anticipating a 25% fall in the segment’s fiscal 2020 sales, reflecting an improved outlook compared to the previous forecast of a 30% to 40% drop.Most importantly, Deere has been curbing its production to right-size its inventory levels and is also cutting down costs amid challenging market conditions. These efforts and a faster than anticipated recovery helped the company raise its fiscal 2020 net income forecast to $2.25 billion, up from the previous projection of $1.6 to $2.0 billion.At the same time, Deere plans to intensify its investments in Precision Agriculture as farmers are seeking advanced technologies and more automation. It is also enhancing its capabilities in the aftermarket and retrofit business.Following the results, RBC Capital analyst Seth Weber increased his price target for Deere stock to $228 from $180. The analyst maintained his Buy rating as the company’s fiscal third-quarter results and improved guidance for fiscal 2020 highlight its &quot;ability to navigate fluid markets&quot;.Weber also raised his fiscal 2020 EPS estimate to $7.21 from $6.15 and fiscal 2021 view to $9.45 from $8.65. He believes that the company is well-positioned for fiscal 2021 based on its agriculture orders and declining inventory in construction. (See DE stock analysis on TipRanks)Based on 12 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell, Deere scores a Moderate Buy consensus from the Street. Deere stock was up about 21.8% year-to-date as of August 26. An average analyst price target of $217.44 indicates a further upside of 3.1% over the next 12 months.Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar beat analysts’ predictions for the second quarter but COVID-19 caused a significant decline in its top-line and earnings due to lower demand in the company’s end markets. The second-quarter revenue fell 30.7% Y/Y to $10 billion while its adjusted EPS plunged 70.3% to $0.84.The pandemic caused Caterpillar’s dealers to cut machine and engine inventories by about $1.4 billion compared to an increase of $500 million in 2019’s second quarter. Revenue from the company’s larger segments--Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation fell 37.4% and 24.4%, respectively. And revenue from Resource Industries and Financial Products declined 35.2% and 12.6%.One favorable trend in the second quarter was that the Asia Pacific business fared better than North America due to improved demand in China. Caterpillar did not provide any full-year guidance, unlike Deere. But, it cautioned that it expects dealers to reduce their inventory by over $2 billion by year-end.The company expects the residential construction business to improve in North America and drive the demand for small equipment. Deere is also optimistic about the medium and long-term prospects for mining, although it expects the overall demand for Resource Industries to remain soft.Within the Energy & Transportation business, the company expects to benefit from demand for data centers and emergency power while continued challenges in oil and gas might hurt the demand for reciprocating engines.On August 3, Credit Suisse analyst Jamie Cook raised her price target for Caterpillar to $159 from $144 and maintained a Buy rating based on a better-than-expected quarter. Cook noted that the market was disappointed by Caterpillar's third-quarter forecast which indicates that the sales and margins will be down sequentially, implying that the second quarter is not the trough of earnings.However, the analyst believes that Caterpillar’s earnings will bounce back next year and that the company’s bottom line has been more resilient than in prior downturns. (See CAT stock analysis on TipRanks)Caterpillar stock has declined about 4% so far in 2020 and the average analyst price target of $141.07 does not indicate a possible upside. Eight Buys, 9 holds and 1 Sell add up to a Moderate Buy rating for Caterpillar stock.The better stockDeere stock has outperformed Caterpillar on a year-to-date basis. Also, analysts on average see more upside in Deere stock compared to Caterpillar. Deere’s recent performance has shown that it is more resilient compared to Caterpillar. In particular, Deere has more exposure to farming, while Caterpillar relies more on construction, mining and power equipment.Meanwhile, Caterpillar’s valuation multiple is lower than Deere and it has a higher dividend yield of 2.9% compared to Deere’s 1.4%. However, Deere looks more poised to recover faster post COVID-19. About 70% of analysts covering Deere have a Buy rating vs 44% in the case of Caterpillar.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-10-09,"Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) shares experienced unusual options activity on Friday. The stock price moved up to $158.09 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $150.00  * Volume: 535  * Open Interest: 1198Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The analyst expects global growth to accelerate in 2021, suggested by the recent increases in OECD leading indicators and commodity prices.""Historical response to acceleration in leading indicators, commodity prices, and other factors suggest CAT's P/E should inflate to at least 30x next 12-month earnings.""Market trends could begin improving during the first half of 2021, Casey said.""Combining this with absence of both COVID-19 economy shutdowns and 2020 inventory reduction initiatives, we expect CAT's revenue growth from these end markets to begin mid- to late-H1 21,"" the analyst said.

2020-10-27,"After stumbling to start the week, it looks like Wall Street is trying to get back on its feet this morning. Major indices--which recovered some of their losses in the last hour yesterday--made up more ground in pre-market trading despite fading stimulus hopes and more shutdowns due to COVID-19.Maybe a fresh batch of earnings can help wipe out yesterday's ugly memories. It's a full day, with three of the biggest Health Care firms reporting this morning. Then Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) leads a host of companies after the close (see more below). Another Tech company reporting today is chip firm Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), which made headlines this morning with its agreement to buy rival Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX) for $35 billion in stock. That's the second major chip sector merger and acquisition (M&A) news in the last week, following Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC) move to sell its flash memory business to a South Korean firm.Things are moving in the chip sector, and this deal today by AMD is likely to heat up the data center competition between it and INTC. This sector could look completely different by the end of the year from where it started. Health companies reporting today include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), which gave an update on its COVID-19 vaccine. Around two-thirds of the more than 40,000 people enrolled in late-stage clinical trials have been dosed, and PFE plans to apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in late November.Those are the bare bones, anyway. Perhaps PFE's call will provide more color. It's been a while since one of the major pharma firms has been in the spotlight this much, though it's unclear how much of an impact the vaccine might have on PFE's future earnings and revenue.  Getting back to the financials, results so far today look mixed. PFE reported slightly better than expected earnings per share, but Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) missed analysts' estimates. Earnings from 3M Co (NYSE: MMM) looked pretty good. Meanwhile, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) also had a nice quarter from a ""beat the Street"" perspective, and its shares have been slowly but surely plowing ahead lately. However, it's important to keep results from all these firms in context. Most are down from a year ago, including a 23% revenue decline at CAT which the company attributed to ""lower end-user demand for equipment and services."" Then again, considering the year we've had, it's probable sales will be lower year-over-year for just about everyone whose company isn't named Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) or Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON). CAT has major exposure to China, whose economy has been emerging nicely from the pandemic, so check for any color they might add on business there during the call. CAT shares moved a bit lower after the earnings release, which is hard to figure out since its report looked solid and it said it expects better demand in Q4 than in Q3. Again, with the big Industrial firms, it's the conference calls that stand out.  Executives often face tough questions from analysts and might explain their outlook and current business atmosphere in more detail. Many companies, including CAT, still aren't offering formal guidance. There's some data ahead this morning, too. Consumer confidence is key to watch heading into the holiday season. Wall Street consensus is for a relatively solid September headline figure of 101.9, according to research firm Briefing.com. That's about even with August, but consider looking deeper into the report to get a sense of how consumers feel about the near future. U.S. durable goods orders rose more than expected in September, another good sign. And crude oil ticked up a little bit this morning but remains on the defensive after yesterday's steep losses. A hurricane headed for the Gulf of Mexico seems to be helping crude this morning, but prices usually roll right back after the storm passes and the U.S. price is still below $39 a barrel. Tomorrow brings the latest U.S. weekly supply and production update.Boeing Waits In The Wings Things were rough for Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) even before COVID-19. The company's 737-MAX was grounded way back in March 2019, and remains in the hangar. BA sold exactly zero new airliners in September and suffered more 737-MAX order cancellations. Boeing has booked 67 orders so far this year, but it's suffered 448 cancellations for the MAX and dropped another 602 orders from its backlog because the company isn't sure it can complete the sales with so many airlines in financial trouble, the Chicago Tribune reported. Then early this week, more headwinds swirled. China's government said Monday it will impose sanctions on U.S. military contractors including BA's defense unit and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) for supplying weapons to rival Taiwan. All this means there's not an incredible amount for investors to hang their hats on going into BA's Q3 earnings report tomorrow. Shares recently traded near 2020 lows at around $160, down from north of $400 in early 2019. How times have changed for this once high-flying company. It doesn't look much better from a financial reporting point of view. BA is expected to report a loss of $2.47 a share in Q3, analysts said, sharply worse than the positive $1.45 earnings per share it booked a year ago. The average Wall Street revenue estimate is $14.49 billion, down more than 27% from the same quarter last year.If there's anything to hang that hat on, maybe it's recent headlines that Europe's top safety regulator cleared the MAX for use, and American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) plans to relaunch the airplane at the very end of this year. Optimism isn't exactly bubbling up on Wall Street ahead of tomorrow's BA earnings report. A Credit Suisse analyst wrote that ""it's difficult to see a substantial post-results rally except in the case of exceptionally better-than-expected results (or) forward commentary that can meaningfully alter the narrative."" A Quick Look Back If you have the stomach for it, let's take a quick review of yesterday. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell nearly 2% for its worst session in over a month. Interestingly, the SPX finished right at 3400, which was just below technical support at the 50-day moving average.That 3400 finish did reflect a very late comeback attempt from the day's lows. It could be interesting to see if stocks get any kind of bounce from that today. Also, the Nasdaq (COMP) didn't fall as much as the SPX yesterday, which could be a sign of people coming back into some of the ""stay-at-home"" names in Tech.The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) climbed above 33 to its highest level since early September. A rising VIX often represents a warning signal, and it had stayed beneath the psychological 30 level for weeks. The sector map was a virtual sea of red Monday, with only a few stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors lighting up green. It all boils down to record levels of virus infections and investors pretty much throwing in the towel on any chance of a fiscal stimulus before the election. In fact, there's talk that if we don't get a jolt of federal money ahead of next Tuesday, it might be a long time coming, no matter which party emerges triumphant. There's not a lot of optimism that a lame-duck Congress can accomplish much, so that could push things back all the way till after the inauguration.Basically, investors saw that and started to recalibrate. They'd spent a few weeks putting some premium into stocks as it looked like Congress and the administration might come through, but that premium's being pulled out. At a sector-level, Energy suffered the worst punishment with losses of more than 3% Monday as crude oil capsized. But some of the sectors that had been doing better recently like Financials and Industrials--areas that tend to do well when the economy strengthens--also got taken to the woodshed. Still Time For Stimulus, And Microsoft's ""X"" Factor Worth Watching This all sounds kind of gloomy going into the darkest, coldest months of the year, but remember, no one can predict how the political winds blow. There are seven days left for Congress and the president to agree on something, even if it's less than what some investors had hoped. Things could turn on a dime if the skies become sunny in Washington and stimulus talk gets positive. Another positive factor could be earnings. This is a monumental week with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) later today and four of the five FAANGS going on Thursday, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Earnings season so far has been far better than analysts had expected, but we're only about 25% done. This week could get us to around 50% and give investors a much better sense of how corporations are dealing with so many challenges.When MSFT reports later on, investors should consider closely watching the company's guidance. Analysts expect strength as MSFT likely benefits from people working at home, and they'll also be watching for any hint of how holiday Xbox sales might be shaping up. As always, MSFT's Azure cloud platform growth will probably get close scrutiny from Wall Street.CHART OF THE DAY: CHANNELING CRUDE SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE. After failing to break out above $42 to the upside on several occasions over the past couple months (upper blue line), WTI Crude Oil futures (/CL) have come under pressure, with chart watchers eyeing a possible test of the mid-$36 level (lower blue line), where /CL has found some support in recent days. Data source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  GDP Watch is On: This week is all about earnings, but there's some important data due Thursday. That's when investors are set to get a first look at the government's estimate for Q3 gross domestic product (GDP). It fell more than 30% in Q2, but analysts look for a big comeback in Q3. Research firm CFRA told investors they could expect around a 33.5% GDP gain on an annualized basis, followed by a Q4 advance of 6.0% and a 2021 gain of 5.4%. Needless to say, 33.5% growth isn't something ever seen before, and even a full-year gain of 5.4% as CFRA sees for 2021 is the best in a long, long time going back to before the 2008 financial crisis. It probably needs to be taken in context, however, because the comparison to 2020 will likely be a pretty easy one. Also, keep in mind that the 33.5% gain is vs. the prior quarter, not the prior year. And Q2 saw GDP fall more than 30%. One Week to Go: Seven days ahead of the election, several sectors stand out as more likely to feel impact from the aftermath. These include Financials, Health Care, and Energy. All of these are often seen as more exposed to possible tax and regulatory changes in a changing political atmosphere. For instance, there's widespread market belief that a ""blue"" Senate and White House would tighten pressure on drug company pricing, keep banks under a microscope and perhaps limit hydraulic fracking and add more environmental laws. From that sense, the historic belief is that Republican control favors those sectors and vice versa. Materials are another sector to keep an eye on, particularly if Democrats take control and appear to be on a path toward some sort of major infrastructure spend. Watch banks, too, which would presumably get a tailwind from any sign of rising interest rates on thoughts of more government spending. The dollar could continue to decline if that raises questions about possible inflation, and a weaker dollar tends to be helpful for multinational companies that have half or more of their revenue coming from overseas.A Penny Saved...Remember those big jars of coins your parents or grandparents kept in the basement? Or the packets of sugar and butter your grandma might have quietly slipped into her purse at restaurants? An entire generation that grew up in the Great Depression developed a ""saving"" mentality. That was accompanied for some by a fear of investing, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) took nearly 25 years to fully recover (on an inflationary-adjusted basis) to the peak level before the 1929 crash.While COVID-19 hasn't had that kind of impact on stocks, it does appear to have people back in the saving mode, according to numerous media reports over the weekend. Those who received government stimulus checks or extra unemployment benefits last spring likely stashed the cash in the bank, economists said. While you never can conclude too much based on one weekend's flurry of media reports, this isn't necessarily the kind of news you want to hear as an investor.Consumer spending drives the economy, and we're heading into the holiday season, a time when many companies depend on shoppers to come out and spend. That was already in doubt thanks to the pandemic, and the recent wave of new virus cases could deal another blow. Many consumers might not get more able or willing to spend until unemployment gets much closer to normal levels, analysts warned, as uncertainty around the job market makes people nervous.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-10-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc. failed to reassure investors that a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining momentum.On a conference call Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said he wouldn’t be giving 2021 guidance. The company reported third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by lower-than-expected taxes.Caterpillar, considered a bellwether for the global economy, has been cutting costs to blunt the impact of still-sluggish orders in energy and mining. The company said Tuesday that retail machine sales fell 20% in September, extending a string of declines. The report comes as a resurgent virus hampers efforts to reopen economies, renewing global demand concerns.The stock has been among the best performers in U.S. markets on bets that sales were on the mend after virus shutdowns dented demand for its signature yellow machines. Caterpillar shares fell 3.2% to close at $157.91 in New York, the biggest decline in more than a month. They climbed 18% in the third quarter.“The lack of sequential improvement in September retail sales is somewhat disappointing,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Christopher Ciolino. “Even as management anticipates less of a decline in fourth-quarter end-user demand versus the third quarter, the outlook for normal seasonality in fourth-quarter sales would suggest a more sluggish improvement than consensus expectations.”A bright spot for the rest of the year may be China, where government efforts to bolster growth in the wake of pandemic shutdowns are stoking demand. The heavy-equipment maker now expects an “up” year for sales in China’s construction market despite the shutdown in the first quarter, mainly helped by stimulus, according to Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield.“Obviously, the China government is stimulating the economy to try and recover post Covid, and it’s very strong, particularly in the excavation market,” said in a phone interview following the earnings report. Bonfield also said the company is in a “battle” for market share in China.Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar suspended its earnings forecast earlier this year because of uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus.Third-Quarter ResultsAdjusted profit for the three months through September was $1.34 a share, down from $2.66 in the same period a year earlier, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts had estimated $1.13, based on the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Third-quarter revenue fell 23% from the same period a year earlier to $9.88 billion. The decline was mostly due to lower sales volume driven by lower end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the third quarter of 2020 than during the third quarter of 2019, the company said.“We’re encouraged by positive signs in certain industries and geographies,” Caterpillar CEO Umpleby said in the statement. “We’re executing our strategy and are ready to respond quickly to changing market conditions.”CEO Umpleby said on the conference call with analysts an investors that the company expects to raise its dividend again next year.Caterpillar expects operating margins to improve in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, according to the company’s presentation. It also said it expects dealers to reduce inventory levels by about $700 million in the fourth quarter, and by $2.5 billion for the year.With the recent run-up in Caterpillar’s shares, the third-quarter results and four-quarter outlook “may not provide enough excitement for additional near-term performance,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said in a report. “While we see no major red flags, it appears any meaningful improvement in fundamentals will be pushed at least to 2021.”(Updates with shares in the 4th graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Offers Little Insight Into Global Recovery

Investors were disappointed with the significant decline in the company’s earnings due to weak demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Industrial machinery maker Caterpillar’s (CAT) 3Q adjusted EPS declined 50% year-over-year to $1.34, but the figure was ahead of analysts’ $1.18 forecast.Revenue declined about 23% to $9.88 billion, due to lower end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact of a decrease in dealer inventories. Analysts expected revenue of $9.80 billion.The pandemic had a significant impact on Caterpillar’s business, and caused a revenue decline across all of its divisions and geographies as well. Notably, revenue from the Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation segments declined 23%, 21% and 24%, respectively. (See CAT stock analysis on TipRanks)Caterpillar did not provide any guidance for 4Q or the full-year but stated that it expects sales and end-user demand to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter. On the conference call, the company disclosed that dealers reduced their inventories by $600 million in 3Q and by $1.8 billion year-to-date. It now expects dealers to bring down their inventories by about $2.5 billion by year-end.Oppenheimer analyst Noah Kaye reiterated a Hold rating following the earnings release, saying, “While we believe the probable lapping of FY20’s $2.5B dealer inventory reduction headwind was well-understood, management was also incrementally constructive on recovery in mining and North American construction, and noted higher-than-typical inventory levels as reflective of confidence in an upturn.”“Our revised estimates contemplate FY21 revenues comparable to FY17, with a flatter subsequent recovery in FY22, but better margin performance vs. past periods as CAT continues to benefit from O&E [Operating & Execution] model implementation. Still, at 16x our revised FY22 EPS estimate, we believe current valuation has contemplated these factors, and remain sidelined,” Kaye added.Caterpillar scores a Moderate Buy analyst consensus from the Street based on 6 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell.

2020-10-30,"Industrial stocks continue to claw back their losses, although the sector has not been as robust as some other areas of the market. The sector is still 10.6% below its prior 2020 highs. Those were set in the first quarter of the year, before the novel coronavirus rattled the market. 
For what it’s worth, that’s about average vs. the other industries and the overall market. The S&P 500 is down 7.3% from its highs, although it was able to set new highs even after the pandemic selloff. 
When considering the other 10 S&P 500 sectors, the industrial sector is in the top six when it comes to how far off its highs it is. With five sectors below it, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI) is in the middle of the pack. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When it comes to performance though, it’s in the bottom half. 
Over the past year, industrial stocks have lost over 4%. That’s better than three other groups. However, it lags seven other sectors, three of which have generated double-digit returns in that time.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

In the end, though, that doesn’t matter. Industrial stocks have been around for centuries and they will be around for centuries more. Let’s look at seven industrial stocks that are worth buying now. 
Honeywell (NYSE:HON)
United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS)
FedEx (NYSE:FDX)
Boeing (NYSE:BA)
3M Co (NYSE:MMM)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)

Industrial Stocks to Buy: Honeywell (HON)
 Source:  josefkubes / Shutterstock.com
	
Considered by many to be a best-in-breed industrial name, it’s hard to lead off a list of industrial stocks and not include Honeywell. Unfortunately, though, HON stock has kept pace with the sector’s performance. 
Yet, despite a massive selloff in the markets lately, HON stock is only down 7% on the year. Considering that so much of the industrial sector’s business is tied to the economy, things could look a lot worse.
In any regard, Honeywell has its feelers in all the right places. 
The company has made its living dominating areas such as aerospace and control panels. The latter are used for a lot of things, from machinery to thermostats. Over the years though, Honeywell has built on its offerings. 
It includes safety equipment, healthcare, pharma, manufacturing and supply chain management. For its buildings and city unit, the company states, “From skyscrapers to stadiums to shopping centers, drive connectivity, productivity and security for everyone in them.”
Further, Honeywell is expanding into the internet of things, or more specifically, the Industrial Internet of Things. For many investors, they like that HON stock is capitalizing on its legacy businesses, while also expanding into new frontiers. 
Plus, Honeywell pays out a 2.3% dividend yield. 

United Parcel Service (UPS)

Is there an industrial company better prepared to handle an influx in demand than UPS? Because of the pandemic, this logistics operator is now benefiting from a sharp rise in e-commerce sales. 
That’s right — it’s not just Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reaping revenue from our current situation. Big-box retailers, e-commerce venders and others have all seen an explosion in online sales. If you haven’t had the time to go through last quarter’s earnings results, just look at information from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. It shows that online sales have made up a growing percentage of overall retail sales for years. But in 2020, that figure has exploded.
In any case, that has resulted in big-time business for UPS. Revenue is forecast to climb over 9% this year, but that may be conservative. In Q3, revenue ballooned 15.9% year over year to $21.2 billion. That smashed expectations by over $1 billion.

Unless you expect online sales to slow, UPS doesn’t seem like a name to bet against. It’s currently one of the stronger industrial stocks on the market.

FedEx (FDX)

The only reason some investors interested in industrial stocks may skip over UPS is to take a closer look at FedEx. 
What I love about FDX stock is the same thing I like about UPS: demand is simply overpowering the two companies. When customers can’t get enough of a companies’ goods and services, that’s a great problem to have. 
Of course, one day, Amazon’s own delivery services may create a problem for FedEx and UPS. However, that problem is not one we’re seeing right now. FedEx is forecast to grow revenue by a similar amount to UPS this quarter, up 10.7%. 
Moreover, it’s the company’s explosion in earnings that we should take notice of. Last quarter, earnings of $4.87 per share beat estimates by more than $2 a share. 
Consensus expectations — which may now prove conservative — call for 67% earnings growth this year. That’s not a one-year gain, followed by a reversion year, either. Analysts expect almost 10% growth next year, too. 
At the end of the day, shares trade at over 17.6 times this year’s forward earnings. At the very least that’s reasonable. One could even make the case that it’s cheap, given the secular trend in e-commerce sales and the earnings boom at FedEx. 

Boeing (BA)

Boeing is a bit of a controversial pick down here, isn’t it? Of all the industrial stocks, this one has so many negative catalysts working against it that it’s hard to be excited. 
To be frank, shares are down 55% this year and down 67% from the all-time highs made in February 2019. That’s when Boeing’s second 737 MAX jet crashed, sending the company into a rabbit hole of headaches, controversy and losses. 
Throw in the fact that the aerospace industry has been ravished by the novel coronavirus, too, and many are wondering why Boeing would be a buy. 
So, why is it?
Boeing is one half of a duopoly on plane manufacturing. Between Boeing and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), virtually all large jets are made by the two companies. And while BA stock may take a while to regain its crown, it can’t go much lower from here. At least, from a business perspective. 
Add in that the U.S. government has a national interest in seeing Boeing survive (and really, thrive) as a defense contractor, and there’s even less reason to worry about the company’s liquidity. 
Further, the 737 MAX is making progress toward getting back into flight — although whether or not consumers accept the plane is another story. European regulators just gave it the green light. Boeing now waits on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). But by and large, the negatives are starting to fade away for Boeing, and its future is looking brighter.


					7 Growth Stocks Running On Fumes				

Perhaps this one is still too risky for investors who want it at a lower price. But, to me, this looks like a buy-and-throw-it-in-the-bottom-drawer kind of situation — with a multi-year outlook. 

3M Co (MMM)
 Click to EnlargeSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com
	
When it comes to industrial stocks with dependable dividends, 3M is near the top of the list. The company kicks out a 3.7% yield. That’s more than four times the yield one will get with the 10-year Treasury bond. 
Better yet, MMM stock is also consistent in how often the dividend gets raised. 3M has not only paid, but has raised its annual payout for 61 consecutive years. Anytime a company has accomplished such a feat, it’s worth a look. 
On the downside, 3M is starved for growth. On the plus side, it’s not seeing its revenue take a big hit from the novel coronavirus. In fact, the company is doing considerable business in the healthcare and PPE fields. That has helped offset the slower growth its seeing in its other businesses. 
Revenue is forecast to fall less than 1% this year, while earnings are forecast to fall a little under 8%. However, in 2021, expectations call for 10% earnings growth, erasing 2020’s drop. 
Even as the pandemic rages on, the economy is moving in the right direction. And that will bode well for the company in 2021, particularly if its strong business units stay strong. 

Lockheed Martin (LMT)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
	
Lockheed Martin is not among the quintessential industrial stocks. That’s because investors consider it more of a defense stock, which is true by industry but not by sector. 
In any regard, LMT stock seems to be presenting an opportunity. In mid-October, Lockheed reported earnings, delivering a top-line and bottom-line beat for Q3. In the third quarter, the company grew revenue by 10.2% and its earnings by 8.7%. Further, management upped its guidance. 
The company now expects earnings of roughly $24.45 a share vs. its prior outlook range of $23.75 to $24.05 per share. For revenue, management forecasts sales of $65.25 billion vs. a previous outlook range of $63.5 billion to $65 billion. 
Despite all that, on Oct. 20 shares fell 3% on earnings and another 1.4% in the following session. 
That leaves the stock trading at about 13.2 times this year’s forward earnings. Lockheed is forecast to grow earnings by more than 11% this year and 6.7% next year and just reported a solid quarterly result. On top of that, it pays out a nearly 3% dividend yield.

To me, that sounds more like an opportunity than a red flag. 

Caterpillar (CAT)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Last but not least, it would be hard to leave Caterpillar off the list of top industrial stocks. 
While CAT stock is highly levered to the economy, we’re not seeing the type of breakdown typically associated with a deep global recession. In fact, shares are higher, up 5% in the past month after its rally. 
Why? Because it’s likely that some sort of infrastructure deal will eventually come to fruition. Whether it’s a Democrat or Republican-occupied White House, both sides have an incentive to put people to work with a big infrastructure bill. 
On top of that, most of the world is looking to get back to regular life. In some cases, that’s merely a hope and not a plan. For others, though, construction, road work and other tasks needing heavy machinery will start back up. That makes 2021 a rebound year. 
These two catalysts should be a boon for Caterpillar — or at least, that’s what the stock price is reflecting amid the current rally.

2020-11-04,"On Wednesday, shares of Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $167.84.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $165.00  * Volume: 33  * Open Interest: 1125Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Recap: Caterpillar Q3 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For October 27, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-09,"On Monday, shares of Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $161.38.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-13  * Strike Price: $180.00  * Volume: 29  * Open Interest: 135Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Analyzing Caterpillar's Unusual Options Activity  * Recap: Caterpillar Q3 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-11,"Despite the ravages of the novel coronavirus pandemic, major indices continue to trade near or at all-time highs. But it’s also the types of sectors that are flying that make this dichotomy incredibly perplexing. For instance, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) is nearing 40% gains year-to-date while some state eviction moratoriums are about to expire. And amid this craziness, the idea of infrastructure stocks seems bonkers.
Let’s face it — while this supposedly K-shaped economic recovery flies in the face of common sense, we can appreciate why people are speculating on tech and other in-demand market segments. Bottom line, they’re sexy, like lights attracting moths. We’ll find out if those lights are bug zappers or not later. But infrastructure stocks? I can’t imagine too many folks getting their jollies from this boring sector.
Still, here are some interesting facts to consider. First, according to a CouponFollow.com survey, most consumers who took advantage of “buy now, pay later” programs bought electronics. However, the purchase totals were highest for home and gardening products, which hauled in an average of $1,187. Interestingly, even in the personal economy, infrastructure garnered serious demand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
More importantly, as a broader segment, skilled labor occupations provide opportunities for those out of work or seeking it. For instance, according to information complied by JobsList, the installation, maintenance and repair segment will grow by 2.8% from 2019 to 2029, whereas the construction and extraction sector will increase by 4%. The national average is 3.7%, which suggests that infrastructure stocks should not be ignored.
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Joblist.com
	
Further, JobsList makes an excellent argument. “The fact is that while the cost of college is skyrocketing, the salary premium degree-holders can expect to earn is barely increasing each year.” Also keep in mind that some sectors, like office and administrative support, are seeing declines in long-term forecasts. This is another underappreciated indicator that the slow and steady game could benefit these infrastructure stocks.

Here are 8 infrastructure stocks that will shine in the spotlight
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)
Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC)
United Rentals (NYSE:URI)
Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP)
Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG)
Waste Management (NYSE:WM)
American Tower (NYSE:AMT)
Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP)
As you can see from the list above, this sector is quite diverse. That’s going to be a useful attribute as these reliable infrastructure stocks head toward an exciting but uncertain post-pandemic world.

Caterpillar (CAT)

Initially, you might not expect Caterpillar to be ranked as an infrastructure stock to buy. Throughout the campaign leading up to the 2016 election, then-real estate mogul Donald Trump railed against Japanese corporations, instead promising to bolster American companies like Caterpillar. Good for CAT stock and bad for foreign competitors, right?
Like anything associated with the Trump administration, it’s complicated. Yes, CAT stock enjoyed a brilliant year — as far as blue-chip infrastructure stocks go — in 2017, as President Trump made America great again. But shares hit a peak in early 2018 and then subsequently succumbed to a long-term downtrend. It wasn’t until Joe Biden won this year’s election that Caterpillar itself was great again.
What happened? It turns out that while infrastructure companies loved Trump’s pro-business policies, they also value stability and diplomacy. Frankly, the outgoing administration’s stance on international affairs was a distraction for companies with global operations. With Biden, things seem poised to change, which explains the seemingly counterintuitive rally.

Vulcan Materials Company (VMC)

Unlike other infrastructure stocks, Vulcan Materials had a frenetic response to the Trump administration as far as the market was concerned. Immediately following the 2017 inauguration, VMC stock bounced higher. But later, shares began tumbling. Throughout the rest of that year and most of 2018, Vulcan undulated wildly before dropping to a low point in October 2018.
Still, 2019 proved to be an incredible recovery year for VMC stock. Despite deteriorating U.S.-China relations weighing on global markets, Vulcan kept charging throughout the first three quarters of last year. Early this year, a thawing of relations with China contributed to bullish sentiment for Vulcan. Unfortunately, the novel coronavirus made its unwanted introduction and you know the rest.
However, VMC has responded reasonably well to Biden’s electoral victory. From the immediate reaction to the election, it appears many VMC investors were hoping for a second term for Trump. Nevertheless, there are benefits to Biden’s promise to build back better.

With rationality and traditional diplomacy returning to the White House, Vulcan could be a surprising beneficiary.

United Rentals (URI)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com

	
As the world’s largest equipment rental company, United Rentals’ business case made tremendous sense in the years before the pandemic. But with Covid-19’s many disruptions, particularly to high-contact activities, the company became an infrastructure stock to avoid, at least on paper. Yet URI managed a remarkably contrarian performance, gaining 44% YTD. Is this run sustainable?
If we’re being honest, buying URI stock isn’t intuitive. However, not all construction-related projects evaporate over a pandemic. Therefore, United Rentals wasn’t rendered wholly irrelevant like some of its peers. More importantly, many involved in the building and infrastructure industries want to limit their exposure to long-term liabilities right now. You just don’t know what’s around the corner, which perfectly suits United’s core rental business.
Finally, while the Trump administration is theoretically better for URI stock, the incoming Biden administration may offer some pleasant surprises. Certainly, for the economy to improve we need to control the coronavirus pandemic. Arguably, Biden’s promise to listen to the science has given Wall Street something to cheer about.

Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)

As Brookfield Renewable Partners demonstrates, infrastructure stocks aren’t always levered to traditional, “analog” industries. Instead, BEP stock has been one of the hottest tickets in town, thanks to overwhelming interest in clean energy solutions. Further, with President-elect Biden’s pledge to get the U.S. to become a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, the future appears bright for Brookfield.
As you know, the shift in environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns has been years in the making. While BEP stock enjoys demand for its underlying clean power production, I’m most interested in the battery storage system. Yes, renewable energy is critical, particularly because of rising population levels and their corresponding energy consumption. However, renewables tend to be intermittent, making storage an indelible part of the green equation.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

Further, this terrible year offered a surprising catalyst for Brookfield and the broader battery storage business. For instance, the California rolling blackouts demonstrated the vulnerability of spike utility demand — something that intermittent power sources can’t readily accommodate. But with battery storage, such issues will become less disruptive, boding well for BEP stock.

Essential Utilities (WTRG)

If there’s any long-term benefit from considering infrastructure stocks to buy, it’s that it forces us to think about what we take for granted. Sure, we’re inundated with the latest gizmos and gadgets or the latest happenings on social media. But none of that really matters if we lose access to the essentials. That’s why investors ought to take a good look at water utility firm Essential Utilities.
Here’s a quick rule if you decide to venture out into the great beyond: three days, three weeks. The latter is roughly the time you can survive without food, but the former is your life expectancy without water. That’s why if you’re going to prepare your survival kit, you should place heavier emphasis on water and less on food. And this marks the fundamental case for WTRG stock.
But the other is that the U.S. has a clean water crisis. I had zero clue that “more than 30 million Americans lived in areas where water systems violated safety rules at the beginning of last year, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency.” With water turning into an increasingly precious commodity, you may want to add WTRG stock to your portfolio.

Waste Management (WM)
Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com

	
When discussing infrastructure stocks to buy, the usual suspects take center stage for good reason. These are the companies that are focused on building something, anything. But few talk about the importance of dealing with the waste products they invariably produced. That’s where Waste Management enters the fray.
True, WM stock isn’t exactly the sexiest infrastructure play. Nevertheless, if Biden truly builds back better, Waste Management and its ilk will have their day in the sun. True, the push for a greener society should mitigate our waste production. Plus, exciting technologies can make products longer lasting, helping to ease the pressure on our landfills. Still, that pressure won’t be eliminated, not by a long shot.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

With our sizable population and consumption culture, we depended on other countries to handle our waste products. But increasingly, those developing countries have rejected our trash — which, you know, good for them. Of course, that puts us in a bind, which makes a cynical plus for WM stock.

American Tower (AMT)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com

	
You may not know or even care too much about the ongoing 5G rollout beyond the obvious: basically, faster mobile internet speeds (though I must say, the comparison to prior mobile networks is remarkable). Though tech nerds will cringe at what I’m about to say next, knowledge of a platform isn’t pivotal. As an example, I don’t understand how my microwave works, just that it does.
For our purposes, 5G will take infrastructure stocks fundamentally to the next level. From cloud services to smart cities, the phenomenal speed of this next-generation network will enable profound innovations. And that means an incalculable number of jobs, especially for those involved in the connectivity side of the industry. This is why investors ought to put American Tower and specifically AMT stock on their radar.
We could go all day about what the 5G buildout can offer society. But in the new normal, the Internet of Things will become critical as vulnerable, self-isolating will still have access to necessary services through vastly improved connectivity protocols. But to realize the powerful applications of 5G requires infrastructure, which in turn benefits the underlying business of AMT stock.

Union Pacific (UNP)
Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.com

	
In recent sessions, rail transportation specialist Union Pacific has been all over the map. Unfortunately, this was due to the coronavirus disrupting the intermodal supply chain. According to Kenny Rocker, executive vice president of marketing and sales stated in the third-quarter earnings call, “You got the terminals, you got the port, you got the dray carriers, everyone was constrained.”
Nevertheless, you may want to add UNP stock to your list of infrastructure stocks to buy. That’s because the company is targeting growth in e-commerce volume, which is a very reasonable assumption. As expected, we saw a huge spike in online sales during Black Friday as many shoppers elected to stay at home and avoid the crowds.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

But it’s not just gift giving that may end up supporting UNP stock. The overriding reality is that Covid-19 has changed America for at least the next several years. It may take a generation or two for us to get back to the old way of doing things. For better or for worse, that means e-commerce will reign supreme.

2020-12-30,"Looking at Q3, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) earned $1.12 billion, a 20.26% increase from the preceding quarter. Caterpillar's sales decreased to $9.88 billion, a 1.16% change since Q2. In Q2, Caterpillar brought in $10.00 billion in sales but only earned $933.00 million.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Caterpillar's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, Caterpillar posted an ROCE of 0.07%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on CATROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Caterpillar is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Caterpillar, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight Caterpillar reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.34/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.12/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * P/E Ratio Insights for Encompass Health  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: Bionano Genomics(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-06,"(Bloomberg) -- American steelmakers and machinery producers surged on speculation that Democrats securing control of Congress paves the way for President-Elect Joe Biden to pass a wide-ranging infrastructure stimulus bill.Investors in the metal used in everything from skyscrapers to highways to bridges and tunnels are wagering that control of the House and Senate will give Biden the support he needs to make good on infrastructure and clean energy campaign promises. Democrats won control of the U.S. Senate after two runoff victories in Georgia.The S&P Supercomposite Steel Index, which includes U.S. Steel Corp., Nucor Corp. and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and 11 other members, gained 8% and capped the biggest two-day gain in more than four years. Caterpillar Inc., which makes the equipment needed for the massive projects, rose 5.6%.“We see the ‘Blue Wave’ reflation trade as driving outperformance in both steel and metal equities today owing to expectations that Democrats will be able to continue to more effectively funnel stimulus into the U.S. economy as well as the potential for a more sizable infrastructure bill,” Curt Woodworth, director of U.S. metals and mining research at Credit Suisse, said in an email.The industry has been clamoring for an infrastructure package since the early days of lockdown, with five U.S. steel groups in April asking Congress to include investment in a second round of stimulus -- which didn’t come until a few weeks ago. At the time, President Donald Trump had called for $2 trillion in spending on roads, bridges and tunnels.One of the biggest hurdles to infrastructure spending is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said it must have some form of revenue source and has complained that stimulus would be used for “blue state bailouts” to shore up things like state pensions.In November, the Steel Manufacturers Association suggested Biden do a five-year $1 trillion-plus package, with funding coming from a “modest” increase in the gasoline tax.“It’s not a blue state versus a red state issue,” the group’s president, Philip Bell, said at the time in an interview. “When you have infrastructure investment, it grows out from the center, so you might have a situation where there’s a project in Texas but you need engineering from California, contractors from Arizona and steel from a mill in Alabama to get that done.”Nucor, the largest U.S. steelmaker, gained 5.5% in New York, while U.S. Steel soared 17% and Caterpillar touched an all-time high.“Construction is a critical consumer of steel for both hot-rolled coil and rebar, and the market reset of inflation expectations higher is likely to drive fund flows into hard assets such as metals and steel equities, given historical hedge for inflation,” Woodworth said.(Updates with Democratic victories in Georgia in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Steelmakers, Caterpillar Jump on Bigger Stimulus Hopes"
2021-01-07,"Investors' hopes for the industrial giant are soaring, backed by a mix of micro and macro factors.",5 Big Reasons Caterpillar Stock Jumped 23% in 2020 and Continues to Rally
2021-01-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Early Wednesday afternoon, as the siege of the U.S. Capitol building was underway, Jay Timmons, the chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers, issued a remarkable statement. The association represents more than 1,000 industrial companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Caterpillar Inc. and Dow Inc. Like most business lobbying groups, it generally stays away from purely partisan issues. But Timmons, clearly outraged by what he was seeing on television, expressed a fury that many Americans were feeling.“Armed violent protestors who support the baseless claim by outgoing president Trump that he somehow won an election that he overwhelmingly lost have stormed the U.S. Capitol today, attacking police officers and first responders, because Trump refused to accept defeat in a free and fair election,” he began. This is not law and order. This is chaos. It is mob rule. It is dangerous. This is sedition and should be treated as such. The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. Anyone indulging conspiracy theories to raise campaign dollars is complicit. Vice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy.Though Timmons’s bluntness set him apart, he was hardly alone in condemning the efforts of the dozen or so Republican senators — led by Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri — and the more than 120 Republican representatives who planned to challenge President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory. The effort “undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division,” the Chamber of Commerce said. The Business Roundtable said that the rioting was “the result of unlawful efforts to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election.” On Monday, some 200 top executives — most of them CEOs — signed on to a short, pointed statement calling on Congress to “certify the electoral vote.” It added, “Attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy.”Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group Inc., Larry Fink of BlackRock Inc., David Solomon of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other top executives issued individual statements condemning the violence and calling for the peaceful transfer of power that has long been the hallmark of American democracy.The day before Wednesday’s trauma, Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld convened a virtual meeting of some three dozen executives, including Robert Iger, the chairman of Walt Disney Co., and Merck & Co.’s CEO Ken Frazier. During the meeting, Sonnenfeld took a poll:Is President Trump attempting to overturn democratically run elections to stay in office? Yes: 88%. Did President Trump break federal and/or state election laws in pressuring Georgia officials to change vote tallies? Yes: 91%. Are 50% of GOP House members and 25% of GOP Senate members aiding and abetting sedition? Yes: 88%.But here’s the question that really caught my attention: Should CEOs warn lobbyists privately that their companies will no longer support election deniers in Congress? This answer was unanimous: Yes.“We have to create some level of cost,” Tom Glocer, a director at Merck and Morgan Stanley, told the Wall Street Journal. “Just coming out with another public letter isn’t going to do much. Money is the key way.”There’s no doubt Glocer is right. Over the last few days, as Hawley, Cruz and the others made it clear they would object to millions of legally cast votes in the states that were critical to Biden’s victory, nobody paid much attention to the statements made by executives. Although the GOP was once the party of big business, those days are long gone; on issues from climate change to shutting down the government, Republican ideologues have shown themselves to be indifferent to the entreaties of CEOs.What they are not indifferent to is money. A decision by companies to withhold contributions to the campaigns and political action committees of lawmakers who were involved in objecting to the certification of Biden’s election would make a huge difference. It would show that there are severe consequences for defying the Constitution and democratic norms.But what are the chances of this actually happening? On Wednesday morning, a website called Popular Information listed the 20 largest corporate contributors to the campaigns of 13 senators and 126 members of the House who it said were attempting to “subvert democracy.” The companies included AT&T ($2 million between 2014 and 2020), Amazon.com Inc. ($598,000), Microsoft Corp. ($505,000) and Comcast Corp. ($1.74 million).The authors of the article called a handful of the companies to ask whether they would be withholding future contributions from them. Not a single one said yes. Some, like Amazon, declined to comment; others issued statements like this one from Pfizer Inc.: “Pfizer supports candidates and elected officials from both sides of the aisle who deal with decisions important to our industry.” That statement was made before the assault on the Capitol building; maybe the shock of those Wednesday afternoon images will cause companies like Pfizer to reassess. Because somebody needs to hold those who voted to defy the Constitution accountable. The body politic lacks the means — and the will — to do so. In too many cases, voters won’t either because they believe the lie that Trump has peddled ceaselessly that the election was somehow “rigged.” That leaves companies. Glocer told the Journal that the proper functioning of democracy isn’t only a political issue — it’s a business one, too. “Respect for the rule of law underlies our market economy,” he said. The rule of law and the smooth functioning of democracy are underpinnings that companies have long taken for granted. Now, like the rest of us, they know how fragile the system is. Ultimately, it’s in their own self-interest to ensure that events like Wednesday’s travesty never happen again. Withholding their money is the best weapon they — and we — have.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2021-01-14,"(Bloomberg) -- With Covid vaccines rolling out nationwide, Congress putting $900 billion into Americans’ pockets and the stock market gaining 16% last year, there’s a great deal of talk about a rapid recovery for the U.S. economy in 2021.Tell that to the companies that pave, manufacture and build. Some may not hit their 2019 revenue levels until at least 2025, according to analysts’ forecasts. Economic bellwether Caterpillar Inc.’s third-quarter sales were down 20% from a year earlier.Infrastructure projects this year face cancellations as states and municipalities revenues plummeted in 2020 amid the lockdowns. Without an aid bill, the American Road & Transportation Builders Association forecasts the market will shrink 5.5% in 2021, and the value of work will drop $16 billion.About one of every 10 jobs in America is related to infrastructure, and every billion dollars lost takes away some 13,000 jobs across public and private sectors. By this metric, almost 210,000 jobs related to infrastructure could disappear in 2021, right as the economy is supposed to be opening back up and offering new work.“You see cities across the country, regardless of where they are, putting a pause or canceling much needed infrastructure improvements,” said Irma Esparza Diggs, director of federal advocacy for the National League of Cities, a group pushing for expanded municipal stimulus. “They don’t know what’s coming next.”It’s unclear what the Biden administration will do about infrastructure stimulus and not everyone sees a sector in distress. Some believe a group of large companies with a robust lobbying capacity is crying wolf. Keybanc Capital Markets says infrastructure spending was actually up 5.5% in 2020, following similar boosts in recent years. Federal, state and municipal spending and public-private partnerships have kept projects well-funded, it argues.Despite concerns that their earnings will be slow to recover, shares of the largest U.S. machinery producers, steelmakers and aluminum companies surged in the second half of 2020, boosted by optimism that the economy may reopen more quickly.While Caterpillar gained 23%, U.S. Steel Corp. rose 47% and Alcoa Corp. climbed 7.2% in 2020, analysts point out that they were recovering from depressed levels. U.S. Steel is expected to book a $198 million loss in 2020, while Caterpillar’s full-year sales are seen dropping 27% and Alcoa’s per-share loss is estimated to have widened by a third.Still, last summer, states said they’d cancel and delay projects if Congress didn’t pass a stimulus, and cancellations are starting to pile up, hitting not only behemoths like Alcoa and Caterpillar but smaller companies like DeFoe Corp., a paver in the New York City borough of the Bronx.DeFoe President Dario Amicucci says without stimulus, he’ll lay off part of his 150-person workforce and face a 40% decline in sales.“All the work we do is infrastructure, so it would be devastating to our company,” said Amicucci, whose firm hauls in about $140 million in revenue during a good year. He says his business won’t get back to pre-pandemic levels for four or five years.Part of the reason these industries are worried is because most projects are funded a year in advance, and 2020 brought shutdowns. Revenue streams from toll booths, property, gasoline and sales tax aren’t flowing this year either.Alison Black, chief economist for the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, has a running model on the shortfalls for all 50 states. And she’s worried.The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says state revenues for the fiscal year could fall as much or more than they did during the worst year of the Great Recession. Contrary to President Donald Trump’s claims, the potential losses aren’t just in states run by Democrats. The center forecasts drops in Texas, Wyoming and Kentucky, home to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who said he’s not going to backstop “blue state bailouts.”Reluctance to dole out funds for infrastructure projects is showing up in the municipal bond market. More than a third of long-term debt issued through mid-November of 2020 was to refinance outstanding debt.Governments have sold more than $170 billion in new money bonds for infrastructure projects so far this year, but that’s only in line with last year, data compiled by Bloomberg shows, despite a 16% uptick in overall issuance.As a candidate, President-elect Joe Biden pledged some $2 trillion -- mostly federal aid -- over four years for infrastructure. If he links a bill to green-friendly initiatives, that would multiply its effect because greener highways, bridges and buildings require new construction rather than upgrades. Some say that even if the new Democratic-run Congress passes a stimulus package, companies will run into a labor shortage.“As little as 12 months ago and maybe even today there was a shortage of skilled workers in the non-residential building channel,” said Phil Gibbs, an analyst at Keybanc.Manufacturing also faces the prospects of a multi-generational shift in non-residential construction demand, part of the Covid ripple effect, said Darrell West, a vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.“Everyone has moved to online learning, telemedicine, remote work, and that has a lot of ramifications for manufacturing,” he said. “We’re not going to need nearly as much commercial space if more people are working remotely, companies will downsize their building needs. That will affect the building sector, that then affects heating and office supply manufacturers.”U.S. plant usage hit 73% in November, 6 percentage points below its 47-year average after touching a low of 64% in April as the pandemic led to widespread lockdowns. It was the worst November since 2009 and third-worst since 1967.“We can’t keep letting infrastructure week be a Washington punchline,” Pete Buttigieg, the nominee for transportation secretary said in a recent television interview, reflecting the industry’s view. “There’s no way we can do what we must do as a country unless we move the transportation sector forward.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","‘Recovery?

2021-01-21,"With inauguration in the rear-view mirror, Wall Street returns today to the business at hand: A long list of earnings reports and the latest word on unemployment claims.We'll get to earnings below. First off, weekly initial jobless claims offered a little good news and some bad. On the negative side, they're still too high at 900,000, and above many Wall Street estimates. The good news is that last week's big number got revised downward slightly. This metric just stubbornly refuses to fall, but maybe if more states come out of lockdown we'll see improvement in coming weeks.The market scored fresh record highs yesterday for every index, with the Nasdaq (COMP) up an amazing 2% after impressive earnings from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) that helped propel the rest of the FAANG stocks. Those companies remain the gorillas on Wall Street. The excitement about yesterday's inauguration and hopes that President Biden can push through another stimulus package seem to have spilled over today. It also seems positive that media reports said Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) has offered to help the Biden administration with Covid vaccine distribution. AMZN knows a thing or two about logistics. A little data came in too, with December housing starts and building permits both beating analysts' expectations. So that also might be helping the market early on. Volatility continues to cool. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has fallen back below 22, but remains above the historic average of around 20. VIX futures remain in contango, meaning forward prices are higher than the spot price. If you look toward spring, VIX futures are above 26. This is a possible warning sign that some investors see a bumpier road ahead. Earnings Parade Marches On As Biden Takes Office The earnings engine keeps chugging up the hill today with two major railroads--CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP)--reporting. Then there's Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and IBM Common Stock (NYSE: IBM) in a double play for the Tech sector this afternoon. INTC could be an interesting one, as the company recently announced a new CEO who analysts think can guide the company through some of its production challenges (see more below). Having said all that, let's be clear: Everything else could take a back seat to events in Washington over the next few weeks as investors look ahead to big changes in policy and outlook from a new administration. Even on his first day in office, President Biden signed executive orders putting the U.S. back in the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate agreement, moves that could have Wall Street impacts over time for sectors like alternative energy, pharmaceuticals, and health insurance. Biden is also likely to try and loosen the previous administration's immigration policies, though political analysts say that's not his top priority. Many large corporations have traditionally welcomed immigration as a source of workers and also as a factor that can keep down wages. This isn't a political column, but the new administration might have to walk a tightrope here because so many Americans remain out of work due to COVID-19.Meanwhile, the Energy industry took a blow with one of President Biden's first acts as he revoked a permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, which continues to be a political football through three presidential administrations. Maybe the impact will get blunted a bit by crude continuing to gain ground, reaching nearly 11-month highs yesterday above $53 a barrel. Energy stocks have been blowing away many other sectors lately on hopes the vaccines could speed the path back to a normal economy. Biden outlined a ""theme"" for each of the coming days. Today is ""COVID"" and tomorrow is ""Economic Relief."" Monday is ""Buy America."" It's definitely a different feeling in Washington, whatever your politics are, and the effects could definitely be felt on Wall Street, which has rallied already since Biden's election in part on hopes for more stimulus. So consider keeping your eye on this because new administrations often try to push the gas pedal hard in their first year when they think they can get the most done. Think of healthcare with President Obama and tax reform with President Trump. Both of those were first-year initiatives. The question many are asking is how much of the ""unity"" both parties have been pledging recently will make its way to the House and Senate chambers. It should be interesting to watch, whatever happens. What Else Is Lifting Stocks? Rising Target Prices Getting back to the markets, we've mentioned valuation a lot lately--mostly to point out that the S&P 500 Index (SPX) is at historically high levels on a price-to-earnings basis and some analysts are fretting about possible overbought conditions. It wouldn't be fair to bring up valuation and not add that plenty of analysts apparently see more potential upside for many of the biggest stocks. That's been evident this week in price target raises for companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), NFLX, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). All of those stocks got some traction Wednesday in part due to those target increases from Wall Street, which helps explain why high-profile large-cap growth companies led the way in yesterday's rally. NFLX might have earned those higher targets with its incredibly strong earnings, but keep in mind that TSLA, GOOGL, and the other FAANGs that rose yesterday all still have to report. Higher expectations from Wall Street could mean a bigger hit if their earnings fail to impress. That's just one reason investors need to be careful, especially with indices at all-time highs. The market environment has been a bit of a two-edged sword with those highs accompanied by bounces every time things pull back. If you've been playing the 'buy every dip' game for the last few years, your success has probably been in many ways unparalleled. Still, whatever's going on with ""animal spirits"" and the overall market, every company has its own fundamentals to consider. That means if you own individual stocks, you always have to keep that in mind. Take INTC, which is expected to report this afternoon. This stock rocketed from below $30 to nearly $70 between 2016 and 2019, only to now be struggling in the $50s due to manufacturing issues that have made it fall behind competitor Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).Last year, INTC was forced to delay rolling out mass production of its next-generation fabrication process until at least late 2022, further widening the advantage TSM has gained, Barron's recently noted. Intel already pays TSM to produce chips, but the company may seek to expand that partnership or try and find capacity elsewhere. Investors are waiting for answers to those questions on the earnings call later today, but it just points up that whatever phase the market is in, no company is immune from problems.On the subject of problems, there's also United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL), which reported last night. The problems it's experiencing extend to the entire industry due to the pandemic's impact, which cut worldwide passenger traffic to levels last seen in 2003. UAL posted its fourth-consecutive quarterly loss, and said it expects Q1 revenue to be down 65% to 70% compared with the same period of 2019. Shares fell nearly 2% in pre-market trading. Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) is coming up next week and analysts are looking for more insight into cost cuts and customer demand metrics.CHART OF THE DAY: FAANG REVIVAL. After a short slumber, the NYSE FANG+ Index ($NYFANG--candlestick) showed life yesterday as it gapped up reaching a new high at around 6693. For a while it was trending up along its 25-day moving average (blue line) but yesterday's action put it well above that support level. Data source: Ice Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Tough Audience: We're entering the heart of earnings season, so it's time to remember a pattern seen so often recently. Investors can be hard to please, to say the least, and might punish companies even when they meet or exceed Wall Street's expectations--just ask anyone who holds shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) after it absolutely demolished analysts' projections but lost ground in the market last Friday. In some cases, there may be ""whisper numbers"" going around that some had hoped a company would meet. In others, the actual earnings might look fine but guidance might not please everyone. Even an offhand remark from an executive on an earnings conference call can sometimes spoil what otherwise would have been a strong day, if you remember what happened to Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) a few years ago. With so many stocks at or near their highs, any company that fails to meet expectations is vulnerable to getting a knuckle sandwich from Wall Street.Biden's First Steps on China Awaited: Since we mentioned CAT, it's probably time to consider the Biden administration's policy on trade and its potential impact on companies like CAT with a big presence there. For now, Biden says he's keeping former-President Trump's tariffs, and faces calls from both sides of the aisle to stay tough on Beijing. On the other hand, there are companies in the U.S. being hurt by tariffs and by having less access to China's huge market, so there's that to think about. Though the first phase of the trade deal signed last year by the countries seems to have gotten agricultural trade back into gear, many industries remain caught between the trenches in this long trade war. It might be interesting to get CAT's perspective on trade relations when it reports next week. The company said in its Q3 earnings call that it had strong demand in China for its construction segment that quarter and that it expected China construction demand to grow in coming quarters. Not All Boats Lifted: One sector that sat out yesterday's rally was Financials. This segment of the market has cooled off lately and it looks like that could be due partly to the recent flattening in the 10-year yield, which had been on a tear for about a month. The yield ticked up slightly early Thursday, pivoting around 1.1% after flirting with 1.2% earlier in January. Overall, bank earnings looked good but not great. The best takeaways are that some of the reserves set aside for credit losses got removed, and that loan activity and trading looked strong in Q4.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2021-01-29,"Electric vehicles have been at the forefront of the investment world for most of 2020. However, as my colleague David Moadel points out, not all companies received the same love. One such company is electrified powertrain solutions provider Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN), which hopes to commercialize long-haul electric trucks. HYLN stock is down roughly 31.4% in the past couple of months, in times when most EV companies are rallying. Risks remain with the investment, but it appears it’s building a nice head of steam so far this year. Source: Muratart/Shutterstock.com It appears that Nikola Motors (NASDAQ:NKLA) woes have unjustly impacted HYLN stock. Investors incorrectly believe that Nikola and Hyliion have virtually the same business model. Unlike Nikola, Hyliion isn’t looking to replace existing truck fleets. Instead, its alternative powertrain solution offers existing trucks to go green. Assuming the technology does what’s expected of it, the opportunity for growth is massive for Hyliion. It offers a product that potentially solves many problems without forcing managers to replace their existing fleets. Moreover, the company has a massive cash balance to see its plans through to the finish line. It most recently raked in $142 million from the sale of its stock warrants. Therefore, the stock is an exciting EV bet for sure but has a lot to prove to investors in the not-so-distant future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Need For Hybrid Trucks Hyliion is developing long-term and short-term electrified powertrain solutions for most commercially available Class 8 trucks. In the short term, we have its hybrid offering, which offers a few unique features that could hit its customers. The first benefit is that fleet managers would not have to replace scraping off their existing fleets. Hyliion’s hybrid solution can be fitted on Class 8 commercial truck to improve performance and achieve carbon reduction goals. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times Another benefit of the hybrid system is that it enables trucks running on natural gas to have a similar performance as diesel truck engines. Moreover, these solutions do not purely focus on electric motors, as they incorporate Hyliion’s proprietary software solution, battery systems, and analytics. Additionally, in my previous article, I also mentioned how the company claims that its electric-hybrid retrofit could increase fuel efficiency by 30%. It’s tough to say whether hybrid trucks are the industry’s future, but if it can do all that’s mentioned above, things could interesting. Hyliion will be looking at a massive addressable market, valued at over $500 billion. The Future Of course, Hyliion’s long term goal is to provide a fully electric powertrain system called the Hypertruck ERX. The hypertruck offers several unique advantages to its customers, covering performance, fuel efficiency, and accessibility. According to the company, the powertrain batteries are re-charged using an onboard generator. That means that the generator could effectively convert whatever fuel you put into the truck. This essentially means that the vehicle becomes net carbon-negative, providing it with a major edge over conventional EVs. Moreover, the ERX system will produce roughly 30% of electricity than the costs from the USA’s domestic grids. Another fascinating aspect is that Hyliion will be looking to leverage existing infrastructure for refuelling. It estimates that an EV charging infrastructure will cost over $7-$12 billion; therefore, it’s easier to expand the existing infrastructure. Moreover, with similar performance systems as existing trucks, it is likely to win over many OEM manufacturers in the industry. The company targets a 2024 sales figure of 19,000 hyper trucks and over 15,000 hybrid systems, which makes its target revenue past the $2 billion marks. All this is speculation at this point, though, and the next few months or so will be critical in adjudging its business model’s strength. Final Word on HYLN Stock Hyliion is a novel EV play that could potentially develop a new niche in the industry. It’s making some tall claims about its proposition, and it appears that investors would not have to wait a long time to see the results. It will be interesting to see how its hybrid solution gains traction, setting the stage for its fully electrified solution. Investors should keep tabs on repeat orders from Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Wegmans and the delivery of 1000 pre-ordered Hypertruck ERX systems by Agility. Therefore, it’s best to wait and see how things play out in the next few months before investing in HYLN stock.

2021-01-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc. fourth-quarter earnings beat analysts’ expectations as reopening economies stoked demand for its signature yellow machines. The company said it expects stronger year-over-year sales this quarter, led by construction industries.The world’s biggest maker of mining and construction equipment posted adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.12 a share, according to a statement Friday. That compares with the $1.45 average of analysts’ estimates compiled Bloomberg. Sales also topped expectations, while still falling below a year earlier.Caterpillar’s stock is coming off its best quarter in three years in a bet on improving demand for machinery used in construction and infrastructure as economies recover from the coronavirus. A broad rebound in commodity markets may mean the return of customers in the metals and oil-exploration businesses after pandemic shutdowns crushed orders.“Our expectations around the top line are for that to re-accelerate as we go into 2021,” Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, said in a phone interview, referring to an improvement in sales. “Over 2021, we would expect recovery.” Bonfield said residential construction is “the bright spot.”There are signs of buoyant demand in building and manufacturing. U.S. home construction starts rose in December to the best pace since late 2006, while Bloomberg Intelligence said China construction-machinery sales may reach a record high in 2021. Meanwhile, orders placed with U.S. factories for business equipment rose in December for an eighth straight month.Full-year revenue in 2020 was $41.7 billion, down 22% from 2019. The decline reflected lower end-user demand and dealers reducing their inventories by $2.9 billion in 2020.“Our fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect the team’s agility in a challenging environment while executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said in the statement. “We are well-positioned for the future and will emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger company.”The company didn’t offer any full-year profit guidance. On a conference call after the report, Umpleby cited “continued uncertainty” due to the pandemic.Risks for the economic bellwether in 2021 include rising steel prices, continuing threats to mining activity from the pandemic and sharper competition in Asia.CFO Bonfield said that the company has long-term contracts for its steel, and “at the moment we’re still benefiting from those contracts.” There’s a lag in steel-price cost increases, “so we are in a good place as we sit here today,” he said.Caterpillar shares rose 1.2% at 9:33 a.m. in New York.(Updates with CEO comments, share move in eighth and final paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Sees Housing Boom Leading 2021 Sales Recovery

2021-03-05,"Panic was in the air this week. The interest-rate hobgoblins came out of the closet to haunt investors everywhere. Well, not everywhere. Oil stocks cared not a whit for the drama. Nor did industrial stocks. In fact, both of these sectors were where traders went to hide. I’m intrigued by the buoyancy from the industrial sector and will shine a spotlight on three strong stocks to buy. Equities flexing their muscles during times of turmoil are easy to see. Just sort your watchlist by percentage change. They’re the few darlings sitting in the green when everything else is red. From a charting perspective, outperformance appears when prices remain above support and key moving averages while everything else melts down. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Industrials score high marks on both fronts. The sector has stood tall this week, allowing its chart to stay above the rising 20-day moving average. Here are my three favorite setups in the space:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) Deere (NYSE:DE) Emerson (NYSE:EMR) After a closer inspection of each chart, I’ll reveal an options trade you can use to bank profits. Industrial Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Let’s start with a logic chain. The underpinning of surging interest rates is inflation. Inflation pressures are rising because commodity prices are climbing. Commodity prices are climbing because global growth expectations are lifting. And do you know who thrives on global growth? Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar. The past week of selling appears nothing more than a garden variety pullback for CAT stock. What’s more, the prior advance saw a sharp uptick in momentum and a quartet of accumulation days. With institutions heavily favoring the feline, the wind is at the back of buyers, and higher prices are more likely than lower ones. The Trade: Buy the May $220/$230 bull call spread for $3.80. You’re risking $3.80 to capture $6.20 potentially. Deere (DE) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Deere is following in Caterpillar’s footsteps. Indeed, their price charts boast many similarities. DE stock’s last upswing had some serious firepower behind it, thanks to an impressive earnings report. Its top and bottom-line growth had buyers eagerly snatching up shares, and I can’t see them completely abandoning shares in light of a little interest rate scare. Plus, for all its fury, the past week of selling delivered a textbook three candle retracement. The profit-taking was mild compared to the previous ascent. DE was up seven days in a row preceding the drop, so it arguably needed to cool. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Thursday saw a test of the rising 20-day moving average the ultimately succeeded. Buyers swooped in to maintain the integrity of the short-term trend. If you’re looking for dips to shop, this one belongs at the top of your list. The Trade: Buy the June $340/$360 bull call for $8.50. You’re risking $8.50 to capture $11.50 potentially. Emerson (EMR) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Emerson Electric rounds out our trio of industrial stocks to buy. The market’s temper tantrum hasn’t affected the EMR chart one bit. In fact, while the S&P 500 was getting torched on Thursday, EMR was tagging a record high. The outperformance is again on full display this morning. While the broad market is sinking, EMR is up 1%. Whatever is spooking stocks at large is having zero impact on investor appetite for Emerson. And that’s a fact that demands attention for strength seekers. The typical volatility or past behavior of EMR’s price trend seems to lend itself to position trading over swing trading. The uptrend has been slow and steady. I like buying more time with a call spread to give the stock plenty of runway to continue ascending. The Trade: Buy the June $90/$95 bull call for $2. You’re risking $2 to capture $3 potentially.

President and CEO Joey Agree purchased 7,870 shares of stock for $63.61 per share according to a March 2nd filing.

Insiders at the company took advantage of the price appreciation by selling some of their holdings in the company.

2021-03-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks trade and supply chains disrupted by the pandemic. Sign up here.An abrupt starboard turn in the Atlantic Ocean is the perfect illustration of the trade disruption caused by the blockage of one of the world’s most important waterways.The Marlin Santorini, a tanker capable of carrying 1 million barrels of oil, switched destinations away from the Suez Canal, turned south and appears to be heading around Africa.The diversion could add about 6,000 miles to the ship’s journey and something like $300,000 in fuel costs, but it’s just one of hundreds of individual setbacks suffered this week by vessels that carry everything from raw materials to finished goods around the world.Swedish furniture giant Ikea and yellow bulldozer-maker Caterpillar Inc. are among the many international companies facing supply-chain headaches. The crisis is buoying natural gas prices in Europe, delaying wind farms in Asia and could soon hit your instant coffee.With the container ship Ever Given likely to remain stuck in the Suez Canal until next week, it’s only the start of the rearranging of global trade.“If it can’t be resumed in a week, it will be horrible,” said Mark Ma, the owner of Seabay International Freight Forwarding Ltd., a company that handles Chinese goods sold on platforms such as Amazon.com Inc. and has 20 to 30 containers on the ships waiting to transit the canal. “We will see freight fares spike again. The products are delayed, containers can’t return to China and we can’t deliver more goods.”The crisis comes as companies are already battling the strain of adapting supply chains to cope with a pandemic-related e-commerce boom. Covid-19 regulations at ports are slowing the passage of some products. While consumers and companies have weathered these problems, the Suez incident promises fresh headwinds and higher costs in the weeks ahead, particularly in Europe.P&F Industries Inc., a U.S. maker of pneumatic hand tools, said the Suez shutdown exacerbates delays to trade that have caused the firm to add six to eight weeks to expected delivery times. Germany’s Enercon GmbH expects delays in the shipment of wind turbine components from Europe to projects in Asia, a spokesperson said.Ikea said it’s considering all options to ensure availability of products such as flat-pack beds and couches, while Caterpillar is said to be considering airlifting products if necessary. Sea-Doo maker BRP Inc., which has parts from Asian suppliers stuck behind the Ever Given, has resorted to flying another batch of components to its North American plants -- a costly back-up plan.“The delays are likely to increase costs, adding to already widespread inflationary pressure on supply chains,” said Chris Rogers, lead trade analyst for S&P Global Market Intelligence’s Panjiva. “The short-term ripple effects will be an increased potential for stock-outs in consumer goods and the risk that just-in-time manufacturing supply chains that had already been roiled by Brexit and commodity shortages may face further interruptions.”The task of re-floating the 200,000-ton container ship called Ever Given, which is still firmly wedged across the vital maritime trade route, will require about a week of work and potentially longer, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified. Rescue efforts had initially been expected to last only a couple of days.A salvage team on Friday night was able to float the rear of the vessel and release the rudder, according to Inchcape Shipping Services, a maritime services provider. Efforts will continue with the next high tide. As the rescue teams toil away, the waiting queue of oceangoing carriers loaded with billions of dollars worth of oil and consumer goods has risen to more than 300 from 186 on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data.On Friday at the canal, it was a clear day and the line of tankers queuing up to get into the waterway was visible from the shore. People from the neighboring area came out to have a look at the 400-meter (1,300-foot) container ship, which dwarfed the palm trees along the shore and made the dredger behind it look like a toy.Should cargo need to be unloaded from the stranded vessel, or extensive repairs made to the canal itself, “then the downtime could certainly last at least two weeks,” according to Randy Giveans, senior vice president of Equity Research for Energy Maritime at Jefferies LLC. The Ever Given could hold almost $1 billion of goods, according to IHS Markit Ltd.The halt of traffic through the Suez Canal is dealing another blow to global supply chains that were already suffering.The world’s biggest flow of merchandise -- between China and the U.S –- has faced nearly five months of bottlenecks at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Importers have been waiting several weeks for arriving cargo, with the knock-on effect that exporters are unable to secure empty steel boxes needed to deliver their shipments abroad.The fear now is that the Suez incident will exacerbate Europe’s logistical challenges, resulting in canceled sailings, container shortages and higher freight rates.Read more: Why a Canal Built in 1869 Is More Important Than Ever: QuickTakeVessels that had been scheduled to traverse the Suez Canal are beginning costly and time-consuming detours around Africa as the shipping sector scrambles to keep deliveries moving. South Korea’s HMM Co. instructed a container ship that departed the U.K. on Monday to divert around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the gridlock.At least seven liquefied natural gas vessels have had routes adjusted away from the canal, according to Kpler analyst Rebecca Chia, and major shippers including A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG are also studying detours. Shipping costs are also surging -- the price of sending a 40-foot container from China to Europe has almost quadrupled from a year ago.The prospect of a long blockage has already boosted European natural gas prices, as cargoes laden with the liquefied form of the fuel destined for the region face delays. About 2 million barrels a day of oil flows are being held up, according to Braemar ACM Shipbroking.What a Long Suez Closure Means for the Oil Price: Julian LeeBulk carriers that ship products from coffee to iron ore have also been snarled up, potentially limiting the availability of some foodstuffs.“The global food system is already under pressure from Covid,” Tim Benton, research director in emerging risks at Chatham House in London and a food security expert, said in an interview. The trade disruption “adds a further straw to the camel’s back.”A list of cargo aboard a HMM Co. vessel waiting outside the canal to return to Asia gives an indication of the sweep of industries caught up in the disruption, with goods on board including wood, machinery, frozen beef, paper, powdered milk, furniture, beer, frozen pork, auto components, chocolate, and cosmetics.Ships currently outside of the Red Sea planning to use the Suez Canal will need to decide whether to reroute around Africa, adding 10 to 15 days to their voyages, according to Giveans. Ships queuing on either end of the Suez Canal area are likely to wait to determine how long the passage will be closed before taking a decision to divert, he said.Even after the huge challenge of re-floating the Ever Given is finally overcome, logistical problems may continue to ripple out across the world.“European terminals will be hit by a surge of container volume that will temporarily overwhelm their handling capacity,” said Greg Knowler, senior European editor at JOC, which is part of IHS Markit. “Rotterdam and Antwerp expect ship-wait times to lengthen, and expect it will take longer to handle ships and clear containers from the yards. Businesses will have to wait longer for their imports.”(Adds Sea-Doo details in ninth paragraph and status of salvage efforts in 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Global Trade Gets Rerouted With Suez Canal Still Blocked

2021-03-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks trade and supply chains disrupted by the pandemic. Sign up here.The giant vessel that’s blocked the Suez Canal for almost a week was pulled free from the bank, a major step toward getting ships moving again along one of the world’s most important trade arteries.The stoppage caused a tailback of hundreds of vessels, snarled supply chains already under pressure due to the coronavirus pandemic and provided a stark reminder of the fragility of the global trade infrastructure.Horns sounded in celebration as the Ever Given -- a boat longer than the Eiffel Tower -- made her way up the canal after a frantic rescue operation involving teams of tugs and dredgers working day and night.The container ship was moved from the canal wall around 3 p.m. Egypt time on Monday. It then moved north from the narrow southern end of the canal, where it ran aground on Tuesday, toward the Great Bitter Lake.The Suez Canal Authority said navigation would resume as normal, though it didn’t specify when. There will be enough space for other ships to pass the Ever Given once it gets to the lake.Salvage teams had struggled to free the vessel, 400 meters long and carrying almost $1 billion of cargo. They tried to use high tides and a full moon to pull it from the sandy bank it smashed into during high winds, in an operation that also involved shovelling 30,000 cubic meters of sand and removing part of the canal wall.Egyptian authorities were desperate to get traffic flowing again through the waterway that’s a conduit for about 12% of world trade and about 1 million barrels of oil a day. This has been the canal’s longest closure since it was shut for eight years following the 1967 Six Day War.Firms including A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG were forced to reroute their ships via the southern tip of Africa, which can add two weeks on to a journey between Europe and Asia.Shipping experts anticipate that the disruption will last for months because of schedules being upturned and the uneven wave of cargo that will hit ports down the line.While the hit of the canal’s $10-billion-per-day closure will likely be small given that global merchandise trade amounts to $18 trillion a year, the prospect of hundreds of ships being thrown off schedule will ensure cargo delays in the weeks if not months ahead. The dozen or so container carriers that control most of the world’s ocean freight capacity are already charging record-high rates on some routes, and shortages of everything from chemicals and lumber to dockside labor already abound.Dominoes Toppled“The dominoes have been toppled,” Lars Jensen, chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting in Copenhagen, wrote on social media over the weekend. “The delays and re-routing which have already happened will cause ripple effects” which will be felt for several months.Companies from Ikea to Caterpillar Inc. have been affected and thousands of live animals -- many of them sheep -- are stuck on ships in the area. Consumer goods, industrial inputs, and commodities from oil to coffee are caught up in the jam, with Asian exporters and European importers affected most directly.The blockage held up about $400 million an hour, based on rough calculations from Lloyd’s List that suggested westbound traffic to Europe is worth around $5.1 billion a day and eastbound traffic is approximately $4.5 billion.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",The Giant Ship Blocking the Suez Canal Is Finally Freed

2021-03-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks trade and supply chains disrupted by the pandemic. Sign up here.A nearly week-long saga to dislodge a giant container ship stuck in the Suez Canal reached an end Monday as the vessel was freed and traffic resumed through the vital waterway. Authorities expected operations to return to normal within days.Hundreds of vessels carrying everything from oil to livestock were forced to wait in line after the Ever Given became stuck in the canal. The accident was a stark reminder of the fragility of global trade infrastructure and threatened to further strain supply lines already stretched by the pandemic.Horns sounded in celebration as the container ship -- which is longer than the Eiffel Tower and weighs 220,000 tons -- limped up the canal after a painstaking operation that saw teams of tugs and dredgers working day and night.Salvage teams used the tides and a full moon to pull the ship from deep inside the sandy bank it had smashed into last week amid high winds and poor visibility. As part of their efforts, they shoveled 30,000 cubic meters (1 million cubic feet) of sand and even removed part of the canal wall.Part of the problem was a five-day wait for two large tugboats, according to Peter Berdowski, chief executive officer of Boskalis Westminster, the parent company of the salvage team.“We were enormously helped by the strong tide, the forces of nature that push hard, even harder than the two tugboats can pull,” he told Dutch radio.“The men were euphoric of course. But there was a tense moment when this giant was floating freely. You need to bring it under control quickly with the tugboats before it gets stuck on the other side, we would have gone from bad to worse. Those were a tense 10 minutes.”Clearing the queue of vessels may take as long as two and a half days, with canal operations returning to normal within four days, Suez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie said at a Monday evening press conference. The SCA is looking into incentives for vessels in line, he said, without giving details on options being considered.Container ship YM Wish was the first to leave the Great Bitter Lake anchorage and enter the southern part of the canal, with more vessels following. There is also a line of as many as 12 vessels entering the northern end of the canal, led by the Biglift Barentsz, a heavy load carrier heading for Singapore.Egyptian authorities were desperate to get traffic flowing again through the waterway that’s a conduit for about 12% of world trade and about 1 million barrels of oil a day. This has been the canal’s longest closure since it was shut for eight years following the 1967 Six-Day War. Responsibility for the incident will be determined after an investigation, Rabie said, adding that SCA isn’t at fault and that the ship’s captain -- and not the pilot -- was responsible for the vessel.Firms including A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG were forced to reroute their ships via the southern tip of Africa, which can add two weeks on to a journey between Europe and Asia. At least one ship appeared to do a double U-turn on Monday as news of the salvage operation emerged.Dominoes Have ToppledThe long-term impact of the canal’s $10-billion-per-day closure will likely be small given that global merchandise trade amounts to $18 trillion a year. Yet so many ships being thrown off schedule will ensure cargo delays for weeks, if not months. The dozen or so container carriers that control most of the world’s ocean freight are already charging record-high rates on some routes, and shortages of everything from chemicals and lumber to dockside labor already abound.“The dominoes have been toppled,” Lars Jensen, chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting in Copenhagen, wrote on social media over the weekend. “The delays and re-routing which have already happened will cause ripple effects” which will be felt for several months.Companies from Ikea to Caterpillar Inc. flagged potential impacts and tens of thousands of live animals are stuck on ships in the area. Consumer goods, industrial inputs and commodities from oil to coffee are caught up in the jam, with Asian exporters and European importers affected most directly.The blockage held up about $400 million an hour, based on rough calculations from Lloyd’s List that suggested westbound traffic to Europe is worth around $5.1 billion a day and eastbound traffic is approximately $4.5 billion.(Updates with SCA comments from eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Suez Canal Has Reopened to Traffic After Giant Ship Is Freed

2021-04-09,"Good infrastructure, including bridges, roads, airports, utilities, can increase the productive potential of an economy. President Joseph Biden has recently released details of his “Build Back Better” plan, which includes around $2 trillion of infrastructure spending stateside. Therefore, today’s article introduces seven infrastructure stocks excited for the $2 trillion Biden plan. Many analysts concur that a great deal of infrastructure across the nation has been in need of revitalization. Thus, the proposed projects will be welcome by many communities and citizens. Meanwhile, economists highlight the importance of infrastructure investment in driving economic growth, especially following the uncertainty created by the pandemic. According to recent research by Jeffrey M. Stupak of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), “Over the past several decades, government investment in infrastructure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has declined. Annual infrastructure investment by federal, state, and local governments peaked in the late 1930s, at about 4.2% of GDP, and since has fallen to about 1.6% of GDP in 2016.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips With the infrastructure plan proposed by the new administration, an investment of about $2 trillion across the nation is expected. As a result, there could be massive upside potential not only for traditional infrastructure stocks but also for some high growth stocks. As our economy opens up, many companies will benefit from low interest rates and the massive government stimulus. However, we should remind InvestorPlace.com readers that they are mostly cyclical stocks, ebbing with the news regarding the economy. Therefore, their share prices can also be volatile at times. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 With that information, here are seven infrastructure stocks that are well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming investments in infrastructure projects: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) Columbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (BATS:PAVE) Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) Nucor (NYSE:NUE) SPDR S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF (NYSEARCA:SIMS) Infrastructure Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $100.22-$237.78Year-to-date (YTD) price change: Up about 25%Dividend yield: 1.8% Our first stock is a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Deerfield, Illinois based Caterpillar is one of the largest manufacturers of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. At the end of January, Caterpillar announced its 2020 full year and Q4 financials. The company reports revenue in four segments: construction industries, resource industries, energy & transportation, and Caterpillar Financial Services. Over 40% of revenues come from North America. Put another way, it has a large global footprint, too. Total sales were $11.2 billion, implying a 15% decline year-over-year (YoY). Net earnings were down by 29% YoY and stood at $780 million. EPS was $1.42, compared with $1.97 profit per share in Q4 2019. The company ended the year with a $9.4 billion cash figure. CEO Jim Umpleby cited “We do expect 2021 to be a better year than 2020 for us. We expect higher sales, but just given the uncertainty around the pandemic, the rollout of the vaccine, the resulting impact on the global economy, although we expect it to be a better year, it’s difficult for us to quantify how much better it will be just based on the pandemic.” CAT stock’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are 29.5 and 3.07, respectively. Given the upcoming earnings season, there could be short-term profit-taking in the shares. A potential decline toward the $215 level would improve the margin of safety in the shares of this iconic company. On a final note, the company is a dividend aristocrat with almost three decades of dividend increases. Columbus McKinnon (CMCO) Source: Gorodenkoff via Shutterstock 52-week range: $21.52-$57.06YTD price change: Up about 38%Dividend yield: 0.46% Our next company is the Getzville, New York based material handling specialist Columbus McKinnon. It designs motion control products and technologies that move, lift, position and secure materials. The group’s products include hoists, actuators, rigging tools, light rail work stations and digital power and motion control systems. They are used in many industries, including construction and infrastructure, mining, oil, energy, aerospace, transportation, automotive, heavy equipment manufacturing and entertainment. In late January, CMCO announced financial results for its fiscal year 2021 third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 2020. Revenue was down by 16.5% YoY to $166.5 million mainly due to the pandemic’s adverse impact on volumes. The company generates 53% of its sales from the U.S. Net income also slid from $15.3 million in Q3 2020 to $6.6 million in Q3 2021. Hence, diluted EPS fell from 63 cents to 27 cents. Free cash flow recorded was $22 million at the end of the period. CEO David Wilson commented, “We delivered solid results in adverse conditions with revenue exceeding our expectations. We are optimistic that growth will accelerate in fiscal 2022 as demand improves and channel partners replenish inventories. Given current macroeconomic forecasts, we expect to return to more normalized revenue levels by this time next year.” The company expects Q4 2021 sales to be within $175-$180 million range. 7 Big Names That Could Be the Next Tesla CMCO stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratio of the stock stands at 24.04 and 1.92. Moving items around plants, construction sites, or factories might not sound like a growth area. However, Columbus McKinnon is likely to benefit from increased infrastructure spending. The shares would offer better value around $50. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $7.30-$39.10YTD % change: Up about 29%Dividend yield: 0.87% Phoenix, Arizona-based miner Freeport-McMoRan is the largest copper producer in the world. Since copper is an important commodity in building and construction work, the company has been in the limelight in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the price of copper has also been on the rise, providing tailwinds for FCX share price. In March 2020, the price of copper was about $2 per pound. Now it is about $4 per pound. Part of the increase in the commodity price is due to copper’s role in green energy as electric vehicles (EVs) use copper, too. It is also used in solar and wind technologies. The company operates through geographical assets with reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. The segments include refined copper products, copper in concentrate, gold, molybdenum, oil and other. Freeport-McMoRan reported fourth quarter and 2020 full year results in late January. Consolidated sales totaled $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $3.91 billion in the prior year period. Adjusted net income totaled $566 million, or 39 cents per share. As of Dec. 31, 2020, it had $3.66 billion in cash and equivalents in hand. CEO Richard C. Adkerson said, “We are enthusiastic about the future prospects for our business based on the positive outlook for the markets we serve, our long-lived and high-quality copper assets, our seasoned and highly motivated global organization and the critical role of copper to the technologies necessary to deliver clean energy and support the global transition to a low-carbon economy.” FCX stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 15.11 and 3.54, respectively. A decline toward $33 would offer a better entry point into the shares of the mining group. 2020 has been a fantastic year for most commodities. Analysts concur that the industry outlook for copper is positive, potentially providing tailwinds for increased cash flow for the company. Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) Source: Shutterstock 52-Week Range: $11.99-$25.88YTD change: About 21%Dividend Yield: 0.4%Expense Ratio: 0.47% per year Our next discussion centers around a thematic exchange-traded fund (ETF) Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development. The fund invests in firms that could benefit from a potential increase in infrastructure activity stateside. Such businesses could produce of raw materials or manufacture or lease heavy equipment. They might also come from engineering, and construction segments. PAVE, which has 101 holdings, tracks the Index U.S. Infrastructure Development Index. The ETF started trading in 2017 and net assets under management total $2.62 billion. Approximately 30% of the holdings are in the top ten stocks. Among the leading names are Deere (NYSE:DE), which manufactures agricultural equipment, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH), an industrial conglomerate, and Eaton (NYSE:ETN), a diversified power management company. In terms of sectors, industrials, materials and information technology (IT) make up 64.4%, 22.5% and 5.2% of its holdings, respectively. 7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills Over the past 12 months, PAVE has returned close to 92%. There could be some profit-taking in the coming weeks as many of the names in the fund report earnings. Interested investors could consider a decline toward the $23 level as a potential entry point. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $151.94-$353.56YTD % change: Up about 22%Dividend yield: 0.67% Raleigh, North Carolina-based Martin Marietta Materials supplies aggregates products (such as crushed stone, sand, and gravel) used in construction as well as in in agricultural, utility and environmental applications. The company operates under three segments: Aggregates Business, Cement Business and Magnesia Specialties Business. In 2020, Martin Marietta sold 187 million tons of aggregates. The group reported fourth-quarter and 2020 full-year results in mid-February. Net sales were $1.18 billion, a small increase from $1.10 billion from Q4 2019. Net earnings increased 40% to $183 million. Earnings-per-diluted-share also went up by 40% to $2.93 from the previous year. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.05 billion, an all-time record, in 2020 compared with $966.1 million in 2019. Martin Marietta had $304.4 million of cash and equivalents on hand as of Dec. 31, 2020. CEO Ward Nye, stated, “Our resilient business model and team’s commitment to Martin Marietta’s vision and strategic priorities enabled us to achieve record fourth-quarter results and deliver record full-year profitability and the best safety performance in our Company’s history. Notably, 2020 marked our ninth consecutive year of growth for products and services revenues, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings-per-diluted-share.” Over the past year, MLM shares have returned 76%. Like most companies in the sector, Martin Marietta benefitted from investor belief that the recovery would be faster than initially expected. Forward P/E and P/S ratios are 30.49 and 4.51, respectively. Those investors who believe the construction-led upcycle will benefit the company could consider investing around $330. Nucor (NUE) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $34.72-$82.76YTD price change: Up about 50%Dividend yield: 2.04% Charlotte, North Carolina based Nucor is one of the largest steelmakers stateside. The company is involved in every phase of steelmaking, from collecting and processing scrap to manufacturing value-added fabricated steel products. As a result of the proposed U.S. spending, the company has been in the limelight. Nucor announced Q4 2020 figures at the end of January. The top line rose by 2.5% YoY to $5.26 billion. Diluted EPS jumped from 35 cents levels in Q4 2019 to $1.30 in Q4 2020. Cash and equivalents were $2.64 million. CEO Leon Topalian said, “Looking ahead, we are confident that Nucor is poised for continued growth, and we anticipate earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to significantly increase from the fourth quarter of 2020.” According to company guidance, which was updated on March 16th, Nucor expects to announce record breaking quarterly earnings in Q1 2021, as diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $3.00-$3.10. 7 Micro-Cap Stocks to Buy That Are Shining Right Now NUE stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 8.32 and 1.2, respectively. Interested investors who believe steel sales will increase could regard any decline in the shares as a good opportunity to invest for the long-term. SPDR S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF (SIMS) Source: Shutterstock 52-Week Range: $23.85-$47.29Dividend Yield: 0.55%YTD Price Change: Up about 10%Expense Ratio: 0.45% per year President Biden is adamant that his administration will increasingly push for sustainable infrastructure.

2021-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Caterpillar Inc. is warning of potential impacts ahead due to a global chip shortage, putting a damper on better-than-expected earnings for the world’s biggest maker of mining and construction equipment.“Although we haven’t been impacted yet, the global semiconductor shortage may have an impact later this year,” Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said in a Thursday interview. “It’s a risk and obviously we’re keeping a close eye on it.”The cautionary words come after Caterpillar posted first-quarter revenue and profit that topped analysts’ estimates, in what Bonfield described as “very strong performance” for the start of the year fueled by construction growth in the U.S. and China.Caterpillar joins some of the world’s biggest automakers and tech giants in highlighting the impacts of a chip shortage that’s already caused Honda Motor Co. to halt output at Japanese plants and Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in flagging production cuts and lost revenue.The shortfall comes as Caterpillar expects a big ramp up in machinery production through the rest of the year. While the company has been able to mitigate the issue so far, Bonfield said such shortages could mean Caterpillar may not be able to fully meet demand from its customers this year.Caterpillar’s quarterly results surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, with sales jumping 12% to $11.9 billion in the period and per-share adjusted earnings of $2.87 topping the $1.95 a share average estimate of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Shares of Caterpillar fell 2.3% to $226.99 at 10:09 a.m. trading in New York.Caterpillar has been riding high on expectations for a sales recovery, with the stock coming off its best quarter in more than a decade in a bet on improving orders amid mass vaccine rollouts and signs of rebounding industrial demand.Other Takeaways:With global metal prices surging to multi-year and all-time highs, Caterpillar’s CEO said during an earnings call that the company is seeing a “gradual” improvement in the pace of mining equipment sales.Construction in the U.S. and China remain the brightest spots for the company. Management said demand will continue growing in the U.S. while staying strong in China. Still, the company said they expect the second half to be more challenging in China because the Asian nation began recovering much sooner than the rest of the world.Dealer inventories grew, but executives don’t expect a “significant” increase through the rest of the year and the focus remains on producing closely to consumer demand.Caterpillar again chose not to give a full-year outlook, saying that uncertainty around the globe still remains, making it difficult to give specific forecasts for investors. The underlying message is that the recovery is real, but the pandemic is still a factor.(Adds key takeaways from earnings call, and share decline)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Caterpillar Says Chip Shortage May Hurt Equipment Deliveries

2021-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- The global chip shortage is going from bad to worse with automakers on three continents joining tech giants Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in flagging production cuts and lost revenue from the crisis.In a dizzying 12-hour stretch, Honda Motor Co. said it will halt production at three plants in Japan; BMW AG cut shifts at factories in Germany and England; and Ford Motor Co. reduced its full-year earnings forecast due to the scarcity of chips it sees extending into next year. Caterpillar Inc. later flagged it may be unable to meet demand for machinery used by the construction and mining industries.Now, the very companies that benefited from surging demand for phones, laptops and electronics during the pandemic that caused the chip shortage, are feeling the pinch. After a blockbuster second quarter, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri warned supply constraints are crimping sales of iPads and Macs, two products that performed especially well during lockdowns. Maestri said this will knock $3 billion to $4 billion off revenue during the fiscal third quarter.“It’s a fight out there and you have to be in daily contact with your suppliers. You need to make sure that you’re important to them,” Nokia Oyj Chief Executive Officer Pekka Lundmark said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “When there is a shortage in the market, it is things like how important you are in the big picture, how strong your relationships are and how you manage expectations.”Meanwhile, companies that supply chips are reporting surging sales and pledging to invest billions to expand capacity as they struggle to keep up with demand. Qualcomm Inc., the world’s largest smartphone chipmaker, said demand for handsets is surging back as life returns to normal in some markets that had been locked down by the Covid-19 pandemic.STMicroelectronics NV, a key chip supplier for carmakers, said profit for its auto and power unit jumped 280% in the first quarter. CEO Jean-Marc Chery credited a surprise rebound in demand as well as the industry’s adoption of new, digital features that require more chips for the latest wave of supply chain constraints.Samsung, which is both a producer and user of chips, said Thursday that component shortages will contribute to a slide in revenue and profit this quarter at its mobile division, which produces its marquee Galaxy smartphones.The shortfall of critically needed semiconductors has forced the entire auto industry to cut output, leaving thin inventories at dealerships just as consumers emerge from Covid-19 lockdowns. In just the past week, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc, Volvo Group and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. have joined the list of manufacturers idling factories.“The second quarter is going to be worse for automakers than the first quarter,” said Song Sun-jae, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities Co. in Seoul. “The chip-shortage problem could end up lasting longer, maybe into next year.”Beyond Apple, whose high-specification iPhones and aggressive demands typically place it at the front of the line, the dearth of chips threatens to dampen a nascent rebound in the entire smartphone market. Worldwide shipments surged an estimated 27% to 347 million devices in the first quarter, aided by a plethora of new models and China’s swift post-pandemic recovery. A shortage of components such as app processors could sap that momentum over the rest of 2021.“Covid-19 is still a major consideration, but it is no longer the main bottleneck,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton wrote Thursday. “Supply of critical components, such as chipsets, has quickly become a major concern, and will hinder smartphone shipments in the coming quarters.”At Ford, the shortage will likely reduce production by 1.1 million vehicles this year, CFO John Lawler said on a call with reporters. The carmaker expects a $2.5 billion hit to earnings due to scarce chip supplies.Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk earlier this week called the chip shortage a “huge problem.” NXP Semiconductors NV said it’s expecting supply to be tight all year and warned constraints for the auto industry could extend into 2022.“There are too many uncertainties about when chip supplies will improve, and that’s making it difficult for automakers,” said Lee Han-joon, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “For semiconductor makers, the auto industry isn’t really seen as one of their key customers and that’s putting the carmakers in a much tougher position in securing supplies.”(Updates with Caterpillar in the second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Global Chip Drought Hits Apple, BMW, Ford as Crisis Worsens"

2021-04-30,"Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) delivered a blowout quarter in 1Q as the manufacturer of mining and construction equipment posted revenues of $11.9 billion, up 12% year-on-year and beating analysts’ estimates of $10.9 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.87 per share in 1Q that blew past consensus estimates of $1.94 per share. Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby said, “I’m proud of our global team’s strong performance as they continue to serve our customers. We’re encouraged by improving conditions in our end markets and are proactively managing supply chain risks. Our dedicated team continues to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth.” CAT stated that the rise in revenues was driven by higher sales volumes due to rising demand from end-users and from dealers increasing their inventories more during the quarter versus the same period last year. In the fiscal second quarter, CAT expects sales to improve in the Construction Industries segment, led by North America. The company also anticipates sales growth in the Energy and Transportation business and higher demand by end-users in resource industries like Heavy Construction and Mining. CAT expects operating margin to moderate in 2Q versus the first quarter. (See Caterpillar Inc. stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the earnings, Oppenheimer analyst Noah Kaye reiterated a Hold on the stock. Kaye commented on the results, “CAT handily beat 1Q21 top/bottom-line consensus with healthy incremental margins as it pointed to improving end-user demand across segments. With dealer inventories increasing +$700M ($500M positive sales impact year/year), CI [construction industries] paced y/y sales growth (sales to end-users +17%), while APAC led growth on a regional basis (dealer stats +27% in 1Q).” “Management indicated expectations for operating margin improvement to moderate in 2Q, which may reflect broad-based supply chain and material cost inflation trends as an offset to anticipated stronger demand in RI (mining, heavy construction, quarry and aggregates),” Kaye added. Overall, consensus on the Street is that CAT is a Moderate Buy based on 7 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $231.25 implies that shares are almost fairly priced at current levels with approximately 1.7% upside potential over the next 12 months.
