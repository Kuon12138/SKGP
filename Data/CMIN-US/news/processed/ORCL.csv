2018-11-15,"Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $216.03), took a few more bites of Apple (AAPL) stock in the most recent quarter. But the big news is that he&apos;s bonkers for bank stocks. Berkshire Hathaway added to or bought new stakes in five of the nation&apos;s largest commercial banks in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. The holding company also made bets on investment banking, custodial banking and insurance. In addition to finding value in select pockets of the financial sector, the Oracle of Omaha also made a surprising new bet on a technology stock. The world&apos;s greatest value investor made several noteworthy moves in the third quarter, according to a new Berkshire Hathaway 13F regulatory filing. (Large investors such as Berkshire are required to disclose their holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.) The biggest changes to Berkshire&apos;s portfolio came in the form of additional stakes and new investments as the company seeks to deploy a hoard of cash that stood at more than $100 billion at the end of the September quarter. But Berkshire also did a little trimming. Since it can be instructive to see what Buffett has been up to, we took a closer look at what Berkshire has been buying and selling. Keep in mind that not all &quot;Warren Buffett stocks&quot; are actually his picks - some smaller positions are believed to be handled by lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.

2019-01-07,"Whenever there is a plunge in the markets, consumers generally get more guarded with big-ticket items. And we may be seeing signs of this with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). During the fourth quarter, the delivery numbers were worrisome. The result is that Tesla stock has come under some pressure, but it's quickly rebounding.

In fact, the TSLA stock price has still held up fairly well during the market correction, especially when compared to other tech operators like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). For the past three months, the return is about 21%.

So what about the deliveries? Why the fall-off?

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Well, here's a rundown: The total for Q4 came to 90,700, up from 29,870 during the same period in 2017. Yet, the consensus estimate was for a more robust 92,000. There were also less-than-impressive deliveries of the Model 3, hitting 63,150. But again, Wall Street was too enthusiastic. The forecast was for 64,900.

  * 10 Top Stock Picks From the Street's Best Analysts 



But unfortunately, this was not the only bad news for Tesla stock. Keep in mind that the company also announced that it cut the price tag on the Model 3 by $2,000 to $44,000. The reason? To offset the impact from the reduction in the federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

### TSLA Stock and Demand

The fourth quarter does show some deceleration in demand, but it is far from clear if this is lasting or not. Let's face it, quarterly results can be choppy.

Despite this, it is still encouraging that more than three quarters of the demand for the Model 3 came from new customers. This is definitely a sign of enthusiasm (by the way, I know someone who purchased a Model 3 during Q4 and she is quite happy with the decision).

Going forward, there should be future demand from those people who have put down deposits for reservations for the vehicle. For example, Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that close to 200,000 of them have not ordered Model 3s yet. Then again, the reservation holders may be holding off because they are waiting for the $35,000 version.

Something else that should help spur demand: Tesla plans to roll out the Model 3 in Europe and China during the next few months. According to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the prospects for the vehicle look &quot;very strong into 2019 and beyond.&quot;

For example, today Elon Musk has announced that Tesla has begun construction of a car factory in China. Its on the fast-track and it may start production of Model 3s by the end of this year. Note that China has the largest market for electric vehicles.

### Bottom Line on Tesla Stock

Last year, Elon Musk stirred up lots of controversy, such as with his ill-fated attempt to take Tesla private. It instead resulted in sanctions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

But this may wind up being a positive. After all, Tesla has revamped its board of directors, with appointments of members like Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) Larry Ellison and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Kathleen Wilson-Thompson (who is the head of HR). Such high-caliber people should provide strategic guidance for Musk.

Besides, there should be some other catalysts for Tesla stock. For example, we'll likely get more details on the upcoming Tesla Y crossover vehicle.

But for 2019, the focus will continue to be on the Model 3. And while the latest quarter was a bit dicey, the miss was still fairly mild and again, there should be more catalysts to gin up demand. So for Tesla stock, there's really no need to push the panic button.

2019-01-09,"The name of the game in investing is &quot;total return.&quot; When you buy a stock, your total return comes from two places - price appreciation and dividends. For the longest time tech stocks were never mentioned hand-in-hand with dividend stocks. Pick up Amazon.com (AMZN) for $300, sell half at a thousand bucks a few years later, and you're sitting on free shares worth $1,600 each a year after that. That's the blueprint!

Many tech stocks used to offer share splits as their prices rocketed higher. However many technology companies are maturing, and with breakneck growth in the rear-view mirror, and they need a different way to draw investors. The answer, for many, has been to start delivering dividends, paying investors for owning their shares.

To be clear, tech stocks that pay dividends aren't done growing. The increased presence of technology in all aspects of human life means that there's still plenty of upside, even for Wall Street's biggest tech companies. To wit, old-guard blue chip Microsoft (MSFT) has surpassed Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) in market value this year, and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon.

Here are 10 tech stocks that offer an ideal combination of dividends and growth potential. They might not be the flashiest names in the sector, but they deserve attention nonetheless.

All good things must come to an end, as market participants are finding out. Over the past few months, the Dow Jones has gyrated wildly from hitting all-time highs to suffering gut-checking lows. While virtually all sectors have fallen on hard times, tech stocks have bore the brunt of the damage.

Since the beginning of October, the benchmark exchange-traded fund Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) has dipped into double-digit losses. That compares unfavorably to the broader SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), which absorbed a 7% loss over the same timeframe.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Similar to other sectors, the main culprit responsible for the decline in tech stocks is China. The specter of a full-blown trade war haunts the markets, and for understandable reasons. Because it's the world's second-biggest economy, a deteriorating relationship with China hurts both sides. At the same time, President Donald Trump is in no mood to show weakness after a disappointing midterm election for Republicans. He'll continue appealing to his voter base, which means acting tough on China and keeping the government closed until he gets what he wants to build his wall.

Nevertheless, we're witnessing encouraging results from Wall Street. But because so many names in the tech sphere have incurred severe volatility, they essentially represent potentially lucrative stocks to buy. A notable figure buying into this storyline is none other than the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett.

  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Lose You Money 



Of course, this is still a risky sector and it involves some knife-catching. Still, if you've got the contrarian urges, here are seven tech stocks to buy:

### Nvidia (NVDA)

Earlier this summer, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay boldly declared that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has protection against China's retaliatory tariffs. The reasoning made sense at the time. The Chinese semiconductor industry couldn't hold a candle to its American counterparts. Therefore, they would hurt themselves with a retaliatory strike.

Unfortunately, NVDA stock didn't receive the memo. In the second half of 2018, Nvidia shares plummeted, with NVDA ending the year down 31%. I understand the volatility. Having a trade war with China does very few industries any good, especially tech stocks. As cyclical investments, several shareholders panicked out of NVDA stock. An earnings disappointment resulted in yet another big selloff overnight and into this morning. But the hard numbers suggest the selloff has gone a bit too far.

Few companies are as financially solid as Nvidia, which features a strong balance sheet as well as good profitability and growth metrics. This has led to the markets placing a significant premium on NVDA stock. Near the start of this year, it traded at 51 times trailing earnings.

Now, NVDA stock trades at close to 18 times earnings. Better yet, it's still the same Nvidia … only at a steep discount.

### Intel (INTC)

In the ongoing market debate between Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), AMD wins this year hands down. Despite going on a wickedly-turbulent ride, AMD shares have gained a whopping 99%. On the other hand, INTC stock has earned a comparatively-pedestrian 5%.

As I noted recently, AMD makes a strong contrarian case. Its market value has taken a beating, but it has proven support where it recently landed. The risk factor is that AMD is notoriously volatile. It could shoot to the moon, or it could crater. If you're angling for a more reliable contrarian asset, I'd look at INTC stock.

Intel doesn't have AMD's present sex appeal. However, resounding fundamental strengths back INTC stock, which many tech stocks can't say. Primarily, Intel has the financial resources to weather difficult times. Once the weather clears, management can use these resources to invest aggressively into the industries of tomorrow.

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



Finally, INTC stock pays a dividend. It's not much, but at a time when major indices have struggled for traction, Intel stands out from the crowd.

### Amazon (AMZN)

I've always admired Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a sheer dominating force. AMZN stock is like LeBron James dunking on some fool that dares challenge him. You know what's going to happen, but you watch for the guttural joy of it all.

That said, it's AMZN stock that is now getting &quot;posterized,&quot; as they say in the NBA. After getting off to a brilliant start and maintaining that momentum throughout most of the year, Amazon received a gut-check in September. The following month, the markets mercilessly laid into the e-commerce giant, dropping its shares 21%.

But is this the time to go contrarian on AMZN stock? My InvestorPlace colleague Tyler Craig doesn't think so. He views Amazon as a dead-cat bounce. Considering that the company has had difficulty breaking past its 200-day moving average, I see his point.

On the flipside, though, AMZN stock has countered prior negative technical posturing with significant vigor. Recall that in early spring of this year, Amazon suffered a brief 14% decline before rebounding sharply.

History isn't guaranteed to repeat. One thing I do know is that you're probably better served betting on AMZN stock than betting against it.

### Oracle (ORCL)

When considering the best tech stocks to buy, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) isn't the first name that springs to mind. I'm not even sure it makes the top 20. While I believe the company has several positives to offer, ORCL stock just doesn't generate broader appeal.

But after watching so many top-ranked organizations stumble in the markets recently, we should all give Oracle another look. Year-to-date, ORCL stock has gained slightly above 8%. While that's not a compelling figure, ORCL is one of the few tech stocks that have held through the storm. Plus, shares are up over 3% in November, going completely against the grain.

That said, the biggest reason I included ORCL stock in this list of tech stocks to buy is Warren Buffett. The Oracle recently bought shares in the enterprise software and cloud-computing company. Interestingly, Buffett loves the titans of industry, particularly those who lever a moat in their core business.

  * 7 Best Stocks to Buy Until the Next Seismic Shift 



And what's Oracle's moat? That they enjoy brand advantage with big businesses. The company has established a powerful reputation with Global 500 firms, which makes it harder for smaller entities to compete.

### Perspecta (PRSP)

Among contrarian tech stocks to buy, Perspecta (NYSE:PRSP) is a fresh face. Launching its initial public offering in May of this year, the IT and business-solutions company hasn't had time to feel out the markets. Unfortunately, that hasn't exempted PRSP stock from severe punishment.

During the October rout, Perspecta shares dropped 5.5%. In the current month, PRSP stock has hemorrhaged nearly 11%. But even though we don't have much technical price history to work with, some analysts are stating it's oversold.

I agree. With PRSP stock, you must focus on the fundamentals. The underlying company's biggest clients are government agencies. From my experience, the government is only good at two things: collecting money, and spending it. While that irks us all during tax season, having such clientele boost Perspecta's longer-term potential.

### Teradyne (TER)

Teradyne (NYSE:TER) has easily suffered one of the worst performances among tech stocks. Since the January opener, TER stock has shed 14%. This is not one of those stories in which an organization did well in the first half, and petered out in the second. No, Teradyne simply disappointed throughout much of 2018.

However, recent signals indicate that you should place TER in your list of stocks to buy. On Thursday's session, Teradyne shares closed up 4.6%, helping to boost the overall technology sector. Not only that, I think a bottom may have formed already. Last month, the bears had an opportunity to sink TER stock below its $32 long-term support line, but failed.

If you're a contrarian investor, you should seriously consider taking a gamble. TER stock boasts impressive fundamentals, featuring a strong balance sheet, as well as lofty profitability and growth metrics. Plus, due to the broader volatility among tech stocks, Teradyne's valuation has come significantly down from its highs.

### CACI International (CACI)

Part tech firm and part defense contractor, CACI International (NYSE:CACI) is in a unique position to rise above the muck. CACI specializes in information solutions and services but with a focus on missions critical to national security. Hence, CACI stock is one of the few tech stocks that could benefit from a contentious relationship with China.

The robustness and resilience of the company's business model are reflected in the technical charts. Generally speaking, CACI stock has avoided the volatility that has impacted &quot;regular&quot; tech firms. For instance, CACA shares dropped 3.5% during the October selloff. Yes, the company incurred a loss … but it was a minor one compared to most other names.

Moving forward, I expect CACI stock to keep chipping away. Just like the situation with Perspecta, the underlying firm has a clientele with virtually-limitless pockets. Moreover, CACI is a necessity: if it fails, we as a country risk vulnerability to our way of life.

Do it for patriotic reasons or for its upside potential; either way, CACI stock can help lead its sector to a resurgence.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-16,"The partial U.S. government shutdown is now into its fourth week, making it the longest-ever political standoff of its kind.

While critical functions such as defense and mail delivery still are operating, other less-vital units have been mothballed, including several national parks and many Washington, D.C., monuments. A handful of agencies are somewhere in between, furloughing some nonessential workers while keeping essential ones at work to maintain the absolutely necessary aspects of their service.

The ripple effect of the shutdown, however, has extended well beyond the circle of government employees and agencies. While government shutdowns typically don't hamper the stock market, a few publicly traded stocks and privately owned companies are starting to feel the pinch. These firms either provide contracted services and goods for the government, or cater to government employees who (for now) aren't receiving a paycheck.

Here are seven companies that have been (or that analysts think could be) adversely impacted by the shutdown.

  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for ORCL with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting ORCL.

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Technology sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Positive

The current level displays a positive indicator. ORCL credit default swap spreads are within the middle of their range for the last three years.

2019-01-28,"Since last year's stock-market retreat, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has made a nice comeback. But that should not be a surprise. Despite the company's massive sales, its growth rate remains solid and should remain so for some time.

But could the rally of Amazon stock pause? Perhaps investors have been overly optimistic about AMZN stock? 

  
Click to Enlarge Source: Shutterstock 

I don't think so. Keep in mind that AMZN stock price is still about 23% off its high (which was reached when the market cap of Amazon stock exceeded $1 trillion). Besides, Amazon stock has multiple drivers that make the company fairly unique.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

So let's take a deeper look at these drivers.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



### Amazon Stock: An E-Commerce Powerhouse

Even though Amazon has strong online competitors, such as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and traditional retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), AMZN still remains the dominant player in e-commerce. According to eMarketer, AMZN is expected to take a whopping 49.1% share of the U.S. e-commerce market.

And e-commerce is likely to continue to grow at a strong pace for many years to come, as consumers keep shifting towards digital platforms. Note that AMZN only has about 5% of the overall U.S. retail market.

Amazon's competitors certainly have to overcome some major barriers to entry. Just some of those barriers are Amazon's top-of-mind brand, its extensive infrastructure of fulfillment centers, its enormous amounts of customer data and of course, the Prime ecosystem.

As InvestorPlace.com's Luke Lango put it in a recent post: &quot;Prime growth is at the heart of Amazon's e-retail growth. As the Prime base grows, Amazon's dominance across e-retail will grow by two-fold due to wider reach and higher per capita wallet share.&quot;

### Amazon Stock: Cloud Growth

A critical factor behind the success of Amazon stock has been Jeff Bezo's ability to move into massive markets. Perhaps the most notable example is AWS (Amazon Web Services), the company's cloud business. Companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) should have been early leaders in the cloud. But it was Bezos who had the vision -- and the guts -- to launch a cloud business before them.

In the third quarter, the AWS segment posted revenue of $6.68 billion, up 46% on a year-over-year basis, while its operating income came in at $2.1 billion.

The cloud market is getting more competitive. But AMZN continues to add new features, innovating in a variety of areas, including AI (Artificial Intelligence), database technologies, virtual private servers and  many other new technologies.

Besides, the cloud opportunity is enormous. According to research firm Gartner, it will go from $175.8 billion in 2018 to $278.3 billion by 2021.

### Amazon Stock: Ad Business

The big knock against Amazon stock is the low margins of its e-commerce segment. Despite the company's cutting-edge technologies, robots and sophisticated logistics, its e-commerce margins haven't risen much.

But the good news is that AMZN has been able to increasingly focus on new markets that have much higher profit margins. For example, AWS has been a key component of Amazon's successful drive to profitability.

Another one of Amazon's newer, more profitable businesses is advertising. Even though Amazon's ad business is relatively small -- at least compared to the ad businesses of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- Amazon's unit still has the potential to become a breakout business. Consider that eMarketer estimates that AMZN likely attained the No. 3 spot in online ads in the U.S. in 2018.

AMZN is leveraging the big-time advantage of its purchase data. By using that data, marketers can obtain higher ROIs from their ads.

There are various other areas on which AMZN can capitalize in the future, such as Twitch (the largest video-gaming service), its video-streaming service and its Alexa-powered speakers.

2019-02-15,"Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $202.78), sold a teensy bit of Apple (AAPL) stock in the fourth quarter of 2018, took new stakes in three companies, dumped one position just a few months after initiating it, and continued to go bonkers for bank stocks.Indeed, the Oracle of Omaha made a total of 17 buys and sells during the three months ended Dec. 31. And because it can be instructive to see what Buffett has been up to, we took a closer look at Berkshire's latest changes to its equity portfolio.We know what the greatest value investor of all time has been doing because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires all investment managers with more than $100 million in assets to file a Form 13F quarterly to disclose any changes in share ownership. These filings add an important level of transparency to the stock market, and give Buffett-ologists a chance to get a bead on what he's thinking.When Buffett starts a new stake in some company, or adds to an existing one, investors take that as a vote of confidence. On the other hand, if he pares his holdings in a stock, it can spark investors to rethink their own investments.Here's the scorecard for what Berkshire Hathaway bought and sold during the last three months of 2018, based on the most recent 13F, filed on Feb. 14. (Keep in mind that not all &quot;Warren Buffett stocks&quot; are actually his picks - some smaller positions are believed to be handled by lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.)

2019-02-26,"The S&P 500 kicked off 2019 on a strong note. It has put together a strong 20% rally off its December lows and only has another 5% to go before reaching the all-time high it set in September.I believe the S&P will break into record territory in the near future. But before that occurs, I suspect we'll see a handful of individual stocks rally through resistance levels as well.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 We are already starting to see this happen, and it's a great sign of things to come. But when looking for stocks to buy, we can make a lot more money by spotting the breakouts before they occur as opposed to after. Today, I'd like to talk about five stocks to buy that are right on the edge of breaking out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Merck & Co. (MRK)One of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, Merck (NYSE:MRK), is currently sitting just below an all-time high.MRK stock fell with the broad market after notching a new record of $80.19 in early December, but since then it has been able to work its way back toward $80. The first few tries at breaking through resistance this week have failed, but I suspect it is only a matter of time until the breakout occurs, making this a good stock to buy now.Merck trades with a forward P/E ratio of 15.1 and boasts a solid dividend yield of 2.8%. Both of these are impressive numbers for a stock on the verge of rallying. Oracle (ORCL)Once a high-flying tech stock prior to the 2000 bubble, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is now a much more mature company and that has held on to its leadership role in the global software sector.ORCL stock has run into resistance at the $54 area several times since 2017. The most recent rally has been in impressive -- ORCL is up more than 20% from its late December low - and the chart suggests we'll see a breakout to a new all-time high in the near future. Ericsson (ERIC)Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) is another company that got caught up in the 2000 tech bubble. It rallied more than 14,000% from the 1980s to the top in 2000 before losing 99% of its value over the next two years. After a decade and a half of not doing much, ERIC is now one of the best-positioned companies to benefit from the transition to the 5G network.This telecom-equipment maker has been attempting to break out since late 2018, but ERIC continues run into resistance near $9.50. There are two factors that tell me the stock could seal the deal move soon.First, ERIC has made higher lows following each failed attempt. That's a positive sign from a technical perspective. It means buyers are paying more for this stock on every pullback.The second factor is the investigation into China's Huawei, the number one global supplier of telecom equipment. The U.S. has filed charges against Huawei, and if the company ends up banned in various countries, it will create a major opportunity for competitors to take market share. Ericsson is one of two companies -- the other being Nokia (NYSE:NOK) -- that stands to benefit the most. This makes ERIC an ideal stock to buy right now. Tractor Supply Company (TSCO)Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO), a rural retailer of farming equipment, appears to be nearing a major breakout. TSCO has struggled to crack the century milestone since 2015. After taking a major hit between 2016 and 2017, the stock has now come back to within 3% of success.Tractor Supply is close, and I suspect we could see new records above $100 before the end of the month. If TSCO can break through the psychological $100 level, look for an influx of investors and heavy buying to push the shares even higher. Twilio (TWLO)Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) is a leading software company in the midst of an impressive short- and long-term rally, and it is now on the verge of a breakout above $120. This move would be the latest in a long line of breakouts to new highs in the last three months.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market I expect TWLO will remain a leader in its industry for years to come. And as a high-flying tech company, I also expect breakouts will remain a recurring theme in its future.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2019-03-05,"It's been quite a run for business analytics software provider Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA). DATA stock has tripled since early 2017. The momentum behind Tableau stock has been such that it kept gaining toward the end of last year, as other growth stocks generally tumbled.Source: Shutterstock Even with a 5.5% decline on Monday, there's an argument that the momentum should continue. Tableau remains a leader in data visualization. That positions it perfectly to take advantage of the &quot;big data&quot; trend, as I argued in recommending DATA stock back in August.Revenue growth looks like it's decelerating, with the midpoint of 2019 guidance suggesting just an 18% increase this year. But accounting changes are having an impact. So is Tableau's shift toward subscription sales. That shift pushes revenue recognition into future years affecting near-term growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound Still, even with underlying growth of 30%+, DATA stock looks dangerous at the moment. Competition remains intense and will only get tougher. Valuation is stretched after the huge gains. Tableau stock might not be a short, and it's possible it can continue to surprise the skeptics. But there's reason to believe that at least in the near-term, DATA may have already peaked. The Case for Tableau StockThe argument for Tableau stock is much like that of other growth stocks in the enterprise software space. The company's data visualization products are something close to revolutionary and hugely valuable tools for enterprises across every industry. With data demands and supply only rising the ability to understand that data becomes more important every year.Tableau appears to be the clear leader in the space. It's outcompeted older firms like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among many others. Tableau Data Prep has moved the company into the data preparation market, while its Hyper engine further expands the addressable market.It's a classic SaaS growth story, along the lines of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). DATA stock isn't cheap, admittedly: the high end of 2019 EPS guidance suggests a 68x P/E multiple. But revenue growth should be solid, with annualized recurring revenue (ARR) guided up 35% this year amid the shift to subscription sales.Meanwhile, like other SaaS high-flyers, Tableau is building a base of sticky, long-term customers who will deliver enormous profits down the line. In its Q4 conference call, Tableau announced a long-term target of 25%+ free cash flow margins. It will take years to hit that target, obviously, but in the meantime Tableau will continue gathering more customers, and more revenue, to drive those out-year profits. The Case Against Tableau StockFrom a long-term standpoint, the big risk is that Tableau faces more competition than other high-flying SaaS stocks. Newly public Domo (NASDAQ:DOMO) is much smaller but is driving better revenue growth, suggesting market share gains. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle, among others, are trying to play catch up. Salesforce.com's Einstein Analytics is a clear shot against Tableau's bow.In data preparation, Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) appears to be the leader (despite some recent weakness in AYX stock). Altair Engineering (NASDAQ:ALTR) entered the space by acquiring Datawatch last year.There's enough growth to go around, to a point. But at ~7x 2019 revenue guidance (even backing out net cash), DATA stock isn't priced for any type of slowdown. And it's important to remember that Tableau has stumbled in the past: Tableau stock lost almost half its value in a single session back in 2016 amid slowing growth. Competition worries were a big factor then, too.DATA isn't likely to drop 50% after earnings again. But it's clear that there's little room for error. Again, DATA stock has tripled, and touched an all-time high just a few sessions ago. It doesn't take much to make Tableau stock wobble - if not turn south, even beyond Monday's decline. Will the Market Stay Patient?It's not hard to wonder if SaaS stocks on the whole are ready for a pullback. The initial reaction to Salesforce earnings on Monday suggests valuations may be topping out.Salesforce unsurprisingly beat consensus estimates once again. But it wasn't enough. After falling 3.7% in the regular session, CRM is down another 2.7% after-hours. I wrote last week that the reaction to earnings might signal investors' appetite for further risk in tech. The initial response, plus Monday's broad tech weakness, suggests that valuations might be near a top.That would be a significant problem for DATA stock. 7x revenue isn't a huge multiple: many peers still are trading at 10x sales. But it's big enough, and competition intense enough, that it can come down. With earnings still too low to really support the stock, any sign of a stumble could send investors fleeing.There's still an attractive story underlying Tableau, a key reason I recommended the stock last year. But at these levels, in this market, risks seem to be rising. And there's a very good chance that, at least in the short-term, DATA stock could pull back.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Shares of the grocery chain fell nearly 10% following a fourth-quarter earnings print that came up short of expectations. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) chipped in quite a bit too though, off more than 3% as the long-standing selloff has now reached a self-sustaining pace.There are a few winners.

Rather, it's the stock charts of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) that merit the closest technical looks. Oracle (ORCL)Three weeks ago, Oracle looked unstoppable. The stock bounced as hard as any other after the December meltdown, and appeared to have enough momentum to blast past a huge technical ceiling,  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Now, not so much. The rally effort has stalled exactly where one would have expected it to, and the shape of this week's bars says the stock is one stumble away from slipping back into a pullback.  Click to Enlarge • The weekly chart lays the groundwork for what's underway here. Last week's and this week's peaks line up with the peaks from 2018 and even 2017, plotted with a dashed blue line.• Note the shape of the bars on the daily chart. In most recent cases -- and particularly on Thursday -- Oracle's closing prices have been well off the highs for the day, suggesting traders are even more leery of sticking with ORCL than it seems on the surface.• Though a move back to the $43 area, where the stock found a floor twice last year, is unthinkable right now, it was unthinkable those two times as well. Tyson Foods (TSN)The last time we looked at Tyson Foods back on Feb. 25, it had just crossed above its 200-day moving average line, and was toying with a break above a pretty important resistance line that went all the way back to September.The effort petered out, but thanks to this week's strength, the budding breakout move is healthier than ever. One more good day could easily get TSN shares over the hump, overcoming what looks to be brewing bearishness from most other stocks.  Click to Enlarge • If you look closely at the daily chart, you'll see Tyson shares are actually already above the technical ceiling at $64, plotted with a yellow dashed line.• This week's bullishness has also gotten TSN over another critical hump though. Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can see Tyson shares have fought their way back above the first key Fibonacci retracement line based on the late 2017 highs and late last year's low.• Unlike most other stocks right now -- even the ones that are making ground -- the bullish volume behind this advance is growing, pulling the weekly chart's Chaikin line above the zero level. Dollar Tree (DLTR)Finally, with nothing more than a quick glance, this week's big bullishness from Dollar Tree not only seemed unlikely, it seems unlikely to last. The rally started out in an overbought condition thanks to the January jump, and has only added to that condition now.There's more to the move than readily meets the eye though, and while we might see a little bit of a profit-taking pushback, such a dip might be a great entry opportunity.  Click to Enlarge• The late-February pause wasn't so much the beginning of selling as it was a chance for the buyers to take a break and regroup at the purple 50-day moving average line. The support at that floor was perfect, sparking a renewal of the rally.• It's the weekly chart of DLTR that really paints a bullish picture though. As was described back in late December, Dollar Tree shares have been guided higher by rising trend, the lower of which ultimately sparked the current uptrend.• Though it will take some time to get there, assuming the pattern on the weekly chart repeats itself, DLTR is en route to the upper boundary, currently near $130.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-12,"With a market value of just over $874 billion, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest U.S. company by market capitalization. Over the past year, Microsoft stock is up 15%, or nearly quadruple the gains of the Nasdaq-100 Index, of which Microsoft is a marquee member.Source: Shutterstock A 15% gain in 12 months for a company the size of MSFT does not go unnoticed and that performance can give investors pause about getting involved with Microsoft stock over the near-term.While those concerns and concerns pertaining to valuation are legitimate, MSFT stock can credibly command higher multiples relative to similarly mature technology companies because it has the growth catalysts to back up those multiples.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;We see wide-moat Microsoft as an attractive investment opportunity throughout 2019, as there are very few companies the size of Microsoft that can offer 12% revenue growth and 15% earnings growth in each of the next several years,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;With shares hovering around $111, we see more than 15% upside to our $130 fair value estimate.&quot; Microsoft Stock: 'To the Cloud'A while back, Microsoft had a quirky advertising campaign where the catchphrase was &quot;To The Cloud.&quot; Some critics panned the commercials for being light on relevant cloud computing content and points, but Microsoft was onto something. Today, the company is a leader in cloud computing and Microsoft stock is benefiting.Cloud revenue for Microsoft's recently reported fiscal second quarter grew to $9 billion, equaling a run rate of $36 billion, up from $34 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners &quot;We estimate Azure is approximately a $7 billion business and it still grew by a staggering 76% year over year in the December quarter,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;The battle for cloud supremacy has become a two-horse race between Azure and AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Azure is well-positioned given its installed base at enterprise customers with Server, Database, Dynamics, and Office. Enterprise clients are increasingly adopting a hybrid cloud environment, which plays into Microsoft's strong position, as the company can offer customers their existing environment in either public cloud or on premise flavors.&quot;By some estimates, Azure sales could reach $26.4 billion through fiscal 2021 and some market observers believe the cloud could replace Windows as Microsoft's primary area of emphasis. That justifies the premium MSFT stock commands over rivals, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).&quot;At 25.5x forward earnings, they trade at a significant premium to its rivals Oracle (14.4x), IBM (10.1x) and Apple (15.2x),&quot; reports Forbes. &quot;This premium is largely justified. Microsoft has stronger prospects and a more secure stream of future revenues.&quot; Gaming, TooWhile MSFT's biggest revenue drivers are mainly business-to-business products, but with Xbox, the company is a major player in the booming video game arena. While Xbox and related fare are unlikely to usurp Azure and Windows as Microsoft revenue drivers, video game exposure is a nice compliment to Microsoft stock's growth prospects.&quot;The gaming side of this company, the ability to move it all on to subscription service and become a ubiquitous platform globally in gaming is a potential that not many people talk about yet the company continues to move in that direction,&quot; said &quot;Shark Tank&quot; star Kevin O'Leary in a mid-2018 CNBC interview. &quot;I think that's why this stock will actually expand its P/E in the next year.

Now, with the historic tech powerhouse set to report its Q3 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell Thursday, let's see what to expect.",What to Expect from Oracle Earnings with ORCL Stock at Record High
2019-03-13,"Despite raised expectations, the guidance from salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) disappointed, pushing CRM stock a bit lower on Tuesday and keeping it suppressed on Wednesday. The post-earnings-announcement rhetoric, however, was anything but bearish.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash Source: Shutterstock The numbers -- and negative response to them -- are a microcosm of a long-standing debate that's surrounded the company since its earliest days as a publicly traded entity. Salesforce stock has been habitually overvalued by every conventional interpretation of the word and, often, seen as a ticking time bomb for the day it fails to grow at a brisk, double-digit clip. The company has yet to see such a slowdown take shape, though. And, if CEO Marc Benioff's feel for what the next five years will look like, that slowdown has yet to even appear on the horizon. Salesforce Earnings RecapIt's a textbook picture of superior execution.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe cloud-based customer relationship software platform has no real defensible moat, to be fair. Additionally, a myriad of outfits ranging from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and others are all willing to give customers more for less money.And, yet, salesforce.com continues to roll over them, driving results like last quarter's resounding beat.For the three-month stretch ending in January, the company beefed up the top line to $3.6 billion, up 26% year over year. Moreover, they turned an operating profit of 70 cents per share of CRM stock versus the year-ago bottom line of 28 cents per share. Analysts expected earnings of 46 cents per share on sales of $3.56 billion.The backlog, even excluding the benefit of the MuleSoft acquisition, was up 23% YOY to $25.7 billion.However, the narrative slipped for nearer-term guidance. For the fiscal year now underway, Salesforce anticipates a top line between $15.95 billion and $16.05 billion. Of that figure, between $3.67 billion and $3.68 billion will materialize in the first quarter alone.Both are below analyst estimates. For fiscal 2020 (essentially calendar 2019), the pros have collectively called for revenue of $16.04 billion. Further, they anticipate $3.7 billion in sales for the current quarter. Also in this present three-month track, profits should roll in between 60 and 61 cents per share. Again, this downgraded forecast falls short of the analyst consensus of 63 cents per share of CRM stock. Analysts UnfazedAt 20 years of age with technology than can be (and is) easily replicated by other competitors, CRM remains relevant. After all, the continued double-digit growth pace impresses, even if it's slowing down. Thus, the headwind is more about the challenge of competing with the company's own historical growth.Still, the expected red flags of size and age have started to wave.One of them is rapidly escalating spending. While revenue grew 26% last quarter, operating expenditures -- including sales and marketing costs -- were up 32% YOY. It may be a sign of increased commoditization of customer relationship management platforms.Still, analysts have largely maintained enthusiasm for growth prospects in CRM stock. Essentially, they regard Tuesday's dip as a buying opportunity into an organization that's proven all it needs to prove.Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead is one of those optimists, noting:&quot;Given the solid results and outlook, we're raising our PT from $165 to $185, based on an assumed FY21E FCF multiple of 34x, up from our prior estimate of 33x and fair given the 20%-25% growth outlook, rising margins and what appears to be conservative FY20 guidance … impressive for a company about to hit its 20th birthday. We reaffirm our BUY rating.&quot;Morgan Stanley's analysts also responded positively to the company, stating:&quot;Three key factors bolster our confidence in the durability of Salesforce.com's growth longer-term: 1) Targeting a $200 Billion total Available Market, … 2) Best in Class Positioning for digitalization initiatives, … and 3) the big get bigger in SaaS (software as a service).&quot;Salesforce suggested it continued to win market share last quarter. If so, the company is holding the position as the favorite within the fastest-growing component of the enterprise software market. Looking Ahead for CRM StockMost analysts may have been looking past the next twelve months, and keying in on Benioff's longer-term outlook. The CEO believes the company will produce between $26 billion and $28 billion worth of revenue for fiscal 2023 (calendar 2022) and alluded to an annualized run rate of $30 billion following that growth.That would more than double the company's current top line, implying a CAGR of roughly 20%.With little reason to fear, Benioff is merely massaging a stock that's already up nearly 25% in the trailing year. Shares have almost gained nearly 90% for the past two years, confirming that investors are largely taking analysts' advice.  * 7 Housing Stocks Bouncing Back In 2019 CRM stock may be off a bit since immediately before its earnings results were posted, but would-be buyers are already testing the waters. If nearer-term movements are any gauge, the stock was up slightly on Tuesday, while the broad market fell flat.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-15,"So far 2019 has been on fire for the equity markets. The December crash in stocks was on such a negative sentiment that the flip to positive hasn't ended yet. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the leaders of the rally. Oracle stock came into its earnings report up 25% from the lows at all-time highs.Source: Shutterstock But this morning, investors are selling the stock because of the forward guidance. While the company exceeded the current metric expectations ORCL said that it expects less enthusiasm going forward. This is a natural reaction when the stock has been rallying into expectations of perfection.ORCL stock is a long-term survivor and this selling from the earnings will pass. Forward guidance is less than perfect, but it doesn't change the long-term thesis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, in the conference call, ORCL co-founder called out Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). I find it strange to pick on a clear winner that surged out of nowhere to hijack the cloud from under the noses of those like ORCL, which were best set up to own it.If things are going so perfectly for ORCL then why guide lower. This is not the same as me saying they are failures. It's a pure statement on investors becoming over-exuberant with the ORCL stock price too fast going into the earnings event. How to Approach Orcale Stock After EarningsThe stock had rallied so fast that it became a setup for failure on the earnings report. At all-time highs, ORCL would have needed to blow out the expectations on all counts, including the guidance. Since they didn't, investors lashed out by hitting the sell button.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary Luckily and to put things into context, Oracle stock was up 17% year-to-date. This dip merely brings them back into a breakout level that has been in contention since last September. This is normal price action that follows a stock break out. The bulls need to retest pivot levels for footing before they can proceed higher.The rally that began on Christmas has been phenomenal and left several mini-levels of contention. Those act as support on the way down. Both bulls and bears usually want to fight over them again so they create price congestion, which helps the bulls.The first such level is at $51 per share with a secondary level at $49.80. These are zones and not so much hard lines in the sand. I think of them as rubber bands, so I don't expect perfection stops. But they do serve as excellent guides for those term traders.Dec. 3 was an important day for the stock market last year. So for ORCL stock that coincides with the area around $47.50 per share. I expect that this level would be the strongest short-term support if the selling continues from this earnings report.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Today On the other hand, and fundamentally speaking, there is a reason to stay long the stock for the long term. Small moves like today's are negligible over time. ORCL is a proven winner that survived the Dot com bubble burst and several sector-wide trend changes. So they are likely to continue executing on plans for years to come.What also helps the bulls is that we now depend on technology more than ever before and the trend is becoming exponential. Tech begets more tech, so the demand on ORCL products and services should stay strong. There is plenty of business for all major competitors to thrive for years to come.I don't look for the experts on Wall Street for help. I'd rather develop and trade my own thesis. The analysts who cover ORCL are split between BUY and HOLD. And the stock is trading in the middle of their price ranges.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-18,"U.S. stock futures are trading mixed in early morning trading. Pre-market weakness in Boeing (NYSE:BA) is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the other major U.S. Indexes are circling unchanged.The Dow is down 0.19% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.04%. Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.02%.Options expiration lit a fire under trading activity on Friday, with call volume winning the day by a large margin. Specifically, about 23.4 million calls and 18.4 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe call surge slammed the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio down to 0.57 - roughly the middle of its 2019 range. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average once again remained sticky at 0.65.Here were three stocks that commanded the attention of call lovers. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) tacked on additional gains to its recent Peltz-inspired breakout. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) swooned and then soared after reporting earnings. Finally, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was flooded with activity as it rocketed to a new record high.Let's take a closer look: Aurora Cannabis (ACB)Recent news that Aurora Cannabis nabbed Nelson Peltz as a strategic advisor continues to benefit its stock price. ACB shares rallied another 6.9% on Friday amid optimism that the billionaire activist investor will help accelerate the company's expansion.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Make the Grade If its entrance into the new year is any indication, 2019 is setting up to be a banner year. ACB stock is already up 93% year-to-date, and its price action has been tremendously healthy.While the stock could do with some digestion after such a meteoric run over the past week, any dips should prove buyable.On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Activity ballooned to 305% of the average daily volume, with 167,036 total contracts traded. An impressive 81% of the tally came from call options alone, showing just how dominating bulls were on Friday.Implied volatility remained subdued, hovering at 75% which is near the lower end of its range. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle shares saw a volatile session after reporting earnings that surpassed the Street's estimates. For the third quarter, the tech giant raked in earnings of 87 cents per share on $9.61 billion in revenue. The EPS metric beat expectations by 3 cents while revenue essentially met them.Shareholders will be happy to note the company decided to increase their quarterly dividend payouts from 19 cents to 26 cents.ORCL gapped lower on the day, but buyers emerged to bid the stock back to unchanged on the day. The rapid upside reversal proves buyers' willingness to defend the uptrend and should bode well for the stock going forward.On the options trading front, Oracle was the second most active stock in the market. Activity climbed to 522% of the average daily volume, with 119,866 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 61% of the total.The post-earnings volatility crush was particularly potent, with ORCL ending essentially unchanged on the day. Implied volatility fell to 18%, placing it at the 6th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of 61 cents, or 1.2% per day. Microsoft (MSFT)The fourth-quarter beatdown in Microsoft is all but a distant memory. On Friday, the sultan of software notched a new closing high at $115.91. It's also on a six-day winning streak. Volume surged to 54.6 million shares which is roughly double the daily average.With the breakout, MSFT stock is firmly positioned for more gains. It's effectively spent the past six months in pause mode. Consider the multi-month base a sound foundation for MSFT to build its next bull run on.Not surprisingly, the burst to record highs buoyed up options trading with calls leading the way. Activity ramped to 214% of the average daily volume, with 277,248 total contracts traded. Calls added 65% to the sum.The increased demand drove implied volatility slightly higher on the day to 18%. Still, it remains at a lowly 3rd percentile of its one-year range, so fear and uncertainty has all but abandoned MSFT stock. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $1.34 or 1.2%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-27,"ZDNet reported in late February that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) bought approximately $2.1 billion of Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) last year between July and September and then promptly turned around and sold all of its Oracle stock in the final three months of the year. Source: Open Grid Scheduler Via FlickrInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI read this the other day and couldn't believe my eyes, so I checked the SEC filings. Sure enough, it was true. Berkshire bought and sold Oracle stock in  six months, setting what has to be a record for the shortest holding period in Buffett's illustrious career.  * 7 Housing Stocks Bouncing Back In 2019 Too bad Buffett didn't get second thoughts about IBM (NYSE:IBM). He could have saved Berkshire Hathaway shareholders a whole lot of grief if he had. So, why did Berkshire sell? Well, Buffett recently tried to explain his rationale. &quot;After I started buying [Oracle], I felt I still didn't understand the business. I actually changed my mind in terms of understanding it, not in terms of evaluating it. Oracle is a great business, but I don't think - particularly after my experience with IBM - I don't think I understand exactly where the cloud is going,&quot; Buffett told CNBCs Becky Quick on Feb. 25. If you own Oracle stock, you're probably questioning yourself after hearing Buffett's explanation that he didn't understand Oracle's business enough to hold it for the long haul. That's because unless you work in the technology industry and understand every nook and cranny of Oracle's business, you might just be taking a big leap of faith. And that's no way to invest.  The Argument for Selling Oracle StockBuffett's argument against owning Oracle stock is two-fold: he doesn't understand its business, and he doesn't know where the cloud is going. Sure, he knows that both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are both big players in this area, but beyond them, is ORCL a player or a pretender?Buffett couldn't answer this question, so he sold ORCL stock. If you can answer this question, I wouldn't sweat it. If you can't, here's something to consider. On Mar. 11, Oracle's top cloud executive, Amit Zavery, joined Google Cloud as a vice president of engineering, reuniting with Thomas Kurian, his former boss at Oracle who now runs Google Cloud. Zavery became the second high-ranking Oracle executive to jump ship since last September, when Kurian left. ORCL would likely say that Zavery merely wanted to work with his old colleague, and that his departure had nothing to do with Oracle's place in the cloud world. But others will rightfully wonder if Oracle's done as much as it can to keep up with Amazon and Microsoft, and if Zavery decided to go to a company [Google] that has an actual chance to catch them.&quot;While the company is rewarding shareholders with its capital return program, we believe ORCL is significantly underinvesting in R&D compared to peers at the expense of revenue and operating income growth, while also limiting its opportunity to participate in transformative M&A,&quot; wrote Nomura analyst Christopher Eberle prior to the unveiling of Oracle's third-quarter results in mid-March. Do you want to own Oracle stock when either Amazon, Microsoft, or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) will do the trick? The Argument for Holding Oracle StockOracle announced its third-quarter results on Mar. 14. It managed to beat analysts' consensus expectations on both the top line and  the bottom line. In terms of revenues, analysts' consensus estimate was for $9.59 billion. Oracle's  sales were $20 million higher than that. On the bottom line, analysts on average were expecting 84 cents per share. Oracle beat that estimate by three cents. Naturally, this would lead one to believe that Oracle's transition to the cloud is gaining traction.Co-CEO Safra Catz had this to say about Oracle's cloud business during the Q3 conference call:&quot;Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue,&quot; he said. &quot;As in past quarters, we're seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific,&quot; Catz added.After reading Catz's statement, it's hard not to get excited about Oracle's ongoing transformation, despite the defections of two of its key executives.  The Bottom Line on Oracle StockIf you were Amit Zavery and you knew that Oracle's cloud business was working like a charm and gaining market share on Amazon and Microsoft, would you leave your job as ORCL's top cloud executive?I sure wouldn't. On Friday, March 22, Oracle reportedly laid off several hundred of its employees in various locations around the world, including Silicon Valley. The company said it carried out the layoffs to help Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud reach its full promise. It says it's moving resources from old technologies to the new technologies such as the cloud that need them. Others believe these cuts are the beginning of a bigger set of layoffs that could amount to more than 13,000 employees worldwide. Warren Buffett's exit could have been cold feet. However, he's a pretty smart guy, so it's possible that he figured out, despite his lack of tech understanding, that Oracle was fighting a losing battle when it comes to the cloud. The departure of Oracle's two most senior cloud executives tells me all I need to know about ORCL stock. My recommendation: Sell Oracle stock and move over to one of the other three cloud providers mentioned earlier.

2019-03-28,"Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) stock is in freefall, so the question here is if it's a good time to catch this falling knife. This never ending slide in the stock is strange since on paper, CLDR should be soaring as it the company operates in the new-tech world arena. It provides services to help corporations manage their workloads and data analytics on premises and in the cloud. They even have a subscription model which is all the rage these days. Yet for some reason the stock cannot sustain rallies.Source: craft.co Last October, CLDR merged with Hortonworks and for a brief while investors cheered the move. This was the chance for two smaller competitors to team up so they could better compete against the behemoths like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unfortunately, the party did not last long and investors resumed selling the stock as it set new lows.Wall Street was once again caught trapped in this persistent selloff. Even the experts were fooled, as back in October, CNBC's expert Jim Cramer heralded the merger move as smart and that CLDR stock was a good stock to own. So far this has not been the case so maybe there are better days ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Problems in CLDR StockThe price action in CLDR has been horrendous. The spike into the merger headline marked the absolute top. Since then it fell 50% from that burst high to the Christmas low. The bulls did battle valiantly, but their efforts were futile. The bounce off the trough failed miserably once more. On Feb. 28, Cloudera stock nose dived 15% in about a week. It then cratered another 20% when they reported their earnings.Clearly Wall Street is not happy with what they saw, as it continues to sell CLDR with conviction. Since their IPO, CLDR stock has been in a descending bearish channel. Every attempt at a breakout from it has failed emphatically. There were moments of exuberance like on the September earnings but the rallies have so far always reversed and set new lows.  * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos So to answer the questions if it is time to catch this falling knife, the easy answer is: No.Once it lost the $13.50-per-share level, CLDR triggered a bearish pattern that targeted the all-time lows of around $10 per share. It is now almost there. So it would seem that it is hitting rock bottom. But, a proverbial knife that is falling this consistently is dangerous to catch as it will cost me digits. It often seems like it's a bottom only to turn out to be another trap door waiting to open. Case in point what happened to General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock last year.So what looked like a bottom then turns into a ledge. For CLDR this happened at the $13.50 zone and could happen again here near $10 per share. I cannot guaranty that won't be the bottom, but there is enough doubt so not worth the risk.So when would it be safe to buy it?Ideally I need to see a clear bottoming process. This includes a double bottom of sorts, then a string of higher lows. It would also be best to see a small trend of higher highs before committing long the stock. I accept the risk of waiting too long and missing out on the first few bucks of the bounce.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-16,"Clouds are becoming the standard for enterprising computing. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud offering has been getting left behind.Source: Shutterstock But under a new business-suited leader, Thomas Kurian, formerly a senior vice president at Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), that is supposed to change, with thousands of new salespeople and a commitment to supporting open source.It's a two-pronged attack.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe salespeople are a move against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the leading cloud platform, which dominates enterprise computing. Open source is a move against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the leading cloud infrastructure company, which has been squabbling with major open source projects who claim it violates the spirit of their licensing.The battle for the enterprise cloud is on. Kurian's WayKurian and his suits are part of the message.Google CEO Sundar Pichai seems to only wear ties for weddings and congressional testimony. Kurian's image is aimed at enterprise sales, at customers moving off Oracle. Even when appearing tie-less, he retains the jacket and a button-down shirt.  * 10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now In addition to hiring a sales team, Kurian is building Google's third-party channel. The open source partnerships are a shot across the bow at International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), which bet the company on hybrid cloud and open source in buying Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) last year. So is BigQuery, a spreadsheet database, meant to prove that only the scale of a Cloud Czar can deliver what big enterprises need.Kurian's plan is also based on interoperability. Google Cloud not only wants to connect enterprises with cloud rivals, but with rival cloud applications from Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) databases. Kurian even has a Microsoft LinkedIn page. Noticeably absent from all this is Oracle.Anthos, a new container management system based on open source Kubernetes, allows use of Microsoft and Amazon clouds, as well as Google and private clouds, for enterprise applications. Tools like IntelliJ and VSCode, connected to containers, are for cloud-native applications. Kurian also announced the company's first vertical-market cloud solution, a collection of tools for large retailers.Google is bulking up its G Suite applications, which compete with Microsoft Office. Google killed its Inbox service and is standardizing communications of all types inside Gmail. The PrizeGartner Group estimates $1.3 trillion in enterprise spending will be shifted to the cloud by 2022, with the greatest shift being in infrastructure. Private cloud spending is growing at over 30% per year, public cloud spending at over 20% per year, at the expense of spending on traditional data centers.This growth is what justifies the $900 billion valuations placed on the three leading cloud players. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is building out paid services on its cloud, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) continues to focus on free services with its cloud. The message of Kurian this week is that the effort to bring everyone else into the cloud has become a three-way race. The Bottom Line on Google CloudMost Google revenue still comes from its free public services, from search, Maps and YouTube. That's the base on which it is building its enterprise cloud business. That's the heart of its cash flow.For now, there is plenty of enterprise cloud business to go around among the Big Three, and even among suppliers like Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), service companies like IBM and cloud-based software vendors like Salesforce.It's a big investment that will cut margins in the short term. Last year, 22% of Alphabet's $137 billion of revenue went to net income. But the enterprise computing opportunity won't come to the Cloud Czars twice. Google's message this week is it will pay to be a player.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Microsoft stock, which has recently seen a 52-week high at $123.52, is expected to release earnings on Apr. 24, after the close.Source: Shutterstock I believe that the strong performance of MSFT stock has been based on robust fundamentals, which I expect to continue in the rest of the year. With earnings season in full swing, let us look at the catalysts that are likely to provide tailwinds to the MSFT stock price. What to Watch for From Microsoft's EarningsAs one of the world's leading technology companies, Microsoft offers a wide range of software products, services and devices, as well as online advertising to a global audience.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn its upcoming earnings report, Microsoft shareholders will pay special attention to three segments:  * Productivity and business processes (includes its Office and Dynamics product lines, and LinkedIn platform)  * Intelligent cloud  (encompasses the company's server products, cloud services and enterprise services offerings)  * Personal computing (includes Windows licensing revenue, Xbox-related gaming revenue and revenue from its Surface family of products and PC accessories)Overall, each segment is an important contributor to the company's bottom line and mostly eye-popping figures. When Microsoft reported its Q2 results on Jan. 30, it posted gains in revenue and earnings, buoyed especially by strong growth in its cloud-based services. The tech giant delivered $32.5 billion in quarterly revenue.This week, investors will want to see if there is any growth fatigue at the high-profile tech company. The tech giant is expected to report $1-per-share on revenue of $29.84 billion; the reported earnings-per-share for the same quarter in 2018 was 95 cents.Microsoft stock is momentum-driven, hence it usually experiences big price swings after reporting earnings. In other words, it can easily gap up if the numbers are better than expected, or if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down, too.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever  Microsoft Stock Has Excellent Long-Term Growth MetricsThe recent rise in Microsoft stock price shows that Wall Street believes in the company's growth narrative. MSFT now trades at about 29 times analysts' consensus 2019 earnings estimate. Let us look at how each of the above segments may continue to add to Microsoft's future growth as well as the stock price.Segment-wise, the earning report of Jan. 2018 showed that Microsoft's productivity and business processes revenue increased 13% to $10.1 billion. Investors also cheered the growth in LinkedIn's advertising and premium memberships numbers. Microsoft had acquired the social networking platform in 2016 for $26.2 billion. LinkedIn, whose revenue increased 33%, now has over 600 million total users and over 260 million monthly active users (MAUs). In other words, the deal is paying off well for Microsoft.In its January earnings report, the company's intelligent cloud segment got the majority of attention and for good reason. Revenue rose 20% to $9.4 billion. Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) data analytics platform, is now the world's second fastest growing cloud platform behind Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS platform.Azure's 76% growth on a year-over-year basis indicates that Microsoft is gaining market share in one of the most important growth industries of the coming decade. Azure continues to incorporate applications that businesses that store data on Microsoft cloud also find valuable, including those driven by AI data analytics. In other words, Microsoft customers can use these AI algorithms to analyze data better so that their own bottom lines improve. Furthermore, the gross margin of the commercial cloud business has been increasing steadily over the past quarters -- a trend investors hope will continue.Microsoft's personal computing segment showed some weakness in the latest earnings numbers. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said that the revenue from copies of Windows software sold pre-installed on PCs fell 5%, as a result of a shortage of microprocessors. However, going forward, Wall Street is estimating relative stability in this segment. On a brighter note, gaming was a strong area in the sector and it is likely to remain so.Over the next five years, analysts on average expect Microsoft to grow earnings at an annual rate of 12.35% -- another reason why most Wall Street analysts are very positive on MSFT stock. In general, the company has been consistent in beating analysts' EPS and revenue estimates.Creating growth opportunities in the highly competitive tech space requires proactive management. And that's where one of Microsoft's strengths may lie. Under its CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has managed to move to a business model that centers around subscription-based products and services with regularly recurring revenue.And shareholders in this elite business, who also enjoy a 1.5% dividend yield, have been particularly rewarded. As a primarily subscription-based business, Microsoft now has a stable cash flow, another positive factor to consider for dividend investors. Short-Term Technical Analysis Over the past year, Microsoft stock is up almost 28%. Due to the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Microsoft's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;So, following its earnings report, there might be some profit taking in Microsoft stock. It's likely that a lot of good news has already been priced into the stock price. Microsoft stock's beta is 1.21, which means its volatility on average is 20% higher than that of the broader market. Therefore, if the industry or the overall market declines as other companies release earnings, the MSFT stock price may also be adversely affected.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks the Street Loves Several of Microsoft's competitors include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Therefore, as the market reacts to news and earnings numbers from any of these companies, MSFT's share price is likely to become choppy, too.If you already own Microsoft stock, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to-date.If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider using a covered call strategy with an approximately two-month time horizon. In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of MSFT at a limit price of $123.37 (closing price on Apr. 19) and, at the same time, sell a MSFT June 21 $125 call option, which currently trades at $3.20.The $125 option is slightly out-of-the-money, offering some downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in MSFT stock. This call option would stop trading on June 21, 2019, and expire on June 22.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find MSFT stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $140. In other words, it's still a good time to be bullish on Microsoft. The Bottom Line on MSFT StockAs Microsoft gets ready to release its quarterly results this week, investors who are seeking capital appreciation should keep in mind the company's dominant position in the cloud sector. Earnings are likely to catalyze Microsoft stock in the coming months, but just as crucial is the visionary stature of management vis a vis its technology peers. I believe that MSFT is on solid track to reach a $1 trillion valuation in the coming months.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-26,"The shares of the cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software company Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is up more than 35% over the past year. The overall fundamental strength of the company has been the catalyst behind the Salesforce stock returns.Source: Shutterstock Between now and when Salesforce reports earnings on June 4, there is likely to be volatility and even some profit-taking in the stock price, especially as many other technology firms also report in the coming weeks.However, I'd encourage long-term investors who would like exposure to a growth company in the sector to regard any dip in the share price as an opportunity to add CRM stock to their portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years  Salesforce Is an Industry LeaderNot many investors are fully versed in the fundamental strengths of the Salesforce stock. In a nutshell, customer relationship management software systems connect businesses with customers. For example, the software enables a company's support and sales teams to have all possible information about any given customer so that they can offer the right mix of customer service at the right time. It is the biggest software market globally.Wall Street credits Marc Benioff, Chairman and co-CEO with popularizing the software for managing customers, sales, and service. Revenues in the CRM market are expected to reach $80 million by 2025. And Salesfoce.com is regarded as the clear industry leader.Salesforce's market share is about 20% and over 80% of all Fortune 500 companies use its CRM software. On the other hand, the respective market share of each of its competitors such as Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is in single digits. CRM Stock Has Robust Fundamental Numbers On March 4, Salesforce announced results for its fiscal Q4 as well as the full fiscal year that ended on Jan. 31, 2019. &quot;We had another year of outstanding revenue growth, surpassing $13 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company in history,&quot; said Mr. Benioff.Growth was strong across geographic markets, products, and sales segments. CRM stock increased its fourth-quarter revenue to $3.6 billion, a jump of 26% year-over-year (YOY). It also reported a total of $5.38 billion in unearned revenue, an increase of 25% YOY. This metric accounts for sales that Salesforce has already made but, due to accounting rules, will only recognize later within the next 12 months.The  jump in revenue also drove a 29% increase in CRM's quarterly operating cash flow, to $1.33 billion. Finally, the company announced an annual revenue goal of $26 billion to $28 billionby fiscal year 2023, an impressive feat for a company with a market cap of over $126 billion. Salesforce Stock and Strategic InvestmentsSalesforce has been branching out into other business ventures, too. This expansion is made possibly partly due to its steady free cash flow (FCF), which measures a company's ability to produce cash. The juggernaut's total free cash flow for the trailing twelve months (TTM) ended in January was $2.8 billion.Investors care a lot about FCF as it can be used in a discretionary manner, for example, to invest in growth opportunities and to strengthen CRM's balance sheet further.The cash-rich company is also not shy to acquire smaller businesses that management deems a good fit with its existing product lines and growth ambitions. The $6.5 billion takeover of the business software company MuleSoft in 2018 was Salesforce's largest acquisition to date. Analysts believe that MuleSoft will increase Salesforce's ability to help customers integrate other systems into Salesforce.Salesforce, the most dominant force in the global CRM industry, has so far invested $1.3 billion in other promising ventures and public companies. Its focus is on cloud companies.Several of CRM stock's past investments include Docusign (NASDAQ:DOCU), Domo (NASDAQ:DOMO), Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), SurveyMonkey parent SVMK (NASDAQ:SVMK), and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Its most recent investment has been in Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) which went public on Apr. 18. In other words, these investments help Salesforce position itself for future success. What Could Derail CRM Stock Short-Term?Year-to-date, CRM stock is up 17%. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat overextended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Salesforce's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;Furthermore, over the past few weeks, CRM stock has been trading between $150 and $160, a range that is likely to be broken soon either to the upside or to the downside.Should bulls reignite, they could easily push Salesforce stock over $165. On the other hand, if there is a pullback, the $145 level looks like a spot to me to consider buying into CRM stock.Although I'm expecting some short-term profit-taking in CRM stock, I'd not fight the tape and would be willing to re-evaluate the technical charts in the coming days.Salesforce stock's beta is 1.37, which means its volatility on average is 37% higher than that of the broader market. Therefore, if the industry or the overall market declines as other companies release earnings, Salesforce stock price may also be adversely affected.If you are worried about the overall earnings season in May and would like to protect some of your profits in the CRM stock, you may consider a covered call strategy with approximately a five-week time horizon.In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of CRM at a limit price of $163.09 (the closing price on Apr. 25) and, at the same time, sell a CRM May 31 $160 call option, which currently trades at $6.65.The $160 option is slightly out-of-the-money, offering downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in Salesforce stock.This call option would stop trading on May 31 and expire on June 1.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find CRM stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $175. In other words, it's still a good time to be bullish on Salesforce. Bottom Line on CRM StockSalesforce stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further broad-based growth prospects, leadership in the respective market, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.Investors who are interested in software stocks or cloud-based services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Salesforce may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have CRM stock as a holding, including iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSE:IGV), First Trust Cloud Computing ETF(NASDAQ:SKYY), or PowerShares Russell Top 200 Pure Growth Portfolio (NYSEARCA:PXLG).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-10,"The Department of Defense’s ongoing saga to award its flagship cloud-computing contract reached a new chapter this week in the wake of Oracle Corp.’s most recent protest.  The Redwood Shores, California technology company amended its complaint in the Court of Federal Claims Tuesday, following a DOD investigation that allowed the acquisition to proceed, continuing the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract’s pingponging journey through the protest process.   The court is currently weighing whether Amazon Web Services held an unfair competitive advantage because one of its former employees worked for the Defense Digital Service when the contract was developed before returning to work for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).  Arguments on this most recent filing will be heard July 10, nine days before the DOD would be allowed to award the $10 billion contract to either AWS or Microsoft Corp.

2019-05-16,"Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported earnings last night and investors are loving it. It spiked 3% on the headline and as of this writing, it's up 6% from yesterday's close. Today's write up is to share an opportunity to trade Cisco stock up from here -- but with a cautionary asterisk. The bottom line is that CSCO has technical and fundamental reasons to set new highs for 2019. This earnings report confirms that management can get the job done.Source: Shutterstock Let's first start with the investing environment: it's been volatile. Monday, equity markets panicked on headlines that China had retaliated against the new U.S. tariffs and the trade talks had completely broke down.In spite of it, CSCO stock bounced and recovered the dip. It even closed +.8% going into its earnings report. This is a sign of confidence from its investors especially when the rhetoric in the media is full of skepticism.  Case in point, year-to-date Cisco stock is up 26% which is 70% better than the S&P 500. In 24 months, the difference is three fold.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast night, management delivered a report card that justified investors' confidence. CSCO beat on every metric that matters. They even guided sales above expectations. Cisco left nothing for the bears to sink their claws into. Selling this report makes no sense at this time.There were a few concern about margins but nothing that is going to last. The data suggest that the transition to cloud services and subscriptions is ongoing and according to plan. Completing this migration could fuel a longer rally to help Cisco stock set new multi-year highs or maybe even re-approach its Dotcom glory.Next, we examine the fundamentals -- and they are solid. CSCO sells at a 20 trailing P/E ratio which is cheap in absolute and relative terms. It is inline with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and 30% less expensive than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This is not a knock against MSFT's valuation, however. They have completed their transformation. CSCO is making headway, but still has some time to go. And that's the opportunity for the long term.But here is the opportunity for the short term. The CSCO chart technicals suggest that the spike here is the start of another leg higher. This probably won't be a straight shot to the target. Cisco stock will hit resistance at $54.40 so what happens in the next few days is important.If I am long the stock, then I stay in it and ignore the small dips in this rally. But if I am looking to start a new bullish position then I can either buy Cisco stock here and accept that I may suffer a few red ticks before gaining. Or, I would set a trigger to buy when it Cisco stock closes above $54.50 per share. If this is a trade not an investment then I should also set a stop loss because below $51 per share would bring momentum sellers to target $48 or lower. The Bottom Line on Cisco StockSo to summarize the opportunity today: For the past two weeks, CSCO stock price range tightened into a point and this looks like a breakout from it. CSCO should have legs as long as it holds the support.While I like the macroeconomic environment, I worry a bit about the geopolitical headline risk. China and the U.S. are in full economic war as they try to come to terms. This is likely to linger for a few months, but I bet we have a reprieve from new news until mid June.  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week Investors liked hearing from the Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins that the tariffs are no longer a threat. CSCO has shifted operations to avoid the headwinds that those would create. That is the perfect example of a management team that is mature and doesn't leave many things to chance. Robbins also reiterated his commitment to increasing the percent of business to come from software and subscriptions.The experts on Wall Streets agree that there is more upside in CSCO stock. Most analysts who cover the stock have a BUY rating on it and it is still trading well below their average price target.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-22,"The market may have popped on Tuesday, but it wasn't a terribly impressive move. The S&P 500's 0.85% gain still left it below some key technical lines, and the volume behind the gain was tepid.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Array Biopharma (NASDAQ:ARRY) was the big winner, gaining 23% following news that its colon cancer regimen met its endgoals in a late-stage trial. Among the more familiar, large and market-moving names though, the 2.5% gain Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) logged was less thrilling though more noteworthy. The partial alleviation of trade tensions, particularly surrounding tech, released the hold that had stymied most of these names on Monday.At the other end of the spectrum, retailer Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) was crushed, losing more than 12% of its value on the heels of lousy Q1 print that forced the company to dial back its full-year profit forecast … weakness that wasn't necessarily mirrored by other retailers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains None of those names are compelling trade prospects as we head into the midpoint of the week, however. Rather, it's the stock charts of TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) that are worth the closest look. Here's that look. Oracle Corporation (ORCL)Oracle shares have dished out an impressive runup since late last year, and for the most part have sidestepped the recent market turbulence.Take a closer look at both stock charts, though, and it's clear that momentum is slowing. Indeed, it has stopped and it is teetering on a reversal back into a downtrend. One or two more rough days could put shares into a more pronounced selloff.  Click to Enlarge  * The most important line to watch now is the one that tags all the key lows going back early February. It's plotted in yellow on the daily chart. It's at $53.59 right now.  * Although that floor is still intact, ORCL has already pulled below the purple 50-day moving average line a couple of different times.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart of Oracle, all the key bearish clues are lining up. The RSI line only had to kiss the 70 level last month before starting to unwind, and we could see a bearish MACD cross before the end of the week. That latter event could spur some programmed selling. TJX Companies (TJX)In the middle of yesterday's trading session, TJX Companies shares looked like they were in real trouble. Already trending lower from a late-April peak, fresh pressure was being put on the white 200-day moving average line. Despite the earnings beat and raised outlook, traders saw matters through a bearish lens … right up until they didn't.By the end of the day, TJX shares were back in the black, having pushed up and off of the critical 200-day line. The big intraday swing backed by a clear volume surge suggesting a major turning of the tide. There's just one more hurdle for the bulls to clear, though it's a huge one.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors   Click to Enlarge  * The big hurdle in question is actually the combination of the blue 20-day moving average line at $53.88 as well as the purple 50-day moving average line at $53.57.  * The scope of the swing itself is telling, indicating a sweeping change of heart, prompted by news. Such reversals tend to go somewhere.  * Almost just as likely, though, is a breakdown. Should the bears decide to retest the 200-day line at $51.49 (and the gray 100-day moving average line right below it at $51.18) and it fails to hold as a floor, the bearish momentum in place since late April could pile-drive the stock following a failed reversal. Lamb Weston Holdings (LW)Finally, when we last looked at Lamb Weston Holdings a month ago, we cautioned that while it had not yet broken below a major support line, the undertow was alarmingly bearish. The selling volume was picking up the pace as well.It turned out to be a worthy worry, though only for a few days. While LW stock edged its way back higher, it met a familiar technical ceiling to end up breaking under any of what could have been technical floors. A new one has been made in the meantime, but it's not great, and also starting to crumble.  Click to Enlarge  * The newest technical floor is right around $65.17, plotted in blue on the daily chart. That's more or less where Lamb Weston has found support since the beginning of the month.  * Although there's a floor in play now, both of the more meaningful support lines plotted in red and yellow on both stock charts have been snapped.  * It's easy to overlook, but the purple 50-day moving average line is now below the white 200-day moving average … a so-called &quot;death cross&quot; that suggests more selling is ahead.  * It's only readily evident on the weekly chart, but with the break under the yellow &quot;neckline,&quot; Lamb Weston appears to have just completed a bearish head-and-shoulders setup.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-11,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is once again the most valuable company in the world, by a large margin. MSFT stock is currently trading with a market cap of $1.02 trillion.Source:  Johannes Marliem Via FlickrSecond-place Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is at $888 billion, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is at $886 billion. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) is even further back at $740 billion.How Microsoft has done this, without drawing the ire of the antitrust police? Partnerships. One example is yesterday's Microsoft news announcing a cloud interoperability partnership with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). This is being presented as a win for customers who want to use multiple clouds.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose looking to make snark points can note how Oracle board member Leon Panetta has been making big money at Oracle. But since he joined the board, in 2016, Panetta would have been better off in an S&P 500 index fund. It's Microsoft stock that's ridden to glory, recently gaining nearly $84 billion in market cap in just five trading sessions. Going Along by Getting AlongMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has accomplished all this growth in MSFT stock reversing the course set by predecessor Steve Ballmer, and even by co-founder Bill Gates.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows Instead of buying or burying competitors, Nadella has embraced them. He has built a cloud in Azure that's neutral in terms of technology and globe-girdling in its reach, with operations on every continent.This has provided a lifeline to Oracle, whose cloud has become an also-ran.And Oracle has bigger problems than cloud. Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) and other software as a service companies -- some, like Salesforce, built with Oracle software -- continue to grab market share. Even Oracle's database niche continues to face new fast-growing competitors. What, Me Monopoly?Oracle moved toward Microsoft, ironically, because it has seen how Microsoft treated open source. Oracle went to war with open source for two decades.  Most notably it bought Sun Microsystems in 2010 and made its open source crown jewels - Java, mySQL and Open Office -- de-facto proprietary. It may have won its point in court  but it seems a pyrrhic victory.Microsoft, once as opposed to open source as Oracle itself, is now a member in good standing of all major open source groups. It even owns the largest open source code repository, Github.Neutrality has been very, very good for Microsoft. The shares are up 242% since Nadella took over in 2014 while Oracle is up just 36%. This hasn't come at a sacrifice in the dividend, which has nearly doubled in that time. Microsoft continues to make acquisitions. It made 15 in 2018 alone. But most are small, bolt-on deals for units like LinkedIn or Xbox.Speaking of Xbox, Microsoft now has a partnership with Sony (NYSE:SNE) in cloud gaming. The two leaders in console gaming have teamed up because, they note, Amazon and Google are threatening to run away with the cloud market.This may be the key point. Every announcement Microsoft makes to extend Azure, or to partner with former foes, is portrayed as a defensive move, necessary because some other company threatens to monopolize a market.Microsoft has no monopolies. Microsoft has its hands in every key market -- operating systems, gaming, applications, enterprise software, social -- but controls none. The Bottom Line for MSFT StockOnce a company becomes the world's most valuable there is a target on its back.MSFT stock now has that target on its back, as the target was once on the back of Apple, Amazon, and others. But it has been here before.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Of course, Microsoft was a monopoly then, as Oracle once tried to be.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

With Treasury yields plunging and overseas risks rising, it may be that investors simply see nowhere else to find returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor now, at least, investors seem willing to stick with U.S. equities. With a month to go until earnings season kicks in again, it remains to be seen whether that will remain the case.In the meantime, there are some interesting earnings reports to watch next week -- even if the calendar remains too light to move the entire market. A tech giant will try to prove its turnaround is underway. A cannabis leader will try to jumpstart a sector that has struggled in recent months. And one of the nation's most important retailers should give clues as to the health of the U.S. consumer.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 Investor eyes likely will stay on politics next week, but savvy investors should keep a close eye on these earnings reports as well, even if they may not make headlines. Earnings Reports to Watch: Oracle (ORCL)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, June 19, after market closeSimply put, recent earnings from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) haven't been good enough. Oracle actually has beaten expectations in the last two quarters, but revenue declined year-over-year in each period. The company's long-awaited shift to the cloud hasn't played out.Given that, ORCL stock actually has held up reasonably well, touching an all-time high earlier this year. But investor patience might be running out. I asked over a year ago whether Oracle was the next Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- a tech giant ready to reclaim former glory -- or the next IBM (NYSE:IBM), unable to quite keep pace with the technological change around it.Oracle still hasn't answered that question, but it gets another chance on Wednesday afternoon. A big fiscal-fourth-quarter report, including some level of revenue growth, might stoke optimism and allow ORCL to reclaim those all-time highs. Anything less at a time when cloud demand should be soaring, and investors might get sick of waiting for Oracle to show progress on its turnaround. Kroger (KR)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 20, before market openGrocery stores, including Kroger (NYSE:KR), plunged two years ago when Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquired Whole Foods Market. That deal perhaps hasn't been as transformative as some thought it might be - but since then, sentiment toward grocery stocks has appeared muted. KR stock did manage to rally from late 2017 lows -- but a 10% decline so far this year has the stock back where it traded two years ago.But what the Amazon-Whole Foods deal obscured was the fact that Kroger itself had sent the industry reeling just the day before. A disastrous fiscal Q1 report sent KR shares tumbling 18% and brought other grocery stocks down with it. As that report showed, Kroger earnings can impact its peers and even its competitors.For both Kroger and the grocery sector, Q1 FY20 results seem particularly important. Kroger reported more margin pressure with its fiscal Q4 report in March. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and even Target (NYSE:TGT) continue to show strength. A second straight miss -- particularly if accompanied by more margin pressure -- will suggest that Kroger is struggling to compete. That in turn suggests that smaller chains like Weis Markets (NYSE:WMK) and Ingles Markets (NASDAQ:IMKTA) may have their own problems going forward.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 With those stocks all selling off of late, expectations for Kroger earnings likely are low. But the company will need to at least meet those expectations -- or else investors might start questioning not just KR stock, but the entire sector. Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 20, after market closeAfter a big rally to start 2019, shares of cannabis play Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) have drifted mostly downward. That includes a 20%+ decline from late April highs. Other major pot plays have seen similar trends. With growth slowing in the Canadian recreational market, and no other significant catalyst on the horizon, the optimism surrounding cannabis stocks at least seems to have moderated.We'll see if Canopy Growth -- the most valuable direct cannabis play out there -- can resurrect some of that optimism on Thursday afternoon. Certainly, Canopy earnings are likely to move the entire sector.And in the context of recent reports, Canopy is carrying a lot of weight. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) missed revenue estimates in its fiscal Q3 last month. Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) earnings were underwhelming.The sector clearly needs some good news. At the moment, it looks like it's up to Canopy Growth to provide it.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-17,"The trade war rhetoric has had a negative impact on investor sentiment as well as prices of many tech stocks. As weeks go by, not many analysts believe that the U.S. and China are likely to conclude a comprehensive trade agreement soon. The negotiations may well drag out right up to the U.S. presidential elections. Therefore, the recent volatility we have experienced, especially in the tech sector, is likely to stay with us for a while.Today, I am going to discuss three tech stocks that may be appropriate for investors who are looking for stocks that have had pullbacks in price and thus offer better risk/reward ratios than they did several months ago. These stocks are Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).I believe investors who buy into the shares of BABA, T or ORCL at any upcoming dip or even around the current levels will be rewarded well in a few years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Shareholders who are still concerned about potential short-term risks may also consider hedging their positions. In that case, covered calls or put spreads with July 19 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Shutterstock Notable Tailwind Catalysts: High growth in business segments, including e-commerce, cloud and electronic payments; potential end to U.S.-China trade warsExpected Price Range Until Next Earnings in late August: $135-$165The current environment offers valid reasons to be concerned about Chinese stocks, including Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. Alibaba's share price has thus seen a significant amount of weakness of late. Over the past year, the stock is down over 21%.BABA stock has been increasingly volatile on the back of the recent earnings released on May 15 as well as the U.S.-China trade war and Chinese economic concerns.Yet Wall Street concurs that with a population of almost 1.4 billion people, China's economic growth is still in its early stages and that the Chinese middle class is likely to expand for a long time.Furthermore, consumer disposable incomes are also going up, fueling growth in many sectors, including e-commerce.In fact, the e-commerce market in China is forecast to almost double within the next four years to reach $1.8 trillion. Therefore, even if the Chinese economic growth pauses for a few quarters to come, the country's growth potential is intact.Alibaba's current share of the Chinese e-commerce space is almost 60%. Many analysts believe that BABA's bottom line is not going to be too adversely affected by these current trade wars as its business model is tied to China directly, decreasing the long-term risks of bi-party trade wars.BABA's core e-commerce business contributes to about 85% of its revenue. Yet BABA is rapidly expanding into many other lucrative industries, including cloud computing infrastructure, digital payments, online entertainment and food delivery.Alibaba's concentrated push deeper into cloud computing is increasingly being compared to the success of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud business. In cloud computing, BABA is now the market leader in Asia.In 2018, Alibaba merged its food delivery platform Ele.med with its lifestyle app Koubei to be able to capture a higher market share in servicing &quot;hungry customers&quot; and to better compete with Meituan, which is backed by Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY).As a result of increased diversification, Alibaba's revenue is expected to grow by double-digit-percentage rates. Such a growth rate would indeed be impressive for a company with a market cap of $415 billion.On May 15, when BABA released its quarterly results, both sales and earnings exceeded estimates. Total revenue came at $56.1 billion, an increase of 51% year-over-year.In the earnings statement, shareholders paid attention to four main areas:  * Core commerce (BABA's largest segment grew 54% YoY);  * Cloud computing (revenue soared 76% YoY);  * Digital media and entertainment (revenue increased 8% YoY); and  * Innovation initiatives (where revenue jumped 22% YoY ).One important highlight was that BABA's mobile monthly active users (MAUs) on its e-commerce platforms reached 721 million. The owners of BABA stock will be interested to know the corresponding number to be released in the next statement in late August.Another metric to pay attention to is Alibaba's operating margin, which currently stands at 15%. Over the years, BABA's high operating margin has contributed to its profitability, which has been even higher than that of  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). BABA's net profit margin is also over 23%. In short, Alibaba is showing strong performance across the board.Finally, forward-looking investors may want to pay attention to BABA's international growth numbers too. Currently, more than 90% of the e-commerce giant sales are made in China.But BABA also has investments in start-ups in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Higher incomes and rising internet penetration rates are likely to strengthen both regions' e-commerce markets and contribute to BABA's bottom line.Given the fundamental strength of the company, I regard BABA stock buy-worthy at current levels.However, in the coming weeks, I do not expect BABA stock to regain its recent high of $195.72, which was last seen on May 3.Instead, BABA stock is likely to trade in a range, between $165 and $135, for several weeks, possibly until its next earnings report expected in late-August.The daily volatility of Alibaba stock is high, giving it a wide trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Nonetheless, long-term investors could view any decline in BABA stock as a good opportunity to buy into the shares. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Notable Tailwind Catalysts: High growth in business segments; growing content through WarnerMedia; decreasing debt levels; respectable dividend yieldExpected Price Range Until Next Earnings in late July: $30-$37.5As internet-based communication becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, I find AT&T shares well-positioned to benefit from various commercial opportunities that would eventually benefit the stock price. June has already rewarded T investors well; the stock is up over 7% so far.Yet over the past few years, AT&T stock had lagged behind the broader market. Within the past 12 months, the stock has basically remained flat. The T share price on June 14, 2018 closed at $32.52. A year later, T stock is hovering around the same level.Even though the company has a strong brand and wireless infrastructure -- two factors that are likely to make it a dominant player in the 5G sphere -- the AT&T stock price has not yet reflected the company's robust forward-looking potential.Thus, now may be a good time for investors to decide whether the rest of the year could witness a sustained up move in the price of T shares.AT&T reported Q1 2019 earnings on April 24. With a market capitalization of $230 billion, the Dallas-based group breaks down revenue into six main segments:  * Mobility (includes wireless subscribers)  * Entertainment Group (includes DirecTV and U-Verse customers)  * Business Wireless (provides services to companies and the government)  * Latin America (includes Latin American and Mexican operations)  * Warner Media (includes HBO, Turner and Warner Bros.)  * Xandr (handles all advertising business)This diversified revenue stream of T stock is important for long-term shareholders who do not want to worry too much about short-term volatility.The company's key Mobility wireless segment generated revenue of $17.57 million, up 1.2% year-over-year. AT&T also added wireless subscribers and its domestic wireless business is neck and neck with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) for market share.In June 2018, a federal court approved the merger of AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner -- a deal that has now turned AT&T into a media giant and &quot;content king.&quot;This merger has been weighing on the T stock price for some time; however, the rest of 2019 should see the question marks slowly disappear.In the quarterly report, investors cheered that the group was selling off assets to decrease its debt burden. Indeed, over the past few quarters, AT&T's debt load had been on Wall Street's radar. The company finished 2018 with $171 billion of debt.The group has recently sold its minority stake in Hulu, a premium streaming service, to Hulu's other owners Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), for almost $1.5 billion.Acquiring Time Warner has bloated this debt load. However, the communications giant is now working to cut costs and debt at the same time. Management realizes the importance of decreasing the level of debt sooner than later.In addition to the company's strong earnings power through telecom and media-related operations, T stock also offers a strong dividend yield at over 6.3%. AT&T's dividend is a big attraction for many long-term investors seeking passive income.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold In short, along with the rest of the market, T stock could experience volatility near term. But long-term, the prospects for AT&T stock are robust and it offers a respectable dividend yield for income investors. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Notable Tailwind Catalysts: High growth in business segments; moving on from recent regulatory probes and legal headlines; 5G Leadership; respectable dividend yieldExpected Price Range Until Next Earnings in late July: $55-$75Shares of Qualcomm, the leading supplier of modem technology for smartphones, have been in a free fall since early May.On May 2, QCOM stock saw an intraday high of $90.34. Then on May 29, Qualcomm shares closed at $65.76.Legal headlines were mainly behind the unforgiving drop in the QCOM stock price. A federal regulatory probe recently concluded that the company had violated antitrust laws and that its licensing fees were too high.Qualcomm stock reports revenues in three main segments:  * QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies);  * QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing);  * QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives)Wall Street saw the ruling as having a negative impact on Qualcomm's QCT (i.e., chipmaking) and QTL (i.e., patent licensing) segements.Qualcomm is the largest maker of chips for smartphones, and its chipsets account for about two-thirds of its total revenue. Its chipmaking QCT segment produces the Snapdragon mobile system on a chip (SoC), a semiconductor product which bundles together a CPU, GPU and modem in a single unit.Its second-highest source of revenue is mobile-phone royalties and licensing. About 60% of its pre-tax profits are from its patent-licensing division, thanks to royalties from 3G and 4G technologies the chip giant helped invent.Qualcomm's patent portfolio is crucial for the company and the licensing business is the higher-margin segment of the three segments.The chip giant is currently appealing this ruling. Although the company may be successful in overturning the ruling, going forward, there is likely to be further choppiness in the stock price.In other words, if the company loses the appeal, the result could be fewer chipset sales in the QCT segment as well as much lower QTL patent licensing revenue for Qualcomm stock.On the other hand, a successful appeal could push QCOM stock upward, possibly to new highs. Yet, it will probably be several months before the company has a final answer from the courts.Analysts believe QCOM will also play a dominant and early role in 5G, replicating its success with 3G and 4G mobile networks. If the analysts are correct, then Qualcomm stock is indeed a good pick for long-term investors. The company is likely to provide a significant part of the intellectual property that will be used to develop 5G communication standards.Recent legal troubles and the subsequent share price drop in QCOM have followed the positive headlines in the second half of April. The chipmaker and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had announced earlier that they had finalized a favorable agreement regarding intellectual property licensing fees for chips used in Apple's mobile devices.This agreement now dismisses all outstanding litigation between the two parties. Because of the success of the settlement, QCOM believes its revenues are likely to double annually in Q3 (the group's fiscal 2020 starts on Oct. 1).In other words, over the past few weeks, important legal developments have been the main driver behind the major volatility in QCOM stock. Therefore, as the dust settles, I expect investors to concentrate once again on the bottom-line results as well as the leadership position of the company.Meanwhile, the 3.6% dividend yield of QCOM stock and the generous stock repurchase program are likely to act as support in case the price of Qualcomm shares declines further in the coming weeks.For investors not familiar with Qualcomm, this drop in its share price may provide a good opportunity to research the company and decide if they would like to include QCOM stock in a long-term portfolio.Tezcan Gecgil holds covered calls on T and VZ stock (June 21 expiry).

2019-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp.’s shares climbed after the world’s second-largest software maker returned to sales growth and gave a forecast indicating the momentum may continue. For investors, the results were a reprieve amid the company’s uneven transition to cloud-based computing.Revenue increased 1.1% to $11.1 billion in the period ended May 31 from a year earlier, the Redwood City, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $10.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oracle said sales will grow as much as 2% in the current period.Chief Executive Officers Safra Catz and Mark Hurd have sought to maintain Oracle’s large customer base as the company competes with a dizzying number of rivals in the cloud-computing space. The software maker’s stumbles against Amazon.com Inc. and others have spurred the company to seek help from unlikely sources. Earlier this month, Oracle announced an alliance with longtime rival Microsoft Corp., letting customers use their respective clouds.The period marked Oracle’s first year-over-year increase in total revenue since the fiscal first quarter.Oracle shares jumped about 5% in extended trading after closing at $52.68 in New York. The stock has gained 17% this year.Profit, excluding some expenses, will be 80 cents to 82 cents a share in the period that ends in August, Catz said on a conference call. The forecast is in line with Wall Street’s average estimate of 81 cents. Oracle reported an adjusted profit of $1.16 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with estimates of $1.07 a share.Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities, said Oracle’s sales and profit outlook brought relief to concerned investors.“These are small numbers but we seem to be making some progress,’’ Walravens said in an interview. “Oracle is doing a nice job on the applications side, but on the infrastructure side you’re competing against Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud. That remains highly competitive.’’Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire co-founder and executive chairman, said some corporate applications for the cloud are finally boosting overall growth, even as product lines like the company’s data-broker business declined.“We are focused on our star products and our star products are now driving the top line higher,” Ellison said on the call. “We have these other businesses that are melting away and we just don’t care.”Cloud license and on-premise license sales increased 12% to $2.52 billion, suggesting that Oracle is doing a better job of signing on new customers. The company said that revenue from NetSuite grew 32%, and Fusion HR and financial suites gained by the same amount. Hurd has been keen to chase growth by selling apps and set a target for attaining 50% market share to best rival SAP SE.Revenue from cloud services and license support was unchanged at $6.8 billion in the quarter, Oracle said. While that metric includes revenue from hosting customers’ data on the cloud, a large portion is generated by maintenance fees for traditional software housed on clients’ servers. The unit accounted for more than 60% of total revenue.Sales of Oracle’s servers declined 11% in the period. Catz said the company has chosen to “downsize our low-margin legacy hardware business,” which Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems.Oracle has been firing workers around the world to cut expenses. The company’s adjusted operating margin reached 47%, the highest in five years. The company’s costs related to restructuring also doubled to $168 million in the quarter compared with a year earlier.The deal between Oracle and Microsoft will allow mutual customers to connect databases on Oracle’s cloud to applications on Microsoft’s Azure cloud. The agreement signified a concession by Oracle that it won’t be able to compete against Amazon Web Services alone. AWS offers cheaper versions of the databases that make up Oracle’s core business.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Investors Breathe a Sigh of Relief on Rising Sales

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As Slack Technologies Inc. flips a switch later Thursday and becomes a public company, it’s another sign of how far the world has progressed beyond the old times of corporate technology. What’s different now is that it actually matters what you want.Until the last decade or so, the technology that workers used in office jobs was largely chosen by bosses far above them. The computer at the desk, the email system, the software that workers used to keep track of expenses or crunch a business unit’s finances were all imposed on them. And it was frequently terrible, because ease of use wasn’t necessarily an important quality to sell software. Cubicle jockeys have a lot more say in what tech they use at work these days. Relatively young software from the likes of Slack, Box Inc., Zoom Video Communications Inc., Google’s G Suite and SurveyMonkey parent SVMK Inc. have free or inexpensive versions for people to try by themselves. The idea is that a few workers will test it out unofficially and like it enough to persuade their employers to pay for the tech because it helps them do their jobs more effectively. And many companies are listening. This “bottom-up” business strategy has become a standard approach for cloud software aimed at businesses. Similar tactics were key for Amazon Web Services and other services used by technical specialists inside companies, and that has spread to more departments.Slack is perhaps the apotheosis of the bottom-up boom. Video conferencing or spreadsheet software can be useful even if one person at a company uses it. But team communication software like Slack is truly only handy if a critical mass of people are using it. That’s why Slack needs to win over workers and then persuade their bosses to pay for versions that are tuned to a corporation’s security and data-compliance needs. (Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack.)Some things in corporate IT don’t change, though. Young cloud software companies like Slack still court systems-integration firms that customize technology for corporations and other large organizations. The bottom-up crew also builds sales teams to pitch software at big companies, and those salespeople still get expensive cars when they sign up big customers.And like the Oracle and Microsoft of old, young companies still want to stitch their software into many other corporate technologies, which makes their product harder to ditch. They want, in short, to become a “platform” — a word that appeared 39 times in Slack’s prospectus for potential investors and more than 300 times in Zoom Video’s IPO document in April. Another thing that hasn’t changed from software’s olden days, at least for Slack, is a dependence on a relatively small number of big customers. Slack says it has more than 10 million daily users and 600,000 organizations that pay for use by three or more people. But about 40% of Slack’s revenue in the latest fiscal year came from just 575 organizations writing at least $100,000 in annualized checks to Slack. The company might be bottom-up in strategy, but it still needs the whale customers to pay its bills. Slack isn’t alone in this regard. Domo Inc., which makes corporate data analysis software, generates nearly half of its revenue from 450 top-paying customers. At Zoom, a few hundred customers generate 30% of revenue. Of course, some kinds of technologies — think databases or inventory-management systems — aren’t likely to appeal to employees and instead are pitched straight to tech-buying executives. That probably won’t stop startups from trying the new approach, though.Courting the rank-and-file is now standard procedure for many types of software. But one old fashioned tactic has lasting appeal: Persuade big companies to write big checks. A version of this column originally appeared in Bloomberg’s Fully Charged technology newsletter.

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. shares rose to record levels on Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected revenue and gave an outlook that pointed to ongoing momentum.While the results were seen as a sign of progress for a company that has lagged the overall technology sector for years, analysts weren’t convinced they represented an inflection point. UBS questioned whether the growth in the quarter was sustainable, while Morgan Stanley said the debate was on whether the quarter represented a “bounce or something more durable.”The stock gained as much as 7.1% to hit all-time intraday highs.Here’s what analysts are saying about the results:Morgan Stanley, Keith WeissThe print “likely reopens the debate on Oracle’s growth potential,” but the firm questions whether the results represent a “bounce or something more durable.”“While the Q4 numbers represent a poignant data point in favor of significant growth potential within Oracle’s large database installed base, the preponderance of evidence still suggests a muted top line growth outlook ahead.”Affirmed equal-weight rating and $59 price target, although “our interest is piqued.”Jefferies, John DiFucci“We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves,” but “we’ve been waiting for signs of what we believe will be a multi-year product cycle on the back of database options.”It may take another 18 months “before we start to see something as relevant as this start to boost total revenue by mid-single digits, which in turn should drive double-digit cash flow growth” for years.Buy rating, price target raised to $66 from $61.UBS, Jennifer Swanson LoweAfter this quarter, the debate is “likely to be whether demand for autonomous database can sustain that healthy license revenue growth” in fiscal 2020.The first-quarter outlook suggested “we may not be fully out of the woods yet, but management was optimistic that growth in star businesses was starting to offset declines in legacy businesses.”Neutral rating, price target raised to $57 from $54.RBC Capital Markets, Matthew Hedberg“Encouraged” by the results, but will “look for signs that Autonomous DB and Cloud at Customer are moving beyond the trial phase at a meaningful number of customers to become more constructive.”Sector-perform rating, price target raised to $59 from $57.Deutsche Bank, Karl KeirsteadResults were “better than feared,” but “we’d caution that a good portion of the license revs upside was due to one-time 606 accounting issues.”Notes management didn’t cite any demand softness on its conference call.Hold rating, target raised to $52 from $48.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“Oracle’s substantial cash generation enables its large stock repurchases.

2019-06-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Call it the class ceiling.Women suing major technology companies for gender discrimination would have much stronger leverage against their employers if they could press their claims on behalf of a large group of female colleagues. But last year, the first two cases to reach that critical juncture -- against Microsoft Corp. and Twitter Inc. -- failed to advance as class actions.Now three women at Oracle Corp. are trying to persuade a state court to let them represent more than 4,000 peers in a case claiming that the database giant pays men better for doing the same jobs, in violation of California’s Equal Pay Act. They were to make their case Friday, but the judge postponed it to September after a brief hearing.It won’t be easy because the U.S. Supreme Court set a high bar for employment discrimination cases to win class-action status in a 2011 decision that blocked 1.5 million female workers at Walmart Inc. from pursuing their gender-bias claims as a group. The barriers imposed by the high court played into the Twitter and Microsoft rulings, both of which are being appealed.The case against Oracle was filed by former company engineer Sue Petersen and two other women, all of whom worked at PeopleSoft Corp. before it was acquired by Oracle in 2005.The women allege that Oracle for years has paid women less than men for “substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions.” To bolster their bid for class-action status, the plaintiffs emphasize that company-wide compensation is determined at Oracle’s headquarters in Redwood Shores, California.Wrong ComparisonOracle contends the lawsuit wrongly compares women and men tagged with the same job codes even though such coding doesn’t mean the work requires similar skills, effort or responsibility, because Oracle’s products and services vary so widely.Relying on the codes doesn’t “account for the tools or programming languages an employee must master, the hours her work requires, or the number and complexity of the sub-areas of a product for which she is responsible,” the company said in a court filing.Dorian Daley, Oracle executive vice president and general counsel, said in an emailed statement that the lawsuit was “meritless,” based on false allegations and relies “on cherry picked statistics rather than reality. We fiercely disagree with the spurious claims and will continue in the process to prove them false. We are in compliance with our regulatory obligations, committed to equality, and proud of our employees.”Oracle is also fighting a case over gender-pay disparities brought by the U.S. Labor Department in the waning days of the Obama administration.The case is Jewett v.

2019-06-21,"Conditions in the market have quickly gone from utter fear to unadulterated cheers. Yet, when it comes to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), I'd caution bullish investors what's gone up on the Intel stock chart, is also likely to come back down. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock From May's pervasive and hard-hitting market correction and its attached-at-the-hip trade war concerns, Wall Street has gotten a case of the proverbial giggles in June. The upbeat shift has the S&P 500 hitting new all-time-highs Thursday. But when it comes to Intel stock and its chances for similar celebrations, investors shouldn't hold their breath just yet.Buoyed by strong earnings and fresh highs from tech giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), broker-driven technical leadership from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a bid in oil and FOMC follow-through, the broader market has its share of reasons for setting new records. The same, however, can't be rightfully said about Intel stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of INTC have rallied this month alongside the market's own bid. In fact, Intel stock is up about 8% compared to the S&P 500's own gain of just over 7%. But I'm afraid that's as good as it gets for the chip giant right now.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills I'd caution competitive threats from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reinforced during Intel's analyst day last month and April's bearish outlook point to a challenging company-specific business environment that shouldn't be dismissed so quickly. And even if you are a contrarian and see the upside in Intel stock's current situation, a quieted but still lurking trade war threat could become an even larger enemy of the state for INTC. Intel Stock Weekly Price Chart   Click to EnlargeDon't get me wrong, I'm not warning of Intel stock's demise and I'm certainly not bearish on its price chart. The provided well-detailed weekly view of Intel stock shows an abundance of Fibonacci and trend-lines spanning decades that continue to back the uptrend in shares. And INTC shares have moved favorably over the past month in appreciation of those technical supports.At the May bottom, Intel stock formed a bullish higher double-doji-pivot low backed by a flatter trendline developed over the past 18 months. The reversal also successfully tested the uppermost layers of a massive Fibonacci price band. And with stochastics sporting a supportive-looking oversold crossover, there's a lot to like on the INTC price chart going forward.But that doesn't mean buying Intel stock today is a good investment, even if you are a bullish contrarian.The current rally coupled with Intel stock's overall weakness of the past few months has shares testing resistance from prior trendline support dating back to 2017, as well as the 200-day simple moving average. It's enough of a technical barrier, that in conjunction with Intel's business risks, my recommendation is investors take a wait and see approach for the time being.If shares pull back in the coming couple of weeks and confirm the May low, buying Intel stock as a contrarian position prior to late July's earnings makes sense. I would, however, advise exiting before or after the report, if May's bottoming pattern is broken by more than 1%. If that possibility becomes a reality, it's my view the risks increase exponentially that an out-of-favor INTC could be facing even bigger challenges off and on the price chart in the months ahead.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management currently own positions in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and its derivatives but no other securities mentioned in this article.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon is preparing for the rollout of its controversial cloud services program even though the requirements of the $10 billion contract are still being challenged in court by Oracle Corp.Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, asked department leaders for recommendations about how they plan to use the contract and told them not to initiate any other cloud agreements without his consent, according to a copy of the memo obtained by Bloomberg News.Deasy sent the memo dated May 20 to a wide range of Pentagon officials outlining guidance for the “fourth estate” -- the Defense Department agencies that provide human resources, services contracting and other support services to the military -- to identify technology programs that could be transitioned to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud, or JEDI, and to a preexisting cloud program called milCloud 2.0.The memo sheds insight on how the Defense Department is moving ahead with implementation of the JEDI cloud program even while a legal dispute raises questions about the contract’s terms. Asked whether the Pentagon’s choice for the JEDI award is contingent on a decision in the Oracle lawsuit, Deasy told a group of reporters at a breakfast on Tuesday that “they are two disconnected events.”He added that the JEDI award will likely be decided “sometime toward the end of August.”Deasy’s memo also said that departments that have already gained approval to migrate data to other computing storage centers may continue, but must “evaluate JEDI as the General Purpose cloud solution at the end of the period of performance.” The memo also contained a list of more than 50 expected data center closings. The Defense Department has said JEDI should become the department’s general-purpose cloud to store the “majority of systems and applications.Defense Department spokeswoman Elissa Smith confirmed the authenticity of the memo and added that the Air Force, Army, and Navy have also “begun identifying and prioritizing programs and migrations to JEDI.”Deasy said Tuesday that over the last six months his team has contacted U.S. regional commanders, such as the U.S. Central Command, for a series of “cloud-awareness sessions.”“There is a significant amount of pent-up demand just waiting to use the capability once it comes online,” Deasy said. The U.S. Transportation Command that’s in charge of maritime, aviation and land transport has developed a set of tasks they want to migrate to the Jedi Cloud “as soon as that contract is awarded.”Contested ContractThe contract has been contested by Oracle, which the Pentagon eliminated from the bidding in April along with International Business Machines Corp. for not meeting minimum criteria. That move left Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.Oracle filed a lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims alleging that the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon. In May, Oracle filed an amended complaint alleging that Amazon offered two former Pentagon employees jobs while they were working on the contract.The Government Accountability Office and an internal Pentagon investigation determined the conflict of interest allegations didn’t compromise the integrity of the procurement. Oral arguments in the court case are expected to occur in July.(Adds that a lawsuit raises questions about the contract's terms in fourth paragrah. The full name of JEDI was corrected in a previous version of the story.)To contact the reporters on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Tony Capaccio in Washington at acapaccio@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",DOD Tech Chief Prepares for `JEDI' Cloud Amid Court Battle

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.For years, companies like Oracle and International Business Machines invested heavily to build new markets in China for their industry-leading databases. Now, boosted in part by escalating U.S. tensions, one Chinese upstart is stepping in, winning over tech giants, startups and financial institutions to its enterprise software.Beijing-based PingCAP already counts more than 300 Chinese customers. Many, including food delivery giant Meituan, its bike-sharing service Mobike, video streaming site iQIYI Inc. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. are migrating away from Oracle and IBM’s services toward PingCAP’s, encapsulating a nation’s resurgent desire to Buy China.PingCAP’s ascendancy comes as the U.S. cuts Huawei Technologies Co. off from key technology, sending chills through the country’s largest entities while raising questions about the security of foreign-made products. That’s a key concern as Chinese companies modernize systems in every industry from finance and manufacturing to healthcare by connecting them to the internet.“A lot of firms that used to resort to Oracle or IBM thought replacing them was a distant milestone, they never thought it would happen tomorrow,” said Huang Dongxu, PingCAP’s co-founder and chief technology officer. “But now they are looking at plan B very seriously.” IBM, which gets over a fifth of its revenue from Asia, declined to comment. Oracle, which gets about 16%, didn’t respond to requests for comment.China has long tried to replace foreign with homegrown technology, particularly in sensitive hardware -- it imports more semiconductors than oil. That imperative has birthed global names like Huawei and Oppo and even carried over into software in recent years, as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. expand into cloud services. That effort has gained urgency since Washington and Beijing began to square off over technology.“China has always wanted to use domestic tech and in areas like cloud, it’s been very successful,” said Julia Pan, a Shanghai-based analyst with UOB Kay Hian. “While it wants to use Chinese chips, its technology is just not there, but when it’s mature enough, they very likely will replace overseas chips with domestic ones.”Now, a coterie of up-and-coming startups are encouraging Chinese firms to go local. Customers use PingCAP to manage databases and improve efficiency, allowing them to store and locate data on everything from online banking transactions to the location of food delivery personnel.Backed by Matrix Partners China and Morningside Venture Capital, PingCAP is competing in a sector traditionally dominated by companies such as Oracle and IBM. The market is expected to grow an average 8% annually to $63 billion globally in the seven years through 2022.The startup is one of the newest members of a cohort of open-source database providers such as PostgreSQL and SQLite that are upending the market. Researcher Gartner forecasts that 70% of new, in-house applications worldwide will be developed on open-source database management systems by 2022.PingCAP -- mashing the term for verifying a web connection, ping, and the CAP computing theorem -- was founded by three programmers whose former employer, a mobile-apps company, was acquired by Alibaba. Inspired by Google’s Cloud Spanner, which pioneered the distributed database model, the trio -- Huang, Liu Qi and Cui Qiu -- began creating an open-source database management system that would allow companies to infinitely expand their data storage by simply linking more servers to existing ones.“Think of traditional database mangers like a fixed glass container, every time you run out of storage you have to get a bigger one,” said Huang. “What our system does is that you can link as many cups together as you want.”Their idea caught on with investors and venture fund hot shots including Matrix agreed to invest about 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in 2015. To date the company has raised more than $71 million and has about 190 employees.PingCAP is working in a space where competition is fierce -- its database TiDB currently only ranks 121 among global peers, according to database rank compiler DB-Engines, which uses mostly mentions on social media and discussion forums as key metrics. Other open-source database managers such as PostgreSQL ranks 4th and its direct competitor CockroachDB, which also focuses on distributed database systems, leads PingCAP by 30 spots. The Chinese startup also operates in a market where it’s difficult to make money -- PingCAP only has a couple dozen paying customers in China and makes about 10 million yuan in revenue a year. Their best shot is to create successes that can be later replicated on a larger scale, said Owen Chen, an analyst with Gartner. “Work with the 10% early adopters free of charge, and make money off the 90% followers later,” he said.That’s why Huang is working with big names like the Bank of Beijing and Mobike -- so it can create templates for each sector. “Only one thing is certain, data will continue exploding,” said Richard Liu, a founding partner at Morningside Venture Capital. “We have the patience to wait before they figure out the best revenue model.”PingCAP has one thing going for it: Chinese customers are increasingly willing to experiment with technology. Data supplied by some 2,000 companies -- more than 300 in-production users and 1,500 who are testing its system -- will provide PingCAP with what Matrix Partner Kevin Xiong says is akin to a supply of ammunition.“You need bullets to train someone to become a stellar marksman, and PingCAP right now has a lot of bullets,” said Xiong, who invested in the company.Huang points to how PingCAP’s database helped tide over Chinese bike-sharing giant Mobike during stressful days when user and transaction numbers exploded on a daily basis -- at its peak in 2017 the company said it handled as many as 30 million rides a day.“It was a really challenging time for us, and [open-source database] MySQL was no longer able to meet our demands given the jump in data volume,” said Li Kai, a senior tech director at Mobike. “PingCAP really helped us big time.”Huang and his team also made it easy for IT departments to jump ship. With one key stroke, companies could export their entire database on MySQL over to PingCAP’s. Some are considering moving their most sensitive data including transactions and customer info over, Huang said without disclosing names.Yu Zhenhua, an IT manager at Bank of Beijing, said China is constantly trying to enhance information security while his industry wants to lower costs as it rapidly expands. “TiDB’s service meets the demands of what we want in a distributed database manager,” Yu said in a statement posted on PingCAP’s website. A representative for the lender didn’t respond to emailed queries about its collaboration.Longer term, PingCAP wants to venture beyond China -- but there, the geopolitical spat is proving an impediment. Earlier this year, PingCAP was ready to embark on an expansion into the U.S. and said it was already in discussions for getting some prominent tech startups to use its software. Now the prospects of winning over American clients are clouded.“We’re not seeing any immediate impact on our business in the U.S. but the trade war does force us to look at the long term uncertainties of getting important U.S. clients in finance or tech to move to our platform,” Huang said.&#92;--With assistance from Olivia Carville, Nico Grant, Lucas Shaw and Gao Yuan.To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s Biggest Startups Ditch Oracle and IBM for Home-Made Tech

2019-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- A leading U.S. retail group, whose members include Walmart Inc., is eager to aid antitrust enforcers that are poised to investigate whether Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are harming competition.The Retail Industry Leaders Association, which also represents Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. among others, said it’s prepared to present their concerns to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which have carved up antitrust oversight of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies.“It’s pretty clear to us that the FTC and different relevant regulators should be taking a much closer look at these platform companies,” said Nicholas Ahrens, vice president of innovation for RILA, in an interview. “We are here to help.”RILA joins a slew of companies, including Oracle Corp., Yelp Inc., Tripadvisor, Inc. and News Corp., that have raised concerns about competitive harm from dominant technology platforms. The retailers’ group has already laid out its views on competition issues to the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee, which is investigating the technology industry, Ahrens said.The group wrote a letter to the FTC dated Sunday, arguing that the tech platforms create an “information bottleneck” that has the power to skew markets and circumvent the traditional power of price competition.RILA also raised concerns about how tech companies may compromise the brands of retailers, favor their own products over sellers on their platforms, accumulate data about competitors and allow for the proliferation of counterfeit goods.It should be “quite concerning to the commission that Amazon and Google control the majority of all internet product search, and can very easily affect whether and how price and product information actually reaches consumers,” the trade group said in a letter responding to a series of hearings the agency held on competition policy.Representatives for Amazon and Google didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The FTC has claimed oversight of probes of Facebook Inc. and Amazon, while the Justice Department is set to scrutinize Google and Apple Inc., Bloomberg has reported. Separately, the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee kicked off a broad antitrust investigation into the technology industry last month with a hearing on how Google and Facebook have affected the news industry.For More: House Panel Kicks Off Antitrust Probe With Focus on News MediaRILA said it agrees with sentiments echoed by Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, and more than 40 attorneys general, that prices shouldn’t be the sole measure of harm.It’s “the combination of information control and market power that should worry antitrust regulators the most,” the letter said. “That unhealthy combination exists at the level of the internet’s pipelines, at the level of product search, in webhosting, on social media platforms and elsewhere.”The group also pointed to Amazon’s perceived dominance of e-commerce, where it has nearly 50% of U.S. online sales. Since it’s both a retailer and a marketplace for third-party sellers, Amazon has drawn scrutiny over whether it uses its clout and huge amount of sales data to give itself a leg up over smaller vendors -- an issue the EU is already investigating and which prompted calls by 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren to break up the online retailer and other tech platforms.Amazon claims it actually only holds a small percentage of the total retail market in the U.S. and faces formidable competition from the likes of Walmart.“RILA does not file this comment to complain about competition from Facebook, Google, Amazon, Visa, or any other technology or payments platform,” the group said. “Indeed, retail leaders comment to ask for more competition, not less. But all competition must be on a fair and level playing field.”&#92;--With assistance from Ben Brody and David McLaughlin.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Justin BlumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Retailers Eager to Lodge Antitrust Complaints Against Amazon and Google

2019-07-01,"There's no question that whatever was plaguing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and FB stock in the second half of 2018 has left the building. Facebook is on fire in 2019, up 47% year to date, getting closer to its all-time high of $218.62. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI don't think there's any doubt that Facebook is a great stock to own. Investors who bought FB stock during the company's initial public offering back in May 2012, when it went public at $38 a share, today would have an annualized total return of about 26%.   * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer If Facebook were to keep this up for another 13 years, anyone who was still holding FB stock 20 years after its IPO would have almost $1 million from an initial  investment of $10,000. While FB might be a great stock, I doubt many Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)  investors, who look for sustainable, ethical stocks,  are clamoring to own it. Here's why.  Workplace Tension Continues to BoilOn several occasions in the past, I have been supportive of Facebook stock. Most recently, on May 21, I called it a buy despite the fact that Facebook's management was being less than transparent with FB's employees. But a CNBC article about former Facebook recruiters suggested that top college graduates have been more frequently refusing to work for the company. Not only that, but potential recruits were asking tough questions of the company, many of which were ESG-related. Young people are starting to recognize that the social media platform enjoyed by billions isn't the employment Shangrila that everyone thought it was.      Life at Facebook is pretty good for Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. They're billionaires who are getting a chance to shape the world we live in.  Poor Treatment of Contracted EmployeesLife isn't  as good for many of the contracted employees FB uses to keep a lid on extremist views, advertising scams, and any other materials that might be offensive to its 1.5 billion daily users. A recent report from the Washington Post suggested that FB contractors working in Austin, TX posted an internal letter complaining about their treatment. &quot;Low pay, increased monitoring from managers, and strictly enforced production quotas have played a significant role in diminished morale in our workplace,&quot; the letter said, according to the Post. &quot;People have been pushed to a point where they feel that their personhood, as well as their work, has been devalued because they are viewed as interchangeable parts in a machine.&quot; While the authenticity of this letter hasn't been determined, it begs the question of why people who are dealing with some ugly materials aren't receiving more support from FB. Given what's happened to shake people's trust of the platform, Zuckerberg and company should bend over backward to make these employees comfortable in their jobs. Not fire someone for putting Bruce Springsteen and Clash words on their internal corporate profile. In fairness to Facebook, COO Sheryl Sandberg did say on Workplace, the company's internal forum, that these contracted employees would soon receive $20 an hour in the Bay Area, while in the rest of the country in places like Austin, they would get a raise to $18 an hour. $18 an hour to be exposed to PTSD-causing materials? I don't think that's fair.  ESG Investors Shouldn't Buy FB Stock In mid-June, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that it was removing Facebook from its S&P 500 ESG Index. Facebook's ESG score fell due to privacy concerns, knocking it out of the index along with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). &quot;The specific issues resulting in these scores had to do with various privacy concerns, including a lack of transparency as to why Facebook collects and shares certain user information,&quot; Reid Steadman, S&P's global head of ESG, wrote in a release. While the company's environmental score was an impressive 82 out of 100, its social and governance ratings both failed miserably, at 22 out of 100 and six out of 100, respectively.Given the latest news stories about the way FB is treating its contracted employees, I don't see how any investors concerned about ESG can own Facebook stock. The Bottom Line on FB StockFor investors who can turn a blind eye to what Facebook is doing to some of its employees, not to mention its inability to take privacy concerns as seriously as they should be taken, I don't think there's any question that FB is a great stock.But as a company, it's got a lot of work to do if it wants to get back on the S&P 500 ESG Index. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Two key Republican lawmakers are trying to pressure the Trump administration to intervene in the Pentagon’s plan to award $10 billion in cloud-computing services, citing concerns about the handling of the bid, which rivals say favors Amazon.com Inc.Representative Steve Womack of Arkansas, who serves on a panel that funds the department, wrote to President Donald Trump seeking his “personal attention” for the award, saying that the president should approach the contract the same way he pushed for a lower price for new Air Force One planes being built by Boeing Co.Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who chairs the chamber’s Homeland Security Committee, asked in a June 24 letter to Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper that the award -- expected to come as soon as next month -- be delayed until an inspector general investigation of the process is complete.The single-award contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, has become a corporate battleground as cloud providers use lobbying and lawsuits to try to gain the edge in the procurement, which industry-watchers believe is all-but-certain to go to Amazon’s cloud division, Amazon Web Services.Trump has spoken out frequently on Pentagon projects that have already been awarded -- from his demand for new paint colors for Air Force One to insisting on price cuts for F-35 jets. He has also called on the Navy to use old-fashioned steam-based catapults on its new aircraft carriers instead of a more advanced but occasionally unreliable electromagnetic system.But presidential interference in the middle of the competition for a Pentagon contract would be virtually unheard-of, and could give a losing bidder grounds for a challenge before the Government Accountability Office or in the courts.Read More: Trump Shows Off His Red-White-and-Blue Air Force One Paint Idea“The JEDI program has the potential to waste hundreds of millions of dollars on technology that may not be the latest and most secure,” Womack wrote in his letter, which is dated June 12. He also criticized the bid for “limiting competition” through the criteria for the award.In March, lawmakers responsible for defense funding ordered the Pentagon to justify making the contract a single award. Womack, a longtime skeptic of the contract, said Defense Department reports on the issue had been “completely unsatisfactory.”Johnson noted news reports on potential conflicts of interest raised in a lawsuit by Oracle Corp., which sued in federal court to stop the award. The Pentagon launchedan internal review and an investigation by the department’s inspector general.The Pentagon determined in its internal review there was no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process and allowed the bid to go forward even while the inspector general investigation is continuing. Officials said last month they expect to award the contract in late August.The Pentagon is preparing for the rollout of the program even though the requirements are still being challenged in court by Oracle.For more: DOD Tech Chief Prepares for ‘JEDI’ Cloud Amid Court BattleOracle filed an amended complaint in May alleging that at least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon while working on the procurement. Amazon’s cloud unit, AWS, has previously referred to the complaint as “wildly misleading.”“If the investigation confirms the allegations of impropriety after the contract has already been awarded, it could significantly erode public trust in the fairness of the government procurement process and, if appropriate, may be very difficult to unwind a project that is already underway,” Johnson wrote in his letter.Womack’s and Johnson’s offices confirmed the authenticity of the letters.

2019-07-11,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), once called Big Blue, has closed on its $34 billion purchase of Red Hat, but the crowds aren't cheering.Source: Shutterstock Since the deal was announced in October IBM shares have risen 17%, opening for trade July 11 at about $141, a market cap of $125 billion.But the average stock in the S&P 500 average is up nearly 13% in that time, and the gain doesn't come close to equaling the purchase price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors are skeptical that this deal will vault IBM into the higher reaches of the technology universe. A year ago, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) lost $124 billion in market cap in a single day.  Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), long considered a cloud also-ran, is worth $200 billion.In today's technology universe, in other words, IBM is a welterweight. No Magic Bullet for IBM StockIt's clear that the Red Hat deal is no magic bullet for all that ails IBM.Red Hat was a fast-growing software company whose Linux operating system, JBoss middleware and, most especially, OpenShift container system were becoming key ingredients for companies transforming their computing systems into clouds. IBM was a lumbering, no-growth maker of mainframes, an outsourcer of software development.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Together they're supposed to be the place to go for &quot;hybrid cloud,&quot;  a world where corporate data centers run the same technologies as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, where companies move data freely among their own clouds and the public clouds.The problem is that most companies have already set their hybrid cloud strategies, that Red Hat's enabling technology is a small part of the whole, and that IBM itself is still a bureaucratic labyrinth where good ideas go to die.The hope was that Red Hat would combine its speed with IBM's heft. The fear is that Red Hatters, as they're called, will take the $190/share they're getting and run away. Hobble the CompetitionIf IBM can't catch up with the Cloud Czars, the company figures, it can at least hobble them.The company's first post-Red Hat white paper is a proposal to regulate what IBM lawyers call &quot;media companies,&quot; amending the Communications Decency Act to make Facebook, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and any other free web services responsible for what people post to them. IBM itself was under anti-trust consent decrees for decades. Its lawyers know how government can stop innovation in its tracks.The idea, in the words of IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, is to distinguish between &quot;business data&quot; and &quot;consumer data,&quot; regulating the latter and letting the former mostly slide.  IBM is entirely a business data company.Politicians on both the left and right are gleefully jumping on the proposal. Even Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates approves of action. Something is likely to happen, something big and destructive to the value of the internet companies that long ago passed IBM by.But will that help IBM? Not likely. The Bottom Line for International Business MachinesIBM has spent this year clearing the decks for Red Hat, selling off some software lines and even spinning off part of the Watson AI program (its former savior) to Centerbridge Partners, a private equity firm.The new company is supposed to go toe-to-toe with Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM), Oracle and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But the spinoff illustrates why investors are right to be skeptical of IBM itself going forward.IBM is a dividend stock, currently paying $1.62 per quarter, yielding 4.6%. GAAP earnings for the last year were $9.51 per share. Keeping the earnings above the dividend, protecting the payout, is all people care about when they buy IBM stock today.Watch to see if that changes.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-12,"A federal court dealt a blow to Oracle’s efforts to win a massive winner-take-all Department of Defense cloud contract, raising questions whether the enterprise software behemoth will face a ripple effect with its federal contracts.",How much will Oracle missing out on a $10 billion federal cloud contract hurt its business?
2019-07-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. lost its legal challenge to the Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contract on Friday, clearing the way for the government to award the contract to Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp.Federal Claims Court Senior Judge Eric Bruggink dismissed the company’s argument that the contract violates federal procurement laws and is unfairly tainted by conflicts of interests. Bruggink said that because Oracle didn’t meet the criteria for the bid, it “cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of other possible errors in the procurement process.”The decision is a major blow to Oracle, which risks losing a share of its federal defense business if the Pentagon awards the contract to another cloud company. The ruling eliminates a headache for the Pentagon, which has been fending off challenges to its winner-take-all strategy in the cloud contract for more than a year.“Oracle will likely be most threatened by this” decision, said Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst James Bach. “They stand to lose the most ground in the Defense market if the DOD decides JEDI is the end-all be-all.”Oracle looks forward to “working with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and other public sector agencies to deploy modern, secure hyperscale cloud solutions that meet their needs,” company spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said in a statement. She didn’t comment on whether the company plans to appeal the decision.Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the ruling “reaffirms the DOD’s position: the JEDI Cloud procurement process has been conducted as a fair, full and open competition, which the contracting officer and her team executed in compliance with the law.”Amazon Web Services, which was also a defendant in the case, said in a statement that the company “stands ready to support and serve what’s most important – the DoD’s mission of protecting the security of our country.”JEDI ProjectThe project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud -- or JEDI, an acronym intended to evoke “Star Wars” imagery -- is intended to be the Defense Department’s general-purpose cloud for most of its systems and applications.The Pentagon is investing in commercial cloud services, in which computing power and storage are hosted in remote data centers, to consolidate its existing technology products, embrace artificial intelligence and machine learning, and enhance its technical capabilities on the battlefield.Vying for the contract became contentious as legacy tech companies such as Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. waged a fierce lobbying and legal campaign against the Pentagon’s decision to choose just one provider. Although they are long-time government contractors, those companies were late entrants to the cloud computing market and eyed market leader Amazon as a threat to their traditional revenue streams from the Defense Department.In April, the Pentagon eliminated Oracle and IBM from the competition, leaving Amazon and Microsoft as the final contenders. Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, has said the Defense Department expects to make an award in August.Amazon Web Services was widely seen as the front-runner for the contest because it had already won a $600 million contract from the Central Intelligence Agency that helped it obtain much-needed security approvals. Microsoft is catching up to Amazon through its advancements in winning such clearances, as well as a recent cloud deal with the intelligence community and years of experience working with the Defense Department.Partial VindicationThe ruling is a partial vindication for Pentagon officials who have battled months of allegations that its procurement process was corrupt, including the circulation of a 33-page anti-Amazon dossier around Washington that suggested improper personal relationships had given Amazon an edge. The Defense Department has also faced pressure from lawmakers, who criticized the deal for lacking enough competition from industry.There are still potential hurdles for the Defense Department as it moves forward with the bid. Either Microsoft or Amazon could lodge a challenge of the contract with Government Accountability Office or in the Federal Claims Court if they were to lose. Oracle could also appeal the ruling in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.On Friday, Chris Lynch, the former director of the Defense Digital Service, which designed the project, praised his former team for their work on the project.“JEDI will immediately deliver much needed capabilities to the warfighter, deliver incredible capabilities that are built from the best tech, and it will change lives,” he tweeted. “Couldn’t be more proud.”Contested TermsOracle’s lawsuit, which was filed in December, alleged that the Pentagon’s minimum requirements for the contract as well as its decision to pick just one winner violated federal procurement laws designed to ensure competition. The government has said choosing one winner would reduce security risks and better enable it to consolidate its technology products.The suit also claimed that the procurement has been marred by conflicts of interest, including ties between former Defense Department officials and Amazon. At least two of the former employees were offered jobs at the company while working on the contract, according to the lawsuit.The Pentagon determined in its internal review that the relationships had no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process but said the department’s inspector general was looking into potential unethical conduct. Bruggink said in his ruling that the Defense Department’s determination on the allegations was not “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”(Updates with Pentagon comment in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Nico Grant.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Loses Challenge to $10 Billion Pentagon Cloud Contract

2019-07-17,"U.S. government contracts are big business for the companies that get them. In 2019, cloud giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are battling over a potentially $10 billion contract. The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project could be the crown jewel of cloud contracts. The deal itself is worth $10 billion, which may not directly move the needle for Microsoft and Amazon stock. Both have market caps around $1 trillion. But a partnership with the U.S. government could be worth much more for the JEDI winner and its shareholders in the long term.Source: Shutterstock Narrowing The FieldIn addition to Microsoft and Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) were also initially in the running for JEDI. Bids were submitted in late 2018, but contenders have been dropping like flies. At one point, Amazon was so close to landing JEDI that AMZN stock investors could almost taste it. Unfortunately, Oracle stepped in and protested a potential Amazon conflict of interest in the process. The alleged conflict centers on Amazon employee Deap Ubhi, who previously worked at the Department of Defense.This month, Oracle was officially removed from the running after a court ruled that the company could not meet a set of gate criteria as of the time its bid was submitted. Google has also dropped out of the running after employees protested the bid. The company determined that JEDI would conflict with its corporate values.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips * 4 Retail Stocks to Buy in Time for the Back-to-School Rush That leaves only early front-runner Amazon and underdog Microsoft left in the running. Microsoft Coming on StrongWedbush analyst Daniel Ives says Amazon remains the favorite, which is great news for Amazon stock. However, Ives says Washington contacts indicate Microsoft has closed the gap on Amazon in the past six months. In fact, Ives says Microsoft now has a realistic shot at landing JEDI.&quot;Based on our discussions and analysis from the Beltway it now appears this battle for JEDI is more of a ~50%/50% AWS vs. MSFT chances to win at this point rather than the runaway (~80%/20%) that it appeared to be with AWS getting ready to pop the champagne roughly a year ago,&quot; Ives says.But before Amazon stock investors dismiss a $10 billion contract, consider the longer-term. Ives estimates the true value of JEDI is around $100 billion. He says the JEDI winner can anticipate a number of additional government contracts and renewals for years to come.JEDI likely played a key role in Amazon setting up a new headquarters in Crystal City, VA, just outside of D.C. That decision is an indication of just how important JEDI may be to Amazon stock. Trump and Amazon StockAt first glance, Amazon may still seem to have the advantage in the JEDI dog race. However, Amazon stock investors have been dealing with a major headache in Washington since November 2016.U.S. President Donald Trump has made crystal clear throughout the years that he disdains Amazon and its billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos. Trump has repeatedly ripped Amazon for not paying its fair share of taxes and not paying fair rates to the U.S. Postal Service. Trump said last year that he is investigating potential antitrust violations by Amazon. He has repeatedly called the Bezos-owned Washington Post &quot;fake news.&quot; Trump has even referred to Bezos himself as &quot;Jeff Bozo.&quot;Last year, sources told Axios that Trump is &quot;obsessed with Amazon.&quot; It's clearly not a positive obsession.So what does that mean for JEDI? In principle, Trump's beef with Bezos should have nothing to do with the Department of Defense or a government cloud computing contract. In reality, Americans have repeatedly seen Trump apply pressure to different departments of the government to get his way. If Trump doesn't want Amazon to land JEDI, AMZN stock investors can bet he will do everything in his power to push for Microsoft. Takeaway for AMZN and MSFTThe timing of the JEDI award is up in the air at this point. Ives says investors may get some clarity in the coming months. Amazon stock investors know AWS has been the gold standard of cloud computing since its inception. So if Microsoft lands JEDI, it could have long-lasting ramifications within the cloud industry. * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace MSFT stock and AMZN stock may or may not initially react to the JEDI award news. But investors should make no mistake about the potential long-term value of the JEDI contract.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-17,"With its 30.5 trailing P/E ratio and its $1 trillion market cap, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock price largely reflects its current two main growth engines: its cloud business and its software-as-a-service offerings. Consequently, investors should not expect MSFT stock to rally tremendously when it reports its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday.Source: Shutterstock Still, the growth of MSFT's cloud business and its SaaS offerings could modestly surpass average expectations, triggering a small increase in MSFT stock.And over the medium term,MSFT has multiple, strong potential catalysts that could push MSFT stock much higher. Microsoft's Cloud Revenue Could Beat Average EstimatesMicrosoft's revenue from its cloud business, Azure, soared 73% year-over-year in the first quarter, and the company gained share in the still rapidly expanding cloud market in calendar Q1.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMSFT has two important drivers in the cloud market.  * 4 Retail Stocks to Buy in Time for the Back-to-School Rush First, a number of foreign countries are in the early stages of adopting the cloud, giving Azure a huge new growth engine. Secondly, brick-and-mortar retailers are expanding their e-commerce businesses and taking e-commerce market share from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has the world's top cloud business. Given that situation, more and more of these retailers may decide to emulate Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and use Azure for their cloud needs.Most analysts likely underestimated the combined strength of these trends, so Microsoft's cloud revenue may surpass analysts' consensus estimates, enabling the company's overall results to come in ahead of average estimates, boosting Microsoft stock. The Valuation of Microsoft Stock Is Already ElevatedBut, as noted earlier, the valuation and market cap of MSFT stock are rather elevated. In fact, Microsoft stock has the highest market cap of any publicly traded company, narrowly beating out Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon. As a result, a great deal of cloud growth is likely already baked into MSFT stock.In fact, just last week, Cowen analyst Nick Yako initiated coverage of Microsoft stock with an Outperform rating, predicting that the combined revenue generated by Azure and the company's SaaS business, Office 365 could rise by $100 billion in five years. He added that the company's revenue and earnings could easily grow by at least 10% annually over the next five years. But despite his optimism, Yako set a $150 price target on MSFT stock, meaning that he expects Microsoft stock to climb less than 10% over the next year.That's another indication that, even if MSFT reports stronger than expected Q4 results, MSFT stock probably won't rise much. Microsoft Stock Has Other Potential Positive CatalystsDuring next year's holiday season, Microsoft will release its first completely new video-game console since 2013. According to Techradar, the new console will be &quot;the most powerful console&quot; and &quot;is meant to be four times as powerful&quot; as MSFT's current Xbox One X console. Other reports indicate that the new console will be entirely cloud-based. If it also features virtual reality and/or augmented reality and highly captivating games, it could move the needle for MSFT stock.Additionally, over the last two years, Microsoft has stepped up its investment in Teams, its&quot;collaboration software,&quot; creating a battle with Slack (NYSE:WORK), which also offers collaboration software. Some say that companies will eventually use such software instead of e-mail. If that forecast proves to be accurate, Teams could spur rapidly accelerating adoption of Office 365, creating another positive catalyst for MSFT stock.Finally, Microsoft is being considered for a a $10 billion cloud deal with the Department of Defense. The long-delayed deal is slated to be awarded late next month. After a judge recently dismissed Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) lawsuit related to the contract, there's a good chance that the deal could actually be announced next month or soon thereafter. Keep in mind that Microsoft is up against Amazon. But in light of President Trump's open disdain for AMZN, I certainly wouldn't bet against MSFT winning the contract.  * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace  The Bottom Line on MSFT StockMicrosoft's Q4 results could beat expectations, but given the high valuation of Microsoft stock, they probably won't cause the shares to climb too much. Positive catalysts, however, could boost MSFT stock over the longer term. Given these positive catalysts and the excellent performance of MSFT under its current CEO, Satya Nadella, longer-term investors should buy MSFT stock on dips.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any of the aforementioned companies.

Down more than 8% on the news, I recommended investors buy Google stock despite the miss. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeading into next week's second-quarter earnings call, I thought I'd revisit some of the seven reasons I gave for buying GOOGL stock.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Analysts aren't expecting much from Alphabet, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider buying Alphabet stock at current prices. Here's why.  Analysts Still Like Google StockAlthough analysts grew less confident about Alphabet after its first-quarter results -- eight cut the Google target price on the news -- 34 still have a buy rating, with three giving it an overweight rating and only six a hold. None have a sell rating on Google stock.The target price? $1,335.22 is the average with a high of $1,500 and a low of $1,150. At the average target price, investors are looking at 16% upside over the next 12 months. I don't know about you, but I'd take a 16% annual return every day of the week and twice on Sundays.Analysts might have lowered their target prices, but when 86% of investors have a buy or overweight rating on its stock, there must be something good about the company.      Google Cloud Continues to GrowAs I wrote back in May, Google's cloud operation is playing catch-up with both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) when it comes to the cloud. Can it catch the two market leaders? Probably not, but it's trying hard to keep up. On July 11, Alphabet announced that it hired Kirsten Kliphouse as Google Cloud's head of North American sales, a newly created position, to enable it to go after small, medium, and enterprise customers.Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian has been busy filling out the division's sales team so that it can better compete against Amazon and Microsoft. In addition to hiring Kliphouse, Kurian also announced that he brought over Eduardo Lopez as head of Latin American sales, also a newly created position. Lopez and Kurian worked together for 20 years at Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) before Kurian left in 2018 to head up Google Cloud.  In addition to making plenty of hires, Alphabet is also making a few acquisitions. In the past three months it has bought Looker, a data analytics firm, for $2.6 billion. Google also made a smaller acquisition of cloud storage company Elastifile and moved cybersecurity firm Chronicle into Google Cloud from outside Alphabet. &quot;Kirsten and Eduardo are inspirational business leaders who will ensure we continue to build strong relationships with users, including HSBC, UPS, Whirlpool and many others, &quot; Rob Enslin, president of global customer operations for Google Cloud, told CNBC in an email. &quot;Their expertise in running multi-billion dollar sales organizations and managing large teams will be invaluable as we focus on accelerating our growth.&quot;Although Google's search business generates the lion's share of the company's revenues, these latest moves should help it grow other parts of its business, especially the cloud.  GOOG Stock's Massive Free Cash FlowIn the trailing 12 months, Alphabet generated $25.5 billion in free cash flow. Given its current enterprise value is $690.1 billion, Alphabet stock currently has a free cash flow yield of 3.7%, which suggests that it's fairly valued at the moment. However, any time a business can generate 15 cents of free cash flow from every dollar of sales as Google does, it's not nearly as worrisome when sales growth slows to 17%, as is expected by analysts in the second quarter. Since 2016, Alphabet's free cash flow has been above $20 billion, which allows it to make more significant investments in all of its various businesses. Capital allocation continues to be a big reason why Google stock will continue to move higher. With Ruth Porat as CFO, you can be sure that the money will continue to be spent wisely. Financially, Alphabet has never been stronger. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-18,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’s looking “very seriously” at a cloud-computing contract valued at as much as $10 billion that the Pentagon is likely to award to Amazon.com Inc. next month.“I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,” he told reporters Thursday during a meeting with Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the White House.The contract wasn’t competitively bid, Trump said. The Pentagon is holding a competition for the contract, but Trump said that companies are complaining that the terms favor Amazon, the dominant player in cloud computing services. Microsoft Corp. is the only other company that hasn’t been eliminated from consideration.Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Trump recently raised concerns about the contract with aides after learning of correspondence Republican lawmakers have exchanged with the Pentagon and the White House criticizing the bidding process.Some Republicans have alleged that the contract’s terms were crafted from the start to favor Amazon, and that there were conflicts of interest involving the company as the Pentagon considered bids.“I will be asking them to look at it very closely to see what’s going on,” Trump said in apparent reference to the Defense Department, “because I have had very few things where there’s been such complaining. Not only complaining from the media -- or at least asking questions about it from the media -- but complaining from different companies like Microsoft and Oracle and IBM. Great companies are complaining about it.”Some supporters of the Pentagon process pushed back on Trump’s comments. Four House Republicans on the Armed Service Committee, including ranking member Mac Thornberry, wrote a letter to Trump on Thursday saying “it is essential for national security” to move forward with the contract “as quickly as possible.”“Further delays will only damage our security and increase the costs of the contract,” they wrote.Trump and BezosWhile Trump didn’t mention Amazon founder Jeff Bezos by name on Thursday, he has long denounced the billionaire in tweets criticizing him on many fronts -- from the shipping rates his company pays the U.S. Postal Service to his personal ownership of what Trump calls “the Amazon Washington Post.”Oracle Corp. has fought the contract process and has led a fierce lobbying campaign against the Pentagon’s plans to award the project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or JEDI, to a single bidder. But the company lost a legal challenge last week contesting the terms of the bid and alleging the Pentagon had crafted unfair requirements and that there were conflicts of interest involving Amazon.In April 2018, Oracle’s Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz dined with Trump at the White House and complained that the contract terms seemed designed for Amazon to win, Bloomberg has reported. The final requirements for the contract were released in July of that year.International Business Machines Corp. said in a statement after Trump’s comments that it “has long raised serious concerns about the structure of the JEDI procurement. We continue to believe that the Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform would be best served by a multi-cloud strategy” rather than the Pentagon’s plan for a winner-take-all award.Oracle and Microsoft had no comment on Trump’s remarks.“We are aware of the remarks and have nothing to add at this time,” Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said in an email.Intervention’s RarePresidents and their advisers often set out their visions for defense spending and technology priorities, and Trump has spoken out on matters from the cost of F-35 fighter jets to paint colors for new Air Force One planes.But it’s rare for a commander-in-chief to intervene in specific Defense Department contract competitions because they are governed by extensive laws and regulations intended to wall off billion-dollar awards from political influence, according to experts on the contracting process.“The system is explicitly set up to prevent political officials from being able to influence the outcome of a contract,” said Stan Soloway, chief executive officer of Celero Strategies LLC. The president “can’t pick winners and losers.”Federal agencies have to clearly outline the requirements and criteria they will use to choose a winning bid. Losing bidders can challenge a decision to the Government Accountability Office or in the Court of Federal Claims, contending that the ground rules set in a solicitation weren’t followed. Oracle already has lost a court case challenging the handling of the JEDI contract.But a president has more freedom to exert influence over a project’s structure and acquisition strategy, which could effectively help some companies and hurt others, said Trey Hodgkins, the chief executive officer and founder of Hodgkins Consulting.“He can shine a spotlight on the process and ask the question: Is this the best option for the warfighter? Is this the best deal for the taxpayer?” Hodgkins said. “I don’t know that it would be politically prudent to ignore executive-level scrutiny of the decision making process.”(Updates with lawmakers’ letter starting in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.net;Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, ;Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Justin Blum, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Says He’s Looking ‘Very Seriously’ at Pentagon Cloud Deal

2019-07-18,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump recently demanded more information about how the Pentagon crafted a massive cloud-computing contract it’s poised to award to Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp., in order to decide whether he should intervene.The Defense Department is set to give the contract, worth as much as $10 billion over ten years, to one of the two companies next month. Amazon, whose cloud-computing technology leads the market, is seen as the favorite.But Trump recently was made aware of letters Republican members of Congress have written to the White House and military leaders complaining that the contract’s terms froze some companies -- including Oracle Corp. -- out of the competition, according to two people familiar with the matter. Trump expressed frustration he wasn’t aware of the concerns and asked aides to show him the correspondence, the people said.Trump said he’s interested in looking into the circumstances of the bid but didn’t indicate he’ll try to block the contract from being awarded to one of the two finalists, they said.Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who recently wrote to the Pentagon to express concerns about the contract, said in an interview that he discussed it with the president aboard Air Force One last week.“He wanted to understand what the issues were, what our concerns were,” Johnson said in an interview.Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, sent a letter to National Security Adviser John Bolton on Thursday asking him to delay the contract award, saying the bid “suffers from a lack of competition.” Trump and Rubio spoke about the contract by phone the next day, a Rubio spokesman said.A person familiar with the call said that it sounded as if Trump was thinking about canceling the contract.All of the people asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive procurement issue. Spokesmen for the White House and Pentagon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.While Trump has leaned on defense contractors to reduce costs on contracts they already hold -- and even to paint new Air Force One planes in his choice of colors -- it may be unprecedented for a president to intervene in a defense contract competition while it’s underway.The cloud-computing program, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or JEDI, has been contentious. Legacy tech companies including Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. waged a fierce lobbying and legal campaign against the Pentagon’s plan to award the contract to a single company.“Nothing good can come from President Trump becoming personally involved in an individual procurement, particularly one of this complexity,” said Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University. “Historically, the system has operated best with limited -- to no -- high-level political involvement.”Oracle lost a legal challenge last week contesting the terms of the bid and alleging the Pentagon had crafted unfair requirements and that there were conflicts of interest involving Amazon. Republican lawmakers have taken up Oracle’s cause, pressuring the White House to intervene in the Pentagon project.Oracle at one point coordinated with at least seven other companies including Microsoft and SAP America to try to block Amazon from winning the entire contract, Bloomberg News has reported. Amazon has already won a contract with the Central Intelligence Agency.Oracle declined to comment for the story.For More: Inside the Nasty Battle to Stymie Amazon’s Pentagon Cloud BidIn April 2018, Oracle Corp.

2019-07-18,"(Bloomberg) -- SAP SE fell the most in nearly five years on signs that its $10 billion bet on cloud-based software faces headwinds, but the companies executives are adamant there is still room to grow.After buying U.S. startups Qualtrics International Inc. and Callidus Software Inc. to bolster its portfolio, SAP instead posted slower growth in new cloud bookings -- a keenly watched metric because it indicates future revenue. With profitability diluted by the shift to internet-based computing, a push to shore up margins failed to make progress in the second quarter.SAP fell as much as 10%, its steepest intraday drop since August 2015. The stock was down 5.9% at 3:40 p.m. in Frankfurt trading.&quot;What you’re not counting on is how much revenue will come SAP’s way by relying on” cloud partnerships with the likes of Amazon and Google, SAP’s Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott told analysts during a call. “There’s no reason to think this is slowing down.&quot;SAP’s new cloud bookings rose 15% at constant currencies, a drop from the 26% gain in the first three months of 2019 and the weakest figure in at least a year and a half.The lower order figure is due to the fact that SAP is focusing on higher-margin sales, and that more customers chose “pay as you go” products that aren’t counted toward that metric, Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said. Excluding infrastructure-as-a-service, growth would be 27%, he said.The figures underscore the difficult transition to internet-based software as McDermott challenges rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp.Cloud sales can initially be less profitable than traditional on-premise installations, and SAP has pledged to increase its operating margin by 1 percentage point a year on average through 2023. In the second quarter, the figure was flat at 27.3%, with Walldorf, Germany-based SAP blaming trade tensions for delaying software spending in Asia as well as acquisition costs.“We’re exactly on track in what we need to hit our mid-term objectives to triple our cloud revenue by 2023,” Mucic said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “Also the profitability in the cloud is steeply increasing.”Total sales rose 11% to about 6.7 billion euros ($7.5 billion), boosted by strong growth from existing cloud customers, with revenue for the segment jumping 40%. Operating profit increased 11% to 1.82 billion euros.Uptake of SAP’s flagship S/4 Hana software accelerated in the April-June period, with the company adding about 600 customers for a total of more than 11,500 users. The software allows businesses to run tasks on their own machines or in a cloud-computing arrangement hosted by SAP or one of its partners. The company is farming out more of the low-margin computing backend to partners including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.SAP stuck to its outlook for operating profit to rise at least 9.5% and cloud revenue to increase more than 33%. McDermott maintained his optimism that his strategy would pay off.The Qualtrics acquisition will prove to be a “growth catalyst,” the CEO said in a telephone interview. “There’s plenty of room to continue strong cloud bookings and cloud growth.”(Update with details from analyst call.)To contact the reporter on this story: Stefan Nicola in Berlin at snicola2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Chris Reiter, Iain RogersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",SAP Executives Come Out Fighting as Shares Slump on Growth

2019-07-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Azim Premji has helped create India’s latest tech unicorn: a fast-rising software startup that symbolizes the growing investor interest in the Asian nation’s enterprise technology space.Icertis, which competes with SAP SE and Oracle Corp. to help businesses manage contracts in the cloud, has raised $115 million, propelling it to unicorn status as investors flock to enterprise software makers.The advanced-stage funding round in Bellevue, Washington and Pune, India-based Icertis was co-led by Greycroft Partners LLC and PremjiInvest, the fund managed by the family office of Indian tech billionaire Premji. Existing investors including B Capital Group, Eight Roads Ventures and Cross Creek Advisors participated. With this, Icertis has raised over $211 million.The enterprise software segment is heating up as investors from Tiger Global Management to Sequoia and Accel scour the industry for India’s next startup giants. Many are expected to be business- rather than consumer-focused, as the country’s talent pool shifts from IT outsourcing services for global clients toward designing and providing online software.Icertis said it now helps customers worldwide manage over 5.7 million contracts, from supply chain and procurement deals to employee agreements and nondisclosure pacts, that have a total value of more than $1 trillion.“As contracts get converted from static documents to digital assets for the first time in history, every dollar in or out is governed by a contract, putting them at the heart of every enterprise,” said Samir Bodas, Icertis’s co-founder and chief executive officer. “Every global company faces unprecedented global competition and needs software to manage contracts.”Icertis is currently valued at “well north of one billion dollars,” Bodas added. The company will use the additional funding to grow its business, including by expanding sales and marketing. Global compliance demands involving Brexit, tariffs, European data privacy regulations as well as rapid digitization has worked in Icertis’s favor, while technologies like artificial intelligence helped enhance the sophistication of its services.“We have been able to ride the technology wave and assert leadership in the space despite large competitors,” Bodas said, citing consultancies Forrester Research and Gartner.Icertis works on a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of contracts drawn up and tracked using its software. MGI Research forecasts the total spending by companies for such contract management at over $20 billion from 2018 to 2022, with services on the cloud growing around 37% annually over the same period.Founded in 2009 when Bodas and friend Monish Darda began exploring cloud-based applications, Icertis in 2015 homed in on building a contract management platform. Today, more than 600 of its 850 employees are based in Pune, where the product is developed. The startup operates a dozen offices from Sofia to Sydney.(Corrects wording to reflect right definition in fourth-to-last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Saritha Rai in Bangalore at srai33@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Billionaire Premji Helps Create India’s Newest Tech Unicorn

2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. set records for lobbying in the second quarter as Washington ramped up scrutiny of big technology companies, while Google’s spending dipped as it continued to reshuffle its influence operations.The world’s largest social media site spent more than $4.1 million on lobbying, the most among big internet platforms, an increase from its previous high in the same period a year earlier.Facebook disclosed lobbying around blockchain, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies. The company has been trying to win support for its Libra cryptocurrency, which drew skepticism from President Donald Trump, congressional Democrats and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and took a beating from lawmakers in both houses of Congress during two days of hearings last week.The company was also in the final stages of settling an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into privacy violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The FTC has voted to fine the company $5 billion and is expected to announce the final details of the settlement within days.For more: Facebook $5 Billion U.S. Privacy Settlement Approved by FTCAmazon spent more than $4 million on lobbying, topping a quarterly record in the first three months of the year, according to disclosures filed with Congress before Monday’s midnight deadline. Amazon, which runs a broad lobbying operation on a diverse range of issues, is closing in on a $10 billion cloud services contract that the Pentagon is poised to award to a single bidder next month.Last week, Trump criticized Amazon as the perceived front-runner for the contract, saying companies such as Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp. had complained that the process was unfair. Oracle has led a sustained lobbying campaign against the department’s plans to award the project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, to a single bidder.In June, Amazon hired Jeff Miller, who bundled $1 million for Trump’s 2016 campaign, to lobby for its cloud computing division on issues related to “cyber security and technology services,” the filings show.On July 18, Trump said he would look “very seriously” at the bid.Oracle spent almost $1.7 million during the quarter, when it said it lobbied on issues including cloud and government IT procurement. It also lobbied the White House and the office of Vice President Mike Pence, the disclosures show. Microsoft Corp., which is the last remaining cloud provider that’s vying with Amazon for the contract, spent $2.7 million in the quarter, while International Business Machines Corp., which was eliminated as a competitor along with Oracle in April, spent $1.6 million, including lobbying on JEDI, the filings show.Antitrust ScrutinyThe big internet companies are coming under growing antitrust pressure as the U.S. moves toward investigating whether their conduct squelches competition. The Justice Department and the FTC, which share antitrust jurisdiction, have carved up responsibility for oversight, with the FTC taking responsibility for Facebook and Amazon and the department’s antitrust division claiming Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc.Facebook and Amazon also underwent a series of hearings by a House committee conducting a broad antitrust investigation of technology companies, drawing ire from lawmakers during the latest hearing earlier this month.Google ended its relationships with at least 17 lobbyists at six outside lobbying firms as global policy chief, Karan Bhatia, reorganizes the search engine’s approach. Google’s second-quarter spending dipped to $3.1 million, a decrease of about half what it spent in the same period a year earlier, the filings showed.Among the top-level exits were Robert Raben of the Raben Group, who served as assistant attorney general of the Justice Department under former President Bill Clinton. It also ended its relationship with Tom Ingram, a former staff director of the Senate Republican Conference. Susan Molinari, the company’s longtime Washington director and a former Republican member of Congress, moved to an advisory position at the end of 2018.Apple, which is grappling with stepped-up antitrust scrutiny as well as concerns about trade, disclosed spending of $1.8 million in the second quarter, up slightly from $1.7 million a year earlier.Trade LobbyingTrump’s threats to impose additional tariffs on imports from China and Mexico during the quarter, as well as a push to ratify a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, contributed to an increase in trade lobbying by some associations.The Consumer Technology Association, whose members include Apple, Amazon and Facebook, reported spending almost $1.8 million during the second quarter -- up from almost $1.5 million a year earlier and from $1.4 million in the first quarter -- in part because of the tariff threats, spokeswoman Bronwyn Flores said.The group reported lobbying Congress, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Commerce Department and the White House on matters including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the China tariffs and duties Trump imposed last year on imports of steel and aluminum.“Over the past year, anti-tariff lobbying has become an increasing focus for our government affairs practice,” Michael Petricone, the group’s senior vice president for government and regulatory affairs, said in a statement. “In addition, this quarter CTA’s marketing and communications team executed a comprehensive media campaign to complement our efforts.”The National Retail Federation, which is helping lead a coalition of trade groups opposed to Trump’s tariffs, showed almost almost $2 million in lobbying spending in the second quarter, up from $1.5 million in the first three months. Trade represented a significant portion of the increase besides health care, taxes and other issues, the group said.Trump threatened tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports in May in response to what he said was Beijing reneging on agreed provisions in a sweeping trade deal the two nations are negotiating. The U.S. has already slapped duties on $250 billion in Chinese goods.Trump put the new tariffs on hold after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June in Japan -- but not until after executives at hundreds of U.S. companies and trade groups testified at public hearings in Washington, most opposing the duties.The president also threatened duties on imports from Mexico if that country didn’t do more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S., prompting an outcry from businesses and trade groups. Trump ultimately relented.Proponents of ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace Nafta had hoped to have Congress approve the deal by its August recess, but discussions continue between the administration and congressional Democrats on concerns about provisions regarding pharmaceuticals, the environment, labor and overall enforcement of the pact.&#92;--With assistance from Bill Allison.To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.net;Mark Niquette in Columbus at mniquette@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Facebook, Amazon Set Lobbying Records as Tech Scrutiny Grows"

2019-07-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce.com Inc. unveiled a partnership with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to enter the Chinese software market, chasing new business in Asia despite the U.S.-China trade war.Alibaba will sell Salesforce cloud-based software for clients’ sales, customer service and commerce needs in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, the companies said Wednesday in a statement.San Francisco-based Salesforce, the top seller of software for managing customer relationships, wants to more than double its annual revenue to as much as $28 billion by fiscal 2023, but has recently seen slowing growth. Under co-Chief Executive Officers Marc Benioff and Keith Block, the company has expanded internationally, announcing investments and hiring throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Salesforce is entering China at a time when the U.S. government has made it harder for some American technology companies to sell products to Chinese customers, amid a flurry of tariffs on China-made goods.Salesforce previously had a limited presence in China. Multinational customers were asking for support wherever they do business, according to the statement. Rival Oracle Corp. has reportedly been shedding workers in China, and the company’s co-founder, Larry Ellison, said in October it’s important for the U.S. tech industry and military to beat China.Some investors have been concerned that Salesforce’s revenue growth rates are slipping, though the company continues to report quarterly sales increases of at least 20%. Salesforce has made splashy acquisitions in the past two years that will significantly contribute to revenue, including a $15.3 billion plan to buy data-analytics company Tableau Software Inc., which the company announced last month.Alibaba’s $3 billion cloud services arm is fast becoming an important driver of its global expansion. The e-commerce giant widened its lead over Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in Asia’s cloud-computing market in 2018, according to Gartner, which in turn helped it narrow its global gap with those two rivals.In China, Alibaba’s cloud business commands more than half the market, which is estimated to grow 55% to $331.2 billion in three years, according to Gartner. Alibaba’s cloud business has been generating triple-digit revenue growth over the past three years, outpacing the industry.Gartner estimates that Alibaba last year accounted for almost 20% of the market in Asia for two forms of infrastructure cloud services.

EQT declined to comment.IFS, which employs about 3,700 staff, says its products are cheaper and easier to implement and use than those of its bigger rivals, which tend to lock customers into long maintenance contracts. IFS says it offers clients the flexibility of up- or downgrading its standard software on the go, and gives them a choice whether they want to move to the cloud or not.More than half the company’s license revenue in the second quarter came from new customers, causing IFS to raise its sales guidance for the year to $711 million.EQT bought IFS in 2015, when it was listed on Sweden’s stock exchange.

2019-07-24,"For years, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was seen as a Goliath of the tech industry; a big dinosaur that was far too  old and slow to make any kind of noteworthy innovations. For a long time, the MSFT stock price languished at around the $40 to $60 a share range, depending on the S&P 500 as well as general investor sentiment about the tech sector. But the appointment of Satya Nadella in 2014 as the new CEO to replace Steve Ballmer seemed to have marked a turning point.Source: Shutterstock Since then, MSFT stock has nearly tripled -- hardly the slow, lumbering dino it was before. In fact, MSFT closed Tuesday at $139.29, just off an all-time high of $140.67, which now gives the company a market cap of over $1 trillion.They key driver in recent years has been a change of culture. Now at Microsoft, Cloud comes first, Mobile next -- and desktop products, their tried-and-true cash cow of years past, are simply left to pay the bills.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor Microsoft, like much of the tech sector, the future lies far removed from the desktop-related products of decades past.Last week, MSFT reported its results for fiscal-year 2019 with revenues up 14% to $125.8 billion. The company is hugely profitable racking up margins that any Fortune 500 as well as any small-cap tech firms would be proud of. Operating earnings totaled $43 billion, making for an operating margin of 34.1% of sales, up 230 basis points from 2018.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025  A Few New Hurdles for the New-Age MSFT StockTake a glance at any Microsoft news story and you'll likely notice that the company now focuses far less on one-off product purchases, such as Windows or Office. Instead, MSFT plans to generate double-digit growth from its service and cloud related business lines. These new business areas are effectively recurring revenue streams that will lead to sustainable long-term growth and less volatility in earnings.As the global market for cloud computing, Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) grows, as do economies of scale, Microsoft will likely create a solid lead in a high-growth market with significant barriers to entry.To give an idea of the immense size of the cloud computing market, MSFT is now in competition with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, to win a Department of Defense contract worth some $10 billion. Details of the complex bidding process were made public earlier this month in a court ruling. In response to a complaint filed by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), another major competitor in the global market for cloud computing services, the federal court cleared the way for MSFT to compete with AMZN for the contract.Oracle, and before that, IBM (NYSE:IBM), had complained to the court that they were unlawfully eliminated from the bidding process. A federal judge ruled against Oracle's motion to block the Pentagon's 10-year, $10 billion cloud computing contract, siding with the Defense Department and Amazon Web Services in a legal battle that lasted nearly a year. These court battles are somewhat reminiscent of the early 1990s, when Microsoft often faced complaints of unlawful anti-competitive behavior from small tech start-ups as well as the U.S. Department of Justice. The Future of Microsoft Stock Is Brighter Than You ThinkMSFT is clearly betting heavily on the future of the cloud and all the high-margin services that come with it. Just this week, the company announced a $1 billion investment in OpenAI, a small startup firm specialized solely in artificial intelligence software. So far, the announcement has driven MSFT stock higher and helped it rise out of a slight ditch set earlier this month. But the longer-term benefits for MSFT will take longer to manifest.  * 7 Stocks on Sale the Insiders Are Buying This $1 billion investment by Microsoft, and the expected enhancements to Microsoft's Azure platform to catapult developers building the next generation of AI applications, is just one example of how the new era of high growth, double-digit earnings for MSFT is only just beginning.Now, rather than look at Microsoft stock as a dinosaur, we can expect its growth to be around much longer as the need for its high-tech services continues to increase with new technological developments.As of this writing, Theodore Kim did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. shares jumped the most in four years after the internet giant reported revenue that beat Wall Street expectations, calming concern about slowing growth.Second-quarter sales, excluding payments to partners, came in at $31.7 billion, Alphabet said in a statement. Analysts were looking for $30.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The Google parent also announced a plan to repurchase $25 billion of the company’s Class C stock, the biggest buyback in the company’s history. The cloud business grew strongly, too. Alphabet shares surged 11% at 11:40 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday increase since the summer of 2015.Google’s advertising sales grew 16% overall. That was slower than many recent periods, but it was a welcome relief from the first quarter of 2019, when Google missed Wall Street revenue expectations and saw its shares plunge. The stock had lagged rivals recently on concern poor results might continue.Google is still able to find more places to put ads around the web, said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co., which owns Alphabet shares. “Many of Google’s growth opportunities remain. For example, advertising on its Maps properties,” he added.For years, Google has grown its advertising business at an annual rate of at least 20% by stuffing more ads into mobile search results, luring viewers to YouTube and automating the web’s complex advertising process. The company is investing heavily in new technology, such as cloud computing and a voice-controlled digital assistant, while experimenting with different ad formats.Thursday’s results buy Google more time to pursue these initiatives, along with longer-term projects including driverless cars.“We’re delivering strong growth,” Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet, said in a statement. “Our ongoing investments in compute capabilities and engineering talent reflect the compelling opportunities we see across the company.”Cloud-computing is Google’s fastest-growing business and second-quarter results put the operation on course to generate more than $8 billion annually, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a conference call. That’s around a quarter of the sales produced by Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud unit, but the solid growth gave investors hope that Google can keep pace with Amazon and Microsoft Corp. in this booming business.The $8 billion run rate was $1 billion higher than the estimate of RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney. The results show Google is getting more tenacious in this market. “Here come the cloud wars,” Mahaney wrote in a note to clients.Other revenue, which includes cloud business and consumer hardware, grew 40% to $6.18 billion. Late last year, Oracle Corp. executive Thomas Kurian was tapped as CEO of Google Cloud. He narrowed the unit’s focus on specific industries and bought startup Looker for $2.6 billion.Another positive sign for investors: Capital expenditures totaled $6.9 billion in the second quarter, up 30% from last year. The same quarter last year saw a year-over-year increase of almost 90%.That said, Porat indicated costs would increase through the rest of 2019. The company plans to hire more employees for the cloud business. Sales and marketing costs will also grow at the end of this year as Google promotes its products for the holiday season, she said.Net income was $9.95 billion, or $14.21 a share, in the second quarter. That compares with profit of $8.27 billion, or $11.75 a share, a year earlier, Alphabet said.(Updates with analyst comment in 10th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Mark Bergen.To contact the reporter on this story: Gerrit De Vynck in New York at gdevynck@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Alphabet Sales Top Analyst Estimates, Calming Growth Concern"

2019-07-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Following a crucial court victory in mid-July, Amazon.com Inc. seemed poised to clinch a lucrative Pentagon cloud-services contract, having beaten out several rivals and steered past the animus of a powerful foe, President Donald Trump.Just one week later, Trump stunned tech companies, the Defense Department and lawmakers when he openly questioned whether the $10 billion contract had been competitively bid. He said he had heard complaints from companies such as Microsoft Corp., the No. 2 contender, and Oracle Corp., which was eliminated from the competition earlier this year. Both have argued that the terms favored Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, is one of the president’s longtime nemeses.Amazon’s sudden fall from grace shows how quickly fortunes can change in Washington. But Trump’s unexpected criticism was the culmination of more than a year of behind-the-scenes maneuvering to unseat Amazon. The well-coordinated lobbying effort -- including a flurry of phone calls, letters and personal appeals from influential senators in the last few weeks -- shows the power of rivals who are long-term government contractors and have won favor with the White House.Trump may not step in ultimately. But the possibility of White House intervention raises the fear that more than $400 billion in government procurement, which agencies and courts for decades have sought to shield from outside influence, could be politicized.“The bidding process is expected to be conducted by the contracting officer without political interference,” said Charles Tiefer, a professor of government contracting law at the University of Baltimore, “and especially not political interference from the highest official in the White House.” Tiefer said he had no financial connections to the companies involved.At stake not only is a rich revenue stream from the Pentagon project. The deal could also open the door to other, highly profitable federal cloud contracts. The losers could see billions of dollars in existing business melt away if they fall further behind industry-leader Amazon in the cloud market.Amazon increasingly relies on its cloud business for revenue growth. On Thursday, the company reported second-quarter profit at $5.22 a share, below analysts’ average forecast of $5.56 a share. Sales increased 20% to $63.4 billion.More than a year before Trump weighed in publicly, the White House asked Pentagon officials to justify their decision to give the contract to a single company instead of spreading it across multiple vendors, according to a person familiar with the matter. That forced the project’s overseers to defend their winner-take-all approach in a document for the White House, the person said. The Pentagon has said multiple vendors would slow down the award while also making it harder to keep its data secure.It was around that time that Safra Catz, the co-head of Oracle, dined at the White House with Trump and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who advises Trump on technology matters. Even though the final bid solicitation wasn’t yet out, the possibility that Amazon alone might win the contract came up in the April 3, 2018 dinner discussion, sources familiar with the matter said. Oracle declined to comment for this story.Amazon was seen as the front-runner from the start because it had already won a $600 million cloud contract from the Central Intelligence Agency in 2013, showing it can manage sensitive government data. When the Pentagon announced its decision in July 2018 to opt for a single winner, it dealt a blow to Microsoft, IBM, Dell and Oracle, who had coordinated a lobbying campaign to stop the Seattle-based giant, Bloomberg reported. The companies wouldn’t comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment.Read More: Oracle Is Said to Lead Anti-Amazon Lobby on Pentagon Cloud BidThe project, which had been championed by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, was never supposed to be this controversial. The goal is to bring the Pentagon’s technology into the modern era. By investing in commercial cloud services, which host computing power and storage in remote data centers, the military could secure sensitive databases, embrace machine learning and artificial intelligence, and speed up real-time sharing of information among war-fighters. Its formal name, Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, is intended to evoke “Star Wars” imagery.Within a year of the Pentagon announcement, many of the officials who backed the sole-source approach, such as Mattis, former Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, and Chris Lynch, the Pentagon’s technology guru, left the government -- leaving Amazon exposed.For more: Inside the Nasty Battle to Stymie Amazon’s Pentagon Cloud BidAttacks on Amazon escalated in late spring 2019. They included a sharply critical Fox News segment on June 14 by Tucker Carlson, widely recognized as one of Trump’s favorite commentators. After seeing the segment, the White House requested a Pentagon briefing, a person familiar with the matter said. The Defense Department prepared a detailed document pushing back on the Fox program in preparation for the briefing. The White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.The Fox host questioned whether the bid had been unfairly skewed to favor Amazon. While Fox flashed pictures of Bezos on the screen, Carlson and Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, mulled whether the Pentagon was being too secretive about its dealings with the company and whether Amazon could be trusted with sensitive data. Carlson didn’t respond to a request for comment.The e-commerce giant, however, seemed to have solidified its chances when Oracle, its most determined opponent, lost a legal challenge in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims on July 12, clearing the way for the contract to go to Amazon or Microsoft, the only companies still in the running.But the court loss may have triggered a new chain of events. That day, two Republican senators put on a full-court press to get Trump to intervene.Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson, while on a well-timed flight to his home state on Air Force One with the president, said that he and others had written letters complaining that the contract terms froze out Oracle and other companies. Trump expressed frustration and asked aides to show him the correspondence, Bloomberg reported.For more: Trump Expressed Concern About Pentagon Cloud-Computing ContractThe same day, Florida’s Marco Rubio questioned the fairness of the procurement in a phone call with Trump. A person familiar with the call said it sounded as if Trump was thinking about canceling the contract.Rubio had written the day before to Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, arguing in favor of multiple cloud vendors to ensure “continuing price competition and access to the latest innovations.”Super political action committees supporting Rubio’s presidential and Senate campaigns have received $5.4 million from Oracle’s founder, Larry Ellison, since 2015, campaign filings show. Rubio also received $21,000 from Microsoft’s PAC in the same period.Microsoft’s PAC gave Johnson $19,000 between 2015 and 2019. Microsoft declined to comment.Amazon’s PAC gave the senators money, too -- $12,500 to Rubio and $10,500 to Johnson in the same period. Spokespersons for Johnson and Rubio said the senators declined to comment.Before his confirmation on Tuesday as the new Defense Department secretary, Mark Esper agreed to a request from Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, to consult the Pentagon’s inspector general before making the award. A Shaheen spokesperson said Oracle has a large presence in the state.Shaheen was referring to a pending ethics review of alleged conflicts by Pentagon personnel, which could include Amazon’s hiring back of a former employee, Deap Ubhi. He left Amazon in 2017 for a job at the Pentagon, where he worked on the cloud contract.He later recused himself because, he told Pentagon officials, he was speaking to Amazon about selling it a company he had started. Oracle’s lawsuit said that was an “elaborate lie” to camouflage that he was actually speaking to Amazon about a job. A spokesperson said the inspector general is aware of the allegations concerning the JEDI cloud broadly and is reviewing them. Amazon, where Ubhi continues to work, said he wouldn’t comment.“Independent reviews by the GAO, along with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims’ ruling, have confirmed the department followed all necessary laws and regulations,” said Elissa Smith, a Pentagon spokeswoman. Nevertheless, Esper on Wednesday said he’d heard “from everybody” about the JEDI contract and “that’s one of the things I want to take a hard look at.” Twelve Republican House members are among those who’ve asked Trump to delay awarding the contract in recent days, citing conflicts of interest.Trump has long denounced Bezos in tweets, criticizing him for the rates his company pays the U.S. Postal Service to deliver Amazon packages and his ownership of what Trump calls “the Amazon Washington Post.”The president at times openly derides Bezos, tweeting a link Monday night to another Fox News segment that referred to the cloud deal as the “Bezos bailout.” And on Wednesday, his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said Amazon “destroyed the retail industry” in the U.S.Government experts question if the president’s involvement is motivated by a personal grudge. “What other reason would he have to weigh in other than he doesn’t like Jeff Bezos?” asked Steven Kelman, professor of public management at the Harvard Kennedy School. Kelman said he has received funding for unrelated research from IBM’s research arm; IBM is no longer under consideration for the Pentagon project.Amazon has been hitting back and in June its cloud-computing unit hired lobbyist Jeff Miller, a longtime Trump supporter who has raised more than $1 million for the president’s 2020 re-election. A filing shows Miller was paid $20,000 to lobby the office of Vice President Mike Pence, possibly in an attempt to enlist him in the effort to save the JEDI program. Amazon wouldn’t comment for this story. Pence and Miller didn’t respond to requests for comment.Now the risk for Amazon is whether Trump might ask Esper to start from scratch. Under U.S. procurement laws, Trump can’t pick winners and losers without inviting a lawsuit. And even though the courts have decided that the Pentagon’s bidding process was fair, Amazon’s foes have Trump’s ear.“I have had very few things where there’s been such complaining. Not only complaining from the media -- or at least asking questions about it from the media -- but complaining from different companies like Microsoft and Oracle and IBM,” Trump said. “Great companies are complaining about it.”&#92;--With assistance from Bill Allison and Jennifer Jacobs.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Amazon’s Fast Track to Pentagon Deal Derailed by Trump, Rivals"

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- New Defense Secretary Mark Esper ordered a review of the Pentagon’s cloud-computing contract after President Donald Trump endorsed criticism that Amazon.com Inc. is being given an unfair advantage for the contract valued at as much as $10 billion.Esper, who took charge of the Pentagon last week, is looking at the contract and “no decision will be made on the program until he has completed his examination,” Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said in a statement Thursday.Trump stunned tech companies, the Defense Department and lawmakers this month when he openly questioned whether the pending contract is being competitively bid. He said he’d heard complaints from companies such as Microsoft Corp., the No. 2 contender, and Oracle Corp., which was eliminated from the competition earlier this year. Both have argued that the terms favored Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, is one of the president’s longtime nemeses.The project, which had been championed by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, was never supposed to be this controversial. The goal is to bring the Pentagon’s technology into the modern era. Despite criticism, the Defense Department maintained that the system would work best if a single company created a single data repository for use from generals at the Pentagon to warfighters in the field.“Secretary Esper is committed to ensuring our warfighters have the best capabilities, including artificial intelligence, to remain the most lethal force in the world, while safeguarding taxpayer dollars,” Smith said in the statement. “Keeping his promise to members of Congress and the American public, Secretary Esper is looking at the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program.”Even before Trump weighed in, a number of lawmakers had questioned the contract requirements. Among them was Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who said in a statement Thursday that “I look forward to working with Secretary Esper to ensure that any JEDI award provides the most capable solution to the warfighter.”Dana Deasy, the Defense Department’s chief information officer, has said the JEDI contract wouldn’t be awarded until late August at the earliest, so Esper’s review wouldn’t necessarily result in a major delay if it postponed the award into September.Oracle lost a legal challenge to the cloud contract on July 12.The company’s lawsuit claimed that the procurement requirements ruled out most companies and that the process has been marred by conflicts of interest, including ties between former Defense Department officials and Amazon.Federal Claims Court Senior Judge Eric Bruggink found that Oracle didn’t have standing to challenge the terms of the contract but that at least one of the justifications the Defense Department used to support its single-source strategy for the contract was flawed.Bruggink also said the conflicts of interest alleged in Oracle’s lawsuit “raise eyebrows” but ultimately the Pentagon was right to determine that they didn’t affect the procurement.“As DOD has asserted all along, and as confirmed by the Court, DoD reasonably evaluated and equally treated all offerors,” Smith, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said at the time. “The court’s decision unequivocally concludes that JEDI is a full and open competition and, despite uninformed speculation to the contrary, its integrity remains intact.”(Updates with Senator Rubio’s comment in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Tony Capaccio in Washington at acapaccio@bloomberg.net;Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Pentagon Chief to Review Cloud Contract Trump Says Favors Amazon

2019-08-01,"Google, the artists now known as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), practically invented the cloud but was nearly a decade late to the cloud market. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has an estimated 33% share of the cloud infrastructure market. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has half of that, 16%. And GOOGL has half of that, at 8%.Source: Shutterstock It is trying to make up for lost time. Under Thomas Kurian, formerly of Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), the company is selling &quot;hybrid cloud&quot; to enterprises, a world where its cloud seamlessly interacts with those of its rivals, and with corporate data centers. A level playing field, Alphabet hopes, will grow its market share.That's what is behind its team-up with VMware (NYSE:VMW), offering support for VMware's Cloud Formation through a start-up called CloudSimple.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut will it really do any good? Who's Number One? You're Number ThreeAccording to Synergy Research Group, which studies the cloud marketplace, Google faces a long, uphill slog.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now Microsoft took three years to get from being a quarter of the size of Amazon to half its size in cloud, said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at SRG. Between them, the two companies represent half the market. Google's share is growing, but Amazon remains bigger than the next four competitors -- Microsoft, Google, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) -- combined.Microsoft, meanwhile, is less focused on the infrastructure opportunity than selling software as a service, where it has 23% of what will be a $100 billion market by this time next year. Here Google is thrown together with nine other vendors which are each a tenth of Microsoft's size.The lesson is that, for all the talk about hybrid cloud and interoperability, cloud may be as sticky as other software services. The one you start with is the one you stay with.Since joining Google last November, Kurian has been on a shopping spree, buying Alooma, Looker  and, this month, Elastifile, a file storage company. These deals have made Google a solid number-three in the market, while cutting out channel partners. But they're expensive. Hybrid cloud is the hottest niche in the hot technology market. Does GOOGL Win?Kurian's big deal may benefit VMware more than GOOGL, making it a better hybrid cloud play.This also makes Dell Technologies (NASDAQ:DELL) a big winner, because it owns 82% of VMware. Like the previous controlling shareholder -- EMC -- Dell operates VMware autonomously, while accounting for it in its own results.VMware has been operating on Microsoft Azure since April. VMware also has a partnership with International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), which is also, like GOOGL, focused on the hybrid cloud market since its acquisition of Red Hat.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek Since the start of the year, shares in Alphabet are up 17%, buoyed recently by that second quarter report. But shares in VMware are up almost 30%. The average NASDAQ stock is up almost 25% so far in 2019. Bottom Line on GOOGL StockGoogle has the financial strength needed to build a place for itself in the cloud re-sale market, providing fuel for GOOGL stock price appreciation.But it's unlikely to challenge either Microsoft or Amazon for cloud market leadership, and its efforts to build hybrid cloud are going to be costly.This means investors are going to rely on its free and public services, like Google search and YouTube, for growth. During the fourth quarter, Google properties continued to grow at a 17% annual rate, while constant currency revenues continued growing at a 22% annual rate. GOOGL stock is selling at about 25 times earnings and pays no dividend.But as regulators continue coming after Google and YouTube, Google Cloud is going to have to start pulling its weight for the company to prosper. The question is whether it can do that as the market's third wheel.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Peter Thiel is a self-described contrarian. This philosophy worked well when he helped establish an online bank at a time few people trusted anything on the internet and more recently, with his bet on the ultimate long-shot presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Understanding where his latest gambit, a very public rebuke of the world’s second-largest economy, fits into this strategy is as complex as his belief system.In a pair of recent public appearances, Thiel diverged from virtually everyone in the global business community by stoking anti-China sentiment and goading the Trump administration to intensify the trade war. Thiel can take this position because, either by accident or by design, the Chinese economy is largely irrelevant to his business interests.Thiel’s network of venture capital and personal funds manages more than $7 billion and has bet on hundreds of startups. Of those, there are only three known investments in Chinese companies, according to a study by market research firm PitchBook commissioned by Bloomberg. The most recent was in a small Beijing-based biotech startup early this year. None of the companies appear to be thriving.Depending on how you look at it, Thiel’s new Chinese offensive is a bitter response to missing the investment opportunity of the decade or a brilliant long game that’s finally coming to a climax. His protectionist rhetoric, in which he accused Google of “seemingly treasonous” collaborations with the Chinese government, initially won plaudits from President Trump and could return benefits to his companies. A spokesman for Thiel declined to comment.Three of Thiel’s most promising investments—Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., data mining company Palantir Technologies Inc. and border security provider Anduril Industries Inc.—rely heavily on U.S. contracts. Those deals have grown in size, and the companies now supply critical capabilities to the nation’s defense and military complex.Although federal contract approvals are supposed to be an objective process, emotional appeals and a sense of patriotism can have an effect, said Mike Hermus, a former technology chief for Homeland Security. “The people who make decisions are still human,” he said. “People can only compartmentalize so much.”Thiel didn’t always look on China with scorn. He once viewed it as an economic wonder and characterized its rise as “the most important political trend of the new millennium.” In a 2008 essay for Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, a public policy think tank, Thiel wrote: “There is no good scenario for the world in which China fails.” By 2014, his curiosity took on a dismissive tone. In his book Zero to One, he wrote that Chinese technologists simply copied ideas from the West.“There is no good scenario for the world in which China fails.”A persistent view Thiel has held is that China doesn’t make it easy for foreigners to buy a stake in the country’s prosperity. “I suspect we are underestimating China, but it may be very hard to invest,” he told economist Tyler Cowen in 2015. In the meantime, several of his peers found ways in. Yuri Milner’s DST Global and Sequoia Capital have been backing Chinese startups for a decade or more, with bets on the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Xiaomi Corp. that proved to be incredibly lucrative.Thiel’s picks, meanwhile, haven’t become household names on the mainland. He invested $180,000 a decade ago in a Shanghai market intelligence startup called Business Connect China, said a spokeswoman for his venture firm Founders Fund. (She disputed that Business Connect China is a Chinese company because it’s incorporated in the Cayman Islands.) According to PitchBook research, Thiel bought an undisclosed amount of stock in Beijing’s Genome Precision in 2016. And this year’s investment was in Immunochina, which has raised less than $30 million from a half-dozen backers including Thiel to develop cancer treatments.As recently as last year, Thiel was still contemplating how to break into China. He evaluated various options, including partnering with local venture firms, people familiar with the conversations said at the time. Those talks never progressed, some of those people now say. It’s essentially too late, said Helen Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners. Today’s market is highly competitive and leaves little room for an outsider, she said: “China is one of the two largest tech ecosystems in the world.”The new contrarian strategy, it seems, is to turn a weak business record in China into an asset. By targeting Google with his unsubstantiated claim last month, Thiel suggested associations with Beijing should be a disqualifier for a U.S. contractor. Trump at first entertained the idea, promising in a tweet that the White House would look into Thiel’s claims of treason and calling him “a great and brilliant guy.” The sideshow appeared to temporarily take the heat off Facebook Inc., where Thiel is a board member. But Google denied the claims, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that they found no security concerns.Some in Thiel’s orbit said the venture capitalist’s concerns are authentic. “He’s a very patriotic guy,” said John Meyer, who received a grant from Thiel’s fellowship program to start a company in lieu of attending college. “If Google is building an AI office in Beijing and hiring a ton of AI engineers there, that means its working with the Chinese government in some way. He’s worried about that.”Thiel’s stance could also win him fans in Washington. The three major U.S. contractors in which he holds stakes have at times echoed Thiel’s message of American loyalty. They have a lot of money riding on federal spending.Just this year, SpaceX has won more than $350 million from the Air Force, Defense Department and NASA. Palantir, which counts Thiel as a founder and chairman, secured a contract worth more than $800 million from the Army in March and another in July from the Defense Department for $144 million.In the second agreement, which hasn’t been previously reported, Palantir will supply software to intelligence agencies and the Coast Guard over four years. This deal was particularly significant because it wasn’t open to competing bids and established Palantir as a “brand name” federal provider of defense technology, in the same league as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. The designation can set a precedent, said Meagan Metzger, who runs Washington-based Dcode accelerator, which consults with tech companies on federal contracting. “When you do a brand name contract of that size, you have to get a bunch of approvals up the chain,” she said. “That’s a huge award.”The newest addition to Thiel’s portfolio of government suppliers is digital surveillance company Anduril. Palmer Luckey, founder of the Facebook-owned virtual-reality headset Oculus, runs the business, which, like Palantir, takes its name from the lore of Thiel’s beloved childhood book series, the Lord of the Rings. Anduril is staffed by more than a dozen Palantir veterans and funded largely by Thiel’s Founders Fund.Anduril has gained significant traction inside the U.S. government in the two years since it started operating. The startup quietly took over the military’s Project Maven this year, according to a news report in the Intercept, after Google faced employee protests and abandoned the effort. Anduril also secured a $13.5 million contract with the U.S. Marine Corps to provide autonomous surveillance towers on the border and at military bases, according to documents surfaced in July by worker advocacy group Mijente.Thiel’s love of country is being embraced throughout his empire. One of the newest additions to the Founders Fund investing team, Delian Asparouhov, posted a photo July 17 to Twitter showing the office décor set to commemorate a visit from Luckey to discuss Anduril. An American flag was draped across a white board in the conference room, as he held a red, white and blue napkin emblazoned with the words, “USA all day.”To contact the author of this story: Lizette Chapman in San Francisco at lchapman19@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Peter Thiel Missed Out on China.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- MacKenzie Bezos is officially Amazon.com Inc.’s second-largest individual shareholder.About 19.7 million shares are now registered in 49-year-old MacKenzie’s name, according to regulatory filings detailing stock sales by her ex-husband, Jeff Bezos. The transfer is a rare disclosure for a divorce whose financial terms have otherwise been shielded from the public. A King County, Washington, judge had signed an order formalizing the separation on July 5.Bezos sold 968,148 shares for about $1.8 billion between July 29 and July 31 as part of his stock-sale plan, the filings show.MacKenzie’s 4% holding is worth $37 billion, enough to place her 23rd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world’s 500 richest people. The value of her stake has fallen by $1 billion since April, when the settlement was first disclosed. Bezos, 55, the founder and chief executive officer of the world’s largest online retailer and web-services company, retains a 12% stake worth $109 billion and remains the world’s wealthiest person.The value of the transfer makes it the world’s most expensive divorce. While Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison has been through multiple breakups, none has affected his ownership in the software maker. Likewise, Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s stake remained unchanged after he and Anne Wojcicki divorced in 2015.To contact the reporters on this story: Tom Metcalf in London at tmetcalf7@bloomberg.net;Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill, Steve DicksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Jeff Bezos Sells $2 Billion of Amazon Stock After 4% Stake Transfer

Case in point: An entirely inconsequential charity lunch that’s been canceled between the billionaire and a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur has gotten far more attention than today’s quarterly earnings report from Berkshire will. It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that Berkshire Hathaway is the most valuable company in the world outside of the technology industry, an outlier in a ranking that goes like this: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Berkshire. Only five members of the S&P 500 index generate more free cash flow than Berkshire does. The company is run by 88-year-old Buffett and his 95-year-old business partner, Charlie Munger, who is just barely the oldest member of Berkshire’s aging board of directors. And though there are successors waiting in the wings, they simply won’t have the same prestige or credibility with shareholders. Even when one of the company’s other investment managers purchased a more than $800 million stake in Amazon.com Inc. earlier this year, investors wanted to hear about it from Buffett himself. There’s constant speculation about the future of Berkshire, including what giant companies Buffett may acquire next and whether it will be his final megadeal. The company is sitting on a record $122 billion of cash. But for now, let’s check in with the hodgepodge of businesses Berkshire already has, the health of which makes Buffett’s dealmaking possible. They earned a combined $6.14 billion in operating earnings in the latest period, down 11% from a year ago, as insurance underwriting income dropped. Berkshire’s insurance division is the most integral part of the conglomerate because Buffett can invest the premiums, earning a return before they get paid out to policyholders. In 2017, a surge in claims tied to natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey resulted in Berkshire’s worst underwriting loss in 15 years. The business is back to turning an underwriting profit, though the $353 million it took in last quarter is down a bit from the nearly $1 billion it earned a year ago. Still, the unit’s investment income climbed 20% to $1.37 billion. Gregg Warren, an analyst for Morningstar Inc., pegs the fair value of the entire insurance division at $149,900 a share. That makes up the largest portion of his $380,000 sum-of-the-parts estimate for Berkshire stock:One of Berkshire’s most well-known insurance brands is Geico, whose longtime CEO Tony Nicely retired a year ago. Buffett honored Nicely in his annual letter to shareholders in February, saying that his management created $50 billion of value for Berkshire. Part of the appeal of being a Berkshire company is that Buffett puts his trust in each subsidiary’s managers – like Nicely – and doesn’t meddle. At the same time, change can be good: Under Geico’s new leader, Bill Roberts, the insurer finally launched a phone app that tracks trips and promotes better driving, akin to the programs that Geico’s rivals have long used to boost profits.Across Berkshire, there are managers taking it upon themselves to implement positive changes and modernize the company, without threatening the cultural continuity Buffett would like to see. Some executives, including Mary Rhinehart, CEO of Johns Manville – a building-products maker owned by Berkshire – have begun a new tradition of regularly gathering to share strategies, even though Berkshire’s modus operandi has always been for its businesses to operate entirely independent of one another. “We’ve loved being part of Berkshire,” Rhinehart told me at Berkshire’s shareholder meeting in Omaha in May; it’s just that she saw an opportunity to take advantage of the network that the sprawling company has. That May meeting was a reminder that Berkshire is more than a cash machine that funds Buffett’s high-profile investments or a podium from which to share his views about markets and the economy. Dozens and dozens of individual companies make up Berkshire, each with its own unique brands and challenges. Take Dairy Queen: CEO Troy Bader explained to me how the ice cream chain is studying the rising popularity of dairy alternatives, trying to create “Instagrammable” menu items and looking at delivery for online orders. There’s also the interesting debate taking place around BNSF, Berkshire’s railroad, which has been slow to adopt precision railroading, a strategy that’s helping its competitors become more efficient. The railroad’s net earnings were $1.34 billion, a 2% boost from last year.In addition to Rhinehart’s and Bader’s businesses, Berkshire’s “manufacturing, service and retail” division comprises aerospace supplier Precision Castparts, chemical producer Lubrizol, McLane wholesale grocery distribution, Benjamin Moore paint, Fruit of the Loom underwear, NetJets private jets, See’s Candies, car dealerships, jewelry and furniture retailers and so on. Together they earned $2.49 billion in the quarter, which was unchanged from 2018.What drew Buffett to each of these very different businesses was the perceived durability of their brands and market share. How durable are they proving to be? That we don’t quite know because Berkshire doesn’t disclose many details about them in its filings.(2)It’s something I suspect will change once Buffett is no longer in charge. He wrote in this year’s letter that he doesn’t want Berkshire shareholders to “obsess on the details,” as that kind of analysis “can be mind-numbing” given the array of businesses Berkshire owns. But investors demand more transparency from CEOs who don’t have his celebrity and track record. I imagine that over time, folks like Greg Abel – Buffett’s likely successor who functions as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and also now broadly oversees all non-insurance operations – will conform to more public company traditions, such as hosting earnings calls and providing results on a more granular level.So often the greatest insight investors get into how Berkshire’s businesses may be doing is by studying the reports of other insurers, railroads and manufacturers. Perhaps that’s another reason so little attention is paid to Berkshire’s own Saturday earnings releases. But even though numerous large companies exist within the company, they are but small next to Buffett. (1) Slightly more is known about the inner-workings of Berkshire’s various electric utilities and other energy businesses because that division files its own reports and its debt isn’t guaranteed by the parent company.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

2019-08-05,"Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock moved modestly higher on Thursday, trading on word that it had closed its acquisition of Tableau Software. Given the visual analytics capabilities and the massive growth forecasted while Tableau traded on a separate ticker, it will likely become a valuable acquisition for CRM stock.Source: Shutterstock CRM continues to make other deals as well. A recently announced partnership with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) should also increase its reach into the world's second-largest economy. This could help Salesforce achieve one of its goals of doubling sales by fiscal 2023.However, despite these moves, CRM stock has seen falling multiples and little price action since the beginning of the year. This calls into question what it will take to boost CRM. Until investors get an answer to that question, I see little reason to own Salesforce stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tableau, Alibaba Should Boost Salesforce RevenuesFew question the premise that Tableau will add significantly to Salesforce's growth. When Tableau traded as a separate company under the DATA ticker, analysts predicted 680% profit growth this year and 31% the next. Given that rate of increase, CRM probably made a wise purchase despite paying more than 12-times sales for the company.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now Further, partnering with Alibaba gives CRM a foothold into China. The deal makes Salesforce the only enterprise customer relationship management (CRM) software that Alibaba will sell on its platform. Salesforce Stock Could Still StruggleHowever, I think traders want to know whether these deals will reinvigorate CRM stock. The company recovered quickly from the market slump back in December. Still, it has seen little movement in the price since February.Many also wonder if valuations will recover to previous levels. The forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at about 60. That may appear high by S&P 500 standards. However, that multiple has fallen far from its average five-year P/E ratio of about 274. Moreover, this year, analysts expect an earnings increase of only 5.1%.  Click to EnlargeAdmittedly, I would treat this lower growth as an anomaly since Wall Street also projects average annual profit increases of 29.58% per year over the next five years. Still, that comes in below the 47.2% average for the previous five years.We have also begun to see indications of a downtrend in the charts. As InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley mentions, CRM stock has struggled to stay above its 200-day moving average. In June and July, bulls rescued the Salesforce.com stock price. Still, with no significant price action since February, repeated tests of this level should cause concern. CRM Saw a Huge Run-Up Over the Last 10 YearsOver the past 10-plus years, CRM stock has seen an incredible run. In November 2008, the Salesforce.com stock price fell as low as $5.21 per share. Today's price of almost $155 per share represents an increase of nearly thirty-fold!Salesforce's Software as a Service (SaaS) has become a disruptor across the tech industry. Although companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) offer competing products, they have not threatened Salesforce's leadership in CRM software.Still, stock prices depend on the future. Salesforce should remain a leader in its industry. However, recent deals have not stopped the multiple compression in CRM. Unless the company can find a larger catalyst, investors may see little near-term profit in Salesforce stock. Final Thoughts on CRM StockThe Tableau and Alibaba deals help Salesforce.com, but they may not help to boost CRM stock. Salesforce stock has seen massive increases over the last 10-plus years. Its SaaS capabilities have transformed tech and buying Tableau should continue this market leadership.However, it remains uncertain how much longer Salesforce stock can defy gravity. The forward P/E ratio has fallen back to double digits. As mentioned before, recent deals have done little to rescue the falling valuation.CRM stock reports its earnings on Aug. 22 after the closing bell. From there, investors should have a better indication of what these deals do for this equity.I do not see a massive downturn occurring in this stock. However, I also do not think the Tableau buyout or the Alibaba deal will stop this multiple compression. With high expectations and the lack of additional catalysts, I do not see what will.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-08,"(Bloomberg) -- The Justice Department is scrutinizing Google’s digital advertising and search operations as authorities gear up a broad antitrust review of the market power of giant internet companies, according to people familiar with the matter.Antitrust officials have been actively meeting over the past month with third-party companies that could have grievances against Google, including publishers and consumer-facing websites, said two people familiar with the matter. Advertisers and ad-tech companies have also met with the officials, and more meetings are on the calendar, one of the people said.The focus on advertising and search operations signals where the department could be taking its inquiry, which is in its early stages and could drag on for months. The range of companies meeting with the antitrust officials goes beyond those that have previously voiced complaints, which include Oracle Corp., News Corp. and Yelp Inc., the person said.Bloomberg reported in June that the Justice Department was preparing to investigate Google, but this is the first indication of the status and scope of the review.The antitrust division, led by Makan Delrahim, is pouring resources into the inquiry, drawing in lawyers from other sections of the agency to study the issues, one of the people said. While the division is exploring the digital advertising and search markets in the review’s initial stages, it will continue to narrow down the ultimate focus, one of the people said.Google controls much of the technology that news publishers and marketers use to serve ads across the internet and nets most of its revenue from ads. The company reported $116.3 billion in advertising revenue last year, which represented 85% of overall sales. It doesn’t break out its revenue by channels. Publishers and rivals have complained that Google’s dominance hinders competition in that market. Earlier this year, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for violating competition law with its online practices.Google said its innovations have reduced prices and expanded choice for consumers and merchants, pointing to its testimony before a House antitrust panel in July. “We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals,” Google lawyer Adam Cohen said in prepared comments for the hearing. “We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.”The Justice Department declined to comment. The people described the investigation under condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the inquiry.Attorney General William Barr has elevated a lawyer from the antitrust division to be his point person on the review, signaling his hands-on interest in the issue. Lauren Willard has been appointed to serve as his counselor and report to him on developments in the inquiry, according to a department official.The Justice Department last month announced its broad review of whether technology giants are hurting competition following mounting criticism across Washington that the companies have become too big and too powerful. The department hasn’t specified which firms it would scrutinize.Bloomberg reported in June that U.S. antitrust agencies carved up oversight of four tech giants, with the department taking Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc., and the Federal Trade Commission claiming Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Read More: Far From Silicon Valley, Trustbusters Plotted Big Tech AssaultThe investigation is a sign of the escalating pressure on tech giants, from Capitol Hill to President Donald Trump, who accuses the companies of silencing conservative views.The giants of the industry are under fire over massive collection of user data, failing to police content on their platforms, and claims that they are harming competition and reducing choices for consumers.&#92;--With assistance from Chris Strohm, Naomi Nix, Mark Bergen and Ben Brody.To contact the reporters on this story: Sara Forden in Washington at sforden@bloomberg.net;David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark NiquetteFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","DOJ Scrutinizes Google Advertising, Search in Antitrust Probe"

2019-08-09,"(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon fought back Friday, defending the cloud-computing contract valued at as much as $10 billion that President Donald Trump has questioned and that new Defense Secretary Mark Esper is subjecting to a fresh review.Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy told reporters at the Pentagon that he’s scheduled “education” sessions for Esper on the competition that critics, including Trump, have argued is tilted to favor Amazon.com Inc.While Esper, who took office July 23, has requested detailed briefings on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure program, Deasy said, the competition hasn’t been put on hold. “There is not a ‘pause’ on the overall JEDI program,” he said.But Deasy acknowledged that the defense secretary’s review will delay the contract award beyond the end of this month, which had been the soonest the Defense Department had said it would happen.Combative RetortsDeasy, whose presentation included a three-page document with combative retorts to criticism of the competition, said Esper supported his plans “to clarify some of the myths that are going on out there.”Trump stunned tech companies, the Defense Department and lawmakers when he openly questioned whether the pending contract is being competitively bid. “I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,” he told reporters last month. Trump has often attacked Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post. Microsoft Corp. is the only other bidder that hasn’t’ been eliminated.Among points in Deasy’s document defending the contract:It’s a “myth” that the contract is for $10 billion over 10 years. “DoD is not locked in” and “is under no obligations to place any orders beyond” an initial $1 million.The proposal reflects the “unique and critical needs” of the Defense Department to allow “a warfighter in Afghanistan to access the same information as an analyst in Washington, D.C., or a service member training in California.”The accusation of favoritism “has been brought by a single company that was determined to be noncompetitive,” a clear reference to Oracle Corp.Oracle has spearheaded the campaign against the contract, but a federal claims court judge last month rejected its contention that the project was fatally tainted by revolving-door conflicts of interest involving people who worked at times for the Pentagon and Amazon or that the acquisition strategy was improper.The Defense Department’s inspector general is working on its own report on the conflict of interest questions. Deasy said that if the report isn’t finished by the time Esper completes his review, “we would obviously have a conversation with the IG” before awarding the contract to see if there’s “reason to pause.”To contact the reporter on this story: Tony Capaccio in Washington at acapaccio@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Larry Liebert, Steve GeimannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Pentagon Pushes Back on ‘Misleading’ Cloud Contract Criticism

2019-08-13,"(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon’s inspector general is “expeditiously” conducting an extensive review of the Defense Department’s JEDI cloud-computing project, including potential conflicts of interest and misconduct in the competition that may generate as much as $10 billion in revenue.“We are reviewing the DoD’s handing of the JEDI cloud acquisition, including the development of requirements and the request for proposal process,” spokeswoman Dwrena Allen said in a statement Tuesday, offering the first details of the previously announced review requested by lawmakers.The watchdog office’s inquiry began before President Donald Trump endorsed criticism by rivals that the pending contract award favors Amazon.com Inc., the leading cloud services provider. New Defense Secretary Mark Esper has initiated his own review of the project.“A multidisciplinary team” of auditors, investigators and attorneys is investigating JEDI matters “referred to us by members of Congress and through the DoD Hotline,” Allen said. “In addition, we are investigating whether current or former DoD officials committed misconduct relating to the JEDI acquisition, such as whether any had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.”‘Sensitive’ ReviewAllen said the review “is ongoing and our team is making substantial progress. We recognize the importance and time sensitive nature of the issues, and we intend to complete our review as expeditiously as possible.”The inspector general intends to write a report and notify Esper, Defense Department leaders and Congress under standard protocols, she said. “We will also consider publicly releasing the results, consistent with our standard processes,” she said.Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, told reporters Friday that if Esper’s review is complete before the inspector general issues findings “we would obviously have a conversation with the IG” to assesses if there’s “reason to pause” in advance of making a contract award for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure program, or JEDI.The contract was originally going to be awarded as soon as late August. The Defense Department previously determined that allegations of unethical conduct didn’t taint the acquisition process but it referred possible instances of unethical conduct to the inspector general.Trump stunned tech companies, the Defense Department and lawmakers when he openly questioned whether the pending contract is being competitively bid. “I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,” he told reporters last month.

2019-08-14,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares have tumbled this month. Since its investor presentation on August 2, IBM stock has fallen from $146.58 a share to $134.12. Reducing its 2019 earnings guidance, IBM anticipates that the recent Red Hat acquisition will not contribute to earnings until 2021.Source: Shutterstock The adjustments to earnings are due to non-cash write-downs of deferred revenue. As InvestorPlace contributor Mark Hake wrote last week, IBM has suspended its stock buyback program in order to pay for the Linux maker.But with the Red Hat adding much needed growth, what's the verdict with International Business Machines stock? Is there upside for long term investors? Or is there additional downside to the IBM stock price? Let's have a closer look at why IBM stock may be a buy at today's price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Red Hat Adds Growth PotentialPrior to the Red Heat deal, IBM was treading water. The company released earnings on July 17. For the second quarter of 2019, revenue was down year-over-year. Sales were $19.1 billion, down from $20 billion in the prior year's quarter. The company's Cloud and Business Services unit saw slight growth (5% and 3% YoY, respectively), but declines in the Global Technology Services and Systems units countered this improvement. Despite this slight revenue slip, IBM managed to keep quarterly operating income steady at ~$2.8 billion.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What The Red Hat deal adds a variety of growth catalysts to the International Business Machines story. For one thing, the acquisition makes IBM a bigger player in the $1 trillion cloud computing space. The deal is expected to accelerate revenue growth and improve gross margins. The deal is also very synergistic. IBM can now sell Red Hat's suite of solutions to their existing customer base. With IBM's global reach, the company could expand Red Hat's business better than Red Hat would have done as an independent company.But is this deal a guaranteed slam-dunk? In the past, IBM's M&A activity has been focused on small bolt-on deals. At $34 billion, this acquisition is quite a large bite. The company could experience headwinds integrating Red Hat into its operations. Failing to meet investor expectations, the IBM stock price could see additional downside if the deal's benefits take longer to realize.With this in mind, is the risk worth the potential return? Are investors paying a premium or getting a bargain? IBM Stock ValuationWith its weak growth over the past few years, IBM stock sells at a fairly low valuation. Shares currently trade at a forward price/earnings (forward P/E) ratio of 11.8x. The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) is 8.9x. Compare this to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which trades for 26.3 times forward earnings, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.4x. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) trades for 17 times forward earnings, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.4x. SAP (NYSE:SAP) trades for 40.8 times earnings, and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.5x.Comparing IBM to similar large information technology companies, it appears shares trade at a discount. With the aforementioned weak growth in mind, such a valuation is justified. But with the Red Heat deal adding growth potential, there could be substantial upside to the IBM stock price. If the company can pull it off, shares should see material appreciation in the next few years.But is now the time to buy IBM stock? Or will investors have an opportunity to buy on subsequent dips?There are many ways IBM stock could go lower. Enterprise IT is not like making widgets. The constantly evolving landscape makes it tough for established companies like IBM to stay relevant. The elimination of stock buybacks reduces the company's ability to shore up earnings per share.  * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now What if IBM decides to cut its dividend to reduce debt? The company has not cut the dividend since its early-90s turnaround. However, even with its high debt load, the company's $12 billion in free cash flow is more than enough to support the current $6.48 per share payout. The dividend cut is a low-risk scenario, but still possible given the company's need to reduce debt. Bottom Line: Patience is Advised With IBM StockInternational Business Machines stock is clearly undervalued. The investment community has written off Big Blue, continuing to believe the company remains a dinosaur. With the Red Hat acquisition, IBM can prove the bears wrong, and deliver acceptable revenue growth going forward. But with IBM's history of making stumbles, it is tough to take their investor presentations without a grain of salt. With this in mind, there could be additional downside to the IBM stock price.In the event of additional bad news, IBM stock may be a screaming buy. If the Red Hat deal faces short-term headwinds, shares could trade at fire sale prices. Until then, keep an eye on IBM stock, but don't bet the ranch.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-15,"If you're like me, the last week or so has made you a bit seasick. Thanks to the escalating trade war, dwindling economic data and perhaps missteps by the Federal Reserve, volatility is rising. Heck, the so-called &quot;fear index&quot; -- the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) -- has spiked to levels not seen in years. That's making for some nasty swings in the overall market. For many investors, those swings are resulting in plenty of sleepless nights. There's nothing worse than being on the cusp of retirement and having to deal with this volatility.With a hefty dose of dividend stocks, you don't have to.By nature, dividend stocks are generally less volatile than non-dividend stocks. That's because getting 2%-4% in cash helps smooth out returns, no matter what the market is doing. At the same time, in order to continue paying those quarterly checks, dividend stocks tend to be of higher quality, featuring steady revenues, low debt and wide moats. As a result, investors tend to abandon dividend stocks less than non-payers during times of duress and their overall volatility is lower.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What This is exactly where investors should be focusing their attention in the weeks and months ahead. As things get dicier, dividends will help get you through.But which dividend stocks make the cut? Here are five that feature long-term dependability. Dividend Stocks To Buy: Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.95%There's nothing particularly exciting about toilet paper, diapers or tissues. But that doesn't mean that boring can't be profitable. In fact, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) has turned purveying paper towels into a cash flow rich niche, and one that has rewarded investors for decades.KMB owns such powerhouse brands as Huggies and Pull-Ups diapers, Kleenex tissues, Scott and Cottonelle toilet paper and Depends undergarment protectors. The firm sells these major brands across more than 175 different countries. And according to the firm's own metrics, 1 in 4 people worldwide use at least one of its products each day. This huge moat and brand penetration have continued to power the firm's revenues over its history. Last quarter, Kimberly-Clark stock managed to see a 5% jump in organic sales year-over-year.That revenue growth may not seem tech-worthy, but with continued improving margins, it's allowed KMB stock to see steadily improving profits. Here again, year-over-year earnings per share for the paper producer grew by 5%. For a steady dividend payer, this is exactly what you want to see -- rising sales and profits that are consistent. And they've been consistent enough to reward shareholders in a big way.Last quarter, KMB managed to hand out $520 million in dividends and buybacks. Management estimates that it'll fork over around $2.3 billion for such activities over the rest of the year. Medtronic (MDT)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.13%Forty-two years is a long time. But that's just how long Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) stock has been paying increasing dividends. This puts MDT in an elite group of dividend stocks dubbed the Dividend Aristocrats that have been rewarding investors through thick and thin.Driving that dividend growth is MDT's business model. The firm basically invented the medical devices sector when it created the first artificial heart/pacemaker back in the 1950s. Today, it's one of the largest device markers spanning a variety of cardiovascular, spine, surgery and other products needed by doctors and hospitals. This vast portfolio churns out plenty of steady cash flows and sales. Last quarter alone, Medtronic managed to sell more than $8 billion worth of devices.The best part is that MDT stock has continued to see some big growth as well.The device maker continues to move into higher-margin and more high-tech devices such as advanced diabetes monitors that use artificial intelligence to determine insulin levels. Sales of these devices have been swift. This has improved MDT's profitability profile and helped boost its cash flows further. And MDT has been sharing those cash flows with investors. The firm recently upped its dividend by 8%, following a 9% boost last year.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now With new devices pulling in high margins and old devices making plenty of steady sales, MDT could be one of the best dividend stocks to buy in this market. Medtronic yields 2.13%. Oracle (ORCL)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.8%Truth be told, many investors have forgotten about Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) in favor of smaller, faster-growing tech stocks. That's a real shame as Larry Ellison's baby is still a great firm and increasingly, a wonderful dividend stock.The enterprise software giant has successfully transitioned to the cloud and now offers a variety of database management and other products to meet the needs of businesses. And if it couldn't build it on its own, Ellison has been very successful in buying what it needs. It added cloud-based enterprise resource planning software maker NetSuite in 2016 and construction project management software firm Aconex back in 2017.The transition to the cloud has been successful for Oracle. Over the course of fiscal 2019, ORCL managed to pull in nearly $40 billion in total revenue. However, cloud services and licenses managed to make up 82% of those. Better still, ORCL stock has continued to see improving margins from these operations.This has flooded the firm with cash. At the end of last quarter, ORCL had more than $37 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. This gives it plenty of room to buy out additional cloud players and reward shareholders. Since initiating a dividend in 2009, Oracle has managed to grow its payout by 380%. This includes its last 26% boost at the start of the year.For income seekers, ORCL stock shouldn't be ignored. While its 1.8% yield isn't super high, it has the goods to keep its growth over the long haul. Extra Space Storage (EXR)Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3%Some of the biggest beneficiaries of the last downturn were the self-storage real estate investment trusts. Americans have a lot of stuff, and as the housing crisis hit, many families were forced to downsize into smaller homes and apartments. That meant finding a place for all their Christmas decorations, family heirlooms and vintage Beanie Babies. This has made Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) a wonderful dividend stock to own over the last few years.That's because for the storage unit owners, it's a game of scale. Most of the sector is owned by mom and pop operators, so giants like Extra Space are able to use their massive size to often price out these operators from the market. Better still, firms like EXR can often offer them attractive buyouts -- which only then improves its own cash flows. Right now, EXR owns nearly 1700 self-storage facilities across the country and continues to smartly add to that pool of assets.That huge pool of facilities continues to work wonders for the firm's cash flows. Since 2006, funds from operations at Extra Space have managed to surge by more than 600%. That beats the pants off its rivals like Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) and CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE). Rising funds from operations directly translates into bigger dividends.  Over the last five years, EXR stock has seen its dividend jump by 91%.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates Given its history of dividend growth during times of stress, EXR could be one of the best dividend stocks as we approach another dicey economic situation. iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF)Dividend Yield: 5.3%Perhaps the best way to avoid the stress and volatility of the recent market is to blend the world of dividend stocks and bonds together. We're talking about preferred stocks. Offering steady coupon-like dividend payouts and callable par value, preferred stocks are a naturally lower-volatility choice for portfolios. However, given the low volumes and hard to research nature of the sector, a broad approach is best. And for that, the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (NASDAQ:PFF) is the best choice.With almost $16 billion in assets and nearly 2 million in daily trading volume, PFF is the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the sector. With it's underlying index -- the ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred & Hybrid Securities Index -- tracks more than 470 different preferred stocks. Financials and utilities make up the bulk of holdings, with preferred stocks issued by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) leading the pack.That huge portfolio of preferred stocks provides plenty of diversification and manages to push out a big 5.3% dividend yield. Even better is that PFF pays that dividend monthly -- an added benefit for those in retirement. Returns for the ETF have mostly been via that dividend, highlighting the stability of owning preferred stocks.With expenses of just 0.46%, or $46 per $10,000 invested, PFF makes a great choice to boost yield, while still owning dividend stocks in the wavy market environment.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the latest twist in the fraught competition for the Department of Defense’s $10 billion cloud-computing project, the Pentagon Inspector General’s Office announced a new investigation into whether there have been improprieties or corruption in the contracting process thus far. This probe, described to me as a very significant undertaking by Pentagon insiders, will complement a review already being conducted by new Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.The cloud project is formally known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or, in a nod to “Star Wars” geeks, JEDI. It would provide a single managerial system and a single repository for storage of the department’s incomprehensibly vast data streams. As the controversy hit, the contract was reportedly about to be awarded, with the final competitors being Amazon Web Services Inc (the heavy, heavy favorite) and Microsoft Corp.The twin investigations were spurred by pressure from three sources: disgruntled competitors who felt they were out of the running; Congressional actors representing districts and states from where those competitors have a presence; and the Oval Office itself. President Donald Trump said in mid-July that he intended to review the JEDI contracting after receiving “tremendous complaints” about the process from “some of the great companies in the world,” including IBM, Microsoft and Oracle – each of which bid on the JEDI contract.None of this, other than direct interference by the commander in chief, is particularly out of the ordinary for big defense acquisitions, given the byzantine procurement process in the Pentagon. As a newly selected one-star rear admiral in 2000, I was assigned to manage a complex agency-wide telecommunications contract that included creating a new constellation of satellites. By the time it was finally awarded, I had long transferred out of the Pentagon. And in 2013, as I was a grizzled four-star Admiral about to finish up my career, I was still wondering why the satellite constellation wasn’t yet fully operational. The short answer is that at the nexus of big money, political influence and uncertain technology, delays are a certainty.All of this begs the questions of why the U.S. military is pursuing this system, and how it can be brought on line rapidly – by whomever eventually wins the contract.JEDI will be an absolutely vital part of America’s future warfighting capability, especially in the increasingly complex new 5G environment. At heart, the vast cloud would allow a much more efficient information-technology system, replacing the hodgepodge of thousands of hand-tooled, inefficient networks that exist today. This is especially critical for the military, where so many personnel transfer every two to three years, often taking with them a hands-on knowledge of an individual network or complex of software. For a vast organization like the Department of Defense -- the largest “company” in the world – JEDI’s efficiency at scale will be crucial to optimizing expensive resources and operating efficiently.It’s not just about efficiency, though: JEDI should vastly improve resiliency and security. Instead of individual networks and organizations backing up their information locally, everything is stored in a much more defendable cloud structure - just as your personal data and photographs likely exist in the Microsoft or Apple Inc clouds today. The data can be seamlessly transferred, even in the intense crucible of combat. Cybersecurity experts tell us that there is great strength in reducing the number of individual portals that can be attacked and overcome; streamlining and unifying the defenses of the entire department make sense. This reduction of “threat surfaces” is crucial.Finally, from an operator’s perspective, there is great allure in one-stop shopping to stream data (a sort of military Netflix,), to record and store it, to create simple systems to “patch” software, and to build an infrastructure that permits constant monitoring of the entire department’s networks. Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, head of the Pentagon’s Artificial Intelligence Center, commented recently on the operational capabilities necessary for the emerging era of great power competition, with China in particular.“Imagine the speed of operations in a fight in the Pacific, where you just do not have time to figure out, ‘How do I get my data, clean my data, move it from point A to point B.’” Shanahan said. “If I’m a warfighter, I want as much data as you could possibly give me. Let my algorithms sort through it at machine speed. It’s really hard for me to do that without an enterprise cloud solution.” His comments were echoed by the department’s chief information officer, Dana Deasy, in a rare on-the-record co-briefing to the press they held last week.In order to move quickly to find efficiencies, create new resiliency, and provide a single point of contact for all IT operations, the Department of Defense needs to thoroughly but quickly complete these investigations. If there are real instances of malfeasance, they should be uncovered and the perpetrators punished forthwith. Frankly, Secretary Esper has an unattractive set of options, including starting the competition over; pressing forward to award despite the external pressure; or searching for some middle ground that may satisfy nobody. Whether he can power through all the sand in the gears here will be the first test of his leadership abilities, and will be among the most important he will face.In the likely scenario that all this smoke reveals not much fire but rather disgruntled competitors and political angst (and a strong component of anti-Amazon influence from the White House, where Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is despised), Esper should press through to a contract award as soon as is legally appropriate. Warfighting in the 21st century will be “brain on brain” combat, and a large, singular cloud structure is the gray matter the U.S. military needs.To contact the author of this story: James Stavridis at jstavridis@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tobin Harshaw at tharshaw@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.James Stavridis is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

The shares represent a great way to get exposure to some of the biggest trends in technology like AI (Artificial Intelligence), cloud computing, streaming and of course, ecommerce. Not many large companies can offer all that.Yet all that does not imply that AMZN is a sure bet either. AMZN is certainly facing notable risks and issues. And besides, in the tech world, a top company can easily fall to pieces. Just look at Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB). They were once seemingly invincible. But they are now marginal players.In other words, with AMZN stock, it's a good idea to consider its potential downsides. So let's take a look:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Cloud BusinessToday the cloud business should be dominated by a company like IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But instead, the clear leader is AMZN. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had the vision to leverage his company's e-commerce infrastructure into a thriving cloud unit. In fact, the cloud business was transformative for Amazon stock,  as it offset the low margins of its e-commerce business and allowed it to invest in its other businesses.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More But there is a problem: the cloud unit's growth is slowing. For the most part, the competition is becoming much more of a factor for AMZN in this sector.I'm not saying that AMZN 's cloud business will somehow fall apart. I believe the unit will remain solid.Yet don't expect it to continue to provide the necessary fuel to boost Amazon stock. Leadership and Managerial BandwidthIn a matter of only 25 years, Jeff Bezos has built a company worth close to $1 trillion. He was not only able to dominate high-growth markets but also find ways to deal with challenging environments, such as the dot-com bust (which almost led to the bankruptcy of AMZN). He was also masterful in convincing Wall Street that profits were not very important!But during the past couple of years, there have been some nagging questions about Bezos' leadership. First of all, he has been targeting a large number of market opportunities and many have not been successful (like the foray into smartphones). If anything, AMZN has become somewhat of a grab-bag of different businesses that really do not have much synergy.Then there is Bezos' personal situation. No doubt, his divorce was unexpected. What's more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal profile, Bezos has been focusing much more of his time on AMZN's Hollywood image (the title of the piece was &quot;Jeff Bezos' Journey From Private Family Man to Tabloid Sensation&quot;). He is also devoting more time to pursuits outside the company, like his space venture. The Limits of AMZN's GrowthEven with over $240 billion in revenues, AMZN continues to crank up the growth. Note that last quarter, its revenue jumped 20% year-over-year.But keeping that level of growth up will get harder and harder. It will also mean moving into categories in which AMZN may have fewer advantages.An example is healthcare. The company has been investing heavily in this business, with internal development and acquisitions. But so far, the results have been mixed. For example, AMZN's PillPack division - which is a digital provider of prescriptions - recently was accused by health information network Surescripts of fraud. True, AMZN has denied any wrongdoing. But this episode shows that it can be extremely difficult to disrupt highly regulated markets that have entrenched players.Interestingly enough, as AMZN gets larger, the company becomes a bigger target of antitrust regulators. Already it appears that AMZN is a target of a Department of Justice probe, which could ultimately lead to heavy fines or even the breakup of the company.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. said it plans to appeal a court ruling that dismissed its legal challenge of the Pentagon’s cloud-computing contract, a project valued at as much as $10 billion.Oracle contended in its lawsuit, which was dismissed in July, that the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract violated federal procurement laws and was unfairly compromised by personal relationships between former Pentagon officials and competitor Amazon.com Inc.Federal Claims Court Senior Judge Eric Bruggink ruled that Oracle didn’t meet the criteria for the bid and thus didn’t have the legal standing to challenge the terms of the procurement process.Oracle General Counsel Dorian Daley said in a statement Monday that the ruling acknowledged the procurement suffered from “significant conflicts of interest” and that federal law bars single-award contracts without proper justifications.“The Court of Federal Claims opinion in the JEDI bid protest describes the JEDI procurement as unlawful, notwithstanding dismissal of the protest solely on the legal technicality of Oracle’s purported lack of standing,” Daley said. “As a threshold matter, we believe that the determination of no standing is wrong as a matter of law, and the very analysis in the opinion compels a determination that the procurement was unlawful on several grounds.”The appeal is being filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, according to a legal notice by Oracle.In April, the Pentagon eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the competition for the contract, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the final contenders. New Defense Secretary Mark Esper has opened a review of the contract.President Donald Trump has openly questioned whether the pending contract is being competitively bid. “I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,” he told reporters last month. Trump has often attacked Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post.

Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are the two remaining competitors for that prize, which may reach $10 billion.The project awarded Thursday, called Defense Enterprise Office Solutions, or DEOS, will provide tools including word processing, email, file-sharing and spreadsheets.“We view some of these broader government modernization plans and cloud initiatives as another growth vector for Microsoft’s commercial cloud segment,” KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin wrote to clients.The agencies said they chose a bid from General Dynamics’ CSRA unit and partner companies for a contract that the Defense Department estimates at as much as $7.6 billion over 10 years, including a five-year base period and opportunities to renew.‘Multi-Cloud Strategy’“DOD’s cloud strategy includes both general purpose and fit-for-purpose clouds. DEOS is a great example of a fit-for-purpose cloud that supports our multi-cloud strategy,” Defense Department Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy said in a statement.Thursday’s announcement comes as the Pentagon is preparing for implementation of the controversial cloud-computing contract for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. Pentagon said the JEDI contract is intended to be the primary data repository for Pentagon data, while other cloud vendors will be used for other projects.In April, the Pentagon eliminated Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. from the competition for the JEDI contract.Oracle has said it plans to appeal a court ruling that dismissed its legal challenge of the JEDI contract.

2019-09-03,"For years, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has offered declining revenue but decent earnings per share that were boosted by the company's voracious appetite for buying back its own stock. While buybacks are often applauded, Wall Street eventually saw through that act and demanded more from IBM stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Up nearly 19% year-to-date, it's fair to say IBM stock is on the mend, but not all the way back. Highly creative and nimble technology companies are often viewed as &quot;transformative.&quot; While that label probably doesn't apply to IBM, Big Blue is undergoing a transformation aimed at rejuvenating the company's growth and boosting IBM stock price.Analysts are mostly bullish on the company's recently closed acquisition of Red Hat and see the deal as a potential bullish catalyst for IBM stock price. Of course, the company paints a bullish picture of the deal, telling analysts and investors that it will be able to sell more IBM products to Red Hat users and vice versa.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;IBM said the deal will boost second half 2019 revenues by about 2 percentage points; 2020 by 4-5 percentage points; and 2021 by 2-3 percentage points,&quot; according to Barron's.Moreover, the Red Hat purchase will bolster IBM's free cash flow. That, in turn, could enable IBM to return more money to the owners of IBM stock.   Over the years, IBM stock has been pretty dependable on that front. In addition to IBM being a dedicated buyer of its own shares, the dividend of IBM stock has steadily grown and currently yields 4.94%, more than triple the yield on 10-year Treasuries. Blockchain Bets, Cloud CallsWhile IBM stock is widely viewed as a mature, if not lumbering, technology name, the company has a formidable presence in the fast-growing blockchain and is a worthy cloud competitor.  Cloud computing is certainly growing, but IBM is behind rivals such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the cloud-computing arena.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September &quot;Though still in the early stages, we think investments in IBM Cloud (a combination of SoftLayer and Bluemix); acquisition of Red Hat; establishment of development platforms like Watson Developer Cloud; and enterprise application partnerships with leading global companies present positive opportunities for IBM,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;Still, more work remains to be done.&quot;In the cloud space, IBM likely needs to sharpen its focus on software-as-a-service, also a hyper-competitive environment. With IBM facing intense competition in its hardware business from rivals, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), software-as-a-service has become more important for IBM stock.&quot;Cloud computing and increasing competitive pressures from Oracle and Cisco will pressure IBM's systems segment,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;We expect secular headwinds and intense competition to hinder the growth of IBM's hardware business over the long term. On average, we forecast a small annual decline in revenue for this segment through 2023.&quot;As for blockchain, a space where IBM has meaningful advantages over its competitors, the company recently unveiled its Trust Your Supplier (TYS) network. TYS is aimed at improving &quot;supplier qualification, validation, onboarding and life cycle information management&quot; for corporate customers.That's a lot of tech jargon. What it really means is the platform helps companies track the movement of goods and services. That could be a $2 trillion industry in a few years. TYS could easily attract many customers if its promises of improving administrative cost and onboarding efficiencies are realized. In the corporate world, &quot;efficiencies&quot; usually mean cost savings, and executives love that.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks to Consider for Those Who Can Handle Risk  The Bottom Line on International Business Machines StockThere are positive aspects of the outlook of IBM stock. That outlook would grow more compelling if the Red Hat acquisition proves to be a better deal than previously believed. Currently, Red Hat is an &quot;add on&quot; to the positive thesis on IBM stock. But if the acquired company exceeds Wall Street's expectations, IBM stock could rally.IBM stock price could also climb if the company increases its footprint in the SaaS market. Trading at just 10.53 times the average forward earnings estimate, IBM is most definitely a value play in a sector in which investors are looking for growth. Moreover, even mature companies (see Microsoft) are delivering growth in the SaaS sector.IBM stock lacks the pizzazz of many equities in its sector, explaining its low multiples. That's all right as long as investors can wait for value stocks to come back into style, something that hasn't happened in over a decade.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03,"Shares of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) fell about 6% in late August after the hyper-growth cloud enterprise resource planning company reported second-quarter numbers which topped expectations. Management also hiked the full-year 2020 revenue guide. In other words, Workday reported a double-beat and-raise second-quarter earnings report, and in response, WDAY stock fell.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com A stock failing to rally on a double-beat-and-raise report should raise red flags. It is almost always a sign of overvaluation.Is that what we have with Workday stock? I think so. Workday is a great company doing great things. The financials look really good, the narrative is robust, and the long-term potential is promising. But, Workday stock is priced for all that good stuff -- and then some.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIndeed, my numbers indicate that a fundamentally supported fiscal 2020 price target for WDAY stock is somewhere around $140. WDAY stock trades hands north of $170 today -- and we are only halfway through fiscal 2020.Thus, Workday stock seems overextended here. To be sure, overextended stocks can stay in rally mode so long as investors keep buying. But, investors aren't buying anymore. WDAY stock is down 20% over the past two months.I think this is the beginning of a bigger downturn in WDAY stock. As such, I'd avoid buying the dip here for the foreseeable future. Workday Has Solid FundamentalsFirst, I want it to be understood broadly that Workday is a good company doing really innovative things and gaining share rapidly in a big market. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with Workday.Enterprises everywhere are migrating to the cloud. As they do, they are adopting cloud ERP solutions to digitize, automate and optimize finance, HR and corporate planning processes. SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have traditionally dominated the ERP market. But as the market has pivoted to the cloud, Workday has stepped in as a third legitimate player. A few years ago, hardly anyone used Workday. Today, 50% of Fortune 50 companies and 40% of Fortune 500 companies use Workday for their cloud ERP.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now There's still plenty of room for growth here. Only one-fifth of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud so far. Further, while 40% of Fortune 500 companies use Workday, only 17% of global 2000 companies do so, too. Thus, Workday has a tremendous opportunity over the next few years to: 1) grow wallet share among big enterprises, and 2) increase adoption among smaller enterprises on a global scale.Consequently, revenue growth will remain big for the foreseeable future. Most of that revenue growth will come through the high-margin subscription revenue pipeline, so it will be additive to gross profits. At the same time, big revenue growth should drive consistent positive operating leverage, so operating margins and profits should both move higher with revenues.Net net, Workday projects to be a big revenue and profit grower for a lot longer. Workday Stock Is OvervaluedSound like a great growth narrative? It is.But, WDAY stock is already priced for all this. Revenue growth is slowing from 30%-plus rates, to 20%-plus rates. The margin expansion trajectory is flattening out because Workday is having to spend big to compete at scale. Gross margins in the subscription business are also showing signs of being maxed out. Thus, while profit growth will remain robust, it won't be as robust as it has been.Realistically, I think this a 20% revenue growth company with healthy, but not huge, margin upside drivers. That combination leads me to believe that $6 in earnings per share is an optimistic but doable target by 2025.That would represent more than 250% growth from 2020's projected EPS. But, that's just not enough growth. If you apply an application software average 34-times forward earnings multiple to that 2025 EPS target of $6, you arrive at a 2024 price target for WDAY stock of over $200. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2020 price target of under $140.Workday stock trades north of $170 today. We aren't even halfway through fiscal 2020. Thus, WDAY stock seems aggressively overvalued today. The Party Appears to Be OverTo be sure, aggressively overvalued stocks can stay aggressively overvalued for a long time, so long as investors keep buying into the stock and the party stays alive.Unfortunately, the party in WDAY stock appears to be winding down.Markets have been choppy over the past few months. But not too choppy. Since mid-July, the S&P 500 is down about 3.5%. Cloud stocks are down about the same, with the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:SKYY) down about 5%.WDAY stock is down more than 20% over that same stretch. That is a noticeable underperformance of both the market and Workday's peers over the past few weeks.This underperformance leads me to believe that the party is over, meaning that this stock may not find support until its fundamentals give it support -- which doesn't happen until $140. Bottom Line on WDAY StockI'd stay away from Workday stock for the foreseeable future. The party appears to be over, and now the market is left with an aggressively overvalued cloud stock that investors don't want to touch. That dynamic should ultimately result in WDAY stock falling back below $150 over the next few weeks to months.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. borrowed $7 billion in its first bond sale in nearly two years, as cheap funding costs tempt even companies flush with cash.The tech giant joined a slew of companies that rushed to borrow in investment-grade debt markets after the Labor Day holiday, taking advantage of yields near all-time lows. Tuesday saw a record 21 bond sales totaling almost $27 billion, led by Walt Disney Co. More than a dozen companies priced deals Wednesday.Apple, which has more than $200 billion in cash and securities on its books, sold senior unsecured bonds in five parts. The longest portion of the offering, a $1.5 billion 30-year security, will yield 1.03 percentage points above Treasuries, after an initially discussed spread of about 1.25 percentage points, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Read more: Why Apple’s Borrowing $7 Billion Even With 30 Times That in CashApple, along with peers Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp., has not tapped the bond market since new U.S. tax laws took effect at the beginning of last year, allowing companies to repatriate overseas earnings at a lower cost. It’s been using that source of cash to fund capital returns in the meantime, an activity it had typically relied on investors for. The company last sold bonds in November 2017, in a $7 billion debt offering.With a rally in Treasuries pushing the average investment-grade bond yield to just 2.79%, companies are getting in while the getting is good. Disney hadn’t issued bonds in nearly a year until Tuesday, and Coca-Cola Co. is borrowed in dollars Wednesday for the first time since May 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. also returned to the market after a yearlong absence.Apple has been aiming for a net-cash-neutral position, but its cash still exceeds debt by around $100 billion. In April, it increased its share repurchase program to $175 billion from $100 billion, of which $78.2 billion had been used by the end of June. Proceeds from the bond sale could be used to buy back shares, as well as for acquisitions and debt repayment, among other uses.Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managed Apple’s bond sale.To contact the reporter on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Dan Wilchins, Christopher DeRezaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Sells $7 Billion of Debt in First Bond Sale Since 2017

2019-09-06,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was built on Google, a free search service that now allows anyone to find anything from anywhere. Google stock has been a reliable investment for a while, but things are changing.Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com Google is the greatest miracle of the 21st century. So why is Alphabet doing everything it can to run away from it in favor of paid services, especially its Google Cloud platform?The answer is, &quot;The government.&quot; Regulators are treating Google as a piggy bank, levying huge fines to media cheers. Politicians are using Google as a punching bag, demanding that it either be broken up or treated as a utility.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the face of all this, there's a sense of urgency about the company's Google Cloud efforts. Getting people to pay for your work gives cash flow the protection of contracts and business alliances. The Cloud and Google StockThe hiring of Thomas Kurian, formerly with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) to lead the cloud unit has been followed by a host of others. The company's cloud acquisition budget keeps growing.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market In June Google Cloud spent $2.6 billion for Looker, an analytics start-up. Kuiran is now reportedly kicking the tires on Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), a $4.3 billion seller of storage hardware and software. Nutanix' chief development officer has already left for Google after a revenue miss.It's not helping Google stock, though. Google is still stuck in third place in cloud market share, behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. The market is growing at 40% per year, but Amazon and Microsoft are winning half the business, leaving Google with just an 8% share.What's happening is &quot;hybrid multi-cloud.&quot; It's why IBM (NYSE:IBM) bought Red Hat. Enterprises are putting all their computing eggs in the cloud basket, rebuilding data centers based on cloud standards, and looking to arbitrage public clouds to reach their customers.Google's hybrid cloud platform is called Anthos. Analysts think it could be a $20 billion business within two years.  It's growing at over 50% per year.But rivals are growing just as fast. Politics and Google StockGoogle Cloud was built on cash flow from Google services, but they are becoming more trouble than they're worth.State and federal agencies have begun an antitrust inquiry into Google. They aim to control the search giant the way Microsoft was controlled starting in the 1990s. That nearly destroyed Microsoft, until the shackles came off and the paid cloud opportunity appeared.A  $170 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over Google's collection of young users' data at YouTube is just the tip of the iceberg.The European Union alone has imposed $9.3 billion in fines over various antitrust and privacy violations.  It's now going after Google's job search tool.Newspaper columnists call such fines &quot;peanuts.&quot; The Federal Trade Commission is now saying a break-up order is possible.Breaking up Google is partly behind the rise of Elizabeth Warren. Even on the right, anyone who switches to Google's side of the political argument is roundly condemned. The Bottom Line on Google StockPoliticians are now an existential threat to the cloud's free services.Those services were built with cash flow from advertising. They were so successful they destroyed a succession of media and retailing industries. Those industries now demand revenge, and they control the political agenda.This makes it essential that Google boost its hybrid cloud market share quickly before the cash flow is taken away. But so far Google Cloud is racing as hard as it can just to keep its place.As big as Google Cloud's recent moves have been, it may be that bigger, costlier moves are called for.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-09-06,"There's a reasonably obvious value case for IBM (NYSE:IBM). IBM stock trades at barely 10x 2020 EPS estimates. Its dividend yields 4.75%.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Both figures are among the cheapest in all of tech. And they suggest that IBM has room to rally if the company can simply provide stable results. With Red Hat now on board, plus efforts in cloud and in blockchain, that bogey doesn't seem that tough to hit.And yet International Business Machines stock is fading once again, dropping ~10% since touching a 10-month high early last month. It's not as if investors don't know that IBM stock is cheap; this is one of the most widely-held stocks in the market. Investors do know, they're just not buying the bull case here. Right now, it's hard to see how that changes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Post-Red Hat Decline and IBM StockAt the end of July, IBM stock seemed to be heading in the right direction. The stock had risen over 30% in 2019 alone. Its Q2 earnings weren't spectacular, but they were good enough to move the stock higher.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market The rebound from late 2018 lows seemed to suggest that investors had come around to the logic of the Red Hat acquisition, even if IBM paid a dear price in the process.What's happened since then? IBM detailed its outlook for Red Hat, and as I argued at the time, it didn't look like enough. A projected $1 billion contribution to free cash flow in 2021 was helpful - but hardly transformative for a company already generating $7B+ in annual FCF.The stock price started slipping immediately after the company gave its post-Red Hat guidance, and it kept falling before a recent bound.It does seem like that guidance disappointed, even if some Street analysts saw it as positive. External factors don't seem to explain the decline. Other large-cap tech plays like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) have traded flattish over the same period.Admittedly, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), perhaps the most similar tech play to IBM, has declined itself. But that's not exactly good news for International Business Machines stock, either. What Drives IBM Stock Higher?Because the question right now is simple: what catalyst does IBM have at this point? Investors have given their opinion on Red Hat. That leaves the legacy business.And that business isn't strong enough. It infamously posted 22 straight quarters of declining revenue before ending the streak in early 2018. After three quarters of growth, however, IBM has returned to its old ways in each of its last four earnings reports.There's a turnaround case, admittedly. There are hopes that with help from Red Hat IBM can become a bigger force in cloud. The mainframe cycle should turn in the company's favor again.But that case has held for most of this decade, and IBM, even with healthy dividends, has been a poor investment. Total return over the past five years has been negative. It's difficult to see investors suddenly deciding that case works at this point, as cloud rivals continue to take share and IBM integrates its largest-ever acquisition.It's possible that IBM will prove to just be too cheap: indeed, I made that case last year. But investor confidence in that case is flagging. It's difficult to see how that changes any time soon.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-09-09,"If you were thinking about investing in it, IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock looks fairly cheap right now. Its dividend yield is now very high at 4.6%, assuming its $6.48 annual rate stays unchanged. And now that IBM's $34 billion purchase of Red Hat has closed, the dividend is looking even more secure.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com In a presentation to analysts on Aug. 2, IBM showed that Red Hat would raise IBM's free cash flow by about half a billion dollars in 2020 and $1 billion in 2021, after interest costs from the purchase.This is important, since as I pointed out in my previous article on IBM, the company has stopped its buyback program in order to pay down the acquisition debt and maintain the dividend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIBM's annual $6.48 per share dividend costs $1.4 billion each quarter, or $5.6 billion annually. In Q2 IBM reported FCF of $2.4 billion, or $9.6 billion at an annual rate. That still leaves $4 billion for IBM to pay down the $34 billion in debt principal that it took on to buy Red Hat. Dividend Yield Comparison on IBM StockCompared to some other large software stocks, IBM's dividend yield looks very attractive. After all, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock yields 1.3%, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) yield 1.8%, and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) yields 2.9%.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy But, as I pointed out in my previous article, IBM's dividend growth rate has been slowing. These other stocks have had growing dividends, and they also repurchase their shares. Their buyback yields are also attractive, giving them high total yields.So, on the pro side, IBM's high dividend yield is now very secure with the Red Hat acquisition. But don't expect its dividend rate to increase much, if at all, since IBM now has to pay down its debt. FCF Yield ComparisonsOne bright spot is that IBM sports a very high free cash flow yield compared to its close peers. IBM's $9.6 billion FCF divided by its $125 billion market value gives IBM stock a 7.7% FCF yield. Microsoft's FCF yield is 3%, while both ORCL and CSCO stock have a 5.9% FCF yield.This means IBM's free cash flow is not being valued as highly as its peers -- which makes IBM stock attractive on a relative basis. International Business Machines Stock has Performed WellThe IBM stock price has risen 24% so far this year. This is better than most of its close peers. MSFT is up 39% YTD, but ORCL is up 19% and CSCO gained 14%. Given that the IBM is relatively undervalued on both a dividend yield and FCF yield basis, it's realistic to assume that the IBM stock price will continue to perform well.Meanwhile investors will have fun collecting IBM's relatively higher dividends. Those dividends are now even more secure with the extra free cash flow that the Red Hat acquisition provides.Moreover, once IBM has made a dent in its Red-Hat-related debt in several years, you can expect that IBM will resume buying back its shares again. That will have numerous benefits to investors. Moreover it will increase IBM's overall total yield (dividend yield plus buyback yield).In sum, IBM stock's dividend yield looks very attractive here and is much more secure with the Red Hat acquisition.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. said Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd is taking a leave of absence for unspecified health-related reasons, disclosing the move along with quarterly earnings on Wednesday afternoon.The software company made the announcement a day earlier than the results were scheduled to be released, after Bloomberg News contacted Oracle in relation to a story about the executive’s health.The company grappled for more than a year with one of the most harrowing dilemmas a corporation can face: when – and whether – to disclose a serious illness that has befallen a senior executive.Hurd, one of the company’s two CEOs, is struggling with an illness that has occasionally taken him in and out of the public eye for more than a year, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. Management’s rationale for staying silent until now centered at least in part on the depth of Oracle’s leadership bench, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing an issue the company considers private.Hurd, 62, shares the CEO title with Safra Catz, 57, a well-regarded 20-year company veteran, who previously served as finance chief and still oversees Oracle’s accounting, operations, legal and corporate development. Larry Ellison, the company’s septuagenarian co-founder, handed over the CEO reins five years ago, but has never strayed far from the helm. He chairs the board, orchestrates management changes and remains deeply involved in product oversight through his role as chief technology officer. Catz and Ellison will assume Hurd’s responsibilities during his leave of absence.Even so, Hurd’s well-being is hardly inconsequential to Oracle’s business. The usually outgoing executive oversees sales, regularly meeting with big corporate customers who spend tens of millions of dollars on Oracle’s collection of software programs. Of the three top executives, he’s also the most media-friendly, frequently outlining the company’s vision in meetings with the press and on television.But over the past year and a half, Hurd has curtailed public appearances and the company has taken pains to squelch discussion of his health. Late last year, Oracle downsized his responsibilities, placing most of the marketing team under Ellison, people familiar with the matter said. Bloomberg News initially contacted Oracle concerning this story on Tuesday. The company declined to comment or make any executives available. It made the announcement Wednesday, with no warning, along with first-quarter earnings, which were scheduled to be released Thursday afternoon.Securities law can be unclear about when a company is obligated to disclose a CEO’s ill health, allowing some to hold out as long as possible, while others have erred on the side of speaking out early. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn’t settled the question, but in general says shareholders should be told about “material” matters, defined as issues on which “there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it important.” The U.S. Supreme Court set a similar standard in a 1988 decision.Apple Inc. gave scant and often delayed details on the cancer that took the life of its co-founder and former CEO, Steve Jobs, in 2011. More recently, some companies have been quicker to tell investors and the public about executive illnesses. That was the case with banking leaders Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Lloyd Blankfein, of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who were both treated for cancer while serving as CEO.“The default position for a company whenever any senior executive is facing health issues should be to disclose, because it is something investors need to know when they assess a company,” said Stephen Davis, associate director of Harvard Law School’s program on corporate governance. “It may not be an issue if there’s a strong board, a strong succession plan, and strong investor confidence in the company. But when it’s a company such as Oracle where you really have a long history of shareholders not having confidence in issues around executive pay, for instance, it’s that much more important for them to know what’s going on.”Hurd and Catz have been navigating Oracle through a critical time, with sales growing modestly since they became CEOs in 2014 and still hovering at just under $40 billion a year. Oracle has been blindsided by the success of cloud software entrants like Amazon.com Inc., and has been racing to catch up and woo new customers. For more than a year, Oracle has conducted layoffs and reorganizations in various business units. On Wednesday, the company reported that fiscal first-quarter revenue was little changed, trailing analysts’ projections.Oracle’s financial performance has been mixed in the past two years. Sales have been choppy, with applications revenue gaining, server-computer sales falling and lucrative maintenance fees stagnant. Still, the shares have climbed more than 24% since the start of the year on optimism that Oracle’s cloud-based programs have started driving overall growth. Some investors say they’re confident in senior management despite some speculation over the last year that Hurd was unwell. C.T. Fitzpatrick, the founder of Oracle investor Vulcan Value Partners, described Hurd’s health as a “non-issue” and said the CEO seemed fine when on stage last year. “There’s a deep bench there and a lot of talent in that organization,” Fitzpatrick said. “I think that Safra in her own right has a lot of bandwidth.”At Oracle’s headquarters south of San Francisco in Redwood City, California, Hurd’s illness has been a topic of quiet discussion among employees for at least a year and a half. There have been periods over the past two years when he has missed many meetings and become a rare sight on campus, including about a month of canceled appointments and appearances in spring 2018, people familiar with the matter said. He has also been missing from headquarters recently, separate people said.The company and Hurd’s representatives have given various explanations for his absences. In spring 2018, Hurd was traveling to New York on a private plane when he started feeling ill. The jet turned around and Hurd canceled his appearance at a Bloomberg Live event. Oracle said the executive had a stomach-related illness. When she was Oracle’s chief marketing officer, Judy Sim gave employees a variety of reasons for why the CEO missed events or appeared to be ill. Sim, who is now Hurd’s chief of staff, has said that he was battling the flu and on separate occasions that a hernia was responsible for his changing appearance, including weight loss and hair that appeared to be a toupee, people familiar with the matter said. At one stage in 2018, a person close to Hurd said he was suffering from a blood-related ailment.There have also been rumblings about Hurd’s condition among the financial analysts who study Oracle on behalf of clients. Their opinions vary, from viewing his health as a private matter to wanting Oracle to be more forthcoming. “People would like to know. Sometimes more information is good,” Jack Andrews, an analyst at Needham & Co., said in an interview. “The lack of transparency and clarity is a cultural thing at Oracle probably set at the top by Larry Ellison. Would it be nice to have that clarity? Yes.” At the same time, Andrews sees Hurd as less “integral” to Oracle’s fortunes than Ellison or Catz.Though Ellison, 75, shifted some of Hurd’s responsibilities in the past year, Hurd had retained management of Oracle’s sales organization, industry-based software groups, one marketing team with a narrow product focus, press relations and investor relations, people familiar with the matter said. It’s not clear what role, if any, Hurd’s health played in the decision to shuffle oversight of marketing, and Ellison asserted control over that group at a time when he thought his company’s brand image had languished, the people said. Another person said the changes were unrelated to Hurd’s health. Ellison tasked his chief of staff, Mamei Sun, with a skunkworks project on how to rebrand Oracle in the summer of last year, people familiar with the matter said. Early this year, he formally appointed Sun to take over branding. He also hired Rupal Shah Hollenbeck, a former sales and marketing executive at Intel Corp., to bring a new perspective to the marketing team, the people said.Hollenbeck and Sun report directly to Ellison. All of Oracle’s top executives still have to go to the chairman to make major decisions, so Ellison remains an irreplaceable force at the software maker – the tiebreaker, the kingmaker, the company’s living charter.While some of Hurd’s responsibilities had been reassigned, Oracle has taken steps that effectively would protect his image inside and outside the company. The software maker recently required executives to complete an online training that instructed them they aren’t permitted to discuss any executive or employee health matters, a person familiar with the matter said.&#92;--With assistance from Tom Giles and Ashlee Vance.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Emily BiusoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Grappled for Months Over Disclosure of CEO Hurd’s Illness

2019-09-11,"Stocks that pay good dividends and also have significant stock buyback programs provide numerous benefits to investors. These benefits include:  * Share reductions from buybacks allow the stock to increase its dividends per share.  * Buybacks act as a natural buffer for the stock.  * Earnings per share increases for the same amount of net income.  * Buybacks act to sterilize share dilution from management and employee options.  * Lower share counts over time increase the remaining shareholders' stake in the company.  * Compared to dividends, buybacks are a much more tax-efficient return of capital.For these reasons, there is a clear trend in the United States stock market for companies to spend more on share buybacks. CNBC recently reported that according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) study, U.S. share buybacks are expected to hit $1 trillion this year. Corporations are using over 104% of their free cash flow for buybacks, up from 82% last year.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September I'm going to focus on five stocks that pay shareholders dividends and have large share buyback programs. Combined, these dividends and buybacks provide large total yields. And over time, these stocks are likely to be good investments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dividend Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Source: thanat sasipatanapa / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.4%Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has an attractive 1.4% dividend yield. But it returns even more capital to shareholders through its large share buyback program. AAPL has spent over 107% of its free cash flow on buybacks in the past year. The company has cut its shares by 32% in the last six years.Based on recent analysis, Apple stock will have an estimated 6.5% buyback yield over the next year, giving it a nearly 8% total yield.For example, AAPL recently reported that it spent $17 billion in share repurchases and $3.6 billion in dividends in its most recent quarter. The buybacks alone, if continued each quarter, represent on an annualized basis just under 7% of its market value ($68 billion dividend by $975 billion).Expect good things from Apple's stock buyback program in the years to come, including higher dividends per share and higher earnings per share. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.4%Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock yields 1.4% and has a large share buyback program. It just completed a $25 billion share repurchase program. In the past quarter alone, MSFT spent $7.7 billion on shareholders, including $4.2 billion in share buybacks.These repurchases have reduced the amount of MSFT shares outstanding by over 30% in the past 15 years. Since Microsoft stock has a $1 trillion market value, its annual spending of over $16 billion in buybacks represents a 1.6% buyback yield. Combined with the 1.4% dividend yield, MSFT sports a 3% total yield. Oracle (ORCL)Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.7%Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock has a 1.7% dividend yield, but has a massive buyback program. In the past year alone, ORCL spent $36 billion on buybacks, representing 20% of its $182 billion market value.In its last eight fiscal years, ORCL has reduced its share count by over 33% using its free cash flow to repurchase shares. All eyes are going to be on ORCL's August fiscal first-quarter earnings statement to see how many shares it has bought back. Since ORCL spent over 280% of its free cash flow on buybacks, effectively drawing down its cash balance, I suspect ORCL's buyback activity may have been reduced for the August quarter.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Nevertheless, at the rate its buybacks occurred last fiscal year (ending in May), Oracle stock sports an annualized 20% buyback yield. Its free cash flow yield is 7.5% of its market value.ORCL will post its earnings Sept. 12, including its cash flow statement which will show the share repurchase amounts. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.8%Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock has an attractive 2.8% dividend yield. Cisco stock also has an attractive buyback program. This is because the company is expected to make $7.7 billion in share repurchases this year.Compared to its $206 billion market value, this gives CSCO stock a 3.7% buyback yield. Its total yield is an appealing 6.5% (2.8% dividend yield plus 3.7% buyback yield).In the past ten years, CSCO has reduced its shares outstanding by 27%, and should reach close to a 30% reduction this year. The main reason for this is that CSCO produces abundant free cash flow -- over $15 billion in this year alone.Expect that shares will continue to fall at CSCO. This has the benefit of allowing CSCO to be able to raise its dividend per share for the same amount of earnings its produces. It also increases earnings per share. Lastly the share buybacks act as a continuing source of demand for the stock, will help push the stock higher over time. McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.2%McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock enjoys a 2.2% dividend yield, but also engages in large share buyback activity. MCD reported that it expects to complete its three-year $25 billion share buyback program by the end of this year.This represents an average of $8.3 billion in share buybacks per year. Since MCD stock has a $158 billion market value, the average buyback yield is 5.3% of its stock market value.Combined with the 2.2% dividend yield, the buyback yield gives MCD an estimated 7.5% total yield. This means that over 7% of MCD's stock value is returned to shareholders on average each year through either dividends or buybacks.On Aug. 30 Mark Hake launched the Total Yield Value Guide, which focuses on high-total-yield value stocks.

2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I understand why Oracle Corp. tried to keep the illness of Mark Hurd, one of its chief executive officers, private as long as possible. It was a humane personal decision, but it was the wrong corporate one.A day after Bloomberg News contacted the company for an article about how Oracle had been grappling internally with Hurd’s health for many months, the company moved up the planned announcement of its quarterly earnings and disclosed that Hurd is taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons.The legal requirements are squishy about when a company must disclose a CEO’s ill health, and I don’t think that Oracle necessarily had an obligation to disclose Hurd’s condition. My default position, however, is that transparency is the best approach for a public company or a public institution. Candor is evidence that a company has a culture in which people do the right thing and that strong structures are in place to support good governance. Being upfront also avoids putting people in situations where they feel they need to lie to protect a colleague.A good rule of thumb is if you have to fudge excuses for an executive or an elected official missing official duties, or if there is gossip spreading about why an executive is scaling back his responsibilities for more than a short time, it’s time to open up about what’s wrong. Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday that Hurd handed off oversight over most of Oracle’s marketing team late last year, and Oracle officials gave different explanations over the past year and a half for why Hurd skipped events or why his appearance seemed to change.Given those circumstances, and the apparent rumblings about Hurd’s condition inside the company and among analysts, it should have been predictable that at some point the illness would either have to be made public or someone would make it public. Being upfront puts a company in control over when and how to disclose sensitive matters.When Warren Buffett announced in 2012 that he had early-stage prostate cancer and Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chairman and chief executive, did the same with a throat cancer diagnosis in 2014, the disclosures let them dictate the timing, form and message about their illness and how the company was handling it. The disclosures also squashed any rumors and diffused the inevitable second-guessing about when and whether the companies were obligated to make their executives’ health conditions public.To be fair, Oracle didn’t pull an Apple, a company that repeatedly dodged and misdirected about the cancer diagnosis and liver transplant of its chief executive, Steve Jobs. Oracle and Hurd didn’t lie publicly, nor is Hurd the equivalent of Jobs. He’s a hired hand—  a good one, to be sure — but not like Jobs, Buffett or Dimon, who are so closely tied to their companies’ identity and performance that a medical condition is unquestionably a material matter for shareholders.You may read this and say that people should be able to keep health problems private, no matter who they are or the positions they hold. We all handle serious illnesses differently, and if I were in Hurd’s shoes, I’m not sure how I would deal with a health crisis. I certainly wouldn’t want my family to read headlines about it.But one of the downsides of being a big company CEO or an elected official is the loss of some privacy and complete control over personal matters. No one should be forced to be an open book in all circumstances, but sometimes the good of the institution trumps the good of a single person. And in public companies or public institutions, transparency is a marker of stoutness. Once a company isn’t upfront about a difficult call like an executive’s illness, it plants a seed of doubt that it would be open about financial problems, troubles with key products or other important matters.Google has tended to obfuscate about health issues experienced by Larry Page, the company’s co-founder and CEO of parent company Alphabet Inc. As with Alphabet, Oracle’s lack of candor is an example of a company built on a weak foundation — and a tendency toward obfuscation doesn’t stop at health matters.Given the lack of transparency about Hurd, it is reasonable to wonder what would happen if Larry Ellison, Oracle’s founder and the person most closely identified with the company, had a serious illness. Could investors trust that Ellison and the board would make the right call about how to handle such a situation? Would Oracle have disclosed Hurd’s illness at all if its hand had not been forced by a news organization’s inquiries?It goes without saying that I wish the best for Hurd and his family. I empathize with people at Oracle who wanted to protect Hurd. That’s the horrible thing about openness. It’s sometimes in the best interest of the institution, but it can be a painful thing  to do. To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Oracle hit on expected EPS, but revenue was short of what analysts had been expecting. More alarming to investors, it was also announced that co-CEO Mark Hurd will be taking a leave of absence for unspecified health-related reasons.

Doing so can send a signal that the company is trying to avoid analyst scrutiny -- or at least delay it by catching them off guard. Oracle was expected to report its fiscal 2020 Q1 earnings on Thursday evening. Instead, the company pulled off a surprise Q1 earnings release after the bell on Wednesday.Earnings per share of 81 cents were in line with expectations, but the $9.22 billion in quarterly revenue was a gain of just 0.3% compared to Q1 2019 and missed analyst expectations. Guidance for Q2 was also lower than expected, setting up ORCL stock to take a hit.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlso noted in those earnings was confirmation that Oracle's board has approved an increase in share repurchases by an additional $15 billion, after spending $5 billion on buybacks during Q1.    * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession All in all, the market reaction to the Q1 earnings report was very different from last quarter when Oracle stock got a boost instead of taking a hit. Co-CEO Is Taking a Medical Leave of AbsenceAnother factor that almost always unsettles investors is an unexpected change in leadership at a company. And Oracle stock felt the effect of that issue on Thursday as well. During the Wednesday evening earnings call, it was announced that co-CEO Mark Hurd would be taking a leave of absence for an unspecified duration, for medical reasons.Hurd joined Oracle in 2010 after his tenure as CEO and president of HP (NASDAQ:HPQ) ended as a result of accusations of an inappropriate relationship with an assistant. In 2014, when Oracle founder Larry Ellison stepped down from the CEO position to become CTO, Hurd took the reins as co-CEO along with former Oracle CFO Safra Catz. During the time that Hurd and Catz have run the company, Oracle stock had seen roughly 45% growth. That is until yesterday, when the news sank in and ORCL Stock dropped 4.26%.During Hurd's absence, Oracle announced that Safra Catz will continue as CEO, with Larry Ellison also helping to cover his responsibilities. Oracle Stock Price Slightly Lagging MarketsSo far in 2019, Oracle stock is up 19% (with yesterday's drop factored in), which is not too bad all things considered. However, it's being outperformed by the broader markets: the Nasdaq Composite is up 23% while the S&P 500 has notched a 20% gain. Is Now the Time to Buy ORCL Stock?With Oracle stock closing on Thursday at $53.89, there is a case to be made that the market over-reacted to the company's announcements. On the other hand, when the Oracle stock price crossed the $60 threshold in early July, that was an all-time high for ORCL. If you look to market analysts, the 26 polled by CNN Business have a median 12-month price target for Oracle of $57.00 representing a bit of upside.If you were eying an Oracle investment after seeing the Oracle stock price pass $60 in July, but didn't want to buy at the peak, Thursday's drop can be looked at as a buying opportunity.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. gave a revenue forecast for the current period that fell short of Wall Street estimates, signaling slower sales growth for its newer marketing products.Revenue will be about $2.97 billion in the period ending in November, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts projected $3.02 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has made several acquisitions in the past two years for marketing and e-commerce products to boost revenue, which has climbed at least 20% each quarter since 2015. While the company has put more emphasis on corporate applications to compete with rivals Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp., it also recently unveiled new augmented reality and 3D-imaging technology to maintain its advantage as the leader in creative software such as its flagship product, Photoshop.Sales from Adobe’s experience cloud division, which includes marketing, analytics and e-commerce tools, are projected to increase 23% in the current period after climbing 34% in the fiscal third quarter. Executives said products gained from its 2018 acquisition of Marketo aren’t growing as fast as anticipated. Adobe plans to invest more money to boost sales in the unit, according to prepared remarks from Chief Financial Officer John Murphy.Murphy said Adobe also has had challenges generating bookings for its Analytics Cloud, which sits atop a new Experience Platform meant to connect clients’ data.

2019-09-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. unveiled an operating system that runs without the need for human oversight, part of a raft of new software tools meant to ease the company’s rocky transition to cloud computing.The operating system expands Oracle’s line of autonomous products beyond databases, the company’s flagship software. Chairman Larry Ellison announced the new Linux-based product Monday during remarks at OpenWorld, Oracle’s annual user conference in San Francisco.“If you eliminate human error in autonomous systems, you eliminate data theft,” Ellison said on stage. The feature makes Oracle’s products more secure than those sold by cloud leader Amazon Web Services, he said.Ellison said the operating system, which the company’s Autonomous Database runs on, will update itself without any downtime.The world’s second-largest software maker has sought to revive sales growth after years of almost stagnant revenue. Oracle hopes that a lineup of “self-driving” programs could help differentiate the company’s offerings against products from Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Those companies are the top two in the market to rent storage and computing power, which is projected to reach almost $39 billion in 2019. The tools may also entice longtime Oracle customers to upgrade their technology to take advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.Oracle disclosed last week that Mark Hurd, one of the company’s two chief executive officers, would take a leave of absence to treat an unspecified illness. Ellison and Oracle’s other CEO, Safra Catz, said they would fill in for Hurd, who has overseen the company’s sales and marketing efforts.The Redwood City, California-based company also announced a variety of changes and new programs to bolster its partner ecosystem:Oracle unveiled an agreement with VMware Inc. to bring virtualization software to Oracle’s cloud, similar to deals VMware has signed with Microsoft and Google.Customers will be able to buy software made by other companies in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace, which may help company partners including Cisco Systems Inc. and Palo Alto Networks Inc.Oracle also said it expanded a relationship with cybersecurity company McAfee Inc. to bring its security incident software to Oracle’s infrastructure cloud.Ellison said Oracle would offer a free version of its Cloud Infrastructure, giving developers, students and others perpetual access to the company’s autonomous database, computing and storage.The company plans to launch 20 additional cloud data-center hubs, called “regions,” by the end of 2020. Ellison said the company would have more regions around the world than AWS.Oracle will let customers run the autonomous database in their own data centers next year, and unveiled new servers with updated memory components from Intel Corp.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Unveils More Autonomous Software to Boost Cloud Growth

2019-09-18,"The headline &quot;The Stock-Buyback Swindle&quot; says it all. The Atlantic magazine's August issue had a story about how American companies are spending trillions on stock buybacks to enrich their CEOs. Much of the article's content has been covered extensively by business media -- both the pros and cons -- so I won't rehash the arguments. However, one of author Jerry Useem's paragraphs bears repeating because it hits at the core of the problem.&quot;Corporations describe the practice as an efficient way to return money to shareholders,&quot; Useem wrote. &quot;By reducing the number of shares outstanding in the market, a buyback lifts the price of each remaining share. But that spike is often short-lived: A study by the research firm Fortuna Advisors found that, five years out, the stocks of companies that engaged in heavy buybacks performed worse for shareholders than the stocks of companies that didn't.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've always believed that if a company wants to allocate its free cash flow to shareholders, it should do so by paying a special dividend, not by repurchasing shares or paying a regular dividend.   * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars Stock buybacks distort earnings growth while regular quarterly dividends ratchet up shareholder expectations. Neither is good for the long-term health of a business.

2019-09-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son, who built a $15.2 billion fortune investing in tech startups like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., is betting on himself more than ever, even as his empire shows signs of vulnerability.The SoftBank Group Corp. founder has pledged 38% of his stake in the Japanese firm as collateral for personal loans from 19 banks, including Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd., according to a June regulatory filing. That’s up from 36% at the start of the year and triple the level in June 2013.“It lets him monetize a large share of his wealth without foregoing influence over the firm,” said Michael Puleo, assistant professor of finance at Fairfield University’s Dolan School of Business in Connecticut. “But there’s an elevation of crash risk. If the share price falls low enough, he could get a margin call and that could be pretty costly.”The structure highlights the extent of Son’s exposure to SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund. Shares in the Japanese conglomerate have been rocked recently by the postponement of WeWork’s initial public offering. The delay came after the office-rental unicorn was being marketed at a steep discount to the $47 billion figure that the Tokyo-based conglomerate invested at earlier this year. That’s spooked investors, who’ve sent SoftBank’s shares down 4.6% this week through Thursday as the listing unraveled, knocking about $700 million off Son’s net worth. The stock has still advanced 26% this year.Son, 62, also has leveraged his stake in the Vision Fund, which invests in tech startups. That boosts his returns if things go well, with outsized losses if they don’t. Uber Technologies Inc.’s falling market capitalization and WeWork’s travails are set to dent the 62% return on the fund that SoftBank reported through March.“There is a danger in companies where the founder calls all the shots regardless of whether there are loans,” said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer with the MIT Sloan School of Management in Boston. “And when founders borrow a lot against their shares, they might be more tempted to make riskier decisions,” he said, adding that borrowing against 5% of one’s stake is usually considered prudentd.Pay OutSoftBank’s compensation plan also involves a lot of debt. Son loaned himself around $3 billion to invest in the first Vision Fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Using loans for a private investment compounds Son’s risk because he would be less able to bail himself out if things go south, Pozen said.The loan was swapped for equity in the fund and will generate profits when deals make money -- and losses when they don’t. Vision Fund employees, including high-profile bankers and investors, receive base salaries and bonuses, but only get payouts when profits are booked.It’s unclear how much of this compensation will be reported in SoftBank’s next annual report. Son’s pledged shares, which currently have a market value of $9 billion, are excluded from his net worth calculation by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. SoftBank spokeswoman Hiroe Kotera declined to comment.SoftBank is planning to lend as much as $20 billion to its employees to buy stakes in a second venture capital fund, the people said. Son may account for over half of the employee investment pool, they said.Ellison, MuskPledged shares have become an increasingly common way for founders to unlock the value of a stake without selling shares. Larry Ellison has a history of pledging Oracle Corp. stock to fund a lavish lifestyle, which includes trophy properties, America’s Cup teams and the Indian Wells tennis tournament. About 27% of his Oracle shares -- worth more than $16 billion -- are currently pledged. Elon Musk has pledged about 40% of his stake in Tesla Inc., according to a May 2019 filing.Still, the move comes with risks. “If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further,” Tesla warned in a filing.The risk-loving Son, who saw $70 billion wiped from his fortune in the dot-com crash, is unlikely to be fazed. He told shareholders at the company’s June meeting that SoftBank’s investment portfolio could grow 33-fold to 200 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion) in 20 years.(Updates Son’s net worth in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Pei Yi Mak, Sonali Basak, Ben Stupples and Venus Feng.To contact the reporters on this story: Giles Turner in London at gturner35@bloomberg.net;Tom Metcalf in London at tmetcalf7@bloomberg.net;Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill, Giles TurnerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Founder’s Empire Is Vulnerable to WeWork Woes

2019-09-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many of us have been fixated on WeWork’s struggle to go public and the disastrous post-IPO stock performance of high-profile startups Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. But as has often been true in the last few years, the tale is different for the unglamorous tech companies that are running circles around their cool peers.The latest example is Datadog Inc., which helps companies monitor the health of their apps and computing infrastructure; it sold its first batch of public stock late Wednesday. If you fell asleep reading the description, let me wake you up by saying that the company’s most recent pre-IPO investors(1) have a nearly 1,100% gain on their shares in less than four years,(2)according to figures from EquityZen, a marketplace for private stock sales. The earliest Datadog stock buyers from 2011 have a nearly 50,000% gain.In a non-systematic look at more than a dozen other tech companies that have gone public in the past couple of years, the stock gain for Datadog’s pre-IPO investors is at or near the top of the leader board. Repeatedly, the less-buzzy startups like Datadog that sell cloud-subscription software to businesses have been the ones that deliver the goods for early backers. There have been exceptions, but companies like Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc. — the coolest of the Zzzz crowd — have tended to produce strong returns for pre-IPO investors, and their public shares have typically done well, too.Investors, both public and private, love these software-as-a-service companies. Generally their technology is better than anything that came before — if there was an old-guard technology with similar functions — and once businesses use the software and stitch it together with email, calendars, information databases and other corporate systems, it can be tough to ditch. If they’re managed properly, these business software companies can grow fast and predictably.Among the tech companies that have gone public on U.S. stock exchanges since the beginning of 2018, nine of the top 10 by stock gains from their IPO price are software companies that sell to businesses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. (No. 1 is Zscaler Inc., whose share price has more than tripled since its March 2018 IPO, despite a recent drop.)What are the lessons here? Well, not surprisingly, it may be that the consumer-oriented tech companies with lots of attention as startups may be great companies but not necessarily great investments if the hype leads to overvaluation. That’s particularly true — as in the cases of Uber, Lyft and WeWork — when public company investors are far more dubious than private investors about companies with unproven business models and unsteady financial metrics. The other lesson may be that you’re in luck if you founded a company in a sector like business software that, at least for now, is the apple of investors’ eyes. I have my doubts about how long these software-as-a-service companies can stay viable. When there is an economic downturn and companies take a hard look at what they’re spending on technology, there are going to be software bills they can live without. That swings the advantage to the big software supermarkets like Oracle, Microsoft and Amazon, which can offer companies discounts on a range of technologies. Some young business software companies are also spending big to grow in a way that may not be sustainable, and their corners of the market may not be as big as optimists expect. These young cloud software companies are also priced for growth to the point where they are vulnerable to any hiccup in customer acquisition numbers or revenue gains. That has happened recently, when companies like Zscaler, Alteryx Inc., PagerDuty Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and New Relic Inc. reported wobbly financial results, changes in management or were just infected by worries from other companies in their sector. Still, Datadog shows the benefit of being the right kind of business at the right time. Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Cisco Systems Inc. approached Datadog recently with a takeover offer significantly higher than the $7 billion valuation it had been shooting for in an IPO. (As of Thursday’s early stock market trades, Datadog is valued at about $11 billion, excluding the value of shares held by employees and others.)Datadog was apparently confident enough in its prospects to turn that down and opt to go public. The uncool companies truly are that cool.A version of this column originally appeared in Bloomberg’s Fully Charged technology newsletter.

Other stock buyers included Index Ventures, OpenView Ventures, Amplify Partners and Contour Ventures, Datadog announced in early 2016.(2) I will say that it's unusual for tech startups these days to go public without selling stock or doing other cash collections in the four years before an IPO.

2019-09-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Steve Schwarzman has doubts. So does Larry Ellison.And so, too, do the growing numbers of Wall Street bankers and investors who are all anxiously awaiting the next move by WeWork and its brash co-founder, Adam Neumann.Neumann was a no-show this week for a long-planned appearance at a SoftBank Group Corp. three-day retreat in Pasadena, California, according to people familiar with the the matter, a further sign that company executives are hunkering down. Once the WeWork initial public offering was postponed late Monday, organizers knew Neumann’s presence would be iffy, the people said. His planned appearance was rescheduled from the first day of the event at the Langham hotel to the last and then canceled altogether.In short order Neumann’s office-sharing company has gone from a get-rich story to a you’ve-got-to-be-joking melodrama -- from WeWork to WeWait to, now, WeWorry.On Sunday, it was reported that some WeWork board members supported removing Neumann as CEO and making him non-executive chairman. CNBC said Softbank chief Masayoshi San supported removing him. It was a brutal week. First, WeWork’s parent company, We Co., finally conceded that its grandiose plans for going public would have to wait.Then Schwarzman, one of the most powerful figures on Wall Street, threw shade on the company’s hoped-for valuation, which has already collapsed from upwards of $60 billion to $15 billion -- or lower.“I sort of went, what? How do you get this?” Schwarzman, the head of private equity giant Blackstone Group Inc., said of the early numbers Wednesday at a luncheon in New York. Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., went further, according to Barron’s. He told a group of entrepreneurs at his San Francisco home that day that WeWork is “almost worthless.”And it only gets worse. In London, two deals for major office buildings that are largely leased out to WeWork started to fray. Back in its hometown of New York, the company made a small round of job cuts. And the Wall Street Journal, examining WeWork’s over-the-top culture, reported that Neumann and his friends smoked marijuana on a private jet en route to Israel last summer -- and left a chunk of the drug behind, spurring the plane’s owner to summon it back.If all that weren’t enough, Neumann’s own bankers were getting antsy: They were looking to revise a $500 million credit line secured by WeWork stock -- an acknowledgment that those shares appear far less solid than they used to.New RisksAnd, by Friday, Wendy Silverstein, a big name in New York commercial real estate who joined WeWork last year as head of its property investment arm, had left the company. She’s spending time caring for her elderly parents.Even the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston was adding to the angst. In a speech Friday in New York, Eric Rosengren warned that the proliferation of co-working spaces might pose new risks to financial stability.A WeWork representative declined to comment on Neumann’s canceled appearance at the SoftBank conference, citing the pre-IPO quiet period. SoftBank also declined to comment.Rarely has so much gone so wrong so fast for a young company in the spotlight. Neumann has begrudgingly agreed to cede some of his powers. The question now: Will that be enough?“I’ve never seen a company of this size and scale generate such a consensus of negative opinion in my long, long life of following IPOs,” said Len Sherman, a Columbia Business School adjunct professor whose 30-year business career included time as a senior partner at consulting firm Accenture Plc. “There is no box that they haven’t ticked when you think of all the reasons that you might be very concerned -- like blaring red lights. Like, oh my gosh, caution, danger, danger.”WeWork now hopes to go public next month. But even that may be optimistic. Neumann, also We Co.’s chief executive officer, has to persuade investors that his company -- which has raised more than $12 billion since its founding and never turned a nickel of profit -- is worth billions on the stock market.Deadline LoomsTime is short. WeWork must complete its IPO before the end of the year to keep access to a crucial $6 billion loan.The company’s $669 million of bonds due in 2025 have dropped 5 cents this week to 97.75 cents on the dollar as of Thursday, according to the Trace bond-price reporting system.A few hours after the Journal story hit Wednesday, investors at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. conference in New York heard from Snap Inc.’s Evan Spiegel -- Neumann’s predecessor as a celebrated startup founder whose behavior and company control attracted unflattering attention as the unicorn went public in 2017.He was asked what advice he’d give to founders looking to become CEOs of companies that have to answer to shareholders. His answer:“Don’t go public.”(Updates with board members suggesting Neumann’s removal.)&#92;--With assistance from Gillian Tan, Matthew Boesler and Sarah McBride.To contact the reporters on this story: Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.net;Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.net;Gwen Everett in New York at geverett10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-09-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Years before he stepped down as chief executive officer of WeWork amid the wreckage of an over-hyped public offering, Adam Neumann was hosting an industry leader for an early lunch at the company's headquarters. It was the summer of 2017, and he brought the person over to the office of one of his deputies, Artie Minson. “This is Artie,” Neumann said. “He’s the adult in the room.”On Tuesday, Neumann resigned as CEO of We Co., WeWork’s parent company, and took the role of non-executive chairman, succumbing to mounting pressure from his board to relinquish power. The campaign to get Neumann to step aside came on the heels of reports of self-dealing and other governance issues that caused public investors to spurn the company, sending its expected valuation tumbling by billions of dollars.  Neumann has been replaced by Minson and another WeWork executive, Sebastian Gunningham, who are now co-CEOs of the troubled co-working giant. The two men, both with years of public company experience in various roles—but scant background in real estate—will seek to bring order to the chaos that has surrounded WeWork’s botched IPO.Insiders describe Minson, an accountant by training who is said to have a dry sense of humor, as the opposite of the extroverted Neumann, who is a natural showman with a propensity for lofty rhetoric. But Minson has a history with the company, having worked closely with Neumann for four years, most recently as the company’s chief financial officer. Gunningham, WeWork’s vice chairman, spent years at Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. before joining the startup.Now, the pair will be tasked with rallying WeWork’s employees, all of whom are accustomed to stagecraft from a charismatic founder with a penchant for hiring famous musicians to perform at company functions. And they must also soothe anxious investors, leery of the company’s huge expenses, its history of unconventional governance structures and persistent inability to turn a profit.“It is an incredible honor to lead WeWork during this important moment in the company’s history,” the two men said in a joint statement. “Our core business is strong, and we will be taking clear actions to balance WeWork’s high growth, profitability and unique member experience while also evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.”On that summer morning in 2017, after he introduced Minson as the resident adult, Neumann and the visiting executive went back to Neumann’s office, where the CEO went on to say he himself had matured, according to a person familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. “You might have heard I like a shot of tequila in meetings,” Neumann said. “But I like to think I’ve grown up.”Instead of tequila, Neumann produced two bottles of single-malt scotch whiskey and meted out small shots. It was before noon.The AccountantArtie Minson, according to a person familiar with the company, is a polished executive who represents a “sober choice” for WeWork. Minson studied accounting at Georgetown University and earned his master’s in business administration from Columbia Business School. As an accountant, he worked at Ernst & Young before starting work in the media industry.Minson did a tour of New York media companies. That included work at Time Warner Inc. and at Rainbow Media Holdings Inc., where he was the senior vice president for finance. Later, as the CFO of AOL Inc., he oversaw that company's successful spinoff from Time Warner in 2009, following their 2000 merger. His last job before WeWork was as CFO of Time Warner Cable, which he left shortly after Charter Communications Inc. agreed to buy the company for $56 billion under his watch.Minson arrived at WeWork in 2015, starting out as the company’s president and chief operating officer, later becoming its CFO. He has acted as a close aide to Neumann, alongside Jen Berrent, WeWork’s chief operating officer.Despite Minson’s numbers-heavy background, he still has “the salesman capability,” said one person who knows Minson but who asked not to be identified speaking about private interactions. Minson would often crack jokes when talking with the investors and analysts at Time Warner Cable, the person said, and was more personable than a typical CFO.He’s “gregarious,” the person said, while remaining “very numbers- and operations-oriented,” making him a “solid person” to counterbalance Neumann’s ephemeral persona.A Tech VeteranAmazon veteran Gunningham represents the technical chops of the new executive team. He arrived at WeWork last year, after spending more than a decade at the retail giant, where he held a senior vice president role in which he reported directly to Jeff Bezos.  Gunningham grew up in Argentina and speaks fluent Spanish. He earned an undergraduate degree in math from Stanford University in 1985 and in 1989, he joined Oracle. Gunningham rose through the company’s ranks to run its Latin American division, based in Miami, before leaving to join Apple Inc. There, he helped the company break into corporate computing.It wasn’t all tech giants for Gunningham, though. He also ran a company called Peace Software that specialized in managing billing for utilities, and sold it to First Data Corp. in 2006. He joined Amazon the following year, back when the company still had a relatively flat structure. There, he built a sprawling organization to manage Amazon’s fast-growing third-party marketplace business. Later, he was responsible for implementing automation that made much of that operation obsolete.James Thomson, a partner at Buy Box Experts, who previously worked for Gunningham at Amazon, said his first reaction on hearing his old boss would be running WeWork was, &quot;Oh, finally there's an adult at the company.&quot; At Amazon, he recalls Gunningham as a formidable executive who typically seemed to know more about each manager's business group than the manager did—and asked sharp questions at meetings.In one meeting, Gunningham asked Thomson, who was behind on his goals for recruiting third-party sellers, if he had looked into using different types of search ads; Thomson hadn't. In another meeting two weeks later, Gunningham brought up the idea again, and Thomson said hadn’t had time to check. Gunningham said that he’d done his own research and came with thoughts on which types of ads to pursue and how.&quot;Everyone in the room is like, 'Damn, you got called out,'&quot; Thomson said. But Gunningham typically delivered the feedback in a calm, factual way, and wasn’t usually admonishing, Thomson said, making him well-liked among the rank and file.Despite his enormous personal wealth, Gunningham dressed casually. &quot;It was the same clothes as us, just really nice versions,&quot; Thomson recalled, noting the executive's premium jeans.Gunningham is said to have adopted some of the leadership tactics of Jeff Bezos, who famously asks employees to silently read “narratively structured six-page memos” at the beginning of meetings. Gunningham would ask for business proposals presented as written narratives, and could drill into the details. By the time he left Amazon, was in the top rung of management under, and was a key Bezos lieutenant.  In a letter to employees on Tuesday, Gunningham and Minson laid out how they would divide the roles of the chief executive. Minson will oversee finance, legal, human resources, real estate and communications functions, as well as corporate development, partnerships and ventures. Gunningham will focus on areas including WeWork’s product, technology, design and marketing. As the pair work to prepare WeWork for another run at the public markets, they vowed to “closely review all aspects of our company” and said they anticipated “difficult decisions ahead.” In the letter the co-CEOs implored employees to keep their focus on on WeWork’s customers and on their “day-to-day work,” adding “it’s more important now than ever.”(Adds detail on Gunningham’s management style)&#92;--With assistance from Spencer Soper and Ellen Huet.To contact the authors of this story: Sarah McBride in San Francisco at smcbride24@bloomberg.netGillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.netMatt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netMichelle Davis in New York at mdavis194@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Tom GilesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",WeWork Gets Two New CEOs: “This Is Artie. He’s the Adult in the Room”

2019-09-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google hired the top aide to Republican Senator Rob Portman to head its Washington policy operation, filling a key post as the internet search giant confronts escalating regulatory threats.Mark Isakowitz, who was Portman’s chief of staff, will be in charge of government affairs and public policy in the U.S. and Canada, according to a Google announcement Friday. He replaces Susan Molinari, who took an advisory role after resigning the position last year.“I am very excited to join a company that is constantly innovating, creating opportunity, and helping the American economy grow,” Isakowitz said in the statement. “I look forward to working with policy makers and others to help promote responsible innovation and the internet economy.”He will report to the company’s global policy chief, Karan Bhatia, who said Isakowitz brings “serious policy knowledge, and an impressive record of bridging divides and achieving results.”Google is grappling with escalating scrutiny from federal, congressional and state antitrust officials. The Justice Department and 50 state attorneys general are conducting broad investigations, while a House panel probing the technology sector has also zeroed in on the company.Bhatia joined Google last year after overseeing global affairs at General Electric Co. A former deputy U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush, Bhatia at one point circulated an empty organizational chart with his name at the top and blank boxes representing all open positions reporting to him, prompting staffers to fear for their jobs, Bloomberg reported.Resources AddedEarlier in the year, he reshuffled Google’s approach to global policy and added more resources to antitrust, privacy and emerging markets in response to policy makers who are increasingly focused on issues that would affect the company’s core businesses. Molinari, a former Republican New York congresswoman, is among several top policy officials to exit. Ross LaJeunesse, Google’s global head of international relations, also departed and Adam Kovacevich, former director of public policy, announced in April he was leaving to join Lime, an electric scooter and bike company.Portman, who is from Ohio, led the successful push to limit tech platforms’ liability protections for third-party content in cases of sex trafficking -- an effort that represented one of Google’s fiercest battles in recent years and most stinging defeats.“Mark is a great friend and a superb leader, and I will miss his counsel that I have relied on over the past five years,” Portman said in a statement.Isakowitz joined Portman’s office in 2014.

2019-10-11,"(Bloomberg) -- The young woman in Monica Mazzei’s San Francisco law office was adamant: She wanted a prenuptial agreement.Never mind that the client had barely anything to her name. What she had was a bunch of startup ideas. She and her fiancé, who already had his own small tech company, signed a prenup with clear terms, Mazzei said: “The spouse who has an idea [and] starts a business ‘owns’ that business. It’s their baby.”A few years later, Mazzei, a partner at Sideman Bancroft, was traveling through the San Francisco airport when she saw her former client on a magazine cover. Her startup had struck gold. Her husband’s business had fizzled.In Silicon Valley, where penniless programmers fervently believe their ideas are worth billions, getting rich can take priority over getting married. California law assumes that any wealth created during a marriage is community property, which should be split equally in a divorce. That’s alarming not just for young entrepreneurs but also their investors.Divorce HavocFortunately, a well-written prenup is a safeguard against post-divorce havoc, which is why more and more young couples are insisting on the agreements, according to more than half-a-dozen lawyers in the Bay Area and elsewhere. Long popular with older wealthy couples who re-marry, prenups are also being demanded by entrepreneurs who want to keep future windfalls to themselves.“I am seeing more and more young people want to enter into prenuptial agreements who do not currently have a lot of money now but plan to have a lot of money someday,” said Manhattan-based divorce attorney Jacqueline Newman.In a 2016 survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, 3 in 5 divorce attorneys said more clients were seeking prenups in the past three years. About half said they’d seen a spike in the number of millennials requesting the agreements.“People’s concepts and notions of fairness when it comes to privately held businesses are changing,” said Mazzei, adding she’s seen “a tremendous increase” in prenups in the past eight years. “They feel that even if they’re married, this is their passion. The agreement should be reflective of that.”‘It’s Complicated’Today’s startup founders have plenty of prenup-writing forebears to emulate. Google co-founder Sergey Brin and Anne Wojcicki, who helped found personal genomics company 23andMe, had a prenup when they married in 2007. After they divorced with little fanfare in 2015, his stake in Google remained unchanged.“It’s complicated -- that’s all I can say,” Wojcicki told Bloomberg TV about the split.Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison has been married and divorced multiple times, but none affected his stake in the software company. Ellison is the seventh-richest person in the world with a net worth of $59.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Still, a prenup hardly guarantees a smooth divorce. Judges can and do throw out the agreements, especially if they’re drafted poorly. “If you don’t put in the right language, a lot of prenups don’t do the job,” said Lowell Sucherman, a divorce attorney at Sucherman Insalaco in San Francisco.In 2017, One Kings Lane co-founder Alison Gelb Pincus, wife of Zynga Inc. founder Mark Pincus, challenged their premarital agreement in court while the couple was getting a divorce, according to a court filing. It’s unclear whether she prevailed as final terms of the divorce aren’t public.While venture capital firms don’t explicitly require prenups, they do demand legal language protecting their investments in the event a divorce court hands a chunk of a founder’s shares to an ex-spouse. So do other co-founders.Founders’ Control“Founders have wanted to ensure that someone else can’t suddenly come in and obtain some sort of founders’ control,” said Par-Jorgen Parson, a partner at venture capital firm Northzone, who has served on the board of Spotify Technology SA. “It’s just as often driven by the founders as by external investors. You don’t want to rock the balance of power.”Venture capital firms often demand that founders’ husbands and wives sign “spousal consent” forms. Such agreements determine who gets to vote for board members, and how and when shares can be sold. In the event of a divorce settlement (or death or disability), a founders’ spouse might end up with company shares. But, the agreements ensure that an ex can’t exercise much, if any, control over the company post-divorce.“We’re trying to make sure that people don’t become involuntary business partners with someone they don’t know, don’t like or who aren’t qualified,” said James Ficenec, a partner at Newmeyer & Dillion in Walnut Creek, California.Divorcing founders will often do anything to avoid handing over half of their shares in their startup.‘Keeping More’“Founders will try to negotiate keeping more of their shares,” said Michael Gorback, a partner at Hanson Bridgett. “You might balance it out some other way,” by paying exes in cash, a home or other investments.MacKenzie Bezos and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos divorced earlier this year, leaving her with a 4% stake and a net worth of $34.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg index. He kept 75% of the couple’s Amazon shares, and retains voting control of those she does hold.Amazon’s stock, of course, is publicly traded, which can make divorce negotiations easier.“One issue we come across very often is, ‘How do you value a startup?’” Mazzei said. Years before an initial public offering, a startup might have no profits or even revenue to speak of. A promising company could later go under -- or eventually be worth billions.Trust, CredibilityIn a divorce, “it can be quite difficult when you have a large asset that is illiquid,” said Lyssa Grimaldo, a wealth manager at San Francisco-based Wetherby Asset Management and a certified divorce financial analyst. Adding to the problem, she said: “One partner knows more about that asset than the other.”With enough billable hours, lawyers can usually sort out the legal ramifications of divorce. They’re less helpful in containing the chaos that a founder’s marital problems might create in the workplace or business relationships.“We have companies where the founder is the brand, and trust and credibility are core to the business,” said Ed Zimmerman, partner and chair of the tech group at Lowenstein Sandler in New York. “If you are investing in a company because you think the founder is amazing,” it can be alarming to learn that he or she is facing the distraction of an acrimonious divorce or custody battle, he said.If a divorce isn’t disclosed to key investors, they can lose trust in a founder who they thought they knew well. Then there’s sometimes other nasty fallout, of the sort that companies are increasingly sensitive to in the metoo era.“It would be great if we lived in a world where people who had marital problems didn’t manifest those problems by hitting on or dating people who worked at their company,” Zimmerman said. “Those kinds of things tend to be more problematic than who gets the shares.”(Updates with adviser’s comment in 23rd paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Steverman in New York at bsteverman@bloomberg.net;Anders Melin in New York at amelin3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill, Peter EichenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",A Prenup Is the Latest Must-Have for Tech Startup Founders in Love
2019-10-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With ambitious profitability goals, a business in flux and an activist investor hammering at the door, SAP SE Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott’s time was up. His successors’ skill sets look better suited to meeting those challenges.After nine years at the helm of Europe’s largest technology company – five as sole CEO, four as co-chief – the American manager stepped down on Thursday, replaced by two new co-CEOs: Chief Operating Officer Christian Klein and cloud chief Jennifer Morgan.McDermott’s tenure was largely impressive. Through $31 billion of deals, SAP entered a string of new businesses, and generated good value for shareholders. Annual returns averaged 15% under his leadership, compared to the 12% average of European technology firms. Since he took sole control in 2014, the returns have been even higher, and the market capitalization has doubled to almost 140 billion euros ($155 billion).Even with that growth, however, many still see the stock as undervalued: SAP trades at 21 times expected earnings, while new cloud software players such as ServiceNow Inc. trade at a multiple of 65 times. That’s partly because of some of McDermott’s operational shortcomings, not least a failure to integrate many of the acquisitions effectively and to get customers to buy into SAP’s cloud products fast enough.  SAP’s clients feel they’re at a disadvantage in their digital transformation efforts to competitors who use products from SAP’s rivals, according to an industry body called the DSAG that represents SAP users in the German-speaking world. One major complaint is a failure of SAP to get its new offerings in the same coding language, creating additional work for their clients to get it all working together. As a result, only third of its 3,500 members trust the Walldorf, Germany-based company to accompany them well on the journey, the group told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper in September.The road ahead looks rocky. In April Elliott Management Corp., the activist fund controlled by the billionaire Paul Singer, revealed it had built a 1% stake in the maker of enterprise software and demanded a halt to any new dealmaking. It’s targeting an increase in earnings per share that will likely require a buyback of as much as 10% of the stock. SAP simultaneously announced it intends to improve profitability by 5 percentage points through 2023, with a focus on a better gross margin at the cloud business.The new CEOs therefore seem the logical picks. Klein is probably expected to bring the improved focus on operations needed to deliver the profit goal, and Morgan the cloud experience needed to accelerate the so far torpid adoption of its products in that market. Having been later than some U.S. competitors to pivot toward a cloud-based business, SAP is now migrating its customers away from software run on their own premises, and into its cloud offerings. Oracle Corp. sees the shift as an opportunity to steal customers from its German rival.The push has come at the expense of SAP’s profitability, which lags the level of peers such as Oracle. McDermott already announced a major restructuring program that includes 4,000 job cuts. Another set of measures will be unveiled at an investor day in New York next month. The timing of the management change therefore gives shareholders a prime opportunity to meet the new team. They will need reassurance that Klein in particular, who at 39 will be the youngest chief executive officer in Germany’s benchmark DAX Index, can seamlessly manage the operational challenges such change inevitably poses. Cost-saving pushes can generate significant uncertainty.McDermott’s departure does perhaps dispel any lingering doubt about who is really in charge at SAP: co-founder and Chairman Hasso Plattner. The 75-year-old looms large in the corridors of SAP’s headquarters in Walldorf. Thursday’s leadership picks mark the culmination of a wave of board changes which also saw former cloud chief Robert Enslin and digital services head Bernd Leukert depart in the past year. When, a few years ago, the company started developing its “digital boardroom,” a web portal that lets managers dig into the finest details of the company’s operations and evaluate earnings in real time, it was because Plattner asked for it, not McDermott.As successful as McDermott was, his shortcomings also made the company more vulnerable to an activist approach. If Elliott were to push for SAP to be carved up, that would endanger Plattner’s legacy. Morgan and Klein now have to knuckle down on delivering that profitability goal. Their boss’s place in the history books is at stake.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2019-10-11,"Unlike archrival Oracle, SAP is reporting solid top-line growth and is comfortable breaking out its cloud revenue.",SAP's Revenue Growth - and Transparency - Compares Favorably with Oracle's
2019-10-11,Investing.com - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) rose by 3.21% to trade at $57.27 by 13:26 (17:26 GMT) on Friday on the NYSE exchange.,Oracle Rises 3%
2019-10-11,"(Bloomberg) -- SAP SE is sticking to its new plan of keeping the company youthful, and top management isn’t being spared.The storied German software giant, Europe’s biggest tech company by market value, has spent the past few years attempting to reinvent itself. It’s working to adapt its corporate software, used by almost all of the world’s 100 most valuable brands, to the web and is taking on younger rivals in cloud-based computing.There’s also been an exodus of company veterans, which as of 12:44 a.m. Friday in Walldorf, included CEO Bill McDermott.Analysts have called the late-night news a surprise; McDermott’s contract doesn’t run out until 2021. He also unveiled a major restructuring plan in April and was expected to brief investors on the company’s strategy next month.But, as he said on a conference call after the announcement, “Ten years is a long time to be CEO.”McDermott, 58, had been with the company since 2002 when he joined as head of its North American business. At the time, he was that unit’s fourth head in three years as SAP struggled to compete with rivals like Oracle Corp., and grappled with a drop in sales of software licenses. Problems with its products were blamed for delayed shipments of Whirlpool Corp.’s appliances and even Hershey’s Halloween chocolates.In the role, he recruited a new management team, changed the way the sales department targeted customers, and ultimately boosted sales growth. When CEO Leo Apotheker unexpectedly resigned in 2010, McDermott and product-development head Jim Snabe were picked to replace him as co-CEOs. Snabe -- currently chairman of Siemens AG -- stepped down and took a spot on the board in 2014, and McDermott became sole head of the company.With nearly 100,000 employees and a sprawling business that generated about $27 billion in revenue last year, driving change has sometimes been controversial. Since 2011, McDermott spent $26 billion on six major cloud acquisitions, and was the main advocate for the $8 billion acquisition of Qualtrics International Inc., the company’s largest-ever deal.Analysts criticized the purchase as too expensive. In November, Qualtrics said it expected revenue for 2018 to exceed $400 million, a figure that wouldn’t move the needle much for SAP. McDermott defended the deal, believing that combining SAP’s sales force and a trove of operational data with Qualtrics’s customer experience feedback would accelerate growth.More recently, the company attracted the interest of activists at Elliott Management Corp., which revealed its 1.2 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) stake when SAP announced a change in strategy in April. SAP had been vague at the time, saying it planned “new initiatives to accelerate operational excellence and value creation” with a focus on “tuck-in” acquisitions.SAP underwent a management shakeup in the weeks preceding the April announcement. The president of its cloud business, 27-year SAP veteran Robert Enslin, had announced his departure earlier that month. It was later revealed he’d left for Google. A day earlier, Chief Technology Officer Bjoern Goerke, another cloud expert based in the U.S., penned a blog post saying he was leaving the company he joined as a student in 1988. Board member Bernd Leukert, a seasoned IT executive, left SAP in February.Personally, McDermott also had to weather a near-fatal accident in 2015 that cost him an eye when he fell down some stairs while carrying a water glass and nearly bled to death.His replacements are a mix of old and new guard at SAP. Christian Klein, 39, spent the past 20 years at SAP, after joining as a student in 1999. Jennifer Morgan, 48, arrived in 2004 and was the first American woman on the company’s executive board. Morgan has been seen as McDermott’s protege, rising relatively quickly through the ranks, and most recently served as the president of the all-important cloud group.Together, Klein and Morgan will have to find a way to compete with younger companies like Salesforce.com Inc. and Workday Inc. while encumbered by a traditional enterprise software business.Cloud is the company’s clear growth engine, with revenue increasing about 32% last year to about 5 billion euros. Sales from its largest business, which helps clients set up and implement SAP’s software, grew less than 1% in 2019.McDermott’s resignation was announced alongside better-than-expected preliminary third-quarter earnings results. New bookings for the company’s cloud products, a key metric that indicates future sales, grew 33% on a constant-currency business. That was more than double the pace set in the second quarter, when disappointed investors sent shares down as much as 10%.“While it is a shock to see Mr. McDermott stepping down, he is clearly handing over the reins of the business from a position of strength and we are encouraged to see that his replacements are long-term members of the SAP executive team,” said Thomas Fitzgerald, fund manager at SAP shareholder Edentree Investment Management, in a note on Friday.&#92;--With assistance from Stefan Nicola.To contact the reporters on this story: Amy Thomson in London at athomson6@bloomberg.net;Kit Rees in London at krees1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Nate LanxonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",SAP’s an Old Company With New Tricks in Battle to Dominate Cloud
2019-10-11,"(Bloomberg) -- SAP SE named executives Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein as the successors to Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott, who’s stepping down after leading Europe’s largest software company during a decade of major industry changes.The two SAP veterans will become co-CEOs effective immediately, the company said Thursday in a statement. McDermott, 58, will remain at the company in an advisory role through the end of the year.Shares of SAP rose as much as 8.4% in Frankfurt on Friday, the most since April, and are up 31% for the year.Morgan, 48, who joined SAP in 2004, most recently served as president of the software giant’s cloud business group. She became the first American woman appointed to SAP’s executive board in 2017 when she was named president of the Americas and Asia. Klein, 39, joined SAP as a student in 1999 and has been chief operating officer since April 2016, and on the executive board since 2018.McDermott’s departure was unexpected, but the new co-CEOs were on investors’ “short-list” to take over in future, Citigroup analysts including Walter Pritchard said in a note.“The decision was made based on my determination that 10 years is a long time to be CEO,” McDermott said on a conference call after the announcement. “You get to the point when you have done what you set out to do and then some.”McDermott joined Walldorf, Germany-based SAP in 2002 and was the first American to hold the CEO position at the firm. He embraced cloud computing, changing the way SAP sold software so customers could use it over the internet. He’s been transitioning the company through acquisitions and revamped products, challenging rivals Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp.While SAP had pledged to triple cloud revenue by 2023, the effort has shown mixed results and the company has pushed to shore up profit margins with the support of activist investor Elliott Management.Earlier, SAP reported preliminary third-quarter revenue and profit that topped analysts’ estimates. Cloud bookings, a key metric in the company’s transition, increased 33% on a constant currency basis, more than double the pace of the second quarter, the company said.SAP’s 3Q results “will likely be received positively and we’d expect will drive a relief in shares,” Citi said in its note.McDermott cited the strong results as a reason for the timing of the leadership change, saying he wanted to give his successors the reins while the company is at “maximum strength.”Morgan said she was only three hours into her tenure so didn’t know what changes she might push for, but expressed optimism in the leadership structure.“I’m a very big believer that when two people come together, you can really get a lot done,” she said on the conference call.McDermott said he was uncertain about his future plans.“I will do something at some point,” he said. “But today’s SAP’s day. There is no doubt in my mind the future of SAP is even brighter now.”(Updates with comments, context and shares throughout.)&#92;--With assistance from Joe Easton.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",SAP Makes Surprise Leadership Change as CEO McDermott Steps Down

2019-10-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Hurd, who was chief executive officer of three major technology companies including Oracle Corp., has died. He was 62.Most recently Hurd was co-CEO at Oracle with Safra Catz where he focused on sales, marketing and press and investor relations, while she ran finances and legal matters. Oracle announced on Sept. 11 that Hurd had begun a leave of absence for unspecified health-related reasons and that Catz and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison would assume his responsibilities during his leave. The company didn’t disclose a cause of death Friday.“It is with a profound sense of sadness and loss that I tell everyone here at Oracle that Mark Hurd passed away early this morning,” Ellison wrote in an online post. “Mark was my close and irreplaceable friend, and trusted colleague. Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle.”Hurd began his career in 1980 as a salesman for National Cash Register Corp. (now NCR), before rising in the ranks to the CEO post. In 2005, he was hired away as CEO by Hewlett-Packard Co., then the world’s biggest personal-computer maker. Hurd joined Oracle as a co-president in 2010, after resigning from HP following a sexual-harassment probe. While an internal investigation didn’t find a violation of the company’s sexual-harassment policy, it concluded that he violated company standards by filing inaccurate expense reports to conceal a personal relationship with a contractor.During his Oracle tenure, Hurd produced solid revenue and profits as the Redwood City, California-based company’s stock price hit a historic high in 2019. He was also a key driver in Oracle’s turn from an old model of licensing software toward the use of cloud computing, a burgeoning business dominated by rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.When he hired Hurd, Ellison said, “There is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark.” Ellison described Hurd’s dismissal by HP as the “worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs.”Transformed SalesforceHurd reshaped Oracle’s salesforce. Beginning in 2013, he implemented a “specialist” model that made each member an expert in a single product category. In that year alone, he hired more than 4,000 people to implement his idea.He also created the “Class of” program that was designed to inject a startup feel into Oracle. College graduates were hired for a dedicated program that prepared them to become Oracle’s future sales leaders.In 2014, Hurd and Catz were named co-CEOs, while Ellison continued to serve as chairman of the board, orchestrate management changes and develop products as chief technology officer.Hurd was regarded as the most media-friendly of the trio, frequently serving as the public face of the company to outline its goals. At the time Hurd and Catz were named CEOs, Oracle’s central business was selling software designed to run on gear owned by the customer and charging a license fee. Hurd was among those inside Oracle who saw the company’s future in cloud computing -- which would let customers rent software and run their data on servers owned by vendors such as Oracle. He predicted in 2015 that by 2025 all enterprise data would be stored in the cloud and that 100% of software development and testing would run through it.Today, the company is much less ambitious in its cloud efforts, and has been making smaller promises. In June, Oracle said it would partner with Microsoft, a decades-long rival, to connect the two companies’ cloud services, so customers can use Oracle databases or applications tied to Microsoft’s Azure cloud. While Catz said Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, wanted an alliance to give clients access to Oracle’s AI-driven databases, the move was a concession—signaling Oracle knew it could no longer go at it alone.It’s now Catz who will have to go it alone, at least for now. Some analysts expect the company will move to appoint a new partner soon. “It’s much more manageable to have two CEOs, so we would be surprised if Oracle goes back to one CEO going forward,” said John Barrett, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service. “The larger question is how Oracle will go about searching for the co-CEO role and how quickly they can find a successor.”The succession will likely come from within the company’s deep bench. One option is Jeff Henley, Oracle’s vice chairman and former chief financial officer, according to Abby Adlerman, CEO of Boardspan, which provides software and services to address board governance. “I think from a succession planning perspective, they are in a much better place than most companies. They have a lot of options.” Ellison will likely stay close and in the long term, “it’s a matter of if Safra wants to go at it alone. It’s such a big company that there was a reason for the co-CEO role.”Ellison has mentioned Don Johnson, head of Oracle’s cloud infrastructure division, and Steve Miranda, head of Oracle’s applications unit, as possible partners to Catz in the future.Growth StrategyHurd led the charge to make Oracle one of the dominant cloud players, investing heavily in research and development and acquisitions, such as the $9.3 billion purchase of NetSuite Inc., sometimes called the first cloud company, in 2016. Oracle also bought Eloqua Inc., a marketing software company, and Taleo Corp., which makes talent-management.He secured significant deals with AT&T Inc., Bank of America Corp., and Qantas Airlines to transfer their existing databases to the cloud through Oracle. By late 2019, Oracle served more than 420,000 customers in 195 countries and territories, he said.Hurd had gone on a similar acquisition binge at HP, managing about $24 billion in deals, including buying Electronic Data Systems (EDS), as part of a larger plan to diversify the computer maker.He was also a drastic cost cutter who was responsible for firing thousands of workers when he first took over as HP’s CEO and laying off thousands more after the $13.9 billion purchase in 2008 of a struggling EDS, a move many investors disliked.Still, under Hurd’s tenure, HP increased profits for 22 straight quarters, while its revenue rose about 60% and its stock price doubled, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He also helped HP surpass International Business Machines Corp. as the largest computer maker by sales.There were some dark moments at HP too. In 2006, it was disclosed that Hurd had helped launch an investigation into internal leaks from the company’s board. Outside security consultants conducted surveillance on a journalist and HP board member, and used a subterfuge to acquire phone and fax records for HP employees, board members and journalists. The California attorney general’s office opened a criminal probe into possible privacy violations, and HP’s chairwoman at the time, Patricia Dunn, resigned her post when the scandal broke.For his part, Hurd defended the need to investigate company leakers, but claimed he didn’t know about the investigators’ tawdry tactics because he’d ducked out of a briefing on the investigation and, several months later, ignored a verbal and written summary of the leak probe.After Hurd was ousted following the sexual harassment probe in 2010, HP discontinued making smartphones and its tablet computer. Eventually it split into two companies, one focused on personal computers and printers and the other on software and services.Top CEODespite navigating several scandals, Hurd was lauded by the industry. In 2007, he was named one of Fortune magazine’s 25 most powerful business leaders. In 2008, the San Francisco Chronicle named Hurd CEO of the Year.“Saddened by the loss of Mark Hurd,” wrote Bill McDermott, who stepped down as CEO of SAP SE this month, on Twitter. “He was a self-made success in the industry & presided over mega accomplishments. While we competed vigorously in the market, we enjoyed professional respect. My heartfelt prayers are with Mark’s family on this solemn day.”Mark Vincent Hurd was born on Jan. 1, 1957, in New York and lived on the affluent Upper East Side of Manhattan. His Yale-educated father was a financier who moved the family to Miami while Hurd was in high school. His mother was a debutante.Hurd received a tennis scholarship to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration in 1979.He was hired in 1980 as a junior sales person by National Cash Register in San Antonio. He eventually became president, chief operating officer and CEO of the maker of automatic teller machines and cash registers.Based on his NCR record, HP hired him in 2005 as its CEO and added the chairman title the following year.“Mark just blew everybody else out of the water,” said Tom Perkins, a former HP executive who interviewed Hurd for the CEO job.Hurd served on a number of corporate boards and was a Baylor University trustee since 2014.He was married to the former Paula Kalupa in 1990. They had two daughters, Kathryn and Kelly.(Updates with comments from analyst in 12th paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Nico Grant, Peter Waldman and Candy Cheng.To contact the reporter on this story: Patrick Oster in New York at poster@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Mark Hurd, Oracle CEO Who Led Three Tech Companies, Dies"
2019-10-18,"Mark Hurd, remembered as “not a shrinking violet” with a fiercely competitive streak, led the reboot of Oracle's sales organization and changed the way the business operated.","Oracle's Hurd remembered for 'loquacious' style, bringing company into cloud era through sales revamp"
2019-10-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Hurd was in his element at Indian Wells.The tennis tournament–more formally known as the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, California— provided him with the perfect backdrop to flex his passions: tennis and selling stuff. Hurd turned the event, which Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison bought in 2009, into a two-week database and software sales extravaganza. He could be seen strolling the grounds or at nearby hotels constantly schmoozing with customers and using his connections with tennis legends like Chris Evert and Rafael Nadal to win people over and help close a deal. Along the way, Hurd, Oracle’s co-CEO, would sneak in a hit–he had a big serve and liked to flaunt it–or check on the American college players he was mentoring and the young pros he was quietly helping with financial aid. For Hurd, business and pleasure were one and the same and almost always intermixed in his life.This is what I’ll remember most about Hurd, who passed away Friday morning after a protracted illness: he was a relentless hustler and loved the art of doing business more than just about any other executive I’ve ever run across. In a statement issued after Hurd’s death, Ellison pointed to his friend’s business acumen. “Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle,” Ellison said. “All of us will miss Mark’s keen mind and rare ability to analyze, simplify and solve problems quickly.” Hurd arrived at Oracle in 2010 under tumultuous conditions. He’d resigned as CEO of Hewlett-Packard after being investigated by the company’s board for a relationship Hurd had with a marketing contractor. The board argued that Hurd had tried to cover up the relationship and misused his expense account, and Hurd argued that they were wrong and making much ado about nothing. The squabble was acrimonious enough to end Hurd’s time at HP, even though he had revived the company’s fortunes and turned it into a lean, mean maker of corporate technology products, printers and personal computers.At Oracle, Hurd applied his trademark skills at analyzing balance sheets and streamlining operations to try and improve the software maker’s bottom line. He could recite from memory the financial minutiae of every division and be blunt about what was working and what needed to be fixed. During his years at Oracle, the company’s share price more than doubled, and Hurd was a constant presence at the company’s events, sales meetings and customer sites. In many ways, he became the public face of Oracle, enjoying the limelight while Ellison made the occasional appearance and co-CEO Safra Catz preferred to operate in the background.Though Oracle remains the dominant database company, it still has much work to do to catch up in the booming market for cloud-based software and services. Oracle was late to the game modernizing its products. Hurd tried his best to paper over Oracle’s weaknesses through salesmanship and often succeeded. One of the biggest weaknesses throughout his career, though, was favoring bottom line performance over investing in research and development and revolutionary new products. Hurd often seemed to focus on the here and now, rather than plotting for what lay ahead. Oracle’s dual-CEO structure was unusual and not always to Hurd’s liking, as he reveled in controlling a business and overseeing all of its operations. He took on sales, marketing and press and investor relations, and Catz handled finances and legal. Last month Oracle said that Hurd was taking a leave of absence for an unspecified illness and that Ellison and Catz would assume his responsibilities. Ellison has said that Catz will stay in place and that he would like to keep the two-CEO structure. He cited Don Johnson, head of Oracle’s cloud infrastructure division, and Steve Miranda, head of Oracle’s applications unit, as possible partners to Catz in the future.What’s clear is that Hurd will not be easy to replace. On a personal note, he shared a tight bond with Ellison around tennis. The two men have been pumping money into American tournaments and players for years, hoping to spark a revival of U.S. male pros. And, when Hurd was at his lowest moment after the HP fiasco, it was Ellison who came to the rescue, championing Hurd in the press and offering him a high-profile gig at Oracle. These actions–along with massive annual pay packages-made Hurd very loyal to Ellison and left Hurd as eager as ever to prove Ellison right and his critics wrong.Not short on ego, Hurd saw business as a battlefield and perceived himself as a master general. On his worst days, he was short of temper and combative. But, on his best days–of which there seemed to be many–he was a numbers and strategy savant with a rare ability to inspire those under him to work incredibly hard. Hurd himself was a workaholic and considered Oracle’s performance as a reflection on his character. Very few people are as committed to their work or as passionate in their pursuit of it.Vance covered Hurd for 15 years in his roles as CEO of NCR, HP and Oracle and even played tennis with him once. To contact the author of this story: Ashlee Vance in Palo Alto at avance3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Molly Schuetz at mschuetz9@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Mark Hurd: Silicon Valley’s Ultimate Salesman

2019-10-18,"One of the key reasons Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is one of the most valuable on Wall Street -- with a market cap of $884 billion -- is that the company is willing to take bold initiatives. True, sometimes things fall short, as seen with the move into the smartphone business.Source: Zapp2Photo / Shutterstock.com But for the most part, CEO Jeff Bezos has been able to make the right strategic decisions and deploy resources in a disciplined way. Perhaps the best example of this is AWS (Amazon Web Services). Without this, AMZN stock would likely have a much lower valuation today.The irony is that the company was not the ideal player to be the winner in the cloud. It should have been from a tech operator like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or IBM (NYSE:IBM). These companies had the advantages of large enterprise customer bases as well as strong infrastructures and trusted brands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AWS Enables Aggressive InvestmentsBezos saw that the cloud was the future of business software. Customers would greatly benefit from the access to a wide assortment of services at a low price. There would also be no need to pay for the hardware, servers and other technologies.The result is that AWS has become a juggernaut, making Amazon the cloud's force to be reckoned with in the 1 position. In the latest quarter, revenues from the business jumped by 49% to $8.38 billion or a run-rate of more than $33 billion. The high operating income from the cloud has also made it possible for Amazon to aggressively invest in other opportunities, such as health care, delivery and online advertising.OK then, so what's next? Can there be another AWS that will continue to power AMZN stock? Well, I think so. And it's AI (Artificial Intelligence). AI Powered Amazon's Original Book RecommendationsKeep in mind that this technology has been a part of the company's focus since its early days. A form of AI was essential for creating the recommendation system for the original online bookstore, which helped propel sales.  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals But of course, the company has continued to push innovation. In fact, a big part of this has been leveraging the huge AWS customer base. To this end, AMZN has been adding sophisticated AI features, including developing a system called SageMaker that makes it easier to create sophisticated models.Yet the most notable example of AMZN's AI is Alexa. Since the launch of this platform five years ago, there have been over 100 million devices shipped. There has also emerged a powerful ecosystem of developers, who have created more than 80,000 skills.According to Chris Nicholson, CEO and founder of Skymind, an AI infrastructure developer, in an email interview: &quot;Amazon is to the smart home what Tesla is to smart cars. It has more devices being used out in the world than any one else, and that gives it a huge advantage in the amount of data it can gather and use to train its AI. Amazon made a play for the home with Alexa and Ring, and it dominates that space like Microsoft used to dominate operating systems.&quot;  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy (With Brands You Can Find In Your Kitchen) The big play for Alexa is as next-generation e-commerce platform. It's all part of something known as conversational commerce. And it is likely to be a massive market. According to OC&C Strategy Consultants, the spending is forecast to reach $40 billion by 2022 in the U.S. Bottom Line On Amazon StockIt's true that there is lots of hype with AI. Many companies are jumping on the bandwagon so as to get funding. Investors looking for a play in the AI space shouldn't overlook Amazon stock.In artificial intelligence, Amazon.com is the real deal. More importantly, it has the massive platform -- with huge amounts of data -- to be highly competitive in this category. And as seen with AWS, the company knows how to monetize technologies. Thus, when looking for a solid play on AI, AMZN stock is certainly a solid choice.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-10-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Activist investor Starboard Value contends Box Inc. has underperformed its competitors due to a slowing growth rate and poor profitability and could be an attractive takeover target.Starboard sees the software maker as having multiple avenues to unlock value, including accelerating growth, striking a better balance between its sales growth and profitability, or potentially even seeking a buyer.“We believe this company is very, very attractive and could be acquired,” Starboard Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smith said Thursday at the C4K Investors Conference in Toronto.Box’s shares rose as much as 4.5% in New York trading. They closed up 3.7% to $16.36, giving the company a market value of $2.42 billion.Starboard disclosed a 7.5% stake in Redwood City, California-based Box last month, putting more pressure on the company, which has struggled to accelerate sales and become more profitable.Preferred AvenueSmith said later Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg TV his preferred avenue for the company to create value wasn’t through a sale. He acknowledged several potential strategic buyers, such as Adobe Inc. or Oracle Corp., along with private equity firms, may be interested in acquiring Box.A representative for Box declined to comment.Box is facing problems similar to those of other companies whose organic growth has slowed while having trouble shifting their model, Smith said. Box hasn’t met lofty sales growth targets that are common in the cloud-computing market, as it tries to transition to a broader software suite from from its current data-storage products.“The issue comes when you’re promising more growth than you’re achieving and you’re not able to pivot and balance that profitability and instead, as you may see in Box, you instead continue to spend more and more dollars chasing that growth,” Smith said. “Those companies that are reaching that level really need to also understand how to balance profitability.”Starboard has been one of the busiest activists this year, launching 10 campaigns, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

2019-10-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has won the sought-after JEDI cloud computing contract with the Pentagon valued at as much as $10 billion over a decade, dealing a blow to the market leader, Amazon.com Inc., which had been the front-runner.The decision, which was announced by the Defense Department late Friday, may be challenged by Amazon, according to a person familiar with the matter, because President Donald Trump weighed in on the bidding process. The terms of the competition were also hotly contested by another rival, Oracle Corp.The Pentagon has said the cloud project, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, is intended to help bring American military technology into the modern era.The Defense Department is investing in commercial cloud services, which host computing power and storage in remote data centers, to improve data security and speed up real-time sharing of information across the military.The Pentagon said the contract was expected to be completed by 2029. Microsoft shares rose 0.6% to $140.73 at Friday’s close.Amazon, which won a lucrative cloud contract with the Central Intelligence Agency in 2013, was long seen to have the upper hand in the competition. But politics entered the picture. Trump has long been at odds with Amazon’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos. Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which Trump claims has treated him unfairly in its coverage“We’re surprised about this conclusion,” said Douglas Stone, an Amazon spokesman. He added that the company was “the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion. We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where security, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources can be the difference between success and failure.”Trump surprised the industry earlier this year when he openly questioned whether the contract was being competitively bid.A new book by Guy Snodgrass, a speechwriter to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, alleges that Trump, in the summer of 2018, told Mattis to “screw Amazon” and lock it out of the bid. Mattis didn’t do what Trump asked, Snodgrass wrote. Mattis has criticized the book.Amazon was believed to be the front-runner until Friday evening.The decision is a big boost for Microsoft’s cloud business.“This is a paradigm changer for Microsoft,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a “buy” rating on Microsoft. “It’s a landmark win that will change the cloud computing battle over the next decade. It’s a shocker to Amazon and Bezos to lose it. But for Microsoft it signals a new era of growth in cloud. This adds $10 to the stock in my opinion.”A Microsoft representative referred questions to the Defense Department announcement. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Amazon Web Services, the retail giant’s cloud computing arm, has a wide lead in the business of selling cloud services to businesses and governments, with $32.5 billion in sales during the most recently reported 12 months. Microsoft, which doesn’t break out comparable sales for its Azure unit, likely pulled in a fraction of that, analysts say.In a statement released later Friday night, the Defense Department said that “the acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The process cleared review by” the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Court of Federal Claims.“All offerors were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria,” the department added, saying that “additional contracts are planned for both cloud services and complementary migration and integration solutions necessary to achieve effective cloud adoption.”The Pentagon’s inspector general said in a separate statement on Friday night that it had “not found evidence that we believe would prevent the DoD from making a decision about the award of the contract.” The watchdog agency, which was leading a review by “multidisciplinary team of auditors, investigators, and attorneys,” was aiming to have its work done by the end of November.The Defense Department had come under criticism for its handling of the winner-take-all project, which was marred by accusations of improper ties between former Pentagon officials and Amazon. Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. waged a fierce lobbying and legal campaign over the decision to choose just one provider, arguing it would imperil the Pentagon’s data and stiffle innovation. Both companies were later eliminated from the competition, but Oracle filed suit.A judge said the company did not have the legal standing to challenge the terms of the procurement process. Oracle has appealed that verdict. Alphabet Inc.’s Google, another large cloud provider, withdrew from consideration last year amid employee concerns over the company’s ties to defense contracting.As recently as Tuesday, the Pentagon said Defense Defense Secretary Mark Esper had recused himself from any decisions involving the contract to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest because his son works with one of the original applicants.IBM confirmed that Esper’s son has been a digital strategy consultant with the company since February but said that his job was “unrelated to IBM’s pursuit” of the cloud deal.The government has ramped up scrutiny of large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google, over issues ranging from consumer privacy to marketplace competition. Yet even as Microsoft spent much of the 1990s wrangling with U.S. officials, ultimately losing a landmark case that accused the software maker of anti-competitive practices, it has largely stayed out of the recent round of regulatory glare. The company has even become a steady government contractor.Chris Lynch, the former director of the Pentagon’s Defense Digital Service who helped design the JEDI project, praised the decision on Twitter. “JEDI Cloud is critical to our women and men in uniform,” he wrote.But Representative Steve Womack of Arkansas, one of several Republican lawmakers who took their concerns about the process to the White House, said he remained “concerned with the contract structure.” He has said that the single source bid amounts to “limiting competition.”Bezos and Microsoft founder Bill Gates are the two richest men in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.&#92;--With assistance from Dina Bass, Sara Forden, Ben Brody, Ryan Beene and Matt Day.To contact the reporters on this story: John Harney in Washington at jharney2@bloomberg.net;Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, John Harney, Tom GilesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Wins $10 Billion Pentagon Cloud Contract, Beating Amazon"

2019-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s quarterly earnings were dented by heavy investment in Google’s cloud-computing business, which is key to future growth but still runs a distant third in the market behind Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.Executives said the company will keep spending to pursue opportunities in cloud, artificial intelligence and consumer hardware.Net income in the third quarter was $7.1 billion, or $10.12 a share, down from $9.2 billion, or $13.06 a share, in the same period a year earlier, the company reported on Monday. Analysts expected $12.35 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Google, the world’s largest online search provider, has been building data centers, buying equipment and hiring salespeople and engineers to support its cloud unit, which rents computing power and software services over the internet. Former Oracle Corp. executive Thomas Kurian was hired late last year to reinvigorate this effort.In the latest period, expenses totaled $31.3 billion, up 25% from a year earlier, while revenue rose 20% to $40.5 billion. Capital spending was $6.7 billion, up 27%.“We continue to invest thoughtfully in talent and infrastructure to support our growth, particularly in newer areas like cloud and machine learning,” Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google, said in a statement.Alphabet shares fell about 1.5% in extended trading, after closing at $1,288.98 in New York. The stock hit a record earlier on Monday, so expectations were high ahead of the results.Sales and marketing costs will keep rising through the end of the year as Google ramps up advertising ahead of the holiday shopping season, Porat said. The company recently launched a new Pixel smartphone and will need to promote it aggressively to compete with Apple Inc.’s iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy handsets.Consumer devices are one way Alphabet is seeking new sources of revenue growth, beyond the main Google digital advertising business. But cloud-computing may be the company’s biggest opportunity. In July, Google said it expected to pull in $8 billion this year in cloud revenue. That’s still a lot less than Amazon and Microsoft, and executives didn’t update that number on Monday.Google hired 6,450 employees in the third quarter, and the largest additions were in cloud computing, for both technical and sales roles, Porat said. “We do remain on pace for head count growth in 2019 to be in line with growth in 2018,” she added during a conference call with analysts.Total revenue, excluding payments to distribution partners, was $33 billion, compared with the average estimate of $32.72 billion. Google’s Other Revenue, which includes cloud and consumer hardware, was $6.4 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney was looking for $6.6 billion.Google’s ad revenue rose 17% to $33.9 billion, suggesting demand for the company’s search, video and web display ads remains strong, even as regulatory and privacy pressures mount.Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, said sales growth was driven by mobile search, YouTube and cloud.He also addressed antitrust investigations into the company, saying Google has helped to cut prices and increase choice for small businesses and consumers. He suggested the company’s forays into new businesses was prompting regulatory push-back spurred by incumbents.Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department started inquiries into whether Google and other large technology firms have violated antitrust law. The House Antitrust Subcommittee has held hearings and submitted intensive document requests to tech companies about potentially anti-competitive practices. And state attorneys general investigating Google recently ordered it to turn over a wide range of information about its ad business.“In many of these areas we are the new entrant and we create competition, and sometimes the competitive pressures can lead to concerns from others,” Pichai said.(Updates with comment from CFO in eighth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Gerrit De Vynck in New York at gdevynck@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Alphabet Earnings Dented by Spending on Cloud Business

2019-10-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If someone woke from a coma and saw that the S&P 500 Index was up 21% for the year and reaching a new record high on Monday, the immediate reaction would most likely be that everything is great. But that’s far from true.The list of reasons stocks should be down is much longer than the one for why they should be up. The economy has slowed, and a majority of chief financial officers anticipate a recession within a year. Earnings have stopped growing, and estimates are being cut. Stock valuations are high. The U.S.-China trade war has not been resolved. Congress has started an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy, but that’s only because the outlook has deteriorated.So why are equities roaring ahead? The answer comes down to a handful of stocks: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Oracle Corp. Those five companies account for half of the S&P 500 tech sector, which has surged 30.2% for the year. Exclude that sector and the S&P 500 would be up only about 14%, according to DataTrek Research. That’s still good but nothing special when compared with the returns in the rest of the world, with the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the U.S. having gained 12%.Therein lies the hidden risk embedded in the market, which is that any missteps by any of these highfliers could spell doom for equities more broadly. It also underscores just how lacking in breadth this latest leg up has been. For one, the percentage of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange closing above their 200-day moving averages has dropped to 53% from 59% in mid-September.Not only that, but the spread between the share of S&P 500 members closing at 52-week highs and the share at 52-week lows has been in a general downtrend since June.To be sure, it’s not unusual that a handful of stocks have led the broader market higher. Before this year, it was the FAANG group of stocks: Facebook Inc., Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and a few others. A few years ago, AQR Capital Management’s co-founder and chief investment officer, Clifford Asness, published a paper examining the impact of individual stocks on the S&P 500 from 1994 to 2014. What he found was that while the S&P 500 rose 9.3% a year, the top 10 stocks accounted for 4.1 percentage points of that gain on average.Then there’s the awkward fact that smaller stocks that make up the vast majority of the market are down about 11% from their records reached in August 2018 based on the S&P Small Cap 600 and Russell 2000 indexes.This stock market has delivered plenty of surprises, and betting against it has been a losing proposition. In January, when the S&P 500 was trading at about 2,600, the median estimate of about 25 Wall Street strategist surveyed by Bloomberg was for it to end the year at 2,913. It surpassed that level in April and ended Friday at 3,203. But those same strategists are more cautious, predicting the benchmark to drop to 3,000 by the end of the year.Of course, they could raise their forecasts, but that would be awkward given the trend in profits and the slowing economy. Third-quarter earnings are tracking at a 3% decline from a year earlier, and forecasts for the fourth quarter have been cut to a gain of 1.2% from the 5.4% increase that was forecast at the end of July, according to Cantor Fitzgerald. The S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio, at just shy of 20 times, is the highest since last October, just as the benchmark was beginning a tumble that led to a 14% drop in the final three months of the year.All that suggests investors need to look beyond the headlines about yet another record.To contact the author of this story: Robert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Robert Burgess is an editor for Bloomberg Opinion.

2019-10-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Within hours of Amazon.com Inc. losing a lucrative Pentagon cloud-computing contract to rival Microsoft Corp. there were hints that the Seattle giant would challenge the decision.Amazon has several options to do so, extending from federal courts to Capitol Hill -- and, with the clock ticking on some of them, the company is expected to move expeditiously.The Defense Department late Friday awarded the closely watched contract to modernize the Pentagon’s computing infrastructure to Microsoft, an upset victory for a company initially viewed as a distant second to Amazon in the market for cloud-computing services. The project could be worth as much as $10 billion over a decade and lead to other contracts.High-profile federal procurement projects often face legal or administrative appeals, and experts in federal contracting say a protest from Amazon became more likely after President Donald Trump earlier this year publicly suggested that the Joint Enterprise Defense Initiative, or JEDI, was unfairly structured to give the Seattle company an advantage.“Amazon has the president on record clearly stating that he was looking at intervening in the procurement process,” said Barbara Kinosky, a managing partner at Centre Law and Consulting LLC, a specialist in federal contracting. “I am guessing Amazon and its legal team did not spend the weekend watching the World Series.”Amazon is considering its options for legal challenges, a person familiar with the matter has said. The company had been preparing for the award under the assumption that the Pentagon’s decision would wind up in court regardless of the winner, said another person familiar with Amazon’s thinking.For Amazon, the value of the contract far exceeds $10 billion, technology analysts and experts in government procurement say. The company’s Amazon Web Services division gained legitimacy as a provider of technology tools to big companies and governments in part with a deal, signed in 2013, to provide services to the Central Intelligence Agency.With JEDI, Amazon had the opportunity to earn another seal of approval and take a step toward making AWS the default option for federal agencies. Instead, Amazon faces the prospect that a contract it was widely expected to win will instead bolster the credentials of its most capable rival at a time when AWS’s growth rate is slowing.“The JEDI loss challenges what once looked like clear dominance in the federal market for Amazon,” said James Bach, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “By picking Microsoft, the Pentagon, with its sensitive workloads and rigorous security requirements, made clear that Amazon can’t rest on its laurels as cloud-market leader to win deals.”Government Accountability Office rules give Amazon 10 days from the date of a contract award, or five days from their official debriefing from the Pentagon, to file a protest and pause the procurement. The debriefing is designed to give Amazon feedback on its bid. AWS and the Defense Dept. didn’t return messages seeking comment on Monday.Such a challenge would trigger a review that the GAO must complete within 100 days and prevent the contract from taking effect in the meantime, though the Pentagon has the power to override the hold and proceed anyway. Two years after first outlining the project, there are signs the Pentagon is eager to move quickly.Even while Oracle Corp. challenged the bidding process in court earlier this year, the Pentagon started to lay the groundwork for implementation by various defense agencies. And it’s notable that Oracle’s challenge failed and is now under appeal -- a sign of how high the bar is to challenge the bidding process.Amazon also could file a lawsuit with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking an injunction to prevent the contract from taking effect. Courts in such cases ultimately tend to defer to the government agency that awarded the deal. But a lawsuit would give Amazon’s lawyers the opportunity to seek documents from the Pentagon and Microsoft that might make the public case for a rehearing of the contract, said Charles Tiefer, a professor of government contracting law at the University of Baltimore. Amazon could also seek to apply pressure on Capitol Hill, he said.“The issue of whether President Trump intervened either explicitly or implicitly might well get the attention of a House committee or subcommittee,” Tiefer said. “Trump was very, very loud in his expression of bias.”When Amazon was seen as the likely winner, rivals like Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. lobbied the Pentagon to award components of the deal to multiple suppliers. The Defense Department could try to forestall an Amazon protest by offering a portion of the deal to AWS.On Tuesday, Dana Deasy, nominated to be the Pentagon’s chief information officer, said that to the best of his knowledge the White House didn’t reach out to the contract selection team. Deasy was speaking at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on his nomination.Though no law flatly prohibits a president from weighing in on a contract, Trump’s comments broke precedent and struck some as a violation of longstanding norms separating contracting from political considerations. Strict rules govern what factors agencies can consider in awarding government business. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.Amazon could argue that Trump’s actions and the Pentagon’s decision, made under the appearance of public pressure from the White House, has the effect of blacklisting Amazon from contract work during the administration, said Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University. Formally disbarring a contractor is by law supposed include a notice period and guarantees of due process, he said.“The challenge for Amazon will be proving that the pressure was applied and proving that the pressure worked,” he said.(Updates with Pentagon CIO nominee comment in 16th paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.net;Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Daniel Seiden in Washington at dseiden5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Seen Focusing on Trump in Pentagon Contract Challenge

2019-11-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. opened its appeal in a legal challenge of a Pentagon cloud-computing contract valued at as much as $10 billion with a familiar argument: the procurement was unfairly tailored for Amazon.com Inc.In in its opening brief, which was filed on Friday, Oracle said the cloud project violated federal procurement law and was tainted by relationships between former Pentagon officials and Amazon.Oracle is appealing a July ruling from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that dismissed its legal challenge to the cloud contract based on similar claims. At the same time, Amazon is mulling its own potential legal challenge of the project after losing the deal to Microsoft Corp. late last month, Bloomberg News has reported.The legal challenges could revive fresh criticism from industry, lawmakers and analysts of the Pentagon’s handling of the controversial cloud project, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The project is designed to consolidate the Defense Department’s cloud computing infrastructure and modernize its technology systems.The department is facing accusations that former employees with ties to Amazon may have structured the deal to favor Amazon and that President Donald Trump may have unfairly intervened in the process against Amazon. Trump has long been at odds with Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post.“As DOD has asserted throughout this litigation, and as confirmed by the court, DOD reasonably evaluated and equally treated all offerors within the framework of a full and open competition,” Elissa Smith, a Department of Defense spokeswoman, said in a statement in response to Oracle’s latest move. She said rulings from the claims court and the Government Accountability Office “validated that DoD followed all the applicable acquisition processes.”Trump Surprise“It is difficult to recall any prior procurement of this scale, value and significance in which two of the four leading competitors had compelling conflicts of interest or bias allegations,” said Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University. “This is extraordinary.”Trump surprised the industry earlier this year when he openly questioned whether the contract was being competitively bid, citing complaints from Microsoft, Oracle and International Business Machines Corp.A new book by Guy Snodgrass, a speechwriter to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, alleges that Trump, in the summer of 2018, told Mattis to “screw Amazon” and lock it out of the bid. Mattis didn’t do what Trump asked, Snodgrass wrote. Mattis has criticized the book.Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, said during his confirmation hearing last week that to the best of his knowledge, no one from the White House reached out to any members of the JEDI cloud contract selection team.Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Criteria ChallengedFederal Claims Court Senior Judge Eric Bruggink dismissed Oracle’s lawsuit in July, saying the company didn’t meet the criteria for the bid and thus didn’t have the standing to challenge the procurement.The Pentagon eliminated Oracle and IBM as potential bidders in April, leaving Amazon and Microsoft as the final competitors for the contract.In its appeal, Oracle contends that the Pentagon’s minimum requirements for the contract, as well as its decision to pick just one winner, violated federal procurement laws designed to ensure competition. Under the law, two different Pentagon officials are required to offer separate legal justifications for choosing just one vendor for an award of this size.Bruggink said in his July ruling that one of the Pentagon’s legal justifications was “completely reasonable” while acknowledging that the second one “does not fit the contract.”The government has said choosing one winner would reduce security risks and better enable it to consolidate its technology products.Tainted RelationshipsOracle is claiming that the procurement has been marred by conflicts of interest, including ties between former Defense Department officials and Amazon. At least two of the former employees were offered jobs at the company while working on the contract, according to the lawsuit.In one case, Deap Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the JEDI procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi had advocated in favor of the Pentagon’s decision to choose just one winner for the JEDI award, the lawsuit said.Bruggink ruled that the conflict of interest allegations “raise eyebrows,” but that the Pentagon’s contracting officer properly determined the relationships had no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process, and that Amazon didn’t gain a substantive advantage as a result.But Oracle’s appeal contends that “JEDI suffers from corruption of a high order” and that the court’s argument that the conflicts of interest had no impact on the procurement “lacks a rational basis.”Separately, the Defense Department’s inspector general has been reviewing potential unethical conduct surrounding the bid, but said there is no reason why the Pentagon can’t move forward with an award.(Updates with Defense Department comment in sixth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark NiquetteFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Revives Charges That Pentagon Bid Was Tainted by Amazon Conflicts

2019-11-08,"Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock continues to remain in place amid company growth and acquisitions. It began the year with a quick recovery from the fall 2018 bear market in tech stocks. However, after returning to levels near the 2018 highs, Salesforce stagnated. As a result, it has traded in a range for most of the year.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com However, valuations remain elevated even as profit growth hits a temporary slowdown. Moreover, other companies have entered the software-as-a-service business. CRM stock should return to double-digit growth in the near future. However, with the company maturing and choices for SaaS increasing, I see little incentive for investors to take the multiple, and by extension, the stock price to higher levels.At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 56, CRM stock remains overvalued. However, unlike other value-rich stocks such as Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) or Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), it lacks one critical element of this type of equity -- movement. CRM stock trades at about the same level as it did in early February.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is not to say I have gone negative on CRM stock. Salesforce pioneered the SaaS industry as founder Marc Benioff left Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and founded this company. As a result, the firm is a &quot;force&quot; not just in sales, but across the entire tech industry. Hence, its high valuations of the recent past are not hard to understand. CRM Faces Multiple CompressionHowever, at $140 billion, Salesforce has grown well beyond the startup phase. This has begun to evolve into a mature company. Over the long run, I also expect valuations to &quot;mature.&quot; As I pointed out during the summer, CRM stock moved little despite buying Tableau and forming a partnership with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).Increased competition has become an increasingly important factor in the company's valuation. Justifying a 100-plus P/E ratio is one thing when a company holds a virtual monopoly. However, consumers now have alternatives. Peers such as Oracle, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) have become competitive threats. All of these companies also trade at a lower multiple.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Stock Up On I would not expect this process to play out quickly. Thus, I agree with InvestorPlace's Thomas Niel when he recommends against shorting CRM stock. Profit growth may have fallen into the single digits. Still, when analysts predict that a profitable company will increase revenues by 27% in the current year and 24.1% the next, it typically makes for a weak short candidate. Regardless of where CRM stock moves, I expect Salesforce to continue to prosper as a company.Also, the CRM stock price has twice bounced back from the low $140 range. Despite my &quot;overvaluation&quot; assertion, it will need more than a high P/E ratio to inspire a massive downward catalyst. Unless we see an overall bear market that compares to the one in the fall of 2018, I do not expect a significant selloff in Salesforce stock.However, those who ride out the maturing process will see CRM stock either stagnate or decline as the process of multiple compression plays out. Investors need to ask themselves if they want to stick around for this. My Concluding Thoughts on CRM StockDespite the bright future for Salesforce as a company, falling multiples and increased competition could hold CRM stock over the near term. Despite a temporary slowdown in profit growth, CRM's forward P/E ratio remains over 50. This has occurred in an environment of rising competition and slow maturation.To be sure, CRM stock remains a long-term winner. I think once valuations fall, Salesforce stock will again become a buy. However, until the P/E ratio compares well to its main peers, I see CRM remaining in its current range for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Dell Technologies Inc. announced a goal to make half of its global workforce female by 2030, one of a raft of pledges meant to foster greater diversity and sustainability at the personal computer maker.The company also set a 2030 target for women to make up 40% of the employees worldwide who manage people. Women comprised 30.4% of Dell’s workforce as of February. And the company said it wants 25% of Dell’s U.S. workers to be African-American or Hispanic by 2030, an increase from almost 13% this year.Dell is among a number of technology companies that have mapped out grand pledges for a more diverse workforce. Facebook Inc. said in July that it wanted to double the number of women, black and Hispanic employees in the U.S. in the next five years -- so half of its U.S. workforce would be from underrepresented groups by 2024. Like several of its peers, including Oracle Corp. and Intel Corp., Dell has been accused by the U.S. Labor Department of paying women and ethnic minorities less than other employees in the same roles. Dell paid $7 million to settle such allegations in September.“We think there is a lot that is challenging the world right now and we are committed to being a significant contributor to solving these problems,” Christine Fraser, Dell’s chief responsibility officer, said in an interview. “We don’t think of it as something that’s nice to do. We think of it as a business imperative.”Dell will educate 95% of its 157,000 employees each year on topics such as unconscious bias, micro-aggressions and privilege, the Round Rock, Texas-based company said Tuesday in a statement.“It’s not just about putting the numbers out,” Brian Reaves, Dell’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, said. “The changes that are coming out behind these goals are in every part of our business.”Dell, which also makes servers, storage hardware and networking gear, said it would expand its sustainability efforts. By 2030, for every product a customer buys, the company said it will recycle or reuse an equivalent product. Dell will also make 100% of its packaging recyclable by the same deadline. More than half of the company’s product content will be made from recycled or renewable materials.“We see e-waste as one of the fastest-growing waste streams,” David Lear, Dell’s vice president of corporate sustainability, said in an interview. “We very intentionally design our products knowing we’ll get it back one day.”The company also said that 75% of the electricity at Dell facilities will come from renewable sources by 2030, and 100% by 2040. Currently, Dell’s headquarters north of Austin, Texas, are powered by renewable energy, Lear said.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Dell Aims to Make Women Half of Workforce in Diversity Push

2019-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest Silicon Valley companies have responded to complaints about unequal pay by disclosing the gaps between men and women doing similar work.But not Oracle Corp.The software giant’s board, led by founder Larry Ellison, 75, says it’s a waste of time and money because the company is already committed to equal pay for equal work.Heather Smith, the vice president of sustainable investing at Pax World Funds who’s pushing to make the figures public, isn’t buying it—and neither is a majority of Oracle’s outside investors.For a third consecutive year, Pax is calling on Oracle to produce a report identifying whether a gender pay gap exists and how to fix it. The petitions are part of a broader effort by Pax, fund manager Arjuna Capital and the $208 billion New York City Pension Funds to push many of the largest U.S. companies to make such disclosures. The proposal will be up for a vote at Oracle’s annual meeting on Nov. 19.“Oracle can and should be doing more to close the gender gap in its workforce,” said Smith, whose firm oversees $4.5 billion.It’s easy for companies to pay lip service to equal pay if they don’t actually have to show the progress they’re making. And in Oracle’s case, there’s at least some cause for concern. Both former employees and the U.S. government have sued the company, alleging it systematically underpaid women and people of color. Oracle has denied the allegations in both cases, which are pending.More and more companies are being pressured to confront compensation disparities. About a dozen publicly traded tech giants, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., have published gender pay data after requests from Pax and others.Last year, almost two-thirds of Oracle shareholders who aren’t senior executives or directors—including funds managed by BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp.—supported Pax’s request that Oracle publish the figures, up from 56% a year earlier. They would have been approved with support from Ellison, who owns roughly a third of Oracle’s shares and has a net worth of $61.4 billion.The board members unanimously recommended that investors vote against the proposal again this year. Public pay disclosures would be costly and time-consuming and “would not lead to meaningful gains in support of workforce diversity and gender pay equity” at the company, they said in a Sept. 27 regulatory filing. Instead, the board said its existing efforts to promote women in tech, and the fact that four of its 14 directors are women, already puts Oracle at the forefront of gender equality issues, particularly at the top. Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz is also one of just a few women to lead an S&P 500 company.Oracle didn’t reply to an emailed request for comment.For Smith, the rationale behind measuring pay equity is simple. A growing body of research shows workforce diversity improves a firm’s financial performance, boosts innovation and tempers overconfident male CEOs. Pay differences are among the clearest signs of unfair treatment, which in turn hampers diversity in the workplace, according to Joelle Emerson, founder of Paradigm Strategy.“You cannot possibly fix a problem that you don’t measure,” said Emerson, whose firm helps companies conduct pay-equity reviews.Making those reviews public is important. A recent study showed the gender pay gap shrank at Danish companies that were required to publicly report such data after a law change in 2006. For firms exempt from the mandate, the disparities persisted.Salesforce.com Inc. has spent millions of dollars raising the salaries of female workers after internal reviews repeatedly found disparities.“I’ve had CEOs call me and say, ‘This is not true, this is not real,’” Salesforce founder Marc Benioff told CBS last year. “And I say to them, ‘This is true. Look at the numbers.’”In one of the two pending lawsuits challenging Oracle’s compensation practices, an analysis conducted on behalf of three female engineers showed the company paid some women about $13,000 less per year on average versus male counterparts. The plaintiffs are seeking to represent more than 4,000 similarly situated employees.In the other, the U.S. Department of Labor alleged that Oracle for years shortchanged women and minority workers by $400 million. In May, a judge rebuffed Oracle’s effort to block the department’s requests for employee wage data.In the U.K., government-mandated pay disclosures suggest that Oracle, like so many other big companies, still has more work to do when it comes to gender pay equality. Last year, the median hourly wage for women employed by Oracle in the country was 17% less than for men. The disparity for bonuses was a whopping 44%.Pax’s proposal would require Oracle to conduct an analysis of pay equity, which factors in things like job level, function and geography. While that entails some number crunching, Emerson said the cost would hardly be prohibitive for a company like Oracle, which booked $11 billion of profit last year.“Most companies might see it as more costly to not do this analysis and get sued for pay disparities,” she said.So far, Pax and its partners in the effort have persuaded about three dozen companies to publicly release their pay equity figures.Their petitions usually help to establish a dialogue with investor relations or human resources that can lead to a public disclosure, Smith said. As a result, many of the proposals didn’t require a shareholder vote.Some of the early wins have had a knock-on effect. When Citigroup Inc. disclosed its numbers in early 2018, for example, other Wall Street firms followed within weeks. Citi subsequently released even more data. Its peers have yet to follow.Oracle has been a different story. Pax’s letters and petitions have been largely ignored, Smith said. No matter what happens at next week’s meeting, she said the fight for pay disclosure is far from over.“All companies, regardless of sector or industry, should be addressing this issue,” Smith said. “We’re going to continue to press.”&#92;--With assistance from Paige Smith.To contact the author of this story: Anders Melin in New York at amelin3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Peter EichenbaumMichael TsangRebecca GreenfieldFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Don’t Ask Larry Ellison About Women’s Pay at Oracle

2019-11-15,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will hear an appeal from Alphabet Inc.’s Google in a multibillion-dollar clash that has divided Silicon Valley, agreeing to decide whether the company improperly used copyrighted programming code owned by Oracle Corp. in the Android operating system.The justices said they’ll review a federal appeals court’s conclusion that Google violated Oracle’s copyrights. Oracle says it’s entitled to at least $8.8 billion in damages.The case, which the court will resolve by July, promises to reshape the U.S. legal protections for software code, particularly the interfaces that let programs and devices communicate with one another. Google contends the appeals court ruling would make it harder to use interfaces to develop new applications.The ruling “has upended the computer industry’s longstanding expectation that developers are free to use software interfaces to build new computer programs,” Google argued.The appeals court decision reversed a jury finding that Google’s copying was a legitimate “fair use” of Oracle’s Java programming language.“There is nothing fair about taking a copyrighted work verbatim and using it for the same purpose and function as the original in a competing platform,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a 3-0 ruling.At issue are pre-written directions known as application program interfaces, or APIs, which provide instructions for such functions as connecting to the internet or accessing certain types of files. By using those shortcuts, programmers don’t have to write code from scratch for every function in their software, or change it for every type of device.Oracle says the Java APIs are freely available to those who want to build applications that run on computers and mobile devices. But the company says it requires a license to use the shortcuts for a competing platform or to embed them in an electronic device.“We are confident the Supreme Court will preserve long established copyright protections for original software and reject Google’s continuing efforts to avoid responsibility for copying Oracle’s innovations,” said Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman. “In the end, a finding that Google infringed Oracle’s original works will promote, not stifle, future innovation.”Oracle says Google was facing an existential threat because its search engine -- the source of its advertising revenue -- wasn’t being used on smartphones. Google bought the Android mobile operating system in 2005 and copied Java code to attract developers but refused to take a license, Oracle contends.‘Incalculable’ Harm“Naturally, it inflicted incalculable market harm on Oracle,” Oracle told the Supreme Court. “This is the epitome of copyright infringement, whether the work is a news report, a manual, or computer software.”Android generated $42 billion for Google between 2007 and 2016, according to Oracle court filings. Google said it welcomed the court’s decision to review the case.“We hope that the court reaffirms the importance of software interoperability in American competitiveness,” said Google’s chief legal officer, Kent Walker. “Developers should be able to create applications across platforms and not be locked into one company’s software.”At the Supreme Court, Google argues that software interfaces are categorically ineligible for copyright protection. Google also contends that the Federal Circuit restricted the “fair use” defense to copyright infringement so much as to make it impossible for a developer to reuse an interface in a new application.“What Oracle is seeking here is nothing less than complete control over a community of developers that have invested in learning the free and open Java language,” Google argued.The Trump administration is backing Oracle at the Supreme Court and urged the justices to reject the appeal. Microsoft Corp., Mozilla Corp. and Red Hat Inc. are among the companies that urged the Supreme Court to give Google a hearing.The appeal encompasses two decisions by the Federal Circuit in the six-year-long battle. The first is a 2014 decision that the programming language can be copyrighted, and the second is a 2018 ruling that overturned the jury’s verdict of “fair use.” The Supreme Court had previously rejected Google’s petition over the 2014 decision.If Oracle wins, the case will go back to a federal jury in California, where the only issue will be how much Google should pay in damages. Should Google win on either question, that would end the case.The case is Google v.

2019-11-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has $128 billion of cash. There is almost no purchase too large for the company — in fact, large is exactly what investors are waiting for. And yet, the only stock Berkshire bought last quarter was a dinky retailer, RH.Berkshire disclosed in a regulatory filing Thursday that it took a $212 million stake in RH, a California-based home-furnishings chain valued at $3.3 billion. Buffett could even buy the entire company and it’d still be a puny deal for him. But it was a big deal for RH, because the shares surged 9% in after-hours trading and held near that level early Friday morning.I admit I didn’t even recognize the retailer’s name at first. RH used to be called Restoration Hardware, a place that sells $6,000 linen sofas and elongated wooden dining tables with “forthright silhouettes.” The company shrank its name and supersized its stores, an effort to target a more upscale clientele. It’s even installed some on-site restaurants, a little nourishment to help one ponder a new addition to the ski house. That’s partly what makes RH such a funny investment for Buffett. Not only is the billionaire known for his down-to-earth lifestyle — he’s lived in the same fairly modest house for more than 60 years — but he’s also usually drawn to businesses that mirror the America he sees from his unassuming Omaha office: railroads, truck stops, Dairy Queens, the Nebraska Furniture Mart. Furthermore, Berkshire tends not to waste time on minority stakes in small, specialty chains; its only other retail holdings are Amazon.com Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp., companies valued at $870 billion and $134 billion, respectively. RH was the only new position Berkshire took in the latest quarter, aside from buying common shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp., in which it already purchased $10 billion of preferred equity (part of a financing deal to assist the oil and gas explorer in its takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.). All in all, it was another dull period for Berkshire, whose last splashy stock pick was Amazon earlier in the year. With U.S. equities still on the rise, Buffett, 89, and his investing deputies are struggling to find cheap candidates. Whoever made the call on RH — Todd Combs, Ted Weschler or the Oracle himself — he may have had prescient timing. At the end of May, RH’s price-to-earnings ratio hit a low, and the shares have doubled since then, taking a big leg up in September. That said, RH’s overnight gains drove the shares above analysts’ average target level, which is $181 apiece. “The business remains tough to predict and we believe expectations may now be somewhat elevated,” Bobby Griffin, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates who has the equivalent of a “hold” rating on RH, wrote in a Sept. 11 report, citing the China tariffs and a slowdown in high-end U.S. housing. Similarly, Gordon Haskett Research Advisors wrote to clients Sept. 10 that the firm finds other retailers such as Wayfair Inc., Williams-Sonoma Inc. and At Home Group Inc. more attractive. At the end of the day, though, no matter how RH performs, it won’t have much of an impact on Berkshire’s portfolio. Another quarter has passed without a major acquisition by Berkshire, its cash pile hitting a record yet again. RH may sell a $449 wool felt elephant, but it isn’t the kind of elephant Buffett is after.

2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg) -- A month after the death of Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd, Oracle Corp.’s succession plan is to leave control in the hands of Chairman Larry Ellison and Hurd’s fellow CEO Safra Catz while an internal successor is groomed, people familiar with the matter said. While Ellison has put forth five candidates, none has emerged quickly as the front-runner to join Catz as CEO, and the company is likely to appoint someone president first—or at least give that executive more time to grow into the role, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the company’s private deliberations. Oracle has considered promoting an executive with product or technical experience, one of the people said.Hurd, Oracle’s chief salesman, died in October after taking a short medical leave. Ellison, 75, and Catz, 57, have said they are splitting Hurd’s duties. In September, Ellison promised to give five names to Oracle’s board of executives who could one day be a “next-gen” CEO. He name-checked Steve Miranda, 50, executive vice president of applications development, and Don Johnson, EVP of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, as leaders who would grow over time. Ellison, who also serves as technology chief, said at that time that the software maker would be in no rush to directly replace Hurd, and Oracle remains committed to taking a slow approach, said the people. The software maker has had only three chief executive officers in its 42-year history. Ellison presided over the company for decades before stepping down in 2014, when he was succeeded by Catz and Hurd. The latter two served as presidents before sharing the top job. Currently, Oracle doesn’t have any presidents. Ellison’s desire to promote from within makes it likely the next person appointed to be CEO will first serve as a president.“We should have people in the company that are capable of being promoted into that position,” Ellison said at a meeting with financial analysts in September. “So when there is this succession, it's not rushing out and doing a search. It's knowing we have these assets that are familiar with the company, familiar with the personnel.”While there’s no current rush in naming a CEO, Oracle could accelerate the appointment should the right candidate emerge, the people said. Ellison may be asked about a successor to Hurd at Tuesday's annual shareholder meeting at Oracle’s headquarters in Redwood City, California.Amid Catz’s aversion to public speaking and media interviews, and Ellison’s limited public appearances, Hurd played a special role in Oracle’s C-suite. The usually outgoing executive oversaw sales and regularly met with big corporate customers who spent tens of millions of dollars on Oracle’s collection of software programs. He frequently outlined the company’s vision in meetings with the press and on television.“Mark Hurd loved sales and he loved the deal,” Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities, said in an interview. “Because of that, he ended up touching so much of Oracle. That’s what they need in a successor. Safra’s got the operations. You need somebody who loves sales and is really good at it.”The management succession issue comes at an important time for Oracle. Fiscal-year revenue has increased an average of less than 1% annually in the past five years as Oracle has transitioned to cloud-based computing. The company's sales have declined year-over-year for two of the past four quarters and analysts project growth of just 1.4% in fiscal 2020. Still, investors appear satisfied—the company's shares have gained about 25% this year, matching the rise of the S&P 500.Ellison has placed great trust in Oracle’s product executives, describing some of them as “people who are really running the company.” Besides Miranda and Johnson, Ed Screven, 55, Oracle’s chief corporate architect who ensures products are consistent with the company’s strategy; Andy Mendelsohn, the EVP in charge of database server technologies; and Juan Loaiza, EVP of mission-critical database technologies, are senior leaders who are well-regarded by Ellison, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing his thinking. Many of the executives have proven their loyalty to the boss by staying at Oracle for decades, since it was a much smaller business, but they’re seen as lacking Hurd’s panache and charisma, the people added.By contrast, Loïc Le Guisquet, the chairman for Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan, has sales experience and oversees a sprawling portion of the company’s business. Le Guisquet is set to be promoted to a new global role, said one of the people, but his new title couldn't be confirmed. Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment on its succession plans.Given Ellison’s second title as Oracle’s CTO, and his ownership of a third of the business, he would almost certainly retain veto power over product decisions as long as he remains at the company.Thomas Kurian was seen as an heir to Ellison as the company’s president of product development until he left in September 2018 after an acrimonious split with the billionaire chairman, Bloomberg News has reported. Kurian is now CEO of Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud Platform. Rather than replace Kurian directly, Ellison has largely absorbed his responsibilities and now oversees the executives who reported to Kurian.If Oracle seeks a candidate other than Le Guisquet with more of Hurd’s skills, it has other strong options, the people said. David Donatelli, 54, Oracle’s EVP of the cloud business group, leads sales and marketing strategy for the company’s cloud efforts and was one of Hurd’s deputies. Rich Geraffo, 56, the EVP of a multibillion-dollar part of Oracle’s North American sales organization, also used to answer to Hurd.“We think we're in pretty good shape,” Ellison said in September. “We've got quality and quantity in our management team. These people are all slightly younger than I am. So I think hopefully they're going to be around a long time.”&#92;--With assistance from Ashlee Vance.To contact the author of this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Jillian WardMolly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Delays Decision to Replace Mark Hurd

To prevail, losing bidders must show the agency made its decision as a result of bias -- rather than on the merits of the companies’ proposals, according to procurement experts.“There is not much of a burden of proof on what did the president say,” said David Berteau, president of Professional Services Council, a trade group that represents federal contractors. “The question the Court will look into is what did DoD do based on what the president said?”For Amazon, the fight isn’t just about a single Pentagon contract but its ability to defend its expertise in the competitive federal contracting world -- and the right to say its cloud services are safe and advanced enough to serve even the most complex and risk-averse government clients.The court challenge -- the second involving the cloud bid -- also means the Pentagon will likely have to delay starting a technology program the Defense Department has called critical to its modernization. Oracle Corp. is also appealing a July ruling from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that dismissed its legal challenge to the cloud contract.Amazon said it filed a notice on Nov. 8 with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that it plans to formally protest its loss of the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or JEDI cloud contract. Amazon could seek to delay the start of the contract while it pursues its case.“It’s critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement announcing the company’s decision to file a complaint. “Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias -- and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”In July, President Trump stunned lawmakers and technology companies when he openly questioned whether the JEDI contract was being competitively bid, citing complaints from Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. Trump has long criticized Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on everything from the shipping rates his company pays the U.S. Postal Service to his personal ownership of what Trump calls “the Amazon Washington Post.”It’s not enough for Amazon to allege that Pentagon employees were aware of the president’s opinion on the contract, said Charles Tiefer, a procurement law professor at the University of Baltimore Law School. The company will have to show the Defense Department took his perspective into consideration when they evaluated bids.“There is a well-developed doctrine in the Court of Federal Claims that a contract award can be challenged for bias, but it’s a difficult showing for Amazon to make,” said Tiefer. “The requirements to show bias are very high.”A new book by Guy Snodgrass, a speechwriter to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, alleges that Trump, in the summer of 2018, told Mattis to “screw Amazon” and lock it out of the bid. Mattis didn’t do what Trump asked, Snodgrass wrote. Mattis has criticized the book, but hasn’t commented on the allegation concerning Amazon.The Pentagon JEDI cloud project is intended to modernize the Defense Department’s technology systems and speed up real-time sharing of information across the military. The contract is worth as much as $10 billion over ten years and could offer the winner a bigger foothold in the burgeoning federal cloud market.While no law prohibits a president from weighing in on a contract, federal agencies must follow strict rules about what they can and can’t consider when making an award decision.Agencies must choose vendors based on the criteria outlined in their requests for proposals to avoid inviting a successful legal challenge, according to procurement experts. In the case of JEDI, Pentagon officials said they would pick a winner based on companies’ security strategy, proposed price and execution timeline and their ability to offer portable cloud services to the war fighter among other factors.A study conducted by Rand Corp. found that the U.S Court of Federal claims sustained just 9% of contract protests against the Defense Department from 2008 through 2016. The Government Accountability Office sustained 2.6% of contract protests during the same time period, though a much larger percentage of challenges led the agency to make changes to the procurement decision or terms, according to the study.Amazon was widely seen as the leading contender for the deal because it is the commercial market leader and already won a 2013 cloud deal from the Central Intelligence Agency, paving the way for the company to earn the highest federal cloud security authorizations.The White House requested a briefing on the cloud contract after Fox News aired a sharply critical segment by Tucker Carlson in June. The Defense Department prepared a detailed document pushing back on the Fox program in preparation for the briefing, Bloomberg has reported.Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, said during his confirmation hearing in late October that to the best of his knowledge, no one from the White House reached out to any members of the JEDI cloud contract selection team. The Pentagon will likely continue to argue in court that political influence played no role in its decision to choose Microsoft.To help make its case, Amazon could examine whether there are any differences between how the companies’ bids were evaluated by lower level technical staff on the Pentagon’s JEDI selection team and what Pentagon officials with closer access to the White House decided, said Frank Murray Jr., a procurement lawyer and partner at Foley & Lardner LLP. If top Pentagon officials chose Microsoft over the recommendation of their technical employees, that would be significant piece of evidence for Amazon, Murray said.Amazon could seek documents and interviews with Pentagon staff as part of its legal challenge. Amazon could also argue that the Pentagon erred in the way that it rated the bids from the two companies on metrics such as security, price and technical capabilities.“The nuts and bolts of the case are going to be: how were the proposals evaluated? And were they reasonable?” Murray said.If Amazon’s legal challenge is successful, the judge could force the Defense Department to reevaluate the companies’ proposals or even open up the bidding process again, procurement experts said.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon's $10 Billion Pentagon Challenge: Proving Trump Meddled
2019-11-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. should increase the racial diversity of its board, a group of U.S. lawmakers said, putting a spotlight on the company’s hiring and management practices.“The fact that African Americans make up 13% and Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the U.S. population but 0% of Oracle’s board and leadership team is inexcusable,” the lawmakers said in a Nov. 22 letter from the House Tech Accountability Caucus and Tri-Caucus, which includes the Black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific American caucuses.It’s the latest call for the second-largest software maker and billionaire Chairman Larry Ellison to improve diversity and inclusion. Former employees and the U.S. government have sued the Redwood City, California-based company, alleging it systematically underpaid women and people of color, and many shareholders have supported repeated requests that the board examine if there’s a pay gap between male and female employees.It’s at least the second time this year that Oracle has attracted congressional scrutiny for its diversity practices. In January, the Congressional Black Caucus and House Tech Accountability Caucus wrote to the company expressing dismay about allegations of pay discrimination.This week’s letter was signed by Democrats Robin L. Kelly, Joaquin Castro, Karen Bass and Judy Chu, who chair the various House caucuses, as well as other lawmakers.Amazon, FacebookThe Tech Accountability Caucus previously criticized Amazon.com Inc. for its tepid record of appointing people of color to its board, and Facebook Inc. for allowing marketers to use ethnic affinity to target ads for housing, employment or credit.Amazon has since adopted a policy pledging to consider a diverse slate of candidates for open board seats and added Starbucks Corp. operating chief Rosalind Brewer and former PepsiCo Inc. Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi as directors. In 2016, Facebook updated its policy to disable ethnic targeting for certain ads.“We respectfully request a prompt response from Oracle Corporation regarding our diversity concerns,” the lawmakers wrote. They requested a briefing with the company to discuss the issue, but said it would also accept a written response within 14 days, or a phone call.Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment.In a February response to the earlier congressional letter, the company said it wouldn’t “intentionally discriminate against women and people of color” and was committed to a diverse, nondiscriminatory work culture, according to the lawmakers.Short-ChangedOracle is also contending with a January lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor, which alleged the company short-changed female and minority workers some $400 million in wages.The allegations stem from a 2014 audit by a department unit that enforces equal pay and other non-discrimination matters for federal contractors. Records show that Oracle paid women and minority employees less than others and steered them into lower-level jobs, the department said in court papers. It also alleged that Oracle used H-1B visas to hire scores of Asians and paid them less than employees who were U.S. citizens.In 2017, three female engineers sued Oracle, alleging underpayment compared with male engineers doing the same tasks. An analysis conducted on behalf of the plaintiffs showed the company paid some women about $13,000 less per year on average versus male counterparts. They’re seeking to represent more than 4,000 similarly situated employees.Oracle has denied the allegations in both cases.For three straight years, shareholder Pax World Funds has filed proposals asking the company’s board to identify whether a gender pay gap exists and how to fix it. The proposals have been supported by several large investors, including funds held by BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., but failed to garner majority support. That’s largely because Ellison, who owns about a third of the stock, has opposed the measure.(Updates with shareholder proposal in third paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.net;Anders Melin in New York at amelin3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Peter EichenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle’s Largely White Board Draws Congressional Scrutiny

2019-11-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the Defense Department’s choice of rival Microsoft Corp. for a Pentagon cloud-computing contract worth as much as $10 billion.The lawsuit, which was filed under seal in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, marks Amazon’s most aggressive push to defend its competitive edge in the lucrative and cutthroat world of federal government contracts.Amazon previously said it planned to formally protest its loss of the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract because the evaluation process was deficient.“It’s critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a Nov. 14 statement. “Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias -- and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”Elissa Smith, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department, said in a statement that it, along with the Justice Department, would review the lawsuit. She added that the Pentagon “was confident in the JEDI award. The source selection process was conducted in accordance with the stated criteria in the solicitation and procurement law.”Representatives of Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday night.Read More: Amazon Seen Focusing on Trump in Pentagon Contract ChallengeIn court paperwork, Amazon said the lawsuit was filed under seal because it contains “sensitive” information that “would cause severe competitive harm” if it’s released.Political InfluenceMicrosoft asked to intervene in the suit, arguing in a filing that the case will “directly affect Microsoft’s interests” and “carries the potential for significant economic and other harms to Microsoft.”It’s widely expected that Amazon will argue that its loss of the high-profile contract was due to improper political influence by President Donald Trump. Exhibits filed with Friday’s complaint include Trump’s comments to the press in July as well as a Fox News segment called “Swamp Watch.”In July, Trump stunned lawmakers and technology companies when he openly questioned whether the JEDI contract was being competitively bid, citing complaints from Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.

2019-12-04,"(Bloomberg) -- If you want to know how Alphabet Inc.’s new Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai will run the company you don’t need to look very far -- he’s essentially been doing it for several years already.Pichai, a 47-year-old engineer, grew up in India and immigrated to the U.S. to attend graduate school. His resume reads like the typical Silicon Valley operator: a Master’s degree from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and a stint as a consultant at McKinsey & Co.He joined Google in 2004 and started amassing responsibility for some of Google’s most popular products, including Gmail, the Chrome browser and Android. Former employees often describe him as a collaborative and loyal colleague. He even turned down a big new grant of stock in 2018 because he felt he was already paid generously, according to a person familiar with the matter.When Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin created the Alphabet holding company in 2015, Pichai was chosen to run Google, whose businesses including YouTube, Maps and Gmail bring in almost all of the company’s revenue. That left the founders to chase visions of building self-driving cars and technology to make people live longer. Brin and Page stepped away from their posts as president and CEO of Alphabet on Tuesday, handing total executive control to Pichai although they’ll stay on the board.In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, Pichai enjoys a positive reputation as the guy keeping the cash flowing at Google. But, partly because Brin and Page were still technically in the picture, Pichai is less well-known outside of tech circles. When the U.S. Senate held a hearing last year to ask what the big tech companies were doing to stop election meddling on their platforms, it invited Page first, not Pichai. Neither went and Google was represented by an empty chair, although Pichai made the trek later to a House Judiciary Committee meeting.Now, there won’t be any confusion about who the CEO is.“Going forward, the story is much simpler: Sundar is the only sheriff in town,” analysts at Evercore ISI wrote in a note on Tuesday.Pichai has done more than just keep the lights on at Google. He’s put artificial intelligence at the center of the company’s pitch to customers and investors, arguing that Google’s prowess in AI technology will give it an edge in all its different businesses, from cloud computing and search ads to health care software and mobile phones. He replaced Diane Greene with former Oracle Corp. executive Thomas Kurian as head of Google’s cloud business. Under Pichai, Kurian has started ramping up acquisitions to expand the unit’s footprint, buying Alooma, Looker, Elastifile and CloudSimple this year alone.Pichai’s actions as head of Google could give a clue as to how he will run the broader conglomerate. In the last couple of years, Google has poached employees or whole units from the Alphabet constellation, bringing them inside to bolster its own projects. Chronicle, a cybersecurity unit, was supposed to be independent, but in June Google’s cloud division swallowed it whole. The same thing happened to health-related projects started by DeepMind, Alphabet’s AI research arm.Pichai has also leaned into his assumed role as Google’s defender-in-chief, making trips to Washington to explain the company’s decisions to lawmakers. Internally, he has pushed back against employee activists who are clamoring for change on a variety of issues from military contracts to the company’s handling of sexual harassment allegations. He reduced the number of the once-hallowed town hall meetings Google workers use to vent their frustrations with management to once a month, down from every week.And last month Google fired four employees who had been pushing for the company to stop selling software to U.S. immigration authorities. Google says the employees violated their colleagues’ privacy by tracking the calendars of certain executives and sharing details outside of the company.The four employees say they plan to file complaints with the National Labor Relations Board.Managing worker dissent and regulatory scrutiny while playing catch-up in cloud and keeping up growth at the core ads business is a tall order, but the market seems to have confidence in Pichai. Google’s stock ended the day up 1.9% after the announcement.At a conference last year, an audience member asked Pichai about the employee revolts against Google’s artificial intelligence work with the U.S. government. In a rare moment of directness, Pichai pushed back against the idea that instead of running the company, the company was running him.At the end of the day, he’s the CEO, Pichai said. “We don’t run the company by referendum.”To contact the reporter on this story: Gerrit De Vynck in New York at gdevynck@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Alphabet’s New CEO Finally Has a Title Fitting His Role

2019-12-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Larry Page and Sergey Brin just got a $2.3 billion retirement gift from investors.The Google co-founders, who announced Tuesday they were stepping down from day-to-day management of parent Alphabet Inc., added more than $1 billion each to their net worth today as the firm’s shares rose 1.9% in New York.They each own about 6% of the internet giant and still control Alphabet through special voting shares.The gains come as investors welcome Sundar Pichai’s elevation to chief executive officer of Alphabet, replacing Page in the role. It means the three most valuable U.S. tech firms no longer have a founder at the helm.Like Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook and Microsoft Corp.’s Satya Nadella, Pichai is a long-time lieutenant who steadily worked his way up the corporate ladder. More than 15 years after he joined the Mountain View-based company he’s replacing Page in the top job. Brin is stepping down as president, leaving Pichai as undisputed leader.The shift reflects Google’s accession into corporate middle age. Started in a California garage by Brin and Page in 1998, the firm had revenue of $137 billion in 2018 and today boasts a market value of $893 billion. That’s behind only Apple and Microsoft on the S&P 500 Index.Founder FreeOther Silicon Valley giants are also founder free. Larry Ellison’s Oracle Corp. is headed by Safra Catz, though Ellison is still involved as the company’s chairman. Some younger companies -- such as Uber Technologies Inc. and We Co. -- have turned to outsiders amid turmoil.There are some notable exceptions. Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg are still at the helm of Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. respectively, which are the fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. companies by market value.Such a transition has proved to be a boon for Apple and Microsoft. The iPhone maker’s shares have risen by more than 400% since Cook took the helm in August 2011 and Microsoft has quadrupled on Nadella’s watch.Since 2015, Pichai has served as CEO of Google, by far the company’s biggest division. During his time in that job, Alphabet’s shares doubled in price even as the company wrestled with increased scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers.Unusual PositionTheir success has placed the trio among America’s richest executives. Each are worth hundreds of millions of dollars thanks to stock awards they’ve received.Pichai, 47, is in an unusual position for a top executive. Unlike Cook and Nadella, who stand fourth and sixth on Bloomberg’s executive pay ranking, almost all of Pichai’s stock awards have vested, filings show.By contrast, Cook, 59, still has as many as 1.8 million restricted stock units worth about $500 million set to vest through August 2021, according to a recent filing. Nadella, 52, could earn as many as 1.8 million Microsoft shares through a long-term performance-based stock award that is currently worth about $275 million.The Alphabet board will likely move to rectify this discrepancy. But however they decide to compensate Pichai, he’ll still lag far behind the wealth accrued by Brin and Page. The pair have a combined net worth of about $126 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.(Updates net worth gains and share price in second paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Anders Melin, Mark Bergen and Gerrit De Vynck.To contact the reporter on this story: Tom Metcalf in London at tmetcalf7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill, Peter EichenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Alphabet’s New Boss Means $2 Billion for Departing Founders
2019-12-04,"Not long ago, Akerna Corp. (NASDAQ:KERN) would have been a perfect mash-up of two industries - that is, cloud software and the cannabis sector. However, as seen in the past few months, the second half of the story has gone south. The cannabis industry has been in a grueling tailspin, as seen with the performance of operators like Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) and Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC).Source: Shutterstock So as should be no surprise, Akerna stock has been quite volatile. The company went public in mid-June on the NASDAQ after an eight-month due diligence process with the exchange. On the first day of trading, KERN stock shot up above $15. However, as of today, the shares are trading at $9.  * 9 Tech Stocks You Wish You'd Bought During 2019 Consider that becoming public was not through a traditional IPO. Rather, Akerna merged into a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company), called MTech Acquisition.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet regardless of all this, what are the prospects for the company? Could KERN stock be a good way to play the cannabis sector? Akerna Stock's BackgroundAkerna's origins go back to Jessica Billingsley, who saw how technology could transform the cannabis market. Prior to this, she had a successful career, having started her first company when she was only 22-years-old.There are several parts of the Akerna platform. First, there is the MJ Freeway application that provides a seed-to-sale management tracking system for state-licensed dispensaries, cultivators, manufacturers and distributors. Think of it as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) for inventory and legal compliance. True, there are many other management systems on the market, like from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Workday (NYSE:WDAY), but they do not handle the intricacies of the cannabis business.Next, Akerna has Leaf Data Systems. This is focused on government agencies that need assistance with managing the complex regulations. The Leaf Data Systems application helps to effectively track plant, product and waste, allowing for maintaining quality standards.In the latest earnings call, Billingsley noted: &quot;For nearly 10 years, we have refined a technology that pinpoints every aspect of every gram of cannabis trapped in our system. The plot of land that is grown on soil nutrients, water and light intake, additional ingredients for manufactured product, when it was shipped out and in what batch and finally, where and when the product was sold and to whom.&quot; Bottom Line On KERN StockEven though Akerna is targeting an interesting category, there are some issues to keep in mind. First of all, monetization could prove difficult in the coming months. With the shakeout in the cannabis market, there will be fewer resources to make investments in new technologies.Next, the government market is far from easy. The sales cycles can be long and the budgets are usually tight. What's more, as of June 30, about 39% of Akerna's revenues actually came from the government agencies of Pennsylvania and Washington. Akerna recently snagged Utah as a customer.According to a recent regulatory filing with the SEC: &quot;Further, even if a contract is awarded, there are strict procedures that government agencies follow when it comes to reimbursement of the costs incurred in the course of fulfilling contracts. Accordingly, it is possible that some or all costs might not be reimbursed under a government contract as contemplated by us.&quot;And finally, the revenue base is fairly small for a public company. In the most recent quarter, the top line hit $3.2 million, up about 39%.Given the uncertainty in the cannabis market and the difficulties with government contracting, growth could be choppy. Thus for now, it's a good idea to be cautious on KERN stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli.

2019-12-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. claims it lost a Pentagon cloud contract valued at as much as $10 billion because of political interference by President Donald Trump, according to the judge overseeing the case.Federal Claims Court Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith said during a court proceeding last week that Amazon’s lawsuit argues that the Pentagon didn’t award the cloud deal to Microsoft Corp. on the basis of a fair evaluation of the companies’ bids.“Plaintiff contends that the procurement process was compromised and negatively affected by the bias expressed publicly by the president and commander in chief Donald Trump against plaintiff,” Campbell-Smith said in a recording of a status hearing released Thursday by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington.The judge’s comments were the first public confirmation that Amazon cited bias by Trump as grounds to overturn the award to Microsoft. Trump has long criticized Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on everything from the shipping rates his company pays the U.S. Postal Service to his personal ownership of what Trump calls “the Amazon Washington Post.”The contract was awarded to Microsoft “despite what plaintiff characterizes as its depth of experience, superior technology and proven record of success in handling the most sensitive government data,” Campbell-Smith said.Amazon filed a lawsuit under seal with the court last month to formally protest its loss of the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract.For More: Amazon’s $10 Billion Pentagon Challenge: Proving Trump MeddledCampbell-Smith said Amazon is seeking to prohibit the Defense Department from proceeding without a new evaluation or award decision. The company is requesting that the Pentagon either reevaluate bids or reopen the procurement to allow for bid revisions, the judge said.Campbell-Smith also granted Microsoft’s request to intervene in the suit.In July, Trump stunned lawmakers and technology companies when he openly questioned whether the JEDI contract was being competitively bid, citing complaints from Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, said during his confirmation hearing in late October that to the best of his knowledge, no one from the White House reached out to any members of the JEDI cloud contract selection team.The Pentagon’s JEDI cloud project is designed to consolidate the department’s cloud computing infrastructure and modernize its technology systems. The contract is worth as much as $10 billion over 10 years and could offer the winner a bigger foothold in the burgeoning federal cloud market.(Updates with Amazon seeking new evaluation and decision from seventh paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Amazon Suit Claims Trump Bias Tainted Cloud Bid, Judge Says"

2019-12-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. claims the Pentagon failed to fairly judge its bid for a cloud contract worth up to $10 billion because President Donald Trump viewed company founder Jeffrey Bezos as his “political enemy.”Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud unit, claimed in a lawsuit that was made public on Monday that the Defense Department ignored Amazon’s superior technology and awarded the contract to Microsoft Corp. despite its “key failures” to comply with requirements for the so-called Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract.The Pentagon made those errors because of improper interference by Trump, who Amazon said “launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks to steer the JEDI Contract away from AWS to harm his perceived political enemy -- Jeffrey P. Bezos,” according to the lawsuit. The president has long criticized Bezos, especially for his ownership of The Washington Post.Defense Department spokeswoman Elissa Smith denied any external factors influenced the bidding process. Microsoft spokeswoman Janelle Poole said in a statement that the Pentagon “ran a detailed, thorough and fair process in determining the needs of the warfighter were best met by Microsoft.”Amazon, which filed its lawsuit under seal last month in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, is seeking to prohibit the Defense Department from proceeding without a new evaluation or award decision. The department won’t start work on the contract beyond certain “preparatory activities” until February 11, according to the lawsuit.“Basic justice requires reevaluation of proposals and a new award decision,” the company said in its lawsuit. “The stakes are high. The question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends.”The Pentagon’s JEDI project is designed to consolidate the department’s cloud computing infrastructure and modernize its technology systems. Amazon was widely seen as the front-runner for the contract because it previously won a lucrative cloud deal from the Central Intelligence Agency and had earned the highest levels of federal security authorizations.Amazon said in its lawsuit that the Pentagon’s “pervasive errors are hard to understand and impossible to assess separate and apart from the President’s repeatedly expressed determination to, in the words of the President himself, ‘screw Amazon.’”Amazon was citing a new book by Guy Snodgrass, a speechwriter to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, that alleges that Trump, in the summer of 2018, told Mattis to “screw Amazon” and lock it out of the bid. Mattis didn’t do what Trump asked, Snodgrass wrote. Mattis has criticized the book, but hasn’t commented on the allegation concerning Amazon.Amazon’s lawsuit also lists other comments and actions by Trump and the Defense Department to make its case that the Pentagon bowed to political pressure when making the award to Microsoft. In 2016, Trump said that when that he would become president, Amazon would “have problems” and that the company was “getting away with murder,” according to the lawsuit.The company also cited the president’s comments during a press conference in July, when he openly questioned whether the JEDI contract was being competitively bid, citing complaints from Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. Later that month, Trump “doubled down” on that rhetoric when he tweeted television coverage that characterized the JEDI contract as a “Bezos bailout,” the lawsuit says.As Trump’s criticisms persisted, Amazon alleges, the Pentagon took numerous actions to “artificially level the playing field” between the company and its competitors during the bidding process, including a decision in mid-2018 to refuse to evaluate past contract performance. For example, the lawsuit alleges that months after the Pentagon initially reviewed Amazon’s proposal, the Defense Department changed one of its requirements for hosting sensitive data, which prevented Amazon from leveraging its existing data centers and increased its total proposed price.The Seattle-based company also contends the Pentagon ignored critical aspects of its proposal while overlooking Microsoft’s deficiencies on concerns regarding security, price and its ability to offer a marketplace of third-party technology products.While no law prohibits a president from weighing in on a contract, federal agencies must follow strict rules about what they can and can’t consider when making an award decision. Agencies must choose vendors based on the criteria outlined in their requests for proposals to avoid inviting a successful legal challenge, according to procurement experts.Still, the experts have said loosing bidders such as Amazon face steep odds to successfully overturn a contracting decision on the legal basis of political or vendor bias.A study conducted by Rand Corp. found that the U.S Court of Federal claims sustained just 9% of contract protests against the Defense Department from 2008 through 2016. The Government Accountability Office sustained 2.6% of contract protests during the same time period, though a much larger percentage of challenges led the agency to make changes to the procurement decision or terms, according to the study.(Updates with comment from Microsoft starting in fourth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Cites Trump Bias at ‘Enemy’ Bezos in Cloud Deal Loss

2019-12-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The Chinese government is taking further steps to remove foreign technology from state agencies and other organizations, a clear sign of determination for more independence amid escalating tensions with the U.S.Beijing will likely replace as many as 20 million computers at government agencies with domestic products over the next three years, according to research from China Securities. More than 100 trial projects for domestic products were completed in July, the brokerage firm said. The Financial Times newspaper said the Communist Party’s Central Office earlier this year ordered state offices and public institutions to shift away from foreign hardware and software.The government under President Xi Jinping has been trying for years to replace technologies from abroad, and particularly from the U.S. Bloomberg News reported in 2014 that Beijing was aiming to purge most foreign technology from its banks, the military, government agencies and state-owned enterprises by 2020. The country’s Made in China 2025 plan also set out specific goals for technology independence, although the policy has been de-emphasized after contributing to trade war tensions.U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive policies against China and its leading companies have given the effort renewed urgency. His administration banned U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei Technologies Co. this year and blacklisted other Chinese firms.“The trade war has exposed various areas of Chinese economic weakness, which Beijing seems determined to rectify,” said Brock Silvers, managing director of Adamas Asset Management. “If the decision pushes Trump to finally come down hard with a more forceful ban of Chinese tech, however, China may one day regret having gone so public with its policy so soon.”While the current push is narrow in scope, it is designed as part of the broad, long-standing effort to decrease China’s reliance on foreign technologies and boost its domestic industry. The goal is to substitute 30% of hardware in state agencies next year, 50% in 2021 and 20% in 2022, China Securities estimated, based on government requests and clients’ budgets.The research, from September, detailed Beijing’s goals. The FT reported the number of computers to be replaced could reach 30 million, attributing the figures to China Securities. The newspaper said the goal is to use “secure and controllable” technology as part of the country’s Cyber Security Law passed in 2017.Starting next year, key industries such as finance, energy and telecom will test more domestic products in trials that may last years, the firm said. Chinese banks are supposed to shift from International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. to more diversified X86 architecture suppliers and then eventually to fully made-in-China hardware. China has decided to adopt ARM architecture for its domestic hardware, China Securities said.“The China-U.S. trade war could also help to breed a new market for home-made products,” China Securities analyst Shi Zerui wrote.Still, Beijing’s push has proven difficult because its domestic industry hasn’t yet shown itself capable of matching foreign technologies in certain sectors. Particularly hard to replace, for example, are semiconductors from suppliers like Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp., as well as software from Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.“While large suppliers such as Microsoft and IBM are undoubtedly worried, many high-end components, like chipsets, can’t be easily replaced,” Silvers said.&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Beijing Pushes for Removal of Foreign Tech in More State Offices

2019-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. will move its marquee annual user conference to Las Vegas, abandoning its longtime venue of San Francisco due to the rising cost of visiting the city and its homeless crisis.Oracle’s OpenWorld will be held in Las Vegas beginning next year, the San Francisco Travel Association said Tuesday in a statement. The travel group, in an email reported earlier by CNBC, said the software company committed the conference to Las Vegas for three years, costing San Francisco an estimated $64 million. Oracle, headquartered about 22 miles south of San Francisco in Redwood City, California, told the travel authority that its conference guests were unhappy with San Francisco’s dirty streets and costly hotel rates, according to CNBC.Las Vegas is a key destination for technology conferences. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud-computing arm, Dell Technologies Inc., Adobe Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. are just a few of the companies that host conferences in the desert city -- drawn to its large venues and inexpensive hotel room rates.Oracle declined to respond to requests for comment on the move.Oracle also holds OpenWorld conferences in Dubai, London, Singapore and Sao Paulo. The company encourages customers and partners to “register for an OpenWorld near you,” reducing the importance of the San Francisco gathering, where the company unveils new software products. The San Francisco OpenWorld generally attracted about 60,000 attendees. For years, the conference has been overshadowed by Dreamforce, rival Salesforce.com Inc.’s annual confab that the company describes as the world’s largest software conference. Dreamforce had more than 170,000 registered attendees in November.San Francisco hasn’t been a happy home for OpenWorld or Dreamforce for years, with residents complaining about street closures caused by the conferences and a surge of pedestrian traffic downtown. Local hotels swell room rates in anticipation of demand among attendees.Oracle held the first official OpenWorld conference at San Francisco’s Moscone Center in 1996, according to its website. The company’s user gatherings date back to 1982, when 50 attendees gathered for International Oracle Users Week at a hotel in San Francisco.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Oracle Conference Leaves San Francisco, Costing City $64 Million"

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. gave a sales forecast for the current quarter that was in line with analysts’ estimates, signaling muted demand for the company’s software amid its uneven transition to cloud computing.Revenue will increase 1% to 3% in the fiscal third quarter, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said Thursday on a conference call with analysts. Wall Street projected a 2.3% jump.Earlier, the world’s second-largest software maker reported sales gained less than 1% to $9.61 billion in the period that ended Nov. 30, short of analysts’ projections of $9.65 billion. Shares declined 3% in extended trading after closing at $56.47 in New York. The stock has gained 25% this year.Oracle’s report was the first since the October death of Mark Hurd, its top sales executive and one of the company’s two chief executive officers. Chairman Larry Ellison said on the call that the company had no plans to replace Hurd, leaving Catz as sole CEO. He pointed toward Oracle’s next line of executives, who lead business divisions, saying, “those people will be the next CEO when Safra and I retire, which will be no time soon.”Since Hurd’s death, Ellison and Catz have sought to reassure investors about the company’s stability, emphasizing Oracle’s advantage in the market for financial planning applications, where it’s seeing some of its strongest sales growth.While Oracle has made little headway in its effort to compete with the biggest cloud companies to rent computing power and storage, it remains a leader in database software. Now, the company is betting on its new Autonomous Database, which runs without a need for human administrators, to spur revenue in the face of strong competition from Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud division.After inconsistent sales growth the past five years, Catz pledged to investors in September that revenue would accelerate this fiscal year and next, and that earnings per share would grow by a double-digit percentage. To help reach that goal, the company that month announced a new artificial intelligence-driven operating system, as well as partnerships with software makers such as VMware Inc. and Box Inc.In the fiscal second quarter, revenue from cloud services and license support climbed 2.6% to $6.8 billion. While that metric includes sales from hosting customers’ data on the cloud, a large portion is generated by maintenance fees for traditional software housed on clients’ corporate servers.Cloud license and on-premise license sales decreased 7.5% to $1.13 billion in the period, suggesting the company is signing fewer new deals.Profit, excluding certain items, was 90 cents a share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 89 cents. In the current quarter, Oracle projected earnings of 95 cents a share to 97 cents a share. Analysts, on average, estimated 96 cents a share.(Updates with forecast in the second paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Projects Revenue In Line With Analysts’ Estimates

2019-12-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. slumped Friday after the company’s quarterly sales trailed expectations. Analysts say forecasts suggest a sharp growth acceleration in the fiscal fourth quarter is needed to meet the company’s year-end target.The culprit for the consolidated sales miss was a shortfall in license revenue brought on by continued effects of a sales reorganziation earlier this year, as well as “price discipline,” according to RBC’s Alex Zukin and other sell-side analysts.Fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 faces the most difficult year-ago comparison (4% growth in constant currency) since the company’s second quarter of fiscal 2018. And the environment is tough, Deutsche Bank added.Shares of Oracle fell as much as 3.5%, the biggest intraday decline since Sept. 12. The stock has gained 22% year to date, underperforming both the S&P 500 and its large-cap tech peers.Here’s more of what analysts said following the report:Raymond James, Michael Turits“The company evinced confidence in second half momentum, which it expects to carry into F21 around back office applications (HCM/ERP), cloud @ customer deployments, new versions of Autonomous Database, and diminishing headwinds from data cloud decline”Management also indicated that the second half benefits from transactional (license/hardware) businessTurits believes that for Oracle to see fiscal 2020 constant-currency acceleration following the “slight” misses in the second-quarter actual sales figure and the third-quarter forecast “would mean an extremely steep back half ramp”Given the current set up, the analyst believes that fiscal 2020 revenue growth will decelerate to 2.2% on a constant-currency basisEstimates 2.9% growth for next year, “as the drivers above continue to play out”Rates outperformWhat Bloomberg Intelligence says:“While management commentary about the increased use of Oracle’s new autonomous database product is encouraging with 2,000 new customers and triple-digit growth, weak total license sales shows that clients are taking time to spend more on other new products,” wrote analyst Anurag Rana.Rana doesn’t see this trend changing in the near-term given weakening global macroeconomic conditions that “could even hurt cloud applications sales.”Wedbush, Steve Koenig“We attribute the miss to database license headwinds from a first-quarter tech sales reorg -- which separated cloud and premise sales and likely resulted in smaller deal sizes -- and declining sales of vertical applications licenses”Management was upbeat on prospects for the second half, as large autonomous database transactions get recognized this fiscal year and cloud database velocity picks up, Koenig saidNoted “longer term, these prospects seem promising, but we suspect that any uptick in FY20 year-end tech segment performance would be mostly seasonality (much like in FY19), and a secular upturn in ORCL’s tech segment is likely many more quarters in the offing”The analyst is “more convinced” of Oracle’ progress in cloud applications than cloud infrastructureMaintains neutral rating, as he looks for “meaningful progress” in rebooting database growth on a more sustained basis; price target $56 from $55Deutsche Bank, Karl KeirsteadThe third-quarter forecast for just 1% to 3% constant-currency sales growth implies “a huge growth acceleration” in the fourth quarter “against a very tough compare and in a tougher environment” in order for the full-year to reach Oracle’s forecastKeirstead remains “skeptical about any sustainable growth acceleration”Rates holdTo contact the reporter on this story: Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle’s Need for ‘Steep’ Sales Climb Leaves Street Cautious

2019-12-21,"(Bloomberg) -- At the Federal Reserve, 2020 will be all about making the repo market boring again. Policy makers will find this easier said than done.The central bank’s liquidity injections -- including almost half a trillion dollars earmarked to ensure New Year’s Eve is a snooze -- and Treasury bill purchases have nudged the vital market for repurchase agreements back toward normalcy after a funding crunch sent rates soaring in September. This has anchored the Fed’s benchmark rate firmly within policy makers’ preferred range of 1.50% to 1.75% and caused T-bill yields to fall.But next year will test whether the Fed can end its interventions without chaos re-emerging. Chairman Jerome Powell recently said the Fed isn’t trying to eliminate all volatility from markets. However, if the repo market is erratic, it signals the Fed doesn’t have good control over the financial system’s plumbing. That’s something policy makers and the broader market can’t tolerate.“It is all about credibility,” said Peter Yi, senior vice president of short duration fixed income at Northern Trust Asset Management in Chicago. “Even if you announce some fancy new trains, you also have to make sure they run on time. The Fed is going to have an important role in how 2020 plays out.”Since the rate on overnight repo spiked to 10% on Sept. 17 from around 2%, the central bank has been conducting overnight and term repo operations to help rebuild banking reserves, adding $237 billion of liquidity. It’s also prepared to inject up to $490 billion around Dec. 31.This year proved the repo market isn’t working without the Fed’s help, and the next issue is how to wean the market off of these liquidity injections without causing a disruption, according to Lale Topcuoglu, senior fund manager and head of credit at J O Hambro Capital Management Ltd.“We may have December in control,” Topcuoglu said on Bloomberg Television. “The question is, there’s January. There’s February. There’s March quarter-end. There’s April.”The last month on her list could be especially tricky. The U.S. tends to issue fewer Treasury bills in April because Americans’ income-tax payments leave the government flush with cash. This could eventually create “intense competition” for T-bills, especially with government-fund assets at record levels, said Jefferies money-market economist Thomas Simons. That could drive bill rates even lower.Money-market fund managers are already having to adjust their allocations. Rob Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, said the Fed’s intervention has caused funds to put less into repo and move out of T-bills and into coupons in order to boost their returns by a few basis points.If downward pressure continues on short-term rates, Sabatino said money funds may opt to return to the central bank’s infrequently used overnight reverse repo facility. Usage of that program has dwindled to $5 billion a day in 2019, down from $11.9 billion in 2018.The Fed says it plans to buy $60 billion a month of T-bills to keep boosting reserves until sometime in the second quarter. But the timing is fluid given that policy makers haven’t figured out exactly how much the appropriate level of reserves is. Officials have said it’s probably at least where reserves were in September, which was about $1.3 trillion. Strategists at TD Securities and Bank of America suspect it’ll end up around $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion.“The Fed has not given the market really any good guidance about what the end game is, and frankly it’s high time,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Bank of America. He wants more concrete guidance on the level of reserves the central bank is targeting and on the prospects for regulatory changes.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in October that the bank was unable to deploy cash to calm the market because of liquidity regulations put in after the 2008 financial crisis. Powell said he’s open to ideas for modifying supervisory practices that don’t undermine the safety and soundness of the financial system.Many market participants want a sense from the Fed on whether it will create a standing repo facility, a tool that would let eligible banks convert Treasuries into reserves on demand at an administered rate. Powell said Dec. 11 that it will take some time to evaluate and create parameters for that.Northern Trust’s Yi said the Fed will eventually have to establish a more permanent facility with expanded counterparties, as well as continue bill purchases to boost excess reserves. Given Powell’s comments, UBS’s Sabatino is skeptical the central bank will ever introduce such a tool, even though many are clamoring for it.“I wouldn’t hold my breath on a standing repo facility in the first half of next year or any time at all,” he said.This lack of clarity on the Fed’s long-term objectives increases the likelihood the central bank becomes more entrenched in the daily fabric of the funding markets. That will make it harder for the space to function on its own and even more difficult for policy makers to untangle themselves.“Every single day we’re getting our funding from the Fed, that starts to get ingrained in the business,” said NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn. “The longer they go on as the major source of liquidity, the harder it’s going to be to extricate themselves.”&#92;--With assistance from Emily Barrett.To contact the reporter on this story: Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Greg ChangFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",The Fed Is Entrenched in the Repo Market. How Does It Get Out?
2019-12-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Imagine you are a longtime Wall Street denizen, accustomed to analyzing trends in the public equity markets, sovereign interest rates, foreign exchange and corporate credit. You think you have a good handle on all these large asset classes.But suddenly, the plumbing of the entire financial system goes haywire in mid-September, and no one knows why. You are fielding questions about the overnight repurchase agreement market and whether this is another banking crisis in the making. Scouring previous research, you see that one analyst at Credit Suisse AG was warning about a potential repo squeeze before this episode happened. His name: Zoltan Pozsar.It almost has a mystical aura — Zoltan is derived from “sultan”; it may or may not be the name of a grand prince of the Hungarians; and there’s even a Zoltan fortune-teller toy. As Bloomberg Businessweek noted in a profile last week, in which Pozsar was dubbed a “repo oracle,” he worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York starting in 2008 and was known for creating a map of the financial system that included repo and “shadow” banks outside of traditional lending. If anyone had the bonafides to diagnose what ails the short-term funding markets, it certainly seems as if it would be him.Those past credentials are part of what made Pozsar’s Dec. 9 report on the repo market all the more alarming. Titled “Countdown to QE4?” it emphasized from the opening paragraph that “reserves are still insufficient; there are no true ‘excess’ reserves; and large U.S. banks’ G-SIB scores are shaping up to be a severe binding constraint heading into the year-end turn.” “The Fed has been slow to recognize the full implications of this situation,” he continued. “The day we run out of reserves would be the day when the world would stop spinning. No, this is not an overstatement.” Pozsar concluded that U.S. Treasury yields could spike around the end of the year and that the Fed would have to shift from buying only short-term bills to purchasing longer-dated government debt — another round of quantitative easing in no uncertain terms.Predictably, these comments rocked Wall Street, especially among those who traffic in financial doomsday scenarios. The report was seemingly so widely read that a reporter asked Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his Dec. 11 press conference what extra steps the central bank would take to address year-end funding pressures in FX swaps and repo markets. Perhaps understanding the origin of the question, Powell said the central bank was willing to purchase longer-dated Treasuries if necessary.Now, just a week away from the turn of the calendar, there are signs that the market will avoid the worst-case scenario — something Pozsar had said “we are on track to realize.” Most notably, primary dealers submitted just $31.3 billion in bids for the Fed’s 14-day term repo operation on Dec. 19 and then $28.8 billion in bids for a 15-day term operation on Dec. 23, both less than the $35 billion on offer. By contrast, the first four term offerings for year-end were oversubscribed. It appears that the central bank’s plan to offer almost half a trillion dollars through repo operations for year-end is easing any lingering anxiety over another funding squeeze.Few strategists are willing to sound the all clear just yet, given the unexpected tumult just a few months ago. It still looks as if repo rates will lurch higher on Dec. 31, but perhaps not to an unmanageable degree.Suffice to say, few if any are particularly thrilled with the way the Fed has handled the repo market in recent months. As I wrote last month, it seemed as if central bankers were simply throwing the kitchen sink at funding markets and hoping it would be enough to calm them down. Maybe it’s just coincidence, but just days after Pozsar’s note sounded the alarm about year-end, the Fed pledged an additional $365 billion of term repo operations to provide funding through January. Pozsar, in the Businessweek profile, seemed to walk back his call for QE4 and claim victory even if his dire prediction doesn’t come to pass. “If the year-end is less of a problem because of the repo bazooka we got from the Fed, and if the message of my report played a part in getting that bazooka, then that’s a nice way to be proven wrong,” he said. But he still sees something ominous on the horizon for the repo market: “I think the system will get gummed up again.” For the Fed, getting past year-end would be enough of a victory. The structural issues that Pozsar flags, like incentives within global systemically important banks to cut back on market-making in the FX swap and repo markets, can’t be addressed so quickly — or, at least, not in a way that’s palatable to central bank officials. Policy makers are advocating for a standing repo facility to alleviate any funding strains, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan each saying in recent weeks that they want to see that come together next year.Getting into the New Year without a massive disruption would be a victory for all of Wall Street. As I wrote during the September chaos, repo is not something that every investor needs to understand in-depth. They just need to have confidence that it’ll function smoothly day in and day out. It’s why Pozsar hit such a nerve when he wrote that running out of bank reserves would stop the world from spinning. Not to jinx it, but it looks as if the sun will rise come 2020.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-01-03,"For holders of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, it's been a disappointing 2019. The return of AMZN stock was about 23%, which underperformed the 35.2% gain by the NASDAQ. And  Amazon stock greatly lagged Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2019.Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com That performance, though, is not necessarily something to panic over.  AMZN stock has been a standout over the long-term. For the past 15 years, its average annual return was about 28%.Yet the performance of AMZN stock in 2019 should still be a warning sign, and it's apparent that Wall Street is getting a bit antsy about the company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirst of all, the company is stretched, with investments in a myriad of categories like streaming, healthcare, groceries, devices, apparel, and lending/payments. So far, Jeff Bezos has been able to somehow manage the complexities,  but it won't get any easier for him. History shows that AMZN's management will ultimately get overwhelmed, as happened to conglomerates like GE (NYSE:GE).And with Amazon's annual revenues over $230 billion, it is getting harder for the company to prevent its growth from slowing. Interestingly, as the company has become larger, it has become more vulnerable to potential antitrust actions.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers  AWSSo what is the biggest risk facing AMZN stock?  Well, it could easily be the company's cloud business, which it calls Amazon Web Services or AWS.  Over the past ten years, AWS has been the biggest positive contributor to Amazon's profits. In fact, if Amazon did not get into the cloud business, the company would be much smaller today.  Note that AWS currently accounts for 70% of the company's operating income. In other words, AWS has masked the low margins of the company's core e-commerce business while enabling AMZN to invest in new categories.But there are some danger signs emerging  for  AWS.  Just look at the competition.  Nowadays AWS must take on numerous rivals like SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), MSFT and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).  All of those companies have the resources to put up a tough fight against AWS, as they all have substantial capital, technical talent, global customer bases and extensive product lines.Because of all that, Amazon is starting to lose some of its advantages. AWS' offerings now look comparable to those of  Microsoft's Azure, for example,. Consider that MSFT recently won a coveted $10 billion cloud contract with the US. Department of Defense. No doubt, this will likely lead to other major contracts for Azure. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives: &quot;Microsoft remains in an enviable position heading into 2020 on the heels of its cloud success as it continues to fire on all cylinders around its Office 365 and Azure strategic vision.&quot;Microsoft, along with other mega tech operators, also can be price competitive, since it has other high-margin businesses.And, in an ominous development for AMZN stock,  AWS' margins and growth are both slowing. In Q3, its growth came in at about 35%, versus  the 40%+ rate that it was generating not long ago. Its margins fell from 31.1% in Q3 of 2018 to 25.1% in Q3 of 2019.On the earnings call, there was little explanation for the weakening of AWS. But it does seem like a good bet that the competition is starting to take a toll. The Bottom Line on AMZN StockAgain, there's probably no reason to panic. AWS still throws off substantial cash flows, and its growth is still fairly strong, given its large revenue base.But in the tech world, things can go sideways fast. And given the fact that AMZN stock fetches a high valuation and relies heavily on AWS, the unit's unexpected deceleration could be a big-time problem for Amazon stock.  Thus, it's a good idea to be cautious on AMZN and keep an eye on how its business progresses.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

A defeat, Google has argued, would restrict further innovation in the computing industry.Oracle, which acquired Java when it bought its original developer Sun Microsystems, argues that it’s owed at least $8.8 billion for Google’s use of the code without a license. Much of Google’s business success over the past decade came from its ability to place its search engine -- and advertisements -- on phones running Android, which account for roughly one of every four smartphones worldwide.The case is likely to have ramifications beyond Google and Oracle -- many tech companies and startups rely on using bits of code other companies develop or own when building new software. That’s the plea Google is making to the court.“An Oracle win would upend the way the technology industry has always approached the important issue of software interfaces,” Kent Walker, Google’s legal chief, wrote Monday in a blog post. “It would for the first time grant copyright owners a monopoly power to stymie the creation of new implementations and applications.”Oracle initially sued Google for copyright infringement in 2010. Since then, the case has worked its way through the legal system, spurring two jury trials and numerous appeals. The Supreme Court turned down Google’s first request to review the case in 2014. After a federal appeals court ruled in Oracle’s favor, Google filed another appeal to the high court, and the justices agreed in November to take the case. The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in March or April and to rule by the end of June.The case is Google v.

Garman will report to Jassy.AWS’s previous marketing chief, Ariel Kelman, is leaving the company to “pursue another endeavor,” Jassy said in the note. He’ll take the top marketing post at Oracle Corp., said a person familiar with the move. An AWS spokesman declined to comment, and Kelman didn’t respond to a message seeking comment. CNBC reported his move to Oracle earlier Monday.Garman last month was named to Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos’s strategy-setting S-team, evidence of AWS’s growing importance to the e-commerce and technology company.Garman previously ran the engineering teams responsible for Amazon’s rented computing power services, including the company’s foray into selling server racks to businesses. He joined Amazon in 2006, the year AWS launched its first major services, after finishing business school. Today, AWS is the biggest provider of rented infrastructure and data storage services; in the last 12 months the unit generated 12% of Amazon’s revenue and a majority of operating income.Rachel Thornton will take over Kelman’s duties.

2020-01-16,"(Bloomberg) -- When Salesforce.com Inc. emerged two decades ago, it lashed out at the software establishment: large companies that allegedly locked clients into dated products. Now, a coalition of newer rivals have extended that criticism to the cloud applications pioneer.  Ten software upstarts kicked off a public campaign Thursday that knocks customer relationship management, or CRM, titans, including Salesforce, Oracle Corp. and SAP SE, by saying the large companies keep clients trapped in subpar software suites, potentially shutting out smaller rivals with newer technology.The “Platform of Independents” leading the effort include Segment Inc., Amplitude Inc., Outreach Inc., Pendo.io Inc. and Drift.com Inc. Some of the companies are privately held unicorns, with valuations exceeding $1 billion. Each caters to a different software niche. The campaign began with a two-page ad in Thursday’s print edition of the Wall Street Journal and includes a web page and information sessions for prospective clients. More than 190 companies co-signed the main tenet of the campaign, that CRM software “isn’t enough” to provide good customer experiences to consumers.“We, as independent software companies, have built our products with the belief that a business should never be locked into a suite, never forced to have a one-size-fits-all technology approach, and its data should never be siloed,” the companies said in a statement. “It’s time to break free of the data monopoly.”The smaller companies argue the large software makers focus more on selling bundled packages of products than serving their clients’ needs with continuous innovation. Large technology companies have come under increasing antitrust scrutiny for their business practices, including how they wield power to maintain advantages over smaller firms. Beyond panning the quality of the bigger players’ technology, the chief executive officers of the startups said their larger rivals use acquisitions to bolster their market power.“If any of these guys becomes too big, that’s a threat to all of us in this ecosystem,” said Spenser Skates, CEO of Amplitude, which helps clients understand user behavior to improve product experiences. “Salesforce bought MuleSoft, Cisco bought AppDynamics. This is continuing to happen. It’s definitely a concern.”Representatives for Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Salesforce has been well served by its strategy in the CRM market. The company’s shares climbed about 19% last year. Oracle’s stock rose about 17%. Salesforce led the market for customer-management applications with 16.8% as of 2018, the last full year for which data is available, according to research firm IDC. Oracle was next with 5.7% while SAP came in third with 5.6%. Adobe Inc. and Microsoft Corp. rounded out the top five.Salesforce, founded in 1999, is the youngest company in the group. The others have been around for about four decades.“I think there’s something significantly broken that there’s been no big CRM company built in the last 10, 15, or 20 years,” Peter Reinhardt, the CEO of Segment, which helps companies compile their data about consumers, said in an interview.Reinhardt, who spearheaded this campaign, said he isn’t interested in being acquired. Rather, he wants to work more closely with his Platform of Independents peers to jointly sell packages of software solutions to clients, as a way to counter the selling advantages and software product bundles of larger companies. And Reinhardt is optimistic that a shakeup is possible in enterprise technology.“I think we have a temporarily dominant set of companies,” he said. “But I think there’s a huge opportunity for another rewrite of the CRM world.”(Updates with 2019 share performance in the eighth paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Software Upstarts Hit Salesforce, Oracle on Tech and Sales Practices"

Atlassian Corp.’s Opsgenie tool took the No. 2 spot as fastest-growing, with a gain of 194%. Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud came in third place and Splunk Inc. in fourth.The cloud applications market generated $121 billion of revenue in 2018, according to research firm IDC. The infrastructure market, where Google Cloud competes, produced $36 billion in annual revenue, the firm said.Snowflake makes cloud-based data warehouses, a type of database that compiles information from various sources so it can be analyzed. The company competes against Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud division and database stalwarts such as Oracle Corp. The San Mateo, California-based startup is considering going public, although the chief executive officer has said the the earliest the company could be ready for such a move would be this summer.Opsgenie makes incident management software that notifies workers about critical issues to reduce or avoid service downtime. Todd McKinnon, the chief executive officer of Okta, said the types of software on the list represent a departure from the traditional business applications that topped the survey in previous years, such as office communications platform Slack Technologies Inc. and videoconferencing company Zoom Video Communications Inc.“This was the first year where the fastest-growing things were infrastructure tools or security tools,” McKinnon said in an interview. “It’s a natural coming of age. We’ve put a bunch of apps in place. Now you have to make sure they’re secure, that users aren’t being phished, that you’re using the data in those apps for insights.”The most popular corporate apps overall, by unique monthly active users, are Microsoft Corp.’s Office 365, Workday Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. Google’s G Suite and Salesforce.com Inc. round out the top five.Increasingly, corporate developer teams are buying work tools independent of their IT organizations. The most popular developer software is the Atlassian Product Suite, Okta said. It was followed by Microsoft Corp.’s GitHub, PagerDuty Inc., New Relic Inc., and the newly public Datadog Inc.Okta crunches these numbers based on data from its 7,500 customers, which use the software to securely log into various tech systems.

2020-01-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Leon Li is the rarest of Chinese crypto magnates -- one who’s won Beijing’s backing. The founder of Huobi Group is now set to play a pivotal role in China’s effort to build a homegrown crypto-industry.The former Oracle Corp. coder, who started one of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchanges six years ago, enjoys unusual access to China’s central bank and government officials thanks to methodical engagement and measured expansion. While rivals Binance and OKEx irked regulators by stoking Bitcoin mania, Li curried favor by discouraging speculation, co-founding the country’s first state-backed blockchain platform along the way. Huobi even set up a Communist Party committee in-house -- a first for any crypto firm.That’s why, keen to explore homegrown alternatives to Facebook Inc.’s Libra and a Western-led blockchain, Chinese central bank and government officials are turning to Li -- among others -- to help develop a local blueprint for crypto supremacy. The still-nascent blockchain arena offers the world’s second-largest economy a rare chance to become an early influencer. Washington’s concerted campaign to contain China has only strengthened Beijing’s resolve to wean itself off American technology.“Once in a lifetime,” said Li, a bookish-looking 36-year-old with thick black glasses. “It’s my hope that we’ll not just be a participant but a driver, even the leader of blockchain history.”Read more: Why China’s Rushing to Mint Its Own Digital Currency: QuickTakeLi co-founded Huobi in the fall of 2013 and later received backing from well-connected ZhenFund and Sequoia China. But the tale of how he and Huobi came to occupy its privileged position really begins in 2017, at the height of Beijing’s paranoia about the potential for unchecked Bitcoin speculation to foment social upheaval.Word trickled down to Li in the summer of that year that officials were preparing a major crackdown on the industry. His instinct was to rush back from medical leave and instruct his team to get Huobi’s almost 2 million registered users to withdraw their funds. But he also began delivering daily progress reports to local regulators and briefed officials whenever requested.Watching his counterparts collapse like dominoes, he realized that regulators meant life-or-death in his world. Li’s since made it his mission to get on Beijing’s good side, from hosting seminars and classes for officials to organizing conferences under the auspices of local government.In addition to consulting for the People’s Bank of China on Libra, Huobi more recently threw itself behind research into blockchain applications that serve the real economy -- a passion project of President Xi Jinping. It’s one of 14 founding members of China’s first state-backed blockchain platform -- an effort led by the country’s top economic planner that will power everything from storing digital contracts to tracing food and drug deliveries. Other members include state enterprises like China Telecom Corp. and China UnionPay Co.“Huobi could play an important role in the local crypto industry, because authorities would probably prefer to see trade go through an entity that they trust, rather than being pushed underground,” said Emily Parker, co-founder of Asia-focused blockchain data site and incubator LongHash. Good relations with Beijing “could be viewed as a sign of stability, as well as a local advantage over a company like Binance, which does not appear to enjoy the same level of trust.”Those years of cultivation paid off during a late-2019 clampdown. While Binance and its co-founder got tossed off Chinese microblogging site Weibo and other outfits got shut down, Huobi emerged unscathed. As the crackdown wound down in December, Li hosted a days-long conference on the fast-liberalizing southern island of Hainan that serves as his second base after Beijing, in a show of support for local government efforts to become a global hub for blockchain technology.At the event, Li pledged to lend his company’s cloud and blockchain expertise to nations participating in Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative, and called on his country to counter Libra. “From the perspective of safeguarding national financial sovereignty, autonomy and control are really important issues,” he told delegates. “Can we rely on ourselves to build something as good as Libra?”A spokeswoman for Binance said its larger user base is among its key advantages over Huobi. OKEx representatives declined to comment for this story.Read more: From Pigs to Party Fealty, China Harnesses Blockchain PowerIn the years since Binance and other competitors fled China, Huobi was one of the few major crypto businesses that stayed put and thrived. True, he moved Huobi’s main exchange business to Singapore. But the company’s blockchain consultancy and training arm, Huobi China, remains in-country and around 100 staffers work out of sleek offices built on reclaimed wasteland on Hainan.That unit -- which the company says is profitable -- has instructed more than 1,000 students from Party cadres to executives at state-owned and private companies. Huobi’s own senior executives, Li included, are based in Beijing, as are key teams from coding to business development. His exchange is estimated to have raked in roughly $680 million in revenue for 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations of data by Huobi on token buybacks.Success has come at a cost of personal freedom for Li, who was born into a working-class family in central China and graduated from Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University -- Xi’s alma mater. After China shut down exchange trading, the heads of Chinese crypto platforms were reported to have been banned from departing the country. Li said he’s never received any official notice prohibiting him from leaving China but he’s chosen not to, unsure of the risks that would entail.In the longer term, his company’s closeness with Beijing could also be a liability.“Huobi may be aiming for a global leadership role in the industry by molding to regulatory requirements,” said Matthew Graham, chief executive officer of Sino Global Capital, a Beijing-based blockchain consultancy. “Certainly one risk is that this could lead to a loss of trust with overseas customers.”To contact the reporters on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.net;Colum Murphy in Beijing at cmurphy270@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The Crypto Mogul Who’s Got the Ear of China’s Central Bank

Over the past week or so, you’ve been holed up in your cramped apartment and your inbox is overflowing with alerts about the spread of a deadly virus.

The global economy loses $1 trillion a year in productivity as a result of depression and anxiety, the World Health Organization found. While the U.S. puts $133.2 billion, or 4% of its annual health expenditure, toward treatment, that proportion reaches 19% in Australia, 18% in Singapore and 17.6% in Hong Kong, Cigna says.The good news is that there’s a solution, and it’s cheap. The bad news is that it’s difficult. After years of considering mental health to be a personal affliction, focus is turning to the role employers can play. The type of changes needed – better communication and support from managers, for example – require a shift in attitude more than financial resources. In Asia, however, the very wokefulness that’s made mental health a priority for Fortune 500 CEOs and U.S. presidential candidates is uncomfortable territory.“My family never, ever talked about this topic. It’s a taboo,” said Deborah Seah, a 38-year-old Singaporean who lived with bipolar disorder for more than two decades before it was diagnosed. As a girl of eight, she recalls going to the kitchen of her family’s high-rise apartment in the middle of the night, looking out the 11-story window and fighting the urge to jump.More than 90% of people in Asia say they’re stressed, and eight out of 10 feel like they operate in an “always on” culture. These can be early symptoms of burnout, which is marked by chronic exhaustion, cynicism and detachment from your work, as well as feelings of ineffectiveness.Seah experienced her first burnout episode in 2016, while working at an academic institution. She recalls the rising levels of stress as managers kept pushing work on her plate. She also felt pressure to keep her mental condition under wraps because colleagues gossiped viciously. Managers who knew of Seah’s struggles urged her to stay quiet.Seah remembers breaking into sobs in the washroom, hoping no one would see, and coming home to dinner, where she would erupt into screams. Her husband begged her to quit her job, but she couldn’t let go: “I didn’t want to give up my career,” she said. Seah eventually admitted herself to Singapore’s mental-health institute when she began to feel suicidal. Successive burnout episodes were equally dramatic, with daily panic attacks, hot and cold flashes, uncontrollable shivering and the inability to get out of bed.Beyond social stigmas, Asia’s often inflexible work culture can be a hurdle, too. In a recent survey of Hong Kong employees by Deacons, a law firm, 65% of respondents cited long hours as their primary concern, closely followed by “domineering” senior management and uncommunicative bosses.The trouble is, even flexible work arrangements have their pitfalls. Ben,(1) 43, started his career in public relations in London, and moved to Singapore in 2013. He struggled with depression and anxiety after his father and half-brother died unexpectedly within less than a year of each other. He was relieved to get a transfer to Hong Kong for a change of pace, and was initially encouraged by the corporatespeak about working from home and unlimited vacation time.Very quickly, Ben found that working anywhere meant working all the time. He was pulling 12-hour days and putting in time on weekends; he compulsively checked his phone for messages. A much-anticipated trip with his wife to the tropical island of Flores, east of Bali, was spent on a deck chair: “I saw it over a laptop,” he recalls.It also became apparent that making a big transition during a period of emotional strain was a bad idea. When Ben asked for help with his workload, his manager said he should be able to cope. As the demands increased, Ben’s symptoms became physical: He lost weight, his cheeks hollowed and his skin turned ashen. One day, he simply couldn’t get up, and stayed bedridden for a week.Though Ben worked for a U.S.-based company, he felt caught between Asia’s cultural expectation of being in the office and the 24/7 demands of his industry. “When I was working in London, our general rule was if you saw someone working late regularly, you would take them aside and say, ‘Hey what’s going on? What’s wrong?’ whereas in Asia, it’s celebrated much more.”Ben eventually decided to leave his job and took seven months off. Now he does contract work in the marketing-services industry, and tries to stick to a four-day week.In 2018, Gallup Inc., a market-research company, looked at the main causes of burnout, as well as what employers and managers can do. What’s striking is how simple some of the solutions appear to be: Employees whose managers are willing to listen to their work-related problems are 62% less likely to be burned out, and those who have the opportunity to do projects where they excel are 57% less likely to experience frequent episodes, the study found. Does a trillion-dollar problem really come down to intangibles such as making work purposeful, promoting teamwork and giving positive feedback?Seah, the Singaporean, eventually left her job, and now works as an executive assistant at Oracle Corp. In her application, she included her volunteer work as an ambassador at “Beyond the Label,” a government initiative to raise awareness about mental health. Seah marvels at the California-based company’s openness to her condition and the willingness to let her work from home. “The approach and attitude of my manager makes a whole world of difference.”The workplaces of the future should not only better equip its managers with soft skills, but give employees the time and space to care for themselves. Think about it: With people working well into their 70s, careers can plausibly span half a century; a recent study puts the age of peak unhappiness smack in the middle, at 47.2. The key to heading off burnout, then, may be clearing your calendar. The Wall Street Journal recently chronicled the experience of one insurance executive who took a two-year sabbatical. The break actually accelerated her progress: She returned to work and became a CEO.For those who can’t afford to put their paychecks on pause, even mini breaks or meditation can help. One Singaporean-based app, MindFi, has breathing exercises that even allow skeptics like me to keep their eyes open. Managing stress this way should be natural in cities like Hong Kong and Singapore. After all, “Asia is the home of meditation,” says Bjorn Lee, MindFi’s founder. “What happened?”There’s perhaps no better time to put these tools to work. The spread of the coronavirus has produced stress triggers that are both extraordinary (with thousands of confirmed cases) and mundane (it’s more difficult to get your Starbucks coffee). With millions of people on lockdown, companies from HSBC Holdings Plc to Facebook Inc. have asked staff to work from home. The novelty of wearing your pajamas all day can wear off quickly when you’re squinting at a tiny laptop screen and keeping your toddler’s sticky fingers off the keyboard. But if you’re safe and virus-free, this could be a welcome opportunity for a deep breath. A baby showed up on one of my video conferences last week — I can’t imagine I’m the only one who cracked a smile. (1) Ben asked that we keep out his surname.To contact the author of this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Rachel Rosenthal is an editor with Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-02-03,"Oracle Corp said on Monday it had added new cloud computing data centers in five countries and aims to have them in 36 locations by the end of 2020, as it races with Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp for market share.  After a rocky start in the cloud business, Oracle, a longtime business software provider, is rolling out its second generation of cloud systems, in which it operates data centers and customers rent capacity from it.  Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are the two top players with more than two-thirds of the global market in 2019, according to Forrester Research, but Oracle is trying to win customers by extending its geographical reach.","Oracle adds cloud data centers in five countries, sets new 2020 target"
2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg) -- The private investment arm of Koch Industries Inc., run by billionaire Charles Koch, has acquired the remaining equity in cloud-software maker Infor Inc., the companies said.The deal values Infor at $11 billion, or nearly $13 billion including preferred shares, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information.  Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kansas-based conglomerate, already owned about 70% of Infor, the company said. Its subsidiary Koch Equity Development LLC purchased the remaining Infor equity it didn’t already own from Golden Gate Capital. Infor, which Wall Street has viewed as a candidate for an upcoming initial public offering, will become a Koch Industries subsidiary. The move to buy Infor underscores Koch Industries’ continued push into technology, a relatively new priority for a sprawling conglomerate best known for refineries, paper goods, and other industrial products—along with the libertarian and conservative views of its CEO and his brother David, who died last year.In 2013, Koch Industries, which brings in $110 billion in annual revenue, bought electronics component maker Molex for $7.2 billion. And three years ago it launched a venture capital arm, Koch Disruptive Technologies, run by Charles’s son, Chase. That venture division has made investments in companies such as enterprise software startup D2iQ and 3D-printing company Desktop Metal.“Investment in Infor is a great platform to continue in that space,” said Jim Hannan, the executive who runs the enterprises division of Koch Industries. A range of Koch businesses already use Infor’s tools, Hannan said, adding, “It doesn’t matter whether you’re making paper towels or fertilizer or anything else.” Infor, a competitor to companies like Oracle Corp. and SAP SE with annual revenue of about $3.2 billion, makes software that is specialized by industry, including manufacturing, government, health care and retail. Its fastest-growing product is its software-as-a-service business, which allows customers to use software held remotely instead of maintaining it in their own data centers.Koch Equity Development first took a $2 billion stake in Infor in 2017, and topped it up with another $1.5 billion a year ago. Infor had been considering an IPO, and according its chief executive officer, Kevin Samuelson, hasn’t ruled out that possibility for the future. But Samuelson said the acquisition route was more immediately appealing because of Koch Industries’ robust balance sheet, with its clout that could potentially enable Infor to make further acquisitions of its own. Of the Koch Industries bid, Samuelson said, “Just the access to capital, the IT perspective, working with someone who started as a customer—this was the right outcome.”Infor’s market share in enterprise software is about 6%, according to the research firm IDC, making it third after SAP and Oracle. Gartner Inc., another researcher, placed both its 2018 market share and its growth rate at 5%. Infor said its software-as-a-service unit would be on track for about $800 million in annual revenue, if its last month’s revenue held steady for the following year. That unit is also growing at more than 20% annually, Samuelson said.Infor, founded in 2002, has grown both organically and through acquisitions. It bought GT Nexus for $675 million in 2015. (Adds context on the valuation in the second paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Ed Hammond.To contact the author of this story: Sarah McBride in San Francisco at smcbride24@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Michael HythaLiana BakerTom GilesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Koch Industries Buys the Rest of Software Maker Infor

2020-02-05,"(Bloomberg) -- The Central Intelligence Agency is planning to hire multiple companies for lucrative cloud computing deals in a new program that will give rivals a chance to take on market leader Amazon.com Inc.The U.S. government posted draft requirements this week for new CIA contracts that aim to build on commercial cloud capabilities the intelligence community first gained through a $600 million contract awarded to Amazon in 2013, according to documents presented to industry and obtained by Bloomberg News.Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. are catching up to Amazon with new technical offerings, public-sector clients and federal security authorizations and are likely to submit bids. The CIA initiative likely will dramatically expand the federal cloud market, which is becoming more competitive.Using commercial cloud service providers, rather than developing those services in-house, has proven to be a faster way to meet the intelligence community’s needs and to “facilitate the adoption of innovation happening in the commercial marketplace,” the government said in the proposal.The CIA and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Under the Commercial Cloud Enterprise initiative, or C2E, the CIA will make multiple awards to companies providing cloud computing infrastructure and cloud-based software, according to the documents. The initiative calls for tech companies to host data with varying security requirements, including unclassified, secret and top secret, according to the documents.Bidders will be judged on a range of factors including their global reach, innovation, and “operational excellence,” according to the documents.The government said the contracts could last up to 15 years with a five-year base period and two five-year renewals. The estimated award date is September 2020.The CIA has previously indicated that it intended to spend “tens of billions” of dollars on cloud computing, Bloomberg has reported. It’s unclear whether the agency has finalized an amount it plans to spend.The agency has long touted the benefits from its 2013 deal with Amazon, which was described as ”transformational” by Sean Roche, the CIA’s associate deputy director of digital innovation. It also won praise from former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.The draft requirements outline CIA plans to implement a “multicloud ecosystem,” likely avoiding some of the criticism the Pentagon faced from industry players when it decided to award the highly-lucrative Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud computing contract to just one company.“In a multi-cloud ecosystem, the government will gain advantages from use of each” cloud service provider’s “unique area of investment in technology, cybersecurity strategy, and best practices,” according to the proposal.In October, Microsoft beat Amazon for the JEDI contract, which is worth as much as $10 billion over a decade. Amazon has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, arguing that it lost because President Donald Trump interfered.In 2018, Microsoft won a deal to let 17 intelligence agencies use Azure Government, a cloud service tailored for federal and local governments.IBM and Oracle have also recently gained new federal security authorizations, clearing the companies to handle more sensitive government workloads.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Gregory MottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",CIA Opens Competition for Lucrative Cloud Deals to Amazon Rivals

2020-02-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Larry Ellison is selling an ownership stake in the professional sailing league he co-founded to Endeavor, the Hollywood talent agency and media business led by Ari Emanuel.The deal values the two-year-old SailGP, which Ellison created with five-time America’s Cup winner Russell Coutts, at $200 million. Neither side would disclose the size of Endeavor’s stake.Coutts said Endeavor, whose sports properties include the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has expertise in media rights, production, licensing and sponsorship that would help SailGP grow globally.“Last year we were a complete startup,” Coutts said in an interview. “Endeavor gives us so much more capability to fast-track expansion.”SailGP is scheduled to begin its second season Feb. 28 in Sydney, where seven countries will field teams. The circuit staged five events last season, and subsequently added teams from Denmark and Spain. SailGP will feature five events this season, and is exploring the possibility of another in the Middle East.Endeavor’s sports properties also include the Professional Bull Riders. Last month, Endeavor acquired On Location Experiences, a high-end events business that’s part-owned by the National Football League.On Location offers luxury travel, accommodations, and experiences like on-field access at the Super Bowl and international sports events. The company has eyed international expansion to link with major events and rights holders like the Olympics, FIFA and Formula One racing.Ellison is the world’s 11th-richest person, with a net worth of $61.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Oracle Corp. co-founder started SailGP after his America’s Cup run ended in 2017. His Oracle team won the cup in 2010 and 2013.The plan calls for Ellison to underwrite SailGP until it becomes commercially viable. SailGP then would move to a franchise model.Unlike the America’s Cup, all the boats in SailGP are identical. In an effort to reduce costs, teams share a number of services, including design.SailGP added sponsors during the offseason, including chemical company Ineos Group Holdings SA, which was founded by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe. Ineos has sponsored an America’s Cup team. Building-products maker Rockwool International A/S also signed on as a SailGP sponsor, joining Rolex.“This is fast-paced. It’s nation-versus-nation. It’s a global championship,” Coutts said. “This has changed the perception of what sailing can be.”To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Soshnick in New York at ssoshnick@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, John J.

2020-02-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc., a maker of cloud-based databases, raised $479 million in its latest funding round, boosting the company’s valuation to $12.4 billion. It also announced a strategic partnership with Salesforce.com Inc.Snowflake sells a type of database that compiles information from various sources so it can be analyzed. The company competes against Amazon.com Inc.’s Redshift product as well as those from industry stalwart Oracle Corp., which has stumbled in the cloud-computing market. Snowflake’s use among clients more than tripled in 2019, making it the fastest-growing cloud-based business software product, according to Okta Inc.’s annual Business @ Work report last month. Snowflake’s new valuation will boost it to No. 13 among global startups, according to data from CB Insights. The company previously was valued at $3.9 billion.The increased valuation came about as part of the new relationship with Salesforce, Frank Slootman, Snowflake’s chief executive officer, said Friday in an interview. “They want to invest in the company as a condition of the partnership,” he said. “They want to benefit from the upside from them being a partner.”Salesforce Ventures, the investment arm of the customer-relations software maker, and Dragoneer Investment Group, which led the fundraising, each contributed half of the round, he said.Slootman said the company recently added two new female board members, Kelly Kramer, the chief financial officer of Cisco Systems Inc., and Teresa Briggs, a former executive at Deloitte LLP. Snowflake is preparing to make the leap to the public markets by the end of 2021, Slootman said.Existing Snowflake backers, including Altimeter Capital, Iconiq Capital, Madrona Venture Group and others, are expected to participate in another investment closing “within the next few weeks,” according to Snowflake.Snowflake said its alliance with Salesforce will involve products, marketing and sales efforts. It will release further details on the relationship in June.

2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has asked the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to allow it to question President Donald Trump in its lawsuit challenging the loss of a highly lucrative cloud contract.In a court filing made public on Monday, Amazon asks to question Trump and top Pentagon leaders about their role in the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract that was awarded to Microsoft Corp. in October.Amazon is seeking evidence to show political interference cost the company the cloud deal. Among the leaders Amazon seeks to depose are Trump, former Defense Secretary James Mattis, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, as well as other individuals involved in the selection process, according to the Jan. 17 filing.Amazon faces an uphill battle to persuade a judge to order the president to participate in a deposition in this case, procurement experts said.“It is absurd to think that this President, at this point, would sit for a deposition or, for that matter, show respect for the legal system,” Steven Schooner, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, said in a statement.Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement the company is seeking the additional evidence to preserve the public’s confidence in the procurement process. Rachel VanJohnson, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department’s Cloud Computing Program Office, said in a statement the Pentagon “strongly opposes” Amazon’s request to depose its senior officials because it would delay implementation of the technology program. The contract is worth up to $10 billion over a decade.The company’s cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, filed a lawsuit in November alleging the Defense Department failed to fairly judge its bid for the JEDI contract because Trump viewed Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos as his “political enemy.”Amazon’s lawsuit chronicles a laundry list of comments and actions by Trump and the Defense Department that it claims show the Pentagon bowed to political pressure when awarding the deal to Microsoft. In one case, Amazon cites claims in a book by Mattis’ former speechwriter, Guy Snodgrass, that Trump told Mattis in the summer of 2018 to “screw Amazon” by locking it out of the bid. Mattis has criticized the book.Amazon also mentions comments Trump made in July 2019 when he said he was looking “very seriously” at the cloud-computing contract, citing complaints from Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.Amazon Web Services is seeking additional material to present to the judge, including “facts not currently known or accessible to AWS demonstrating exactly how President Trump’s order to ‘screw Amazon’ was carried out during the decision-making process,” the company’s filing said.Also on Monday, Microsoft filed two separate motions asking the court to dismiss many of Amazon’s bias allegations and block the company from seeking additional evidence. Microsoft argued in court papers that it had won the JEDI procurement because it submitted a cheaper and “technically superior” bid and not because of political interference by Trump.“AWS has alleged zero facts-- nothing -- plausibly indicating any DOD official involved in the JEDI procurement, at any level, was actually influenced by the alleged anti-Bezos statements,” Microsoft wrote.The president has long criticized Bezos over everything from the shipping rates his company pays the U.S. Postal Service to his ownership of the Washington Post. In December 2015, Bezos joked on Twitter about wanting to send Trump to space.Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, has said that as far as he knows, no one from the White House reached out to any members of the JEDI cloud contract selection team.While no law prohibits a president from weighing in on a contract, federal agencies must choose vendors based on the technical criteria outlined in their requests for proposals, not opinions from politicians, according to procurement officials.In order to win Trump’s testimony in this case, Amazon would have to offer evidence that he followed up on his public comments about Amazon with private instructions to the officials running the procurement, said Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law.The judge could still grant Amazon permission to obtain more communications between the White House and the Pentagon about the contractwithout giving permission to conduct the depositions, Tiefer said.Letting a losing bidder depose a sitting president “may have not have been seen before,” Tiefer said. Yet “it’s far from impossible.”(Updates with Microsoft motion, starting in eleventh paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Daniel Seiden.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Seeks to Question Trump in Suit Challenging Bid Loss

2020-02-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is denying a Pentagon cloud-computing contract valued at as much as $10 billion was unfairly tailored for the e-commerce giant.In a court filing made public Monday, Amazon countered rival Oracle Corp.’s claims that bidding for the lucrative cloud deal was tainted by relationships between its employees and former Pentagon officials.Oracle is appealing a July ruling from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that dismissed its legal challenge of the cloud contract based on claims that the bidding violated procurement law and was marred by conflicts of interest. Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, has filed a separate lawsuit challenging its loss of the contract known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, which was awarded to Microsoft Corp. in October. Amazon claims it lost the bid after interference from the White House and is seeking to interview President Donald Trump in that case.Oracle’s lawsuit claims that Amazon offered two former Pentagon employees jobs at the company while they were working on the contract. In one case, Deap Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, allegedly helped craft the JEDI procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from AWS, according to the lawsuit.Amazon argued that Oracle’s lawsuit is based on “suspicion and innuendo” and that neither employee that Amazon hired disclosed any “competitively useful” information to the company. Government lawyers have also argued in court that the employees’ input on the JEDI procurement was minimal.Representatives for the Pentagon and Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in July that the Pentagon’s contracting officer properly determined the relationships had no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process and that Oracle didn’t have standing to challenge the contract. The Pentagon eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the competition in April 2019.Last week a federal judge temporarily blocked Microsoft from working on the Pentagon cloud project while Amazon’s lawsuit is litigated. The Pentagon’s JEDI project is designed to consolidate the department’s cloud computing infrastructure and modernize its technology systems. The contract is worth as much as $10 billion over a decade.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Denies Unfair Advantage in Oracle Challenge of JEDI

2020-02-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by Alphabet Inc.’s Google, boosting Oracle Corp.’s bid to collect more than $8 billion in royalties for Google’s use of copyrighted programming code in the Android operating system.The administration weighed in on the high-stakes case on the same day that President Donald Trump attended a re-election campaign fundraiser in California hosted by Oracle’s co-founder, billionaire Larry Ellison.Ellison hosted a golf outing and photos with Trump. The event cost a minimum of $100,000 per couple to attend, with a higher ticket price of $250,000 for those who wanted to participate in a policy roundtable with the president, the Palm Springs Desert Sun reported.Google is challenging an appeals court ruling that it violated Oracle copyrights when it included some Oracle-owned Java programming code in Android. The dispute has split Silicon Valley, pitting developers of software code against companies that use the code to create programs.Google’s “verbatim copying” of Oracle’s code into a competing product wasn’t necessary to foster innovation, the U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said Wednesday in a filing with the court.Francisco had asked the high court in September, on behalf of the administration, not to hear Google’s appeal. The Supreme Court usually, though not always, takes the solicitor general’s advice about pending appeals. In this case, the justices agreed to take the case and are scheduled to hold oral arguments on March 24.”The Obama Solicitor General Don Verrilli supported Oracle’s position in Oracle v. Google, a position maintained by Trump Solicitor General Noel Francisco,” Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said in an email.Google contends the appeals court ruling, if not reversed, will make it harder to develop new applications.“A remarkable range of consumers, developers, computer scientists, and businesses agree that open software interfaces promote innovation and that no single company should be able to monopolize creativity by blocking software tools from working together,” the company said in a statement. “Openness and interoperability have helped developers create a variety of new products that consumers use to communicate, work, and play across different platforms.”Francisco asked the justices to give the government 10 minutes to argue its position in the case. The U.S. has “substantial interest” in issues regarding copyright law and the re-use of computer code at the heart of the dispute, he said in a filing.(Updates with fundraiser details in third paragraph.

2020-02-20,"(Bloomberg) -- While a wave of employee activism marked by walk-outs and protests has rippled through Silicon Valley the past few years, Oracle Corp. glided along unscathed.Now, a symbol of tech’s old guard is facing the stirrings of a worker uprising as well. People left their desks Thursday at Oracle offices around the world to protest Chairman Larry Ellison’s fundraiser a day earlier for President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. The protest, called No Ethics/No Work, involved about 300 employees walking out of their offices or stopping work at remote locations at noon local time and devoting the rest of the day to volunteering or civic engagement, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.Ellison drew employee ire that most didn’t know existed at Oracle. News of the fundraiser for Trump’s re-election campaign at Ellison’s home in Rancho Mirage, California, spurred a petition at Change.org from some of the company’s 136,000 employees. The workers argued the chairman’s public support for Trump violated Oracle’s diversity, inclusion and ethics policies, and harmed the image of the world’s second-largest software maker.The petition had more than 8,000 signatures as of Thursday afternoon, though it was open to the public and anyone could sign it. Organizers demanded that Oracle and Ellison give money to support a humanitarian cause such as climate change, denounce the Trump administration and commit to diversifying the company’s board.Employees at Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. started mobilizing more than two years ago over a variety of issues, including law enforcement and military contracts, the gender pay gap and the treatment of contract workers.Thursday’s activism at Oracle, a database stalwart founded in 1977, showed cultural differences from the younger companies like Google. Some Oracle workers who participated in the “log off” used vacation time for the protest, the people said. Many had asked the company’s human resources officials whether they would be targeted for participating and didn’t receive a response before the protest, so they took the precaution of participating on their own time, the people said.Others who supported the action, but were leery about the company’s potential response, chose to donate money to charitable groups that oppose Trump administration policies rather than leave work, the people said.Some employees received a warning Thursday when trying to access the protest organizers’ website from a work computer: “Access to this site may not be permitted by the Oracle Acceptable Use Policy. However, if user is authorized and has legitimate business reason to access the requested site, then click below to access. Your access will be logged.”Oracle, however, said the message was an error that was corrected.“The site was not intentionally blocked by Oracle,” said spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger. “It was temporarily blocked by a ‘false positive’ from our McAfee network security and anti-virus software. Once we were notified by employees of this issue, our security team conducted a review, determined that there was no actual security threat, and then whitelisted the site.”Organizers said the protest participation at Oracle’s headquarters in Redwood City, California, seemed more muted than in other locations, such as New York City and Austin, Texas, which have more young workers.The organizers hope Thursday’s action is the first effort to voice concerns about the company’s policies, and employees will continue to feel motivated to speak out, one of the people said.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Some Oracle Employees Stop Work in Protest of Larry Ellison’s Politics
2020-02-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has asked a court to force the government to hand over documents related to Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s decision to recuse himself from making decisions on a $10 billion cloud-services contract.In a court filing made public on Friday, Amazon seeks a trove of documents to bolster its challenge of the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract that was awarded to Microsoft Corp. in October.Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud unit, is also asking the U.S Court of Federal Claims to require the government to turn over materials that shed light on the role that Stacy Cummings, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, played in the procurement.Cummings communicated with the team evaluating JEDI bids and worked on preparations for JEDI-related meetings involving Esper, the lawsuit said. She recused herself from working on the procurement in September 2019, according to the lawsuit.In a previous filing, government lawyers argued that Amazon is “not entitled” to all materials relating to the recusals of Cummings and Esper. They added that Cummings had a conflict with Microsoft, that “did not impact the procurement.”Other files Amazon seeks include “informal notes” between the bid selection team members, JEDI-related content on digital channels and procurement documents that were presented to Esper and Deputy Secretary David Norquist.Representatives for the Defense Department and Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Amazon filed a lawsuit in November in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims alleging that the Defense Department failed to fairly judge its bid because President Donald Trump viewed Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos as his “political enemy.”Amazon asked the court earlier this month to allow it to question Trump, Esper, former Defense Secretary James Mattis, and Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer.In August 2019, the newly confirmed Esper ordered a review of the procurement after Trump endorsed criticism that the Pentagon had given Amazon an unfair advantage with the contract’s design.The Pentagon announced in October that Esper would recuse himself from any decisions involving the contract to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Esper’s son worked as a consultant for International Business Machines Corp., which along with Oracle Corp., had earlier been eliminated from the competition.Three days after Esper’s recusal, the Pentagon announced it had chosen Microsoft, an upset victory for the company that many in the industry viewed as a distant second to Amazon.“A complete factual record on the bases for these recusals is especially critical in light of the well-grounded allegations AWS has made about the troubling circumstances surrounding the recusals of DoD personnel,” the lawsuit said.The Pentagon’s JEDI project is designed to consolidate the department’s cloud computing infrastructure and modernize its technology systems. Earlier this month, a judge agreed to block Microsoft from working on the contract while Amazon’s lawsuit is being litigated.To contact the reporter on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Seeks Internal Pentagon Documents in JEDI Cloud Case

2020-02-21,"Are you frustrated trying to buy and sell stocks in today's volatile and headline-driven market? To position with stronger success, look to diversify risk and hedge your portfolio with large-cap stocks setting up for meaningful moves up and down using the monthly chart.Wall Street's risk appetite from one day to the next goes hand-in-hand with the latest breaking news on the coronavirus. And just how the pandemic plays out other than POTUS believing hot weather will save us, isn't known. That's a fact.Still, if history is any sort of indicator, there's reason to be optimistic someone smarter than our country's own 'stable genius' will ensure the coronavirus dies a quiet death.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Small Cap Stocks That Pack a Wallop Right now though, well-positioned monthly charts in two large-cap stocks are ready to break out and break free of today's erratic price behavior regardless of the headlines. Likewise, a similarly meaningful short hedge is worth putting on the radar and maybe in the portfolio for profitable diversification in the event this time doesn't prove different. Netflix (NFLX)  Source: Charts by TradingViewStreaming video-on-demand giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the first of our large-cap stocks that has put in the work on the monthly chart and in position for buying. Shares have moved firmly higher after a brief 'pause and rewind' following the outfit's earnings topper in late January. But Netflix is anything but finished for bullish investors.The price strength in Netflix has just now resulted in shares clearing a pattern mid-pivot within its 1.5+ year old corrective base this week. Coupled with a bullishly-trending stochastics still in neutral territory, the buy decision for this large-cap stock is an easy one.Netflix Stock Strategy: Buy shares of Netflix today. I'd advise setting a stop if required at $357. This keeps risk contained to about 7%. On the price chart this exit also gives enough leeway for a handle consolidation to form with symmetry and without overstaying one's welcome if the pattern deteriorates for the worse. Oracle (ORCL)  Source: Charts by TradingViewOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) is the next large-cap stock that has caught our attention on the monthly price chart. If investors appreciate the trend is your friend, Oracle is a stock to relish. As the monthly chart shows, shares have been a steady ally for bulls since the financial crisis bottomed in 2009. And now the trend is looking even friendlier.Since December 2018's broad-based market correction established a technically well-supported double-bottom in ORCL stock, shares have been consolidating in the upper half of its bullish channel pattern. The observation is a rally through the smaller angular resistance line could lead to this large-cap stock's trend entering a more determined phase of bullish behavior.Oracle Stock Strategy: I'd suggest buying this large-cap stock under two conditions. First, shares need to clear $56.24. This entry waits for the channel's minor downtrend line to be broken and for Oracle to trade 1% above the high of December's pivot bottom candlestick. The purchase should also wait for Oracle's stochastics to signal a bullish crossover.  * 7 Lessons Businesses Can Learn From the Girl Scouts For containing downside exposure and because this strategy waits for additional confirmation, I'd set an initial blended stop-loss below $54. In our estimation that's ample room off and on the price chart as the buy is predicated on increased share strength from this large-cap stock. Likewise, I'd look to take partial profits above the existing channel and rally to fresh highs above $62. Walmart (WMT)  Source: Charts by TradingViewWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is the last of our large-cap stocks signaling something big for investors. This time, however, the technical picture hints shares of the retail giant are going on sale. Interestingly enough, the stock is in position for shorting today despite this week's well-received announcement from management it isn't cutting guidance similar to fellow large-cap stock Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Hmm, maybe a bearish update by Walmart is in store for investors?On the provided monthly chart readers can see WMT stock put together a bearish topping pattern during the last two months of 2019. Further, with the formation challenging layers of Fibonacci-based resistance there's additional technical evidence we're looking at a meaningful top in shares.Now and following January's bearish price confirmation and backed by an overbought stochastics crossover, Walmart is in position for shorting into this week's rally in anticipation a larger corrective cycle and possible bear market are just beginning.Walmart Stock Strategy: This large-cap stock is a short right now. I'd recommend a blended stop above $123.69 if needed and only if this large-cap stock's stochastics signals a bullish crossover. Bottom-line, this strategy contains risk to as little as 5% and only closes the position if shares make a sufficiently strong technical case this time is truly different.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2020-02-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett says he’s in the “urgent zone.” It’s the folksy billionaire’s way of calling himself old. But even as Buffett approaches 90, the spotlight-loving chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. isn’t ready just yet to talk about who will run his giant company when he’s gone. He still has more to say, and more to do — and that could make for an interesting year ahead.Buffett’s annual letter of intrigue arrived Saturday morning, a roundup of thoughts that the Oracle of Omaha has been publishing for six decades. It’s evolved over time into what reads like a love letter to shareholders, to insurance float — the lucrative gift that keeps on giving at Berkshire — and to America as a whole, while taking the occasional jab at Wall Street’s fee-giddy bankers and anyone who thinks Ebitda is an honest profit gauge. Lately, he’s also lamented the lack of cheap takeover targets. The company’s last splashy acquisition was in 2015, when it struck a $37 billion deal for airplane-parts supplier Precision Castparts. Berkshire had $128 billion of cash as of December, about the same level as the previous quarter and many billions more than Buffett would like to see sitting in a bank. The letter, one of two major yearly events for Berkshire investors and Buffett groupies (the other is the shareholder meeting each May) has become more condensed in recent years. But more important to readers is what’s written between the lines — hints of a major deal and signs that the world’s most celebrated businessman is about to step aside. I suspect the former will come before the latter, though not even Buffett can truly know.As mentioned, Buffett will turn 90 this summer, and his right-hand man Charlie Munger is 96. His letter contained an anecdote about a friend from his past who, at the relatively ripe age of 80-something, kept receiving requests from a local newspaper for biographical data so that it could prep the man’s obituary. The request was marked “URGENT.” “Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone,” Buffett wrote, assuring shareholders that their company is “100% prepared” for the sad day of their departure and even sharing some details about his will. In my decade covering Berkshire, it’s the most I can remember Buffett discussing what will happen when he’s gone.Over 12 to 15 years after his death, Buffett’s class A shares will be converted into B shares and distributed to various charities; the executors and trustees are otherwise instructed not to sell any Berkshire stock, no matter what. That’s putting a lot of faith in the next CEO, whoever it is. Buffett’s still keeping hush about his succession plans. But in a first this year, he said that shareholders can direct questions directly to his lieutenants, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, at the May investor meeting. It’s something I suggested Berkshire should start doing at last year’s meeting, and indeed Buffett did hand Abel the mic in a rather symbolic, if impromptu, moment during the Q&A session. Not long ago, Abel’s title was expanded from head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy to vice chairman of all the company’s various operations — except for insurance, which is overseen by Jain. Notably, this year’s letter signaled a desire to invest more of the energy division’s retained earnings to take on large utility projects. He said Berkshire’s operations in the Omaha-based company’s neighboring state of Iowa will be wind self-sufficient by next year thanks to investments in wind turbines, which have helped to keep rates lower than the competition as profits soar. Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF — the railroad Berkshire bought in 2009 — together earned $8.3 billion last year, making them two of the biggest contributors to profit. Abel’s rising profile, along with the emphasis on energy, leads me to wonder whether he’s not only being groomed to take over for Buffett, but also whether Abel could soon make his own M&A splash. Separately, Todd Combs, who manages some of Berkshire's stock-market portfolio, was recently tapped to be CEO of its Geico insurance business. Despite his dual-function sparking succession curiosity, he didn't get a shout-out in the letter.Buffett’s letter always includes a rant on the topics du jour, and this year’s was corporate governance. He penned a section on the “vexing problem” of subservient corporate boards made up of overpaid aging directors, especially those who don’t tap into their own savings to buy shares in the companies they serve. Of course, Berkshire is guilty of some of that. The average age of its board is 74 (including three nonagenarians). Buffett’s celebrity and track record has also allowed him to skirt many of the corporate governance customs expected of other CEOs, such as quarterly earnings calls, more detailed filings and returning cash to shareholders. His successor may not be given so much leeway, especially not with $128 billion sitting around. Reading that finger-wagging section, it was hard not to think of Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. — one company that was once seen as Buffett-investment quality, and another that in many ways tried to be like Berkshire. The downfall of each has been a devastating display of what can happen when leadership isn’t held to account, and I imagine that’s the sort of thing Buffett had in mind when he was writing. Then again, his investment in Kraft Heinz Co. is almost the pot calling the kettle black. Kraft Heinz juiced Ebitda by irresponsibly under-investing in its business — which goes completely against the Buffett way — and all the while it happened under Buffett’s nose. Berkshire is the largest shareholder, and while the Kraft Heinz holding is carried at $13.8 billion on its balance sheet, it had a market value of only $10.5 billion as of Dec. 31 (and is worth even less than that now).Buffett only reveals what he wants to, and it’s clear that succession is on his mind, as is his unending hunger for deals. Is it urgent enough for him to strike soon? To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- A powerful executive with Amazon.com Inc. in October portrayed attempts by archrival Oracle Corp. to block her company from winning one of the biggest-ever government deals as a last-ditch attempt to rescue a business that was becoming irrelevant.Now, Amazon is borrowing a page from the playbook Oracle used to unseat it as the front-runner for an up to $10 billion, 10-year project to overhaul the military’s technological operations.Amazon filed suit in federal court in November after the Pentagon, in a surprise move, on Oct. 25 awarded the contract to Microsoft Corp. Amazon asserted that the procurement was corrupted by the intervention of President Donald Trump, whose disdain for Jeff Bezos, its chairman and chief executive officer, is widely known.“Amazon is going to the mattresses,” said Stan Soloway, a deputy undersecretary of defense under President Bill Clinton and now president of Celero Strategies, a Washington-area consulting firm. “It feels like the same scorched-earth approach” that Oracle took.Earlier, Amazon had sounded a very different note on legal challenges in the government contracts arena. Two days before it lost the award to Microsoft, Teresa Carlson, who oversees government contracting for the company’s profitable cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, derided efforts by Oracle and others to cast the Pentagon’s bidding process as corrupt and rigged in Amazon’s favor.It’s “kind of sad” when losers routinely protest procurement decisions “because it delays innovation,” she told other female corporate leaders, lobbyists and government officials at a Washington conference.Amazon’s combative legal strategy includes seeking Trump’s deposition, which legal experts say is unlikely but not impossible. It hopes to block the Pentagon from putting the cloud project into effect without a new evaluation or award decision.The longer the delay, the more time it has to gather depositions from officials, win over lawmakers, influence public opinion and prevent Microsoft from doing anything on the cloud project that would be hard to reverse. It’s also claiming the Defense Department lowered its standards by choosing Microsoft.Microsoft declined to comment. Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment. Amazon pointed to earlier statements from company spokesman Drew Herdener who said the contract evaluation was tainted by deficiencies and “unmistakable bias.”The company scored an early win on Feb. 13 when a U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge temporarily blocked Microsoft from working on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud program while the lawsuit is pending. The order, which is still sealed, says the Pentagon must stop working on the contract “until further order of the court.”The e-commerce giant’s newfound aggressiveness has surprised some observers. The company remained a champion of the project in 2018 and 2019, while Oracle mounted a fierce lobbying and public-relations effort to stop the Pentagon from awarding a sole-source contract. “I didn’t think” they would protest even if they lost, Soloway said.Over the last two years, Oracle has filed -- and lost -- challenges at the Government Accountability Office and the federal claims court. Those efforts resulted in news stories airing its claims of unethical behavior by Pentagon and Amazon officials.Oracle’s audience wasn’t only bureaucrats and judges, but also the White House, lawmakers and the general public, all of which were simultaneously being flooded with revelations about Pentagon employees who worked on the procurement in its early days and then left to work for Amazon.Amazon is similarly seeking common cause with outsiders. Its case so far has attracted briefs from Protect Democracy, an anti-corruption group, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the Trump administration numerous times for alleged ethics lapses. Both organizations say they haven’t received money from Amazon.Amazon’s court case could help amplify its perspective on the procurement the same way that Oracle’s challenges attracted media attention. “There is also potential in litigation that you are arguing to members of Congress and the public,”said Steven Schooner, a professor of procurement law at George Washington University Law School.The company has been characterizing the loss of the contract as a political, not a technical, decision. Its suit contends that Pentagon officials artificially lowered their evaluation of the company’s proposal and that Trump “launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks to steer the JEDI contract” away from Amazon “to harm his perceived political enemy” -- Bezos.Earlier this month, Jay Carney, Amazon’s top spokesman, told CNBC that the company was taking legal action because it believes that “blatant political interference” affected the award decision. Trump has long criticized Bezos over everything from the shipping rates Amazon pays the U.S. Postal Service to his ownership of the Washington Post.While Oracle charged that Pentagon officials failed to properly investigate ethical issues surrounding the bid, Amazon goes further by arguing that bias cost it the deal. Amazon alleges that the Defense Department, swayed by Trump’s animosity, unfairly judged its bid. It cites passages in a book by the speechwriter to former Defense Secretary James Mattis, stating Trump once told Mattis to “screw Amazon” out of the bid. (Mattis has criticized the book.)“Contracting officers are accused every day of not playing by the rules but rarely that they had a vendetta,” said Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law.Microsoft, International Business Machines Corp. and other Amazon rivals at times joined forces with Oracle to try to stop the Pentagon from awarding the cloud contract to a single company, which made Amazon the obvious front-runner.Amazon not only was the market leader in the cloud-server industry, it also had won high-level security clearances from its previous work moving the Central Intelligence Agency’s data to the cloud.The tech companies courted the press and Defense Department cloud-services buyers. The Oracle coalition also descended on Capitol Hill, appealing particularly to members of the Armed Services committees. Some of the lawmakers would later propose curtailing the Pentagon’s funding for the contract until it justified its strategy.Amazon, likewise, in June hired a Trump-connected lobbyist, Jeff Miller, just before Trump disparaged the bidding process as uncompetitive, citing complaints from Oracle, Microsoft and IBM.Oracle’s legal challenges helped Microsoft catch up technologically -- and ultimately win. During the nearly three-year process, Microsoft won new deals with large customers such as Chevron Corp., AT&T Inc. and more than a dozen intelligence agencies that bolstered its standing in the marketplace.Delay Was Microsoft’s AllyMicrosoft, in addition, invested in a portable Azure system to analyze and transfer data to the cloud from the battlefield. The delay also gave Microsoft time to attain a higher level of government security, though it still hasn’t matched Amazon’s top-secret certification.Oracle, too, may have benefited from the delays it continued to engineer even after it was eliminated.

2020-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- When the Internet Accountability Project popped up late last year and joined the growing crusade against Big Tech, the nonprofit group refused to say who was financing it.Turns out, at least one of its benefactors is Oracle Corp.Oracle donated between $25,000 and $99,999 last year to the internet project, according to a new political-giving report Oracle posted on its website. The group calls itself a conservative nonprofit advocating for tougher privacy rules and stronger antitrust enforcement against the internet giants.The IAP financing is just one part of an aggressive, and sometimes secretive, battle Oracle has been waging against its biggest rivals, including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Oracle spent years fighting to unseat Amazon as the front-runner for a lucrative Pentagon cloud contract, which was awarded to Microsoft Corp. in October.The Redwood City, California, company has also been locked in a decade-long legal dispute with Google, claiming the search-engine giant violated Oracle copyrights by including some Java programming code in the Android phone. Oracle acquired Java’s developer, Sun Microsystems Inc., in 2010.Earlier this month, IAP filed an amicus brief supporting Oracle’s position in the case. IAP said it wants to “ensure that Google respects the copyrights of Oracle and other innovators.” The U.S. Supreme Court on March 24 will hear oral arguments in the Google v. Oracle America case.The Trump administration on Feb. 19 also urged the Supreme Court to reject Google’s appeal in the case. Its brief appeared the same day that Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and chairman, hosted a high-dollar fundraiser at his Rancho Mirage estate for President Donald Trump. The event prompted about 300 Oracle employees to stage a protest the next day. The U.S. had previously supported Oracle as the case wound its way through the courts.Oracle’s donations disclosure reveals that it contributed to at least four other groups that filed supportive briefs in the Supreme Court case. Google has also donated money to at least 10 groups that have filed briefs on its behalf in the high court case.Oracle and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment about the Oracle disclosure. Google declined to comment.IAP President Mike Davis said in a statement the group doesn’t disclose its financial backers but specified that Oracle didn’t fund its Supreme Court brief.The internet project was launched in September by Davis, a former aide to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Rachel Bovard, a former aide to Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. The group aims to “lend a conservative voice to the calls for federal and state governments to rein in Big Tech before it is too late,” according to its website.The IAP is a Section 501(c)(4), known as a “social-welfare” organization. That designation means it isn’t required to disclose donors as long as it doesn’t spend more than half of its money on campaign advertisements or activities to sway an election.Among other policies, IAP supports curtailing Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from liability for content that users post on their platforms. The clause saves tech companies from having to review content before it’s published online, and then shields them from lawsuits if that content turns out to be problematic.Earlier: Barr Takes Aim at Legal Shield Enjoyed by Google, FacebookIn interviews and on social media, IAP has supported Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has proposed that tech companies lose the legal immunity unless they can prove to the Federal Trade Commission that they treat their content in a politically neutral manner.Since September, IAP has tweeted at least 11 times about Hawley’s legislative efforts against Google and other tech companies. Other IAP tweets highlight instances in which Google-funded groups fought on the internet giant’s behalf.“Holy smokes you guys, DC is awash in @Google money,” Bovard tweeted in September.Davis, the group’s president, wrote last week on Townhall.com that Google’s battle with Oracle is “the poster child for what we at IAP call ‘the Great 21st Century Internet Heist.’” He said the company “is anathema to conservatives and everything we stand for,” without disclosing that his group is funded by Oracle.Earlier: It’s the Kochs vs. the Mercers in the Right’s Big Tech BrawlOracle claims Google owes it at least $8.8 billion for using the Java code without a license. Google argues it was fair to use parts of the programming language to help Android communicate more easily with other software.The case has split Silicon Valley by pitting software makers who favor stronger copyright protections against companies that rely on others’ code to produce new innovations.Other CampaignsIAP is far from the only anti-tech group Oracle has funded. It also gave between $25,000 and $99,999 to the Free and Fair Markets Initiative, according to the disclosure.Free and Fair Markets claims it is a grassroots coalition of businesses and advocacy groups fighting for a better economy. In practice, it has focused more on publicizing negative reports about Amazon. The Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle, Walmart Inc. and the Simon Property Group had financed the group.For the last two years, Oracle has also waged a multi-front battle against Amazon over the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract. The deal, which could be worth $10 billion over a decade, is designed to transition much of the Pentagon’s data into one commercially operated cloud system.For more: Oracle’s Catz Is Said to Talk Amazon Contract Row With TrumpAmazon was seen as the leading contender because it had already won a major cloud contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and had obtained high levels of security clearance. The move to Amazon’s cloud would have threatened Oracle’s legacy database business with the Defense Department.Oracle led a coalition of other tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., to oppose the Pentagon’s decision to award the contract to a sole bidder. In addition to lobbying Congress and the Trump administration, Oracle also filed -- and lost -- challenges through the Government Accountability Office and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.Oracle is currently appealing a July ruling that it lacked standing to challenge the contract.(Updates with comment from IAP in paragraph 11)&#92;--With assistance from Greg Stohr.To contact the reporters on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Reveals Funding of Dark Money Group Fighting Big Tech
2020-02-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce.com Inc. delivered a bag of surprises with its year-end earnings, including a $1.3 billion acquisition of Vlocity Inc. and most notably the exit of co-chief executive officer Keith Block, which prompted some concern on Wall Street.Evercore said Block leaves Salesforce in a sound position competitively and operationally, but his exit begs “the question of who will step into his shoes from a sales leadership and operational standpoint.” Meanwhile, Wedbush highlighted that it’s “not sure what to make of this change.”Shares in the company declined 1.7% during Wednesday’s pre-market trading.Generally, Wall Street remains confident in Salesforce’s positioning going forward. “We’re still in good hands,” Brian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, wrote in a note touting the tenure of Marc Benioff, who once again becomes the sole CEO.Here’s what analysts are saying:Roth Capital Partners (Richard Baldry)Neutral, price target $165 from $139“While F21 revenue and PF EPS was guided modestly higher, recent price appreciation and the co-CEO departure also announced yesterday leaves us sidelined with a neutral rating.”“Revenue guidance upside appears mostly driven by acquisition impacts,” Baldry wrote in a note. “Excluding acquisitions, revenues grew a more modest 22%.”Compass Point (Marshall Senk)Buy, price target $202“The surprise in the quarter was the announced departure of co-CEO Keith Block, who has been a linchpin in quadrupling revenues over the past seven years.”Senk said “the stock may show some weakness on this news.”“Given the depth of the management bench, the $30 billion of RPO and the company’s consistent execution track record, we are confident that the team will execute through Block’s departure from day to day operations.”Raymond James (Brian Peterson)Strong buy, price target $230 from $200Positively, Salesforce’s “strong results and above consensus outlook suggests that fundamentals remain impressive, while the Vlocity acquisition gives them a broader presence in a number of key verticals.”“That said, co-CEO Keith Block’s decision to step down may also raise questions on big deal momentum, though we remind investors that Mr. Benioff has built one of the most successful software companies of all time (i.e. - we’re still in good hands).”“We understand the inclination to trim on high profile management changes, but see little to disrupt CRM’s growth trajectory in the next several years.”Wedbush (Steve Koenig)Outperform, price target $217“Acquisitions put a dent in FY21 operating cash flow guidance, and the departure of Keith Block from his co-CEO role was a surprise.”“We’re not sure what to make of this change, but perhaps it’s related to media reports that have suggested Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff is preparing for a transition to next-generation leadership.”Piper Sandler (Brent Bracelin)Overweight, price target $205“The unexpected departure of co-CEO Keith Block may overshadow these solid results,” Bracelin wrote in a note, citing the potential for rising execution risks.“After a 26-year career at Oracle and just shy of seven years at Salesforce, Keith Block was a well respected leader internally and externally who helped scale” the company from a $3.8 billion run-rate when he joined to a $19 billion-plus run-rate today.Citigroup (Walter Pritchard)“The exit of Block is surprising, given ascension to the post from COO was just 18 months ago.”“We believe CRM’s deep bench will enable operational continuity, although acknowledge the change happened abruptly and without obvious explanation.”To contact the reporter on this story: Kamaron Leach in New York at kleach6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Kristine OwramFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Salesforce Falls as Surprise Executive Exit Overshadows Earnings

2020-02-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce.com Inc. Co-Chief Executive Officer Keith Block stepped down Tuesday after revamping the software maker’s growth strategy, helping fuel a fourfold increase in revenue during his tenure.Block garnered less public attention than founder and Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff during his seven years at the market leader for customer-relations software, but took command of day-to-day operations behind the scenes. Block, promoted from president to chief operating officer to co-CEO with Benioff in August 2018, professionalized the sales organization, taking lessons from his 26-year stint at Oracle Corp. He persuaded Benioff the company should tailor software for different industries, which expanded the universe of customers. And, as co-CEO, Block allowed Benioff time to focus on his many political and philanthropic initiatives.“Keith has really inspired us to be much more committed to verticals and vertical solutions than ever before,” Benioff said on a conference call with analysts. “It’s going to be a huge part of his legacy here.”Benioff said he would partner with Block in his undisclosed “next chapter.” The former co-CEO will remain an adviser, the company said.“Keith Block’s departure as Salesforce.com CEO dims enthusiasm over a strong 4Q, as he’s been critical to successes over the past seven years and leaves a short-term vacuum,” Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a research note. Salesforce shares declined about 2.5% in extended trading after the announcement.Despite Block’s departure, Benioff tried to reassure investors that Salesforce has a deep leadership bench. The company recently promoted Bret Taylor, the former product head, to chief operating officer and gave him additional responsibilities, suggesting he will become even more consequential in Block’s absence.Block’s focus on selling industry-specific software will remain prominent at the company, which also Tuesday announced a $1.3 billion acquisition of Vlocity Inc. to bolster that effort. Vlocity’s apps focus on six specific industries and help subscribers manage relationships with their customers, including T-Mobile US Inc. and TELUS Corp.Salesforce was an investor in the San Francisco-based startup founded by former Oracle executive David Schmaier. Vlocity’s software is built on Salesforce’s platform and Schmaier consulted Benioff and other Salesforce executives before starting the business, he said in a 2018 interview. Vlocity had a habit of locating its offices in Salesforce-occupied buildings, ensuring it would remain visible to the cloud-software pioneer.Vlocity’s current headquarters is in the Salesforce Tower, suggesting a relocation won’t be necessary if the deal closes as expected in the fiscal second quarter.Though Block was known for his sales acumen, he wanted to broaden his duties, which was part of the reason he took on a more diversified co-CEO role, Benioff said.Benioff and Block had sought to maintain Salesforce’s annual growth rates of about 25% through frequent acquisitions and international expansion. By the end of the fiscal year, the company is on target to have doubled its annual revenue over the past three years, spurred by snapping up MuleSoft Inc. in 2018 and Tableau Software Inc. in 2019.Sales will be as much as $21.1 billion in fiscal 2021, the San Francisco-based company said. Analysts projected $20.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which is at the top end of what the company had forecast in early December.In the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce reported Tuesday that revenue gained 35% to $4.85 billion, marking the second consecutive period of more than 30% year-over-year growth. Analysts, on average, projected $4.75 billion. Earnings, excluding some items, were 66 cents a share, topping analysts’ estimates of 56 cents.Revenue from Sales Cloud, the company’s flagship product, grew about 17% to $1.23 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 31. The company leads the market for sales-tracking software, but growth rates have slowed down, prompting Salesforce to diversify its business.Service Cloud sales increased 26% to $1.22 billion. The software maker offers this tool so companies can communicate with field employees and customers, a space where it faces competition from ServiceNow Inc., Zendesk Inc. and others.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Salesforce Loses Co-CEO Block Who Propelled Growth Strategy

2020-03-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett is waiting for one last fat pitch.The Oracle of Omaha released his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. late last month and followed it with a marathon interview on CNBC two days later. As in previous years, investors were eager to hear from Buffett about his succession plans and his assessment of markets, and he didn’t disappoint. What we learned is that, for Buffett, the two subjects are closely related.    As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Tara Lachapelle has already pointed out, Buffett will turn 90 this summer, so succession is top of mind for him and Berkshire’s shareholders. Buffett appears to have no doubt that the company will continue to thrive after he’s gone. “I want them to look back and say, ‘Gee, we should have made this change earlier,’” he told CNBC, adding that he feels “terrific” about Berkshire in the post-Buffett era and that “it’s almost going to be embarrassing” how well the company is prepared. Which raises the question: Why wait? Buffett has more than earned his retirement after a career that spans more than six decades. One answer is that Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of all time, and the great ones in any endeavor typically don’t walk away from the game until they have to. But I suspect the more important reason is that Buffett senses a historic investing opportunity coming, probably the last of his career, and he has no intention of watching from the sidelines.       Buffett has a knack for spotting trouble in financial markets. He’s not one for big pronouncements, preferring instead to say he simply doesn’t understand the things that concern him. But don’t be fooled. He didn’t understand internet companies in the 1990s before they roiled the stock market. He was also puzzled by the widespread use of derivatives in the 2000s before they blew up the financial system.What vexes Buffett today is investors’ eagerness to part with their money for shockingly little in return. “It makes no sense to lend money at 1.4% to the U.S. government when it’s government policy to have 2% a year inflation,” Buffett said. “The government is telling you, ‘We’re going to give you 1.4% and tax you on it, and on the other hand, we’re going to presumably devalue that money at 2% a year.’”It’s not just the government. “We’re allowing people to borrow money on much weaker terms than we were five or 10 years ago. You couldn’t borrow money at all for a period 10 years ago. I mean, literally, Berkshire couldn’t borrow money. Everything stopped. And now the pendulum has swung dramatically and yet we still have very, very, very low rates.”Buffett blames all that cheap money for driving up equity prices, particularly for outright purchases of companies, which he prefers to buying smaller stakes in public companies. “There’s quite a premium” for buying whole businesses, according to Buffett, “and part of the premium is because you can borrow so much money so cheaply in buying those businesses. Obviously, you can pay more for a business if you can borrow a very high percentage of the purchase price and of the future cash flow committed to it. And you can borrow at low rates with very little in the way of restrictive covenants or anything of the sort. That’s going to bring higher prices, and the demand for that is huge.”That’s a problem for Buffett because he cares about price more than anything else. I lost count of the number of times he made that point in his interview. Here’s one: “I don’t think anybody knows what the market’s going to do. I think you do know whether you’re making an intelligent purchase at a given price.” And another: “A stock can be a good buy or a bad buy. A bond can be a good buy or a bad buy. It depends on price.” And yet another: “In the end, if you own good businesses at the right price, you’re going to do fine.”Buffett’s money is where his mouth is. Roughly 41% of Berkshire’s stock portfolio is invested in financials, which is among the cheapest sectors. And nearly a third is in shares of Apple Inc., which Buffett began buying in early 2016 when the stock traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.6 during the first quarter of that year, based on 12-month trailing earnings per share, nearly half the S&P 500’s average P/E ratio of 19.5 at the time.And let’s not forget the whopping $128 billion of cash Buffett is hoarding at Berkshire. It’s not that he enjoys having all that cash around; Buffett’s reason for being is to buy companies. “I’ve actually been a personal net buyer of stocks ever since I was 11,” Buffett recalled. “We’re about 80% roughly in equities and about 20% in cash, and I’d rather have that 20% in other good businesses.”So how will it all shake out? “People are reaching for yield, there’s no question about that, and that’s stupid, and it has consequences over time,” Buffett explained, adding that, “It can take a lot longer than you think, but eventually you get to midnight and everything turns to pumpkins and mice.” In other words, when the money dries up or interest rates return to more normal levels — for Buffett, a question of when, not if — equity prices will tumble and he will have his opening. Like all great players, there are few flaws in Buffett’s game. But perhaps more than anything else, Buffett will be remembered as the master of the fat pitch, and he’s fixing for one more before he hangs up his stock charts.To contact the author of this story: Nir Kaissar at nkaissar1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the markets.

2020-03-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud division hired lobbyists to work on Defense Department and intelligence community cloud computing matters as the company fights the loss of a $10 billion Pentagon cloud-services contract over alleged political interference by President Donald Trump. Amazon Web Services hired Washington-based American Defense International in January, according to a lobbying disclosure filed this week.AWS hired Josh Martin, who recently served as chief of staff to Representative Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, according to the disclosure. Longtime defense lobbyist Michael Herson, who is president and chief executive officer of American Defense International, will also be working for the cloud-services giant, the filing showed.Representatives for AWS and the lobbying firm didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.Amazon is challenging the Pentagon’s award of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract to Microsoft Corp. in federal court over claims that the department failed to fairly judge its bid because Trump views Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos as his “political enemy.”The JEDI cloud project is intended to modernize the Defense Department’s technology systems and speed up real-time sharing of information across the military. The contract is worth as much as $10 billion over ten years and could offer the winner a bigger foothold in the burgeoning federal cloud market.Amazon scored a win last month when the U.S. Court of Federal Claims temporarily blocked Microsoft from working on the project while the lawsuit was ongoing.The Central Intelligence Agency is planning to hire multiple cloud-computing providers for a new program to serve the intelligence community.

Salesforce now has a market capitalization of $145 billion, not far from Oracle's $160 billion.Oracle has tried to respond with Oracle Cloud. But from the beginning, it was never a real cloud. It was built with proprietary hardware, run with proprietary software. Customers know the difference. Oracle is now having to lay off 1,300 people in Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands, most of whom will be snapped up by rivals.One of those rivals is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Its Google Cloud was late to the re-sale party and is now third in that market behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Its strategy for catching up has been to hire Thomas Kurian, who spent the previous 22 years as a director of project management. At Oracle. Larry's Doing OKFormer CEO Ellison may be the most unpopular man in Silicon Valley today. He has been funding dark money groups fighting the major cloud companies. He has contributed heavily to Trump and seen 300 employees hold a one-day strike in protest.But he's doing fine. His $59.4 billion fortune is the world's eighth largest. He owns the Hawaiian island of Lanai. He is a member of the board at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), having bought 3 million of its shares in 2018. That stake alone is worth over $2 billion. The Bottom Line on Oracle StockWhile Ellison and his executive team have made themselves rich, they haven't done very well for shareholders. Over the last year the stock's performance has even trailed that of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM).Oracle continues to insist its cloud customers will do OK, too. It has a new Cloud Data Science platform. This sounds great but, like so many Oracle Cloud &quot;innovations,&quot; it's years late to the party. Companies that remain tied to Oracle's databases by contract may welcome the new capabilities. Prospective customers know better.If Oracle were not working near the cutting edge of technology, the company would be failing. Its strategies are out of step with the industry mainstream. Thanks to the cloud raising all boats, it's only Oracle shareholders who are suffering.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-03-07,"(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. is cooperating with the U.S. Justice Department in its Google investigation, which is exploring whether the online search and advertising giant violated antitrust laws, according to a person familiar to the situation.The discussions are part of a probe into Google’s digital advertising and search operations, and antitrust officials have been meeting with a range of parties, people with knowledge of the matter have said previously. That includes discussions with companies and organizations other than those that have voiced complaints about google in the past, such as Oracle Corp., News Corp. and Yelp Inc.Google controls much of the technology that online publishers and marketers use to serve ads across the internet. Media companies and rivals have complained that Google’s dominance hinders competition, and its business practices have brought scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe.The Justice Department said it doesn’t comment on specific investigations or meetings.“As a general matter, it is usual for the department’s antitrust division to meet with a range of third parties during an investigation,” it said in a statement. “The department takes protecting the privacy of third parties seriously so as to protect them from any potential retribution from the target.”The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on AT&T’s talks with the Justice Department.The company had its own clash with the Justice Department starting in 2017, when antitrust enforcers sued to block AT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. But the telecom carrier ultimately prevailed and was able to close the transaction the following year.AT&T has pushed deeper into online ads in recent years, putting it in Google’s orbit. It agreed to buy AppNexus in 2018, giving it an online-ad exchange that is now part of a business AT&T calls Xandr.

2020-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly sales, signaling that demand for the company’s cloud services is holding up in the face of an economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak.The company also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares jumped about 4% in extended trading.Revenue gained 1.9% to $9.8 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Feb. 29, the Redwood City, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, expected $9.76 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said the effects of the spreading virus on global business added “uncertainty” to Oracle’s outlook for the current period. Sales in the three months ending in May could range from a decline of 2% to a gain of 2% from a year earlier, she said in a conference call. Analysts estimated about 2% growth to $11.3 billion.Profit, excluding some items, will be $1.20 to $1.28 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, she said. The midpoint is in line with analysts’ estimates.Analysts at Jefferies LLC warned on Wednesday that enterprise software companies including Oracle could be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic that began late last year. “No one is immune,” the analysts wrote Wednesday in a note to investors.Oracle shares closed at $39.80 in New York before the report, and have dropped 25% in the past 12 months.In the fiscal third quarter, revenue from cloud services and license support climbed 4% to $6.93 billion. That metric includes sales from hosting customers’ data on the cloud, but a large portion is generated by maintenance fees for traditional software housed on clients’ corporate servers.Cloud license and on-premise license sales declined 1.6% to $1.23 billion, suggesting the company is signing fewer new software deals.While Oracle’s applications and infrastructure segments performed better in the third quarter than the previous period, “it’s highly likely we may see some slowing in the next two quarters, as enterprises delay decisions to purchase new software packages,” Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note after the results.Catz has sought to boost profit by cutting expenses, including firing employees in global offices over the last few years. The world’s second-largest software maker has struggled to bring existing database customers to cloud-based offerings and better compete against big public-cloud purveyors including Amazon.com Inc.Investors have been looking for signs that Oracle’s Autonomous Database product, which is driven by artificial intelligence, can meaningfully contribute to the company’s revenue, which has remained little changed for two years. Oracle’s cloud-based applications have been a bright spot, but so far haven’t been large enough to fuel total sales growth.Profit, excluding some items, was 97 cents a share in the third quarter, Oracle said. Analysts estimated 96 cents.(Updates with forecast in the fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.net;Olivia Carville in New York at ocarville1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Sales Top Analysts’ Estimates on Cloud Service Demand

2020-03-13,"Along with most other stocks since late February, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has been on bearish path. Note that the shares have gone from $55 to $39.80. But today, there was a nice change in direction: ORCL stock is up 14% to $45.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com This is due to a combination of a snap back in the market as well as a solid earnings report. For the fiscal third quarter, revenues grew by 2% to $9.8 billion and the adjusted earnings came to 97 cents a share. As for the Street, the consensus estimate was for $9.75 billion on the top line and 96 cents a share for the profits.Actually, the quarterly growth in revenue was the highest in two years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Drowning Energy Stocks to Avoid for Now Here are some of the other highlights for the quarter:  * Among a group of 16 companies, Oracle ranked as a leader for Gartner's 2019 &quot;Magic Quadrant for Manufacturing Execution Systems.&quot; This was based on the vision and ability to execute with its cloud platform.  * Oracle announced the general availability of its Cloud Data Science Platform. This technology helps enterprises with training, managing and deploying sophisticated AI (Artificial Intelligence) projects. This is all backed up with the kinds of things businesses look for like audits, security and model catalogs.  * Oracle has continued with its aggressive expansion of its cloud infrastructure. In the quarter, the company added local regions in Saudi Arabia (Jeddah), Australia (Melbourne), Japan (Osaka), Canada (Montreal) and The Netherlands (Amsterdam). The goal is to have 36 cloud regions by the end of this year.  * Oracle and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bolstered their collaboration alliance by establishing a new interconnect location in Amsterdam, which is a strategic location for regions in Europe.  * There are plans to layoff up to 1,300 employees in Europe. This is part of a plan to streamline the cloud business.  * The Oracle Cloud Applications has been certified for FedRAMP Moderate Authorization. This is a key part of being more competitive in getting federal contracts.In the quarter, the main driver was the cloud business, which saw overall growth of 5%. Keep in mind that this segment now accounts for 71% of total revenues.The company has also been bolstering its core database business. After all, Oracle has had to fend off fast-growing startups like Mongodb (NASDAQ:MDB). There is also more competition for mature operators like MSFT and SAP (NYSE:SAP).So a key part of Oracle's strategy is its Autonomous Database. As the name implies, the system handles tasks like security patches automatically. There is also much flexibility with modern environments by being serverless and elastic.On the earnings call, here's what Oracle CTO and chairman Larry Ellison had to say: &quot;We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud.&quot; Bottom Line on ORCL StockThen how will the likely downturn in the economy impact ORCL stock? Well, for the most part, the company's revenue base is likely to hold up very well. Oracle has the benefit of highly sticky applications for strategic areas like databases, middleware and ERP. Such technologies are not discretionary for customers.And as a sign of confidence, Oracle has announced a $15 billion buyback. In fact, the company has been a big buyer for quite some time. For the past five years, there has been a 28% reduction in the share count.Thus, for investors looking for a bargain in the tech sector -- and where the yield is a respectable 2.4% -- Oracle does look like a good choice right now.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

2020-03-13,"On its face, VMWare (NYSE:VMW) looks too cheap. VMWare stock now has declined 30% so far this year. Most of the selling pressure has come in the last few weeks, as broad markets have accelerated to the downside.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com At yesterday's close of $97 -- a 30-month low -- VMW now trades at below 16x this year's adjusted earnings per share guidance of 2020. That appears far too low a valuation for a company that remains a leader in &quot;virtualization&quot; of on-premise servers.But looking closer, the case for VMWare stock does get a bit thinner. Yes, the multiple is low -- but the same is true of earnings growth. There are underlying changes in customer behavior that present a risk.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsForced to choose, I'd argue VMW indeed is too cheap. I recommended the stock, if cautiously, in December. Until recently, I owned Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), VMWare's majority owner. I'm far from a VMW bear.  * 7 Stocks to Sell as We Enter a Bear Market The risks are real, however. And even at a cheaper price, after recent developments I'm not ready to start pounding the table for VMWare stock -- yet. The Earnings MultipleAgain, 16x this year's earnings 'feels' too cheap. But looking at both 2019 results and 2020 guidance, that multiple appears far more reasonable.At least from a profit standpoint, this no longer is a torrid grower. VMWare, in fact, isn't much of a grower at all. Adjusted EPS rose 21% in fiscal 2019 (ending January). The figure grew just 4% in FY20, however. Guidance for fiscal 2021 given on the fourth-quarter earnings call is for adjusted EPS of $6.55 this year -- up just 5% year-over-year.There's certainly a case that mid-single-digit profit growth can drove a modestly higher multiple. But at least looking at last year and this year, it's tough to make the case that VMWare stock is dramatically undervalued. The fact is that FY20 performance was a bit soft. And fiscal 2021 guidance was quite soft relative to Wall Street expectations: consensus EPS estimates for this year were at $7.03 heading into the report.VMW now is down well more than 22% since that release after the close on Feb. 27 -- and the decline can't be attributed to the market-wide sell-off alone. The fourth-quarter report was disappointing, both in terms of the actual numbers and guidance. Even in a more stable market, it's likely VMW stock would have sold off, if possibly not to the extent that it has. The Shift to CloudVMWare's valuation needs to be considered in the context of the longer-term outlook as well. There are challenges ahead.As Barron's detailed in November, the rise of open-source Kubernetes software, originally developed by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a threat to VMWare's business. It allows companies to move from local servers to the cloud -- bypassing VMWare's vSphere in the process.VMWare is trying to respond by bulking up its own cloud capabilities. The acquisition of Pivotal Software gives the company its own Kubernetes platform.But these pivots are difficult, and expensive. Again, 16x for VMW stock might sound cheap. But IBM (NYSE:IBM), which acquired Red Hat to drive its own cloud transition, now trades at barely 9x the 2020 consensus EPS estimate. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is at 11.5x FY20 EPS.If VMWare stumbles at all in its own shift, there's not much reason it can't see earnings multiples around those levels at some point. It's true that IBM and ORCL had higher multiples just a month ago, and too have come down in the recent sell-off.But even in what was still an optimistic bull market before late January, IBM and ORCL generally were valued at 12-15x earnings. If VMWare looks like another victim of the cloud, instead of a beneficiary, there's not much reason it can't see a similar multiple. And that suggests more downside even from $106. The Case for VMWare StockThe negativity here doesn't mean that VMW stock is a sell, or a short, at the lows. Rather, the point is that there are real risks here -- and at least some logic behind the sell-off. This is not a case where VMW's only problem has been broad market weakness.That said, there are reasons for optimism, too. VMWare, in my opinion, is not IBM or Oracle. The acquisitions of Pivotal and Carbon Black not only help the transition to the cloud -- but they hurt near-term margins. The shift to subscription revenue -- which is booked over time -- versus perpetual licenses provides another near-term headwind.The underlying profitability of the business is better than this year's guidance suggests. Indeed, analysts see earnings snapping back next year to $7.61 per share -- 16% above current FY21 guidance. (Worth noting: that guidance doesn't appear to incorporate too much in terms of impact from the coronavirus, at least per VMWare commentary last month.)If VMWare can get to that level, then VMWare stock may well be too cheap. The stock trades at less than 14x that estimate. That's a multiple that prices in little, if any, growth from that point on -- and I don't believe VMWare's days of profit growth are over for good. Be Cautious With VMWare StockStill, from both a near-term and long-term perspective there is reason for caution. Near-term trading can get worse for VMW stock. Long-term, the company still has work to do.And on both fronts, I'm not sure VMW is quite the most compelling play just yet. There are plenty of quality stocks out there with their own significant declines simply due to broad market trading.VMWare's disappointing earnings report means it's not one of those stocks. It's likely the stock has fallen too far -- but that hardly means it shouldn't have fallen at all.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-13,"Amid all the chaos caused by the COVID 19 pandemics causing global stock to tumble, software giant Oracle Inc. (NYSE: ORCL) has managed to achieve the best revenue growth in almost two years. Moreover, Oracle is the first among the large firms in tech to report figures from a period that includes the coronavirus pandemics.Although Oracle has so far failed to challenge the biggest cloud infrastructure providers Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) whose JEDI wars aren't over just yet, neither is Oracle done trying as it has a strength of its own which its latest earnings report showed.Q3 Earnings Report The company has managed to increase sales 1.9% compared to last year as sales amounted to $9.8 billion, marking its best performance since May 2018 and resulting in a profit of $2.6 billion, or 79 cents a share. Before this increase, Oracle has struggled quite a bit to increase revenue as it kept posting year-over-year gains of less than 0.5% for six consecutive quarters.After adjustments, earnings amounted to 97 cents a share. This is an increase from last year's 87 cents a share.According to FactSet, analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 96 cents a share on sales of $9.75 billion. The cloud license segment achieved $1.23 billion in revenue, which is down 2%  but at least more than the $1.19 billion FactSet consensus estimated. However, both the company's hardware and services divisions missed expectations. Hardware was down 6% as its revenue amounted to $857 million, significantly missing the FactSet consensus was $878 million. Services revenue was down only 1% but reached $778 million whereas FactSet consensus was more optimistic at $781 million.COVID-19 Reportedly, there has been no discernible impact on sales so far but that is due to the fact that  Oracle is somewhat protected thanks to the strenghts of its business model. Its stock, however, has not been immune to the recent market tumble.But, Oracle wasn't performing well before the coronavirus hit either as shares have declined 24.6% in the past year.  Oracle  shares rose as much as 4.44% immediately following the results but later lost much of their gains Thursday after hours, following already a drop of 11% during the day's trading session. The company's stock traded lower on Thursday than it had since 2017, as this was really a Black Thursday for Wall Street.Challenges Oracle is reportedly laying off employees in Europe, which adds to the image of encountering difficulties to achieve promised revenue growth as it attempts to catch up with cloud peers. If we also consider the significantly slower pace of hiring that took place since September last year, it is obvious that  the path to the cloud is presenting structural challenges for the company. As for its guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, as the case with other companies, it was left wide due to the COVID-19 uncertainty.The projected revenue ranges from a decline of 2% to a gain of 2% resulting in a range of $10.92 billion to $11.36 billion.  The middle of the range for quarterly revenue guidance was slightly lower than expected as analysts estimated $11.31 billion. Adjusted earnings guidelines were in the range of $1.20 to $1.28 a share in which FactSet analyst estimates of $1.23 do fit in.Competitors Oracle's leadership position in enterprise databases should position it well for cloud-enabled database services. However, it is unlikely that it could become a serious threat to Amazon and Microsoft. Meanwhile, another cloud software giant Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM) also has managed to beat the latest earnings estimates for the 12th consecutive quarter on Feb. 25 as its e-commerce traffic surged in Q4. According to Salesforce, the increased prevalence of mobile wallet solutions such as Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has had its fair share in changing consumer behaviour when it comes to shopping. But both of these companies have issued revenue warnings of the COVID 19 impact so let's hope that the strong  increase in e-commerce that benefited many digital retailers won't be contaged, not to say diminished entirely, by the coronavirus.Salesforce is also San Francisco's largest private employer as it has more than 7,000 employees in the city itself. Therefore, the responsible thing to do was to ask its employees in California to work remotely in March due to the pandemics so there will be some impact on its workings. But this is surely a company who can protect its system well from any hacking attempts.Outlook For Oracle On the bright side, analysts appreciate Oracle's execution capacity and find it to be among the best in the industry. During the past two recessions, it has successfully increased its margins thanks to its ability to cut costs rapidly. And overall, the third quarter earnings report pleased investors as it showed that cloud subscriptions succeeded at driving growth.There's no arguing that Oracle's revenue growth has slowed recently as the company continues to navigate a path to the cloud but there is evidence that it has decisively shifted toward a more predictable subscription model that will continue pushing its revenues and profit up.This Publication is contributed by IAMNewswire.comPress Releases - If you are looking for full Press release distribution contact: press@iamnewswire.comContributors - IAM Newswire accepts pitches.

2020-03-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The coronavirus outbreak has become a global pandemic, stock markets are crashing, credit is getting crunched and his stock price is down 30%. So of course, SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son would announce a share buyback.This isn’t a crazy idea. It’s well-timed and savvy.The Japanese conglomerate best known for its $99 billion Vision Fund plans to spend up to 500 billion yen ($4.8 billion) to purchase as much as 7% of its own shares. The move doesn’t come totally out of the blue. It’s one of the actions called for by activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which earlier this year took a stake of about 3% in the company, and then called on Son to improve corporate governance and appoint more independent directors.Son is not alone in seeing opportunity in signs that the global rout could continue, even after his company has lost a third of its value. The announcement came Friday the 13th, a day after U.S. equities dropped the most since Black Monday in 1987. It includes a one-year timeline to conclude the buyback, plenty of time for prices to go lower.   Just hours earlier, Oracle Corp. announced that its board authorized a $15 billion buyback. At the start of the week,Twitter Inc. said that it plans to repurchase $2 billion of shares under measures to placate Elliott, which had also called for changes at the social-media company.  Twitter had only lost 13% from its recent high when it made its announcement; Oracle was off about 29%. That’s how big a difference four days makes.Investors were starting to question the outlook for Tokyo-listed SoftBank’s portfolio of companies even before the U.S. woke up to the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak. Its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is the single largest asset on the balance sheet. The Chinese e-commerce giant is on track to report one of its worst quarters of revenue growth since listing in 2014.Of course, the bigger issue is its stable of unicorns that live within the Vision Fund, including Chinese and Southeast Asian ride-hailing companies Didi Chuxing and Grab Holdings Inc. and short-video service ByteDance Inc., as well as troubled Indian accommodation startup Oyo Hotels.Despite troubles at some of these investments, notably office-rental outfit The We Company (better know as WeWork), Son had brushed off most of Elliott’s concerns at last month’s investor conference and seemed unlikely to enact any of its recommendations beyond a buyback.Among the impacts of a repurchase, beyond reducing the share pool and concentrating the value of each remaining share, is signalling confidence to investors and boosting the price. Given the macroeconomic and market environment, it’s unlikely Twitter, Oracle or SoftBank’s shares will be able to swim against the tide and quickly rebound. SoftBank, for example, closed 5.1% lower Friday after dropping as much as 9.6%.Both SoftBank and Oracle are showing streaks of opportunism that emerge quickly in the kind of upheaval we’ve seen in recent days. Expect more — Apple Inc. has plenty of cash, and is overdue for another big buyback announcement.  If you’re committing your company to buying something, then you may as well pay rock-bottom prices for it. We’re still looking for the bottom.It’s possible that that Son could mistime his buyback, which would make him look a little foolish.  More likely, he’ll wait for an inevitable rebound that will make him seem a genius, a moniker he has failed to earn recently.Son may appear as though he’s listening to a vocal activist shareholder. Actually, in the rich  tradition of technology companies, he’s just being an opportunist. Watch for others to follow suit.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-03-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Google employees in Europe could soon have more power to challenge company decisions after the search giant approved the creation of a council that will represent the interests of thousands of its workers across the continent.Earlier this month, a group of 153 Google employees from 11 European offices wrote to the company’s management requesting the establishment of the council, according to three people familiar with the matter. Last week, Google’s management agreed to take the first steps toward creating the council and will soon begin negotiating with employees about its scope, the people said.The creation of such works councils-- which aim to give employees the right to be consulted by management about issues such as organizational changes or job cuts -- is required by the European Union if enough of a company’s employees in at least two countries file a written request.The works council is likely to include employee representatives from more than 35 Google offices across Europe, according to the people familiar with the matter. It will meet several times annually in Dublin, the people said.A spokeswoman for Alphabet Inc.’s Google said in a statement that the company had “always encouraged constructive and open dialog with Googlers, and we always will.”She added, “We look forward to working together with our employees on this.”The move could represent an opportunity for Google and its European employees to improve relations that in recent years have frayed over working conditions and decisions made by senior leadership at the company. In the last two years, the search giant has endured a series of internal protests as employees have complained about controversial contracts with the U.S. military, a plan to build a censored search engine in China and multimillion dollar payments to executives accused of sexual harassment.“The point of the works council is to be the voice of the employees -- to express concerns and to find better solutions,” said Gabriel Kerneis, a Google software engineer who is based in Paris and was involved with the effort to set up the council. “We hope that it will create a fairer process.”The works council can’t veto company decisions, but the process means that employees should be consulted and can sometimes cast a vote to oppose or approve certain measures, allowing for greater input into management plans before they are finalized, said Kerneis.Google already has a works council in place in Paris, as mandated by French law. A similar council is currently being set up by employees in the company’s Zurich office, according to a person familiar with developments there. However, the nation-level councils can only consider issues relevant to their respective offices.Last year, employees who were involved in organizing internal protests at Google alleged that the company had retaliated against them, demoting them from their positions and effectively forcing them to leave the company. The search giant was also accused of developing an internal spy tool to monitor worker activism and of trying to shut down workers’ attempts to learn about their rights in Zurich. Google has denied allegations that it has sought to suppress employee activism.After those incidents, employees who were involved in trying to establish the European works council said that they were concerned that their efforts to gather support would be met with a harsh response from senior leadership, who they feared might try to shut them down.In the end, employees were pleasantly surprised by the positive response they say they received from company management, according to several employees.“We didn’t know what would happen, but there’s not been any blow back so far, which has been great,” said Hannah Pascal, a senior software engineer at Google who is based in London and was involved with the effort to set up the council. “These issues that are coming up -- complaining about retaliation, or taking on dodgy contracts -- we hope the council is going to allow us to have more of an eye-level discussion with management about them.”There is a legal mandate in the E.U. for the creation of works councils. A 2009 directive states that if a group of 100 employees from offices in two or more E.U. countries submit a written request for the establishment of a works council, central management must initiate negotiations to form one.Other large American technology companies, including Oracle Corp., HP Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc., have similar works councils in place in Europe. The results have been mixed. In 2012, for instance, the European works council at Hewlett-Packard sued the company, alleging that it had obstructed the council’s right to be consulted on planned job cuts.“There’s resistance from some employers, but others have embraced it and recognized it is a good way of developing trust among staff,” said Catherine Barnard, professor of E.U. law at Cambridge University. “It depends how cooperative or otherwise both sides are, and how willing both sides are to engage.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Agrees to Worker Council in Europe Amid Recurring Discord

For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter.Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) is creating a website and mobile applications for collecting data on the treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients with antimalarial drugs, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.What Happened Oracle is donating the project to the federal government, which will maintain oversight, according to the Post.The platforms will collect information from doctors about administering the drugs to their coronavirus patients to determine their effectiveness based on data outside of more established methods of clinical trials.The Trump administration is also exploring whether the participating doctors should receive bonus payments, the Post noted.President Donald Trump was convinced of the effectiveness of two antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for the coronavirus after multiple conversations with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, multiple officials familiar with the matter told the Post.Why It Matters Ellison is a long-term backer of Trump, and earlier this year held a fundraiser for his re-election bid, even as hundreds of employees walked out as a protest, Time reported in February.The president has publicly advocated for the use of both drugs for COVID-19 based on anecdotal evidence from China and France.Many healthcare officials, including within the Trump administration, have called for more evidence, in particular for proper clinical trials to be conducted, before the drugs are recommended for COVID-19 patients.&quot;Many of the things that you hear out there are what I had called anecdotal reports,&quot; White House Coronavirus Task Force member Anthony Fauci said on the antimalarial drugs on Saturday, as per the Post.&quot;They may be true, but they're anecdotal. So the only thing that I was saying is that if you really want definitively to know if something works, that you've got to do the kind of trial that you get, the good information.&quot;At least 18,615 people across the globe have lost their lives to the deadly virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

2020-03-27,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic has put on indefinite hold a major portion of the U.S. Supreme Court’s docket, including a multibillion-dollar clash between software giants Google and Oracle Corp. and cases that could affect President Donald Trump’s re-election chances.What was supposed to have been a drama-filled spring at the high court has instead become a season of waiting, especially for the lawyers and litigants in 20 arguments that had been scheduled for March and April. The court has postponed 11 of those cases and could do the same soon for the remaining nine.The cases include fights over congressional and grand jury subpoenas for Trump’s financial records -- clashes that need to be resolved in the court’s current term to give the president’s critics any chance of seeing the documents before the November election. Also on hold is a clash over the Electoral College for presidential elections and an $8 billion copyright dispute between Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Oracle.It’s not clear whether the justices are still hoping to resolve those cases in their current term, possibly by forgoing argument or by breaking tradition and hearing arguments by phone or online. Lawyers say they’ve received no guidance from the court on the subject, though briefing deadlines are still in force. The term normally ends in late June, although that time frame is now in doubt as well.‘Just Waiting’“As far as oral arguments go, we’re just waiting upon the court,” said Jay Sekulow, the lead lawyer for Trump in the president’s bid to block a New York grand jury subpoena for the president’s financial information. The case had been set for argument March 31.Courtroom arguments are unlikely anytime soon. Elderly people are at increased risk of dying should they contract the coronavirus, and two justices are in their 80s -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, who’s been treated in recent years for pancreatic and lung cancer, and Stephen Breyer, 81. Four others are 65 or older, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 65, whose type 1 diabetes puts her at additional risk.The court is moving ahead with rulings in dozens of cases that have already been argued. The justices issued four opinions earlier this week and plan to issue more on Monday. All nine justices are healthy and took part in a scheduled private conference by phone Friday, spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.Time-Sensitive CasesThe grand jury subpoena case shows the difficulty of holding arguments in the near future. Sekulow’s adversary would be Carey Dunne, a lawyer in the Manhattan district attorney’s office whose city is at the epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak. The White House says anyone traveling from New York should self-quarantine for 14 days.And yet the subpoena cases are also among the most time-sensitive, at least from the standpoint of the Democrats seeking the information. Lower courts required Trump’s banks and accountants to turn over the records, which could include his tax returns, but those rulings are on hold.“Delaying this case is effectively picking a side,” seven liberal groups led by Demand Justice said Wednesday. “Every day that Trump is allowed to keep his tax returns secret is a day that he has won and the public has lost.”Similarly, the court had been aiming to resolve clashes over the Electoral College, the body that will formally select the next president, before any election controversies may arise. At issue in cases scheduled for argument April 28 is whether states can stop “faithless electors” who try to cast a vote for someone other the candidate who won their state’s balloting.“We’ve gotten no indication about whether it’s going forward,” said Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor and the lawyer for two groups of electors who say they have the right to vote as they please. But “we’re preparing as if it is.”Google and OracleOther cases could more easily be deferred until the new term opens in October. That includes Google’s appeal of a ruling that the software giant improperly used Oracle’s copyrighted programming code in the Android operating system. Oracle says it’s entitled to at least $8.8 billion in damages in the case, which had been scheduled for a March 24 argument.Google’s lawyer, Tom Goldstein, said he is preparing as if the argument will now be in April even though “it’s unlikely.” That includes taking part in “moot court” practice arguments using Google video chat, he said.Joshua Rosenkranz, Oracle’s lawyer, said he’ll put his three planned moot courts back on his schedule once the court sets a new argument date. He said he expects Chief Justice John Roberts, who argued 39 Supreme Court cases before becoming a judge, will ensure the lawyers have ample time to ramp back up.“The chief justice certainly knows how much time it takes to prepare to stand up in the Supreme Court,” he said.(Updates seventh paragraph to show opinions will be released Monday, justices are healthy)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Google, Oracle and Trump Put on Supreme Court Hold By Virus"

2020-04-09,"(Bloomberg) -- There has been concern for months in Silicon Valley that the eventual Democratic presidential candidate would be someone who wanted to break up large technology companies. Bernie Sanders’s decision Wednesday to end his campaign effectively ends that scenario, leaving a presumptive nominee—former vice president Joe Biden—who is comparatively content with the way Silicon Valley does business.The turn in the primary race corresponds with an upheaval in political priorities due to the Covid-19 crisis. It’s still uncertain how the aftermath of the pandemic will play out, but the political landscape the industry faces in 2020 has almost certainly been transformed over the last six weeks.The primary process first took a hostile turn to the tech industry last spring when Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed a plan to force Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. to spin off parts of their businesses. Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, later said he would “absolutely” aim to break up large technology companies if elected. At the same time, multiple investigations into allegations of anticompetitive behavior from large technology companies were accelerating.For his part, Biden has called it “premature” to call for breaking up companies like Facebook. The former vice president has criticized tech companies and their leaders, particularly Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, telling the New York Times editorial board that he had “never been a big Zuckerberg fan.” In the same interview, Biden suggested revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law protecting tech companies from legal liability for what their users post. The industry has made defending the law one of its top political priorities.But Biden’s attacks have never provoked the concerns as those from Sanders and Warren. He has deep ties to the tech industry; his former director of communications, Jay Carney, is now Amazon’s top spokesman. Biden has also repeatedly framed his administration as a continuation of the Obama years, and several former Obama officials have set up shop in Silicon Valley.While the tech industry rank-and-file mostly donated to the industry’s antagonists, its executives seemed most excited about younger moderates Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker. Biden is a happy consolation prize.An open question is who Biden surrounds himself with now that he seems to have locked up the nomination. Neither Warren nor Sanders has endorsed him, and may hold out to push Biden to pick staff supporting their priorities.The anti-tech momentum may also fade because of the coronavirus pandemic. While state and federal antitrust investigations will continue, new antitrust rules will likely take a back seat to more economic rescue legislation. Tech services seem even more vital when large swaths of the population are confined to their houses. And Google, Facebook, Apple Inc., and others have been quick to offer help in various ways.President Donald Trump has been vocally critical of technology companies, and he’s widely unpopular among tech workers. He has regularly called for crackdowns on social media companies and other perceived enemies in the industry. But his top policy achievement, a major corporate tax cut, helped send tech stock prices soaring. (They have since come back down after coronavirus fears have sunk the entire market.) Trump has also seemed to pick favorites among the tech sector, cozying up to Oracle Corp. and Apple, while repeatedly criticizing Amazon and Facebook.Silicon Valley voters generally lean Democratic. But it’s even harder than usual to predict what the upcoming election will look like. Even basic questions about the mechanics of voting remain unresolved. But for now, the things the tech industry was worried about at the beginning of this year seem like a distant memory.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The Politics of 2020 Are Looking Less Ominous for Tech

2020-04-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. will let paying customers decide which countries their virtual meetings get routed through, a move to assuage clients worried they may be vulnerable to possible Chinese snooping.The ability to select preferred data center locations will be available beginning April 18, Brendan Ittelson, Zoom chief technology officer, said Monday in a blog post. Paid users can also opt out of certain locations. Free users will be locked into data centers in their region, which will mean a U.S.-based data center for many users.Zoom has gone from being used by 10 million office workers a day to more than 200 million people, including many consumers. The new uses have exposed security flaws with the app’s default privacy settings, thrusting the company into controversy and spurring Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan to focus on the safety concerns. Researchers from the University of Toronto found that some Zoom calls had been routed through data centers in China despite none of the users being based in the country, raising the specter that the data might be accessible to the Chinese government. The company said it would stop routing calls through China unless one of the participants was based there.Zoom has 19 data centers, which are shared with other tenants, and also uses cloud-computing services from Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Zoom Offers New Call Controls for Paying Clients in Privacy Push

2020-04-15,"The report throws new wrinkles into the ongoing battle between JEDI awardee Microsoft Corp., competitor Amazon Web Services and the DOD.",OIG report finds no evidence of political bias in JEDI contract award
2020-04-16,"(Bloomberg) -- The Defense Department’s watchdog found no evidence that the Pentagon’s controversial decision to award a $10 billion cloud-computing contract to Microsoft Corp. was the result of interference from President Donald Trump, though it said its probe was limited by the White House.The 317-page report issued Wednesday by the inspector general’s office also found that giving the JEDI contract to a single company -- Microsoft -- rather than dividing it among competitors was “consistent with applicable acquisition standards.”While the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project was hotly disputed by rival technology companies from the start, the project gained broader attention when Trump publicly expressed concern about the assumption that the contract would go to Amazon.com Inc.After Microsoft was given the award instead, Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud services unit, filed a lawsuit alleging that political interference by Trump cost the company the cloud deal. Amazon said in the suit that the Defense Department failed to fairly judge its bid because Trump viewed Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos as his “political enemy.”In its report, the inspector general’s office said, “We believe the evidence we received showed that the DoD personnel who evaluated the contract proposals and awarded Microsoft the JEDI Cloud contract were not pressured regarding their decision on the award of the contract by any DoD leaders more senior to them, who may have communicated with the White House.”But the report also said the White House limited cooperation with the inquiry. The inspector general said the assertion of a “presidential communications privilege” resulted in the Defense Department general counsel instructing officials “not to answer our questions about potential communications between White House and DoD officials about JEDI.”Claiming VindicationWhile Amazon’s lawsuit is still in the courts, the Defense Department declared vindication from the inspector general’s findings.“This report should finally close the door on the media and corporate-driven attacks on the career procurement officials who have been working tirelessly to get the much needed JEDI cloud computing environment into the hands of our front-line warfighters while continuing to protect American taxpayers,” Lieutenant Colonel Robert Carver, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw said in a statement that the “report makes clear the DoD established a proper procurement process.”Jon Palmer, deputy general counsel for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, said in a blog post that Amazon “bid high and lost. Should Amazon be allowed a do-over on JEDI?”Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement on Wednesday night that the inspector general’s findings say “nothing about the merits of the award, which we know are highly questionable.”Amazon has asked the U.S Court of Federal Claims to require that the Pentagon to broaden the scope of a reevaluation that the government requested after a judge said the Defense Department might have misjudged part of Microsoft’s pricing proposal for the work.But the Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, said the inspector general’s findings underscore that the JEDI award was riddled with ethical problems and the appearance of improper influence by Trump.“Add to that the White House’s inappropriate refusal to participate in the inspector general’s investigation, and we have a $10 billion mess on our hands,” Scott Amey, the group’s general counsel, said in a statement.The Pentagon has said that JEDI, with its acronym inspired by “Star Wars,” is intended to help bring American military technology into the modern era. The Defense Department is investing in commercial cloud services, which host computing power and storage in remote data centers, to improve data security and speed up real-time sharing of information across the military. The contract is valued at as much as $10 billion.The inspector general examined dueling allegations of misconduct surrounding complaints that former employees with ties to Amazon may have structured the deal to favor the company, as well as the assertion that Amazon lost out because of Trump’s antipathy toward Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post.Amazon’s lawsuit cites a book by Guy Snodgrass, a speechwriter to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who alleges that Trump told Mattis in 2018 to “screw Amazon” and lock it out of the bid. Mattis didn’t do what Trump asked, Snodgrass wrote.The inspector general’s office said Mattis couldn’t recall whether Trump made that comment, but he said “I knew his dissatisfaction with Amazon. I mean I knew that loud and clear.” Mattis also told the watchdog that the book by Snodgrass was “full of inaccuracies.”Oracle’s AccusationsThe Pentagon inspector general’s office also examined allegations, surfaced by Oracle Corp. in a lawsuit challenging the terms of the contract solicitation. Oracle said the bid was tailor-made for Amazon and was fatally tainted by conflicts of interest between the Defense Department and the e-commerce giant.At least two former Defense Department employees were offered jobs at Amazon while working on the contract, according to the lawsuit. Oracle is appealing a July ruling from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that dismissed its legal challenge to the cloud contract.In one case, the inspector general concluded that Deap Ubhi -- a former Amazon employee who soon went back to the company -- violated procurement regulations through his “false statements and his failure to disclose his employment negotiations and job acceptance with Amazon.”But the watchdog added that Ubhi’s “minimal and limited contributions were largely discarded and did not affect the conduct or outcome of the JEDI Cloud procurement.” Ubhi didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.The inspector general also concluded that Stacy Cummings, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, violated ethics requirements when she participated in a matter related to the procurement while owning stock in Microsoft valued between $15,001 and $50,000 but that her participation didn’t influence the decision. Cummings couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.The Pentagon watchdog cleared two other former Defense Department officials -- Sally Donnelly, a former top aide to Mattis, and Anthony DeMartino, who also worked in the defense secretary’s office -- of misconduct. Both had consulted for Amazon before working at the Defense Department.(Updates with Amazon statement, in 11th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Pentagon Watchdog Clears Microsoft’s Cloud Win Over Amazon

2020-04-22,"(Bloomberg) -- SAP SE’s abrupt decision to scrap its co-CEO leadership structure was another vivid example from the software industry that two chief executive officers look better on paper than in practice.SAP became the third of its peers to abandon the dual-CEO model, just six months after returning to the structure with the appointments of Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. The rationale at the time was that Morgan would remain in the U.S. and play a prominent role overseeing the German technology giant’s extensive American operations. Klein would be based at headquarters. Both young executives would help fill the shoes of departing CEO Bill McDermott, a charismatic American who led the company for a decade.But time and the novel coronavirus pandemic exposed the risks of having more than one boss: Two executives must sign off on decisions, which often slows operations and generates competing spheres of influence within an organization. SAP’s late Monday announcement that Morgan would depart at the end of April followed similar decisions by Oracle Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc., software makers that experimented with twin leaders before returning in the past six months to a sole CEO.“Two heads are not better than one,” said Charles Elson, the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “When you have two CEOs, there are inevitable clashes between the two. One will dominate and the other has to go. They always end up with one person being CEO.”Over the past two decades, companies as different as Citigroup Inc. and BlackBerry have attempted to share power between co-CEOs, only to drop the effort after little success.“When times are good, it’s easier to be more relaxed — take a little longer, hold a little more conversation before decisions,” Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Bernstein, said. “When times are more difficult, that’s where you need to be able to make a cohesive decision. If the two of them at SAP couldn’t make decisions together, obviously that was a failure.”The two-CEO structure only works well if there’s a clear division of labor and the participants are determined to share power, analysts say.Salesforce saw its co-CEO structure unravel within 18 months. In February, the San Francisco-based company said Keith Block had stepped down from his post as co-CEO for a vague new chapter, but would advise company co-founder Marc Benioff, co-CEO at the time with Block. The company was explicit that Block wouldn’t be replaced and Benioff would go back to being the lone CEO.“In Keith and Marc, Keith was a very strong person, Marc is a very strong person,” Moerdler said. “While Keith was more operational than Marc, there was still a significant overlap in responsibilities. You start seeing strong people being unhappy sharing power.”The longest a large tech company has lasted with two CEOs recently is five years, at SAP early in McDermott’s tenure, and at Oracle. Safra Catz and Mark Hurd began sharing the Oracle CEO title in 2014, with Catz focused on finances and Hurd acting as chief salesman. Both made decisions in concert with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who remained an engaged executive chairman. Elson said the arrangement lasted because Ellison ran the show and the pair were, in reality, sharing the No. 2 role, as they had for the previous four years as co-presidents.“Safra and Mark worked fine because they had two different skill sets altogether,” said Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Companies often consider two CEOs because they fear no one person has all of the talent or energy to run the show. Large companies need a strong financial expert who knows where every dollar goes, an operational person who leads the workforce and an enthusiastic public face for customers and others, Moerdler said.There’s no reason you can’t appoint two people as CEO “if you are mixing the responsibilities,” he said.But the model is often a compromise made to appease different constituencies within a company. And when conditions aren’t ideal -- personalities clash, crises arise -- companies change course.When Hurd died in October, Oracle opted to keep Catz as the sole CEO rather than find her a new partner in the post. SAP, meanwhile, has gone back and forth between co-CEOs and having a single person in charge.“Nothing ever changes at SAP and Oracle,” Rana said. “They are stagnant companies. They have massive support bases. They can experiment with new executives and still do all right.”SAP hasn’t ruled out another flip-flop after the Covid-19 pandemic.“I have always believed that co-CEO models have their place and their time; after all, I was a co-CEO once,” SAP Chairman and co-founder Hasso Plattner said in a memo to staff. “But this has turned out to not be that time. Therefore, for the benefit of our company and our customers, we felt it was crucial to have one sole CEO navigate us through this unprecedented change.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Software Companies Abandon Co-CEOs, Exposing the Model’s Risks"

Trade tensions between the US and China tied to novel coronavirus squabbling certainly haven't helped investors. But much of the blame lands squarely on the shoulders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) following ""mixed"" and ""disappointing"" quarterly results.Apple is off 0.5% as investors focus on slower revenue growth and the company's decision to suspend guidance for the June quarter due to Covid-19 related uncertainty.

Still, while many investors are allowing Friday's heavier-than-usual, tech heavyweights to do their bidding, the new calendar month is ushering in fresh, longer-term opportunities for trading on other tech stocks:  * Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL)  * Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)  * Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU)These stocks represent opportunities for both bulls and bears in the sector. Tech Stocks to Trade: Oracle (ORCL)  Source: Charts by TradingViewOracle is the first of our tech stocks to trade. This weeks' earnings headlines have shares under sympathetic pressure. But make no mistake, this enterprise software / cloud play's shares are not only far from out, they're a definite ""buy.""Since putting together a market-leading bottom in early March after delivering its own narrow quarterly beat, shares of Oracle have worked to solidify the monthly chart's long-term uptrend. Now, while some stocks cry for mercy, Oracle stock is screaming ""buy""to anyone willing to pay attention.Bottom-line, strong technical supports from a bullish stochastics crossover out of oversold territory, monthly chart hammer confirmation,and the opportunity to buy shares near the candle buy point on today's pullback make Oracle a clear winner. Spotify (SPOT)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe next name on our list of tech stocks to trade is Spotify stock. Similar to Oracle, the streaming music giant's shares are a favored purchase due to an earnings beat on strong subscriber growth delivered earlier this week, plus confirmation from the monthly stock chart.Technically, Spotify shares affirmed an undercut variation of a double bottom pattern within a larger bullishly-tilted channel this week on the heels of quarterly results. Unlike Oracle, I'd recommend investors hold off on this tech stock and wait for a 'second attempt' buy signal.A purchase should only be considered if the price action Spotify stock above $152 and slightly back above April's pattern pivot high. This entry is focused on getting on board as price momentum takes hold.With stochastics crossing over just beneath overbought territory, I'm anticipating the weaker channel's resistance is about to be broken and Spotify stock will take on more bullish leadership.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Given the company's dominant industry position, shares still relatively new to the market and nice growth prospects to build its brand and eventually profits as well, there's more than a bit of interesting support for this outlook to take shape. Roku (ROKU)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe last of our tech stocks to trade are shares of Roku. I'm a fan, as well as an early adopter of the over-the-top streaming platform, though I eventually pulled the plug on cable with the company's original device more than several years ago. But as a trader in search of investing opportunities, Roku stock looks risky near-term.Technically, after enjoying a big-time rally from corrective lows, shares have that ""mayday"" look about them. The stock has hit downtrend channel resistance and simultaneously challenged the 62% retracement level from last September's all-time-high. At the same time, stochastics are just now entering overbought territory and shares have confirmed a weekly doji topping pattern.Bottom-line, Roku looks more well-suited for bearish positioning. However, earnings are next week so I'd highly recommend limited-risk options strategies in lieu of shorting shares.Still, unless the price chart is telling us fabricated stories, until shares are closer to that other bottom-line on the price chart, Roku is better for watching Netflix (NASAQ:NFLX) or Disney (NYSE:DIS) programs than in your investment account as a long.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management does not own any securities mentioned in this article.

2020-05-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett will address his followers on Saturday for the first time since the U.S. began implementing the state-by-state lockdowns that have upended the economy and life as we knew it. Technically, it’s the annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholder meeting, though much will be missing from this year’s event — people, for starters. Even so, the main draw of the weekend lives on: the chance to pick one of the most brilliant brains in business.In a live-streamed interview that evening, Buffett will answer questions submitted by investors, including presumably how the conglomerate’s various lines of business have been affected by the pandemic. But what listeners are really tuning in for are the Oracle of Omaha’s broader views on the world during a time like this. Here are five questions for him:1&#92;. Is it time to name a successor?Or has he essentially done so? For the first time, Buffett is doing the Q&A jointly with Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman, rather than his usual sidekick, Charlie Munger, who is 96 years old and resides in California. Buffett, who will turn 90 in August, even joked in his February letter to shareholders that he and Munger are in “the urgent zone.” All signs point to Abel being the next CEO of Berkshire, but Buffett hasn’t spelled out the succession plan yet. It was going to be hard enough for shareholders to get comfortable with anyone other than him someday being the steward of their money. With all the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, now is a good time for Buffett to clarify why Abel is best suited to manage the conglomerate, even through a crisis like this.2&#92;. Could the concept of a “new normal” alter what kinds of investments Berkshire makes in the future?If Buffett isn’t using his enforced isolation at home to hunt for another elephant-sized acquisition, is that because the Covid-19 shutdowns are causing him to reevaluate what types of businesses will recover? Or is he perhaps grappling with the potential for long-term changes in customer behavior? Taking a stake in the Kroger Co. supermarket chain late last year proved to be prescient; buying preferred stock in oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. not so much. Those circumstances would still seem to be temporary. Air travel, on the other hand, is an example of an industry where a return to normal could take awhile — or never even come. 3&#92;. Will the airline industry ever rebound? Buffett has a tormented history with airlines. After getting burned once by a US Airways investment, Buffett swore off the industry in 2001, saying: “Now if I get the urge to invest in airlines, I call an 800 number and I say: Hello, my name is Warren, and I'm an air-o-holic.” Well, Buffett apparently lost that number and went all in on airline stocks in 2016. Berkshire is now the largest shareholder of Delta Air Lines Inc., the second-largest owner of United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co., and has the third-biggest stake in American Airlines Group Inc. They’ve all plunged this year as the pandemic wreaked havoc on air travel — or any travel at all.On March 10, during a Yahoo Finance interview, Buffett said he “won’t be selling airline stocks.” That was before the shutdowns. A few weeks later, Berkshire reduced its Delta and Southwest positions, although it’s still the No. 1 and No. 2 investor in each. An update on his thinking would be especially illuminating now.4&#92;. Covid-19 has forced the nation to reassess and recognize what it means to be an “essential” worker. Does that warrant new ideas for solving wealth inequality? Buffett himself employs a lot of essential workers: They’re manning freight trains that are still pushing goods around the country, as well as manufacturing Duracell batteries. Lubrizol — which makes chemicals used for everything from coating car interiors to yoga pants — has helped to produce hand sanitizer, while Fruit of the Loom switched to making protective face masks. Berkshire is also the largest shareholder of food giant Kraft Heinz Co., one company helping to keep supermarkets stocked. In that same March interview, Buffett discussed the wealth gap, saying it’s a reflection of the fact that workers are rewarded based on the skills that are valued by the market:You get this pushing of extreme rewards to people who are very, very good at something the market demands. And people demand entertainment. They demand people apparently that arbitrage securities. There's certain specialties.But they demand lots of basic things, too, as this pandemic has shown.Even though Buffett agrees with letting the system function the way it does, “we don’t want people left behind,” he said. The billionaire has often advocated for an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit as a better way of putting more money in the pockets of low-income families than through hiking the minimum wage. That’s because the latter could backfire by increasing unemployment. The EITC just doesn’t have the same ring to it as $15, and it’s not as easily understood as earning more per hour. Buffett has also called for higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy, like himself. 5&#92;. Do America’s best days still lie ahead?Buffett has seen his share of crises, and they’ve never seemed to shake his optimism that the U.S. will continue to prosper in the long run. “America’s best days lie ahead,” is a mantra he often repeats in his annual letters to shareholders. But Buffett has been unusually quiet during the pandemic — in terms of a lack of both TV appearances (perhaps due to virus fears) and deal activity. Investors could use a reminder of how the country’s biggest cheerleader and hungriest dealmaker feels about its long-term prospects. Is it possible they are changing? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-05-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Three female employees at Oracle Corp. scored a major victory in court, gaining the right to represent thousands of others in a gender-discrimination lawsuit over pay, a legal milestone that has eluded women at other tech titans.A California state judge certified the class action Thursday, allowing the lawsuit to advance on behalf of more than 4,000 women who claim the database giant pays men more for doing the same job.“Whether the jobs at issue in this case are substantially equal or similar is a question of fact for a jury,” California Superior Court Judge V. Raymond Swope in Redwood City said in the 25-page ruling, rejecting Oracle’s claim that each is an individual case because people in the same job code don’t perform substantially similar work.“This is just a procedural step unrelated to the merits of the case and we look forward to trying those in court,” Oracle said Friday in an email.The ruling gives the women critical leverage in pursuing the case under the state’s Equal Pay Act.“This case will help ensure that women are paid fairly at Oracle, and we hope, throughout the tech industry,” Jim Finberg, a lawyer representing the women, said in an email.Women at technology companies who have turned to the courts to transform their pay and treatment in the workplace have faced difficulty gaining traction, just like their female counterparts in more traditional industries, from retail to finance. The U.S. Supreme Court set a high bar in its 2011 decision that blocked 1.5 million female workers at Walmart Inc. from pursuing their discrimination claims as a group. Female engineers at both Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Corp. failed to persuade judges to let their gender-bias cases proceed as class actions and those rulings were upheld on appeal.”Courts seem hesitant to certify classes alleging gender discrimination more broadly,” said Jason Lohr, a lawyer who has filed such suits. “Fortunately, the California legislature has made it easier to bring class-wide claims based upon pay disparities. While not a perfect way to resolve gender inequality in the workplace, it’s progress.”Why So Few Women Break Through Tech’s Bro Culture: QuickTake Q&AUber Technologies Inc. paid $10 million in 2018 to settle pay discrimination and harassment claims brought on behalf of more than 400 female and minority engineers. Google is fighting another suit filed under California’s Equal Pay Act -- one of the strongest measures of its kind nationwide. That case may be the next battle over class-action status.The case against Oracle was filed by former company engineer Sue Petersen and two other women, all of whom worked at PeopleSoft Corp. before it was acquired by Oracle in 2005.They claim that Oracle for years has paid women less than men for “substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions.” To bolster their bid for class-action status, the plaintiffs emphasized that company-wide compensation is determined at Oracle’s headquarters in Redwood Shores, California.Oracle argued that the lawsuit wrongly compares women and men tagged with the same job codes even though such coding doesn’t mean the work requires similar skills, effort or responsibility, because Oracle’s products and services vary so widely.Relying on the codes doesn’t “account for the tools or programming languages an employee must master, the hours her work requires, or the number and complexity of the sub-areas of a product for which she is responsible,” the company said in a court filing.In a separate ruling, Swope dealt Oracle another blow when he refused to toss out a study, commissioned by the plaintiffs, that found women at the company earned 13% less than their male counterparts. The study was done by a UC-Irvine economics professor David Neumark.“Professor Neumark had a reasonable basis for his opinions that education, years of prior job experience, tenure at Oracle, and performance review scores do not explain the gender pay gap faced by women in the same job code as men,” the judge wrote.Oracle is also fighting a complaint over gender-pay disparities brought by the U.S. Labor Department in the waning days of the Obama administration. The agency claims the company owes women and minorities $400 million in what it says is “the biggest enforcement case” it’s ever brought against a federal contractor.The case is Jewett v. Oracle America Inc., 17-CIV-02669, California Superior Court, County of San Mateo (Redwood City).(Updates with company comment in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Women Score Major Win in Court Battle Over Equal Pay
2020-05-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s what we all needed to hear: “Nothing can stop America” — Warren Buffett’s way of saying, “We will get through this.” Saturday evenings aren’t normally the ideal time for tuning into a multi-hour investor conference, especially after being cooped up all week working from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But mere minutes into the live-streamed Berkshire Hathaway Inc. annual shareholder meeting, it was clear that something much more meaningful was unfolding. Buffett, sitting on a stage in an empty Omaha arena, began with a history lesson like no other — a vivid walk through the other moments in America’s past that tested its resiliency, but never broke it. At 89 years old, he’s lived through many of them.The current crisis “is creating a huge amount of anxiety and changing people's psyche and causing them to somewhat lose their bearings, understandably,” the chairman and CEO of Berkshire told his virtual listeners, while peering out where some 40,000 of them would normally be sitting. “The American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again.”While his unwavering confidence in the U.S. economy is hardly a new theme in Buffett’s lectures, they’re not normally so moving. Like many of those watching, he was in need of a haircut and acknowledged it, adding that he had grown used to wearing sweat suits — as opposed to the real suit and tie he donned on Saturday. It was a humanizing moment. Watching Buffett was like watching Dr. Anthony Fauci or New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, the two government leaders whose comforting words and realism have probably stuck with Americans most during the pandemic and helped to create a sense of hope and community. Even so, going into the event, it wasn’t quite so clear that Buffett still believed in his mantra, “America’s best days lie ahead.” He had been notably quiet in recent weeks, and Berkshire was selling stock and shunning acquisitions, a bearish signal for a company where the ethos is to buy when others are panicking. After all, Buffett once wrote:Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.Berkshire has done neither, even with $137 billion of cash just sitting there. As such, some say his optimistic outlook doesn’t align with his actions of late. But Buffett explained that the panic hasn’t hit the stock and credit markets to the extent it did during the 2008 financial crisis — or not for as long, thanks to the extraordinary measures taken by the Federal Reserve. His investing during that time “was not designed to make a statement, it was designed to take advantage of what we thought were very attractive terms,” he said. He’s not finding as many enticing investments now, partly because of those Fed actions, which removed the need for many companies to seek a lifeline from a deep-pocketed savior like Buffett.The complicated public-health aspect of this downturn also makes it impossible to predict how long it will carry on or how much worse it will get before it gets better. “The cash position isn’t that huge when I look at worst-case possibilities,” Buffett said Saturday.There are also some industries that may be permanently altered by the coronavirus, such as airlines, Buffett said. Berkshire was a top-three shareholder in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. as recently as early April. Buffett has since decided to completely exit those positions: “The world changed for airlines and we wish them well.” Even though Buffett is still a believer in the long-term prospects of the U.S. economy as a whole, his 180-degree turn on the airline industry shows that he sees the virus changing at least some consumer behavior for good. That will affect future dealmaking. One of Buffett’s biggest takeovers was Precision Castparts, a supplier of airplane engine parts, which he bought for $37 billion in 2016. It was also his last major transaction. As fascinating as Buffett’s commentary was, the Q&A wasn’t the same without his usual sidekick, Charlie Munger, who is known for his quips and comically curt responses compared to Buffett’s monologues. Munger, Berkshire’s longtime vice chairman, is 96 years old and lives in California. Though he is in good health, Buffett said, it didn’t make sense to have him travel to Omaha — a reminder of both their ages, even if they are as sharp as ever. Instead of Munger, Buffett was joined by Greg Abel, who oversees all non-insurance operations under the Berkshire umbrella and is Buffett’s likely successor. ""When I talk to Greg, sometimes I wonder, am I talking to Warren?” Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and author of books on Berkshire, said during the meeting pre-show. It may be a while before others see him that way. While Abel answered some questions Saturday, he mostly deferred to Buffett and stuck to high-level corporate-speak. Buffett, who recently joked that his age puts him “in the urgent zone,” did have a message for whoever does replace him: “I will bet on America the rest of my life, and I hope my successors at Berkshire do.”He closed the evening with a smile and a laugh: “We’ll see you next year and we’ll fill this place!” Let’s hope. But if it turns out that this virtual event was the Oracle’s last time as the master of ceremonies, it will stand as a fascinating and beautiful sermon that will be remembered. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-05-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Workday Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped $1 billion for the first time, beating analyst estimates and continuing growth for the maker of human resources software despite the economic challenges of the pandemic. Shares rose more than 7% in extended trading.Revenue increased 23% to $1.02 billion in the fiscal first quarter, the Pleasanton, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. On average, analysts expected $994 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. After some expenses, profit was 44 cents a share, compared with analyst projections of 47 cents.Workday expects subscription revenue for the fiscal year of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion, down from as much as $3.77 billion.

The company continues to expand its human resources, accounting and planning software to offer the capabilities of established rivals Oracle Corp. and SAP SE, but delivered through the cloud.

2020-06-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Google has taken aggressive action to scrub coronavirus conspiracies from its news service and YouTube, at a time when social media companies have come under intense scrutiny for their potential to spread dangerous disinformation about the global pandemic. It has begun labeling misleading videos aimed at U.S. audiences, and has joined with other major internet companies to coordinate a response against what the World Health Organization has described as an “infodemic.”But Google is also placing advertisements on websites that publish the theories, helping their owners generate revenue and continue their operations. In at least one instance, Google has run ads featuring a conspiracist it has already banned.One ad for Veeam, an independent Microsoft 365 backup service, appeared atop one website featuring an article that includes false claims that Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates’s charitable efforts on pandemics and vaccines are a part of a world domination plot.  A Microsoft Teams ad ran with a French language article that alleged Gates tried to bribe Nigerian lawmakers to vote for a Covid-19 vaccine. An ad for the telecommunications provider O2 showed up on another article linking the virus to 5G networks, a common conspiracy theory. The ads were placed through Google’s automated system for matching marketers with websites. The Global Disinformation Index, a research group, recently reviewed 49 sites running baseless claims about the virus, including the stories about Gates and 5G networks. Alphabet Inc.'s Google placed ads on 84% of them, generating the majority of the $135,000 in revenue the sites earned each month, according to the Global Disinformation Index’s estimate.Google has faced criticism for funding hyper-partisan publishers such as Breitbart News in the past. The company has avoided making blanket policies about which publishers can run its ads. Instead, it removes ads only from the specific pages carrying content that violates its content policies. It also allows advertisers to blacklist specific sites. The company has been particularly reluctant to take action with political ramifications now that the Trump administration is taking concrete action to punish companies that it argues show bias against conservative viewpoints. Christa Muldoon, a Google spokesperson, said none of the web pages flagged by the Global Disinformation Index violated its policies. “We are deeply committed to elevating quality content across Google products and that includes protecting our users from medical misinformation. Any time we find publishers that violate our policies, we take immediate action,” she said.‘A Huge Issue’  Google's network ad system is a massive machine for automatically generating money for its owner. Websites apply for Google's program,  and they add display banners and pop-ups advertisements to their pages. Google's system automatically fills these slots with digital marketing and takes about 30% of the revenue they generate. Although Google offers a level of control to its marquee advertisers, the self-service system sometimes places ads for brands on websites with which they’d prefer not to be associated.Google’s systems have recently placed ads for eBay Inc., Oracle Corp. and HBO on websites like activistpost.com, thegatewaypundit.com and thewashingtonstandard.com, all of which routinely publish conspiracy theories, according to the Global Disinformation Index.Another company that placed ads on the sites in the study was Criteo SA. When contacted by a reporter about an ad mentioned in the report, Luca Sesti, a spokesman for the company, said it was breaking off its commercial relationship with the website in question, thegatewaypundit.com. “In the event we find a partner is not adhering to our policies, we will terminate the relationship immediately,” he said. “We recognize that the dissemination of inaccurate information through ‘fake news’ is a very real problem on the internet.”Often the ads the researchers found made for uncomfortable pairings. The O2 ad ran alongside an article promoting false claims that 5G wireless technology causes people to experience symptoms of coronavirus because it ""poisons their cells."" “This is a huge issue that Google needs to tackle now,” said Craig Fagan, program director at the Global Disinformation Index. “It is creating a financial incentive for these websites to continue promoting the conspiracy theories. You go to these sites and there are ads galore, pop ups everywhere. The ads are there to get clicks, monetizing each reader.”A Banned Provocateur ReturnsIn one case, Google accepted ad revenue from a company promoting a conspiracy theorist it tried to remove from its own platforms. In early May, YouTube removed the account of David Icke, a British provocateur who often ranted about ""Rothschild Zionists"" controlling global institutions and has questioned the efficacy of vaccines. In a recent interview about Covid-19, he said that 5G makes people sick and sends out signals that can control their emotions. Icke had posted on YouTube for more than 14 years.Guillaume Chaslot, a former Google engineer and founder of the research group AlgoTransparency, estimated that Icke’s YouTube channel gained 200,000 subscribers during March and April, when he largely touted unproven theories about the virus. Chaslot's research tracks how often YouTube's recommendation system sends viewers to particular videos and channels. In a 10-year span, YouTube promoted Icke's videos about a billion times.YouTube removed Icke’s account for violating its rules about coronavirus disinformation. Since then, Icke has appeared on other YouTube channels and in YouTube ads for Gaia Inc., a streaming network that promotes yoga and alternative healing. ""We have to break out of this perceptual prison,"" Icke said in a voice-over during an ad that ran weeks after his ban. Gaia's network runs several shows featuring Icke. On a recent earnings call, Gaia executives said YouTube had become a ""pretty significant"" way to get new subscribers.Gaia didn’t respond to requests for comment. Imran Ahmed, chief executive officer of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a U.K. nonprofit, argues that social media platforms should remove Icke entirely. “In a pandemic, lies cost lives,"" said Ahmed. ""Misinformed people put us all at risk through their reckless actions.” His group estimated that Icke earned about $177,000 a year from YouTube ads before the ban.Jaymie Icke, a spokesman for Icke's video service Ickonic, said the earnings estimate was inaccurate because YouTube has restricted ads on controversial videos for several years. ""Revenue is nothing and has been for a while,"" said Icke, who is David Icke’s son. ""They removed all ads from the channel two months prior to the full deletion anyway. So that figure has simply been made up.""Icke and others blocked from the site are allowed to appear on other accounts and in ads as long as those videos don't break rules, according to Muldoon, the Google spokesperson. While web giants like Google have tried to handle conspiracy theories on their user-generated services, they have also tried to reform their ad systems to handle the growing problem. In October 2018, Google and Facebook Inc. signed a European Union code of conduct on disinformation that contained a commitment to “improve the scrutiny of advertisement placements to reduce revenues of the purveyors of disinformation.”According to Fagan, however, the issue remains a blind spot for the companies. Some of the conspiracy websites attract a large number of visitors, promoting their content across social media platforms.The 49 websites promoting Covid-19 conspiracies that were reviewed by the Global Disinformation Index were just a small sample and offer a snapshot of a much larger program, Fagan said. Last year, the Global Disinformation Index published a study of about 20,000 websites promoting disinformation and conspiracy theories. It estimated that they were generating $235 million every year in advertising revenue, approximately $86.7 million of which was paid out by Google.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Helps Place Ads on Sites Amplifying Covid-19 Conspiracies
2020-06-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. demonstrated that paying customers have flocked to its virtual-meeting software, transforming the once-niche appmaker into a popular communications service and positioning it to benefit as the nature of work, school and life is upended.Zoom reported sales soared in the three months ended April 30, when the coronavirus pandemic spurred a wave of stay-at-home orders for millions of people worldwide. The company expects the trend to continue the rest of the year, and projected that revenue and profit will leapfrog investors’ earlier expectations.“A shift in work culture triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic urges corporations to pull forward adoption of cloud-based video-conferencing tools,” Boyoung Kim, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote Tuesday in a note. Zoom’s “intuitive technology and strong brand recognition should help the company pick up market share in video conferencing, outpacing the industry.”Sales in the current quarter will be as much as $500 million, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Revenue in the third and fourth fiscal quarters should be consistent with that performance, Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said during a conference call. Overall, Zoom expects to generate as much as $1.8 billion this fiscal year, which is almost triple the size of the business last year. Analysts, on average, estimated $930.8 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Zoom’s shares jumped 6.6% to $221.80 at 11:44 a.m. Wednesday in New York after closing at a record $208.08 on Tuesday. The stock has tripled this year.Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan has tried to ensure that his virtual-meeting platform can cope with a swell of demand from people staying home to curtail the spread of Covid-19. While security and privacy issues plagued the system early in the quarantine, Zoom has become an essential service, attracting more than 300 million participants some days, up from 10 million in December. The software maker allows gatherings of as long as 40 minutes for no charge. While Zoom has attracted more buzz than corporate rivals, the results Tuesday suggested it can attract the paying clients needed to compete against services from Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.The software maker said its potential market has expanded beyond an estimate of $43 billion by 2022 made by analyst IDC, according to a 2019 regulatory filing. And executives said they have expanded hiring plans to take advantage of the opportunity. While Steckelberg warned that the lifting of stay-at-home orders may cause fewer people to use Zoom’s software, the company said it hadn’t seen the numbers decline yet in areas that have reopened.Many educational institutions that teach through Zoom have decided to host virtual classes through at least the fall, pointing to robust demand for the app through the rest of the year. To continue growing at a torrid pace, Zoom will sell its Phone software and Rooms hardware products to existing customers, Steckelberg added. Yuan vowed not to rely on advertising to make money from its legions of free users.In the fiscal first quarter, revenue increased about 170% to $328.2 million. Analysts, on average, expected $203 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was 20 cents a share, compared with analysts’ average projection of 9 cents.The company said its expects adjusted profit in the fiscal year will be $355 million to $380 million, or $1.21 to $1.29 a share. Analysts had estimated 46 cents, just more than Zoom’s earlier forecast. The company has been spending to bolster its network capacity, including by buying cloud-computing services from Oracle Corp. during the pandemic. Zoom also continues to use Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud service, which provided the majority of the new capacity.Zoom’s daily meeting participants have dipped a bit below the blockbuster 300 million figure revealed in April, but Steckelberg said the company expects to consistently surpass that milestone in the future.The company said it ended the quarter with about 265,400 customers with more than 10 employees, a more than fourfold increase from the same period a year earlier. The company now has 769 corporate clients that have spent more than $100,000 on Zoom’s products over the last 12 months, about double from a year earlier.With Zoom’s popularity has come controversy over the company’s security practices. Trolls have invaded myriad meetings, religious gatherings and other events, to share pornography and shout profanity or racial epithets, in a phenomenon known as “Zoombombing.” The company highlighted or created a raft of tools users can employ to prevent the virtual attacks, including passwords and waiting rooms.There also were instances when Zoom calls were routed through servers in China even when no participant was based there and users were unwittingly sending metadata to Facebook Inc. when they signed in. Zoom put an end to both practices. The company pledged to commit to bolstering privacy over all other concerns for three months, purchasing a secure-messaging company, Keybase, to bring the highest standard of encryption to the platform, and hiring cybersecurity experts to guide safety efforts.Corporate clients will get access to Zoom’s end-to-end encryption service now being developed, but Yuan said free users won’t enjoy that level of privacy, which makes it impossible for third parties to decipher communications.“Free users for sure we don’t want to give that because we also want to work together with FBI, with local law enforcement in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose,” Yuan said on the call.(Updates with shares in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Zoom Transforms Hype Into Huge Jump in Sales, Customers"

2020-06-05,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett says “nothing can stop America.” To put his money where his mouth is and spend some of his $137 billion stash before this crisis is over, he wouldn’t have to look far. If there’s one company that warrants the dealmaker’s attention, it may be Costco Wholesale Corp., a retailer in which Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. already owns a stake. At Berkshire’s virtual shareholder meeting last month, Buffett signaled that the Covid-19 pandemic hasn’t afforded him deal opportunities at bargain-basement prices the way past economic meltdowns have. Despite the nationwide shutdowns that are just starting to lift and a soaring unemployment rate, the S&P 500 Index is only 8% off its February all-time high. That’s partly due to aggressive actions taken by the Federal Reserve to mitigate the crisis, though one can’t deny that there exists an astonishing disconnect between stock prices and the economic realities of many Americans right now.Costco wouldn’t be a typical crisis-era bet for Buffett in this regard. The shares are up, not down, this year and its operations have carried on throughout the pandemic. Zoom, Netflix, TikTok, Costco — the retailer is right up there with those services that have become centerpieces of the stay-at-home recession.But in so many other ways a Costco deal would still be classic Buffett. For starters, Buffett already likes Costco. Berkshire has owned the stock for two decades; its 1% stake is valued at about $1.3 billion currently. Buffett’s business partner Charlie Munger, the 96-year-old vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, also sits on Costco’s board. Last year, Buffett even publicly marveled at Costco’s in-house Kirkland brand, which at that point had $39 billion of annual sales. “Here’s somebody like Costco, establishes a brand called Kirkland and it’s doing $39 billion — more than virtually any food company,” including Kraft Heinz Co., he said. Berkshire is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder.Costco has proven during this crisis that it has a durable brand and a wide competitive moat, two of the key attributes Buffett looks for. More than 90% of Costco’s U.S. club members renew, and globally the rate is nearly as high at 88%. Those warehouse memberships are a predictable source of cash flow, almost akin to Berkshire’s insurance float that Buffett uses to invest. While the majority of Costco’s 787 warehouse clubs are in the U.S. and Canada, it does have locations in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia. It’s also expanding in China, offering Buffett exposure to the country’s growing middle class.Costco’s same-store sales have risen 6.5% on average for the last 10 quarters, topping other U.S. mass retailers including Walmart Inc., the parent of Sam’s Club. Costco also generated more than $1,300 of sales per square foot in fiscal 2019 — more than any of its peers.The share price has gotten a bump from all the panic-shopping, and at 34 times earnings, Costco’s valuation certainly isn’t what Buffett would call cheap. But Costco should continue to fare well in a post-virus America, especially if it leads some residents to ditch cities for suburbs and spend more time at home. After the meat and toilet paper shortages, more shoppers may even turn to bulk-buying to be better prepared for future lockdowns or shortages.The biggest hurdle to a takeover is that Costco’s market value is $137 billion — precisely the amount of cash Berkshire has available. Berkshire’s last major acquisition was Precision Castparts, a maker of airplane engine parts, for $37 billion in 2016. After years spent searching for his next target, Buffett signaled recently that his hunt is on hold, suggesting that he thinks the crisis could still get worse before it gets better. “The cash position isn’t that huge when I look at the worst-case possibilities,” he told a stunned audience last month that tuned into the livestreamed annual meeting expecting to hear something a little more upbeat or at least hopeful from the Oracle of Omaha.(1)Berkshire could simply increase its stake in Costco, a stable holding that pays a 70-cent quarterly dividend. But it wasn’t all that long ago that Buffett spoke of the possibility of an acquisition Costco’s size. “If a $100 billion deal came along that Charlie [Munger] and I really liked, we’d get it done,” he said in May 2018. With Buffett set to turn 90 in August, it would be uncharacteristic to not want to do one last splashy transaction.It also wouldn’t be the first time Berkshire acquired one of its stock holdings. Berkshire owned shares in Precision Castparts before that deal. It also took a stake in the BNSF railroad in 2007 and kept adding to that position until it eventually purchased the whole company. Berkshire’s ownership of Geico even dates back to the 1950s when Buffett first bought shares and as a curious young investor began a serendipitous friendship with the insurer’s former CEO, Lorimer Davidson, as Buffett often retells it.Whether as a takeover candidate or stock pick, Buffett’s best option may be right under his nose. (1) One well-known shareholder, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, even exited its Berkshire position, deciding itcan find worthwhile investing opportunities faster than Berkshire can at this rate.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-06-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s a long-running joke among my team’s deals writers and editors that in the corporate world, all roads eventually lead to mergers. Whatever is happening on the outside or on Wall Street — economic downturns, upturns, elections, currency fluctuations, CEO departures, CEO arrivals, good earnings, bad earnings, you name it — the case can somehow always be made, almost comically, that it’s an impetus for more corporate tie-ups. Warren Buffett would say that’s thanks to all the fee-hungry bankers playing to CEOs’ vain propensity for empire-building. Others say it’s the animal spirits at work.Whatever the case, the global pandemic is giving businesses plenty of reasons to get back to dealmaking. Yes, even social distancing may draw some companies closer together. How they do it will just require a bit more ingenuity in a post-handshake, post-Covid-19 world.As drugmakers race to develop vaccines and treatments for the virus, the pharmaceutical industry is an obvious place to expect renewed M&A activity. Already, drug giant AstraZeneca Plc has made a preliminary takeover approach to Gilead Sciences Inc., Bloomberg News reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. That’s a potential $100 billion transaction. Executives from Johnson & Johnson also said in April that one of their top priorities is finding M&A that enhances its pipeline, citing the drugmaker’s financial strength. The company has $18 billion of cash and equivalents, and Ebitda exceeds debt.It was the pharma industry that kicked off the global megamerger wave last time around, in early 2014, as companies including AstraZeneca participated in a game of merger musical chairs. Soon enough, just about every industry had joined the deal frenzy, which lasted until earlier this year. It might have kept going had the virus not arrived.M&A globally is down 50% this year after the coronavirus quite literally brought the economy to a halt. But stay-at-home orders have been lifting across Asia, Europe and the U.S. And now that New York City — the unofficial headquarters of the M&A market — is beginning to reopen, deals that were in the works previously may pick up where they left off. Those are “low-hanging fruit” for bankers to try to get done, said Eric Becker, who manages the AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF at Water Island Capital, a firm with $2.5 billion under management. “Those were situations where they were still able to hit the golf course and have the handshakes and look at each other face to face.”The M&A handshake may be over, but tech-savvy companies are already embracing the deal-by-video-chat method. Verizon Communications Inc. acquired videoconferencing business BlueJeans Networks for about $400 million in April, and though those talks began last year, the deal had to be finalized over BlueJeans video calls. Intel Corp. also bought Moovit Inc., an Israeli public-transit mapping startup, for $900 million last month. Moovit’s CEO told one publication that the deal came together over Zoom video calls.Not only could more companies use videoconferencing tools to do M&A, other tech-affiliated companies could copy Verizon by acquiring a service like BlueJeans to round out their business software offerings. That’s if working from home is going to be more common even after Covid-19 gets under control. And for deals in which physical assets and property are key, investors have cited the prospect of drones being used to conduct due diligence and avoid unnecessary travel and virus risks. Whether that’s a practical solution remains to be seen. Companies that announced deals just before the virus struck may experience buyer’s remorse. Tiffany & Co.’s acquirer, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, is reportedly looking to pay a lower price than the $16.2 billion it offered in November, but Tiffany, of course, doesn’t want to renegotiate the terms. The spread between Tiffany’s share price and LVMH’s bid is wide at 10%, signaling investor apprehension that the deal will collapse.But then there are deals that make all the more sense because of the crisis. Uber Technologies Inc. is trying to acquire Grubhub Inc. to consolidate the market for food-delivery services as demand surges. Even as restaurants reopen, diners in heavily populated areas may still be reluctant to eat out. Becker also cited an ongoing trend of regional bank acquisitions, as smaller banks require better online capabilities and larger banks seek a deeper community presence.Vulnerable companies may already be bracing for activist shareholder interventions and unsolicited bids. The law firm K&L Gates LLP said that between March and mid-April more than two dozen U.S. public companies adopted so-called poison pills — more than the total number of S&P 500 companies that had these types of takeover protections in place last year. Private equity firms are also likely to be gearing up for buyouts. Such campaigns run the risk of igniting political and public scrutiny in a year marked by soaring unemployment and social activism over inequality. Other opportunistic buyers may soon come out of the woodwork. Amazon.com Inc., which isn’t a frequent borrower, aroused suspicion when it issued $10 billion of debt in recent weeks. Oracle Corp. also raised $20 billion. “When you start seeing some of these deep-pocketed buyers doing these large debt deals, it makes me think there's pent-up demand for M&A,” Becker said. One caveat: Regulators are ostensibly taking a tougher stance against potentially anti-competitive takeovers by tech giants. Even so, companies that see President Donald Trump losing the November election may want to act before less-merger-friendly Democrats take charge.There’s also the question of what Warren Buffett will do with Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $137 billion of cash. I suggested last week that Costco Wholesale Corp. should be its next bulk purchase. Wherever the crisis goes from here, all roads still lead to deals. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-06-12,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.U.S. stocks suddenly need some good news. A steady recovery from March lows was rudely interrupted on Thursday, as markets plunged. Major market indices fell at least 5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining almost 7%.It's likely coincidental that the steep decline came not long after earnings season ended. As we've noted in this space, reactions to earnings reports were relatively muted.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, it's possible that earnings news -- whether positive or negative -- gave investors some kind of tangible information, which helped drive the V-shaped rally in the public markets. Whatever the cause, investors seem much more nervous on Friday than they did just two days ago.  * 7 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy and Hold Now There aren't enough earnings reports next week to change that broader sentiment. In fact, the earnings calendar is as light as it's been in some time. Nonetheless, there are a few reports for investors to watch -- particularly at a time when any information is useful. Three releases in particular are worth close examination:  * Lennar (NYSE:LEN)  * Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)  * Kroger (NYSE:KR)That said, let's dive in. Earnings Reports to Watch: Lennar (LEN)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 16, before market openInvestors will get reports from two ""big-ticket"" industries next week. The more important of the two comes from Lennar, the nation's second-largest homebuilder behind D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI).After all, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on U.S. housing remains unclear. High unemployment seems to present a risk, even with last week's surprise job numbers.However, LEN stock actually has rallied of late. And even with an 8.4% decline on Thursday is in the green year-to-date. Investors seem to be betting that the pandemic will lead to an exodus out of urban areas -- and potentially into developments built by the likes of Lennar. It's probably too early to test that thesis, but commentary from Lennar on Tuesday could support, or undercut, that optimism.And in combination with fiscal first quarter earnings from CarMax (NYSE:KMX) on Friday morning, investors will get a reasonable sense of consumer confidence at the moment. We know Americans are venturing out, and looking to spend again. So after earnings next week, we should have a better handle as to what exactly they're willing to spend on. Oracle (ORCL)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 16, after market closeThe days of Oracle moving the market likely are in the past. But the tech giant still has an intriguing fiscal fourth quarter report on Tuesday afternoon.For Oracle itself, the report seems enormously important. Excluding a quickly-reversed plunge in March, ORCL stock has traded basically flat for 15 months now. The company's slow and steady transition to the cloud isn't moving fast enough for investors, who have moved on to faster-growing (and much more dearly-valued) plays elsewhere in the space.With the pandemic expected to accelerate the shift to cloud and SaaS, Oracle needs to show that it's able to keep up. I asked more than two years ago if Oracle was the next Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- a former giant nimbly adapting to new realities -- or the next IBM (NYSE:IBM), a company left behind by technological change.  * 7 Telehealth Stocks That Have Plenty of Growth On Tap The question remains open, but Tuesday's report could help some investors come up with an answer. What that answer looks like, and how investors react, could bear not only on ORCL, but IBM, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and other large-cap tech value plays trying to generate their own rallies. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 18, before market openIt seems like investors have been waiting for Kroger's fiscal first quarter release for quite some time. On April 1, Kroger issued a business update. The company disclosed that March same-store sales, excluding fuel, had risen a stunning 30%. In turn, KR stock rallied to near $32.More than two months later, the stock has barely moved, closing Thursday at $32.70. Investors no doubt are expecting a banner Q1, but what that means for the rest of the year remains unclear. Are some of the spectacular sales in March and (likely) April being pulled forward from later in the year? Is there a mid-term tailwind to demand as restaurants struggle? Can Kroger hold off the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), let alone the many smaller players in the industry?The flat trading in KR stock since early April suggests investors aren't yet sure how to answer those questions. Meanwhile, its broad reach means the report should be of interest to investors in Kroger's competitors and suppliers.After all, investors right now are working through exactly what the ""new normal"" will look like. And with that in mind, Kroger earnings are one of the best data points those investors will get in the next couple of weeks.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-06-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. projected stagnant revenue in the current quarter, signaling the company may not see a revival of new license sales after clients in the hospitality and retail industries delayed software purchases amid the coronavirus pandemic.Sales will be in a range of a 1% gain to a 1% decline year-over-year in the period ending in August, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said Tuesday in a conference call. The midpoint of no revenue growth matched analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding some items, profit will be 84 cents to 88 cents a share, with the midpoint again in line with analysts’ projections.Catz and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison have sought to renew growth at Oracle, the world’s second-biggest software maker, which has expanded to cloud applications, servers and public cloud services. The shift to internet-based computing caught the 43-year-old tech giant off guard and it’s still struggling to switch existing database customers to cloud-based offerings and better compete against Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. In the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue declined 6.3% to $10.4 billion, missing analysts’ estimates of $10.7 billion.Cloud license and on-premise license sales declined 22% to $1.96 billion in the period ended May 31, the Redwood City, California-based company said earlier in a statement, suggesting the company is signing fewer new deals. Oracle’s software for managing data, corporate finances, employees and customers require elaborate and often expensive installations, but during the Covid-19 pandemic, companies held off on getting new products.“Our overall business did remarkably well considering the pandemic, but our results would have been even better except for customers in the hardest-hit industries that we serve such as hospitality, retail, and transportation postponing some of their purchases,” Catz said in the statement.The software maker says some of those conversations with prospective customers have now resumed.“It was a disappointing quarter,” said Hari Srinivasan, an analyst at Neuberger Berman, which has been a long-term Oracle investor. “We were expecting a decline because although Oracle’s products are important for enterprises, that’s not where the spending is. Most companies are spending on getting employees working from home and the cloud.”The company’s sales may be weak for the next two or three quarters until spending recovers, he added.Shares declined about 3.5% in extended trading after closing at $54.59. The stock has climbed 3% since the start of the year.Catz said she expects Oracle’s revenue will accelerate this year, but didn’t provide a forecast for annual sales. She also said the company’s growing businesses now represent a larger share of overall revenue than its declining legacy product lines, which should aid sales growth in the future.Oracle said that revenue from cloud-based accounting and financial planning software climbed 32% in the quarter from a year earlier. The company’s software for managing employees increased 27%. Oracle didn’t disclose total sales of the products, which compete against those from Workday Inc.Revenue from cloud services and license support increased 1% to $6.85 billion. That metric includes sales from hosting customers’ data on the cloud, but a large portion is generated by maintenance fees for traditional software housed on clients’ corporate servers, which gives Oracle a predictable revenue base.Profit, excluding some items, was $1.20 a share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.15.To keep up with its rivals, Oracle has touted the affordability of its cloud infrastructure offerings. The company notched a key win when Zoom Video Communications Inc. began using cloud services from Oracle along with Amazon to cope with a strain on its network capacity amid blockbuster demand for its videoconferencing tool. Oracle is now supporting millions of Zoom meeting participants a day, Ellison said. Catz and Ellison said there has been surging demand for its cloud infrastructure, which now has 24 data-center regions around the world. Ellison promised its number of facilities will soon surpass Amazon’s tally.(Updates with forecast starting in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Expects Flat Sales on Fewer Corporate Software Deals

2020-06-17,"Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) shares were trading lower Wednesday after the company reported a larger-than-expected revenue decline in the fiscal fourth quarter but issued current-quarter guidance that exceeded expectations.Oracle reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.20, exceeding consensus analyst estimates of $1.15. The revenue figure of $10.44 billion was down 6% from a year ago and below consensus analyst estimates of $10.65 billion.Several analysts have weighed in on Oracle shares since the Tuesday afternoon report. The stock was down 4.73% at $52.01 at the time of publication Wednesday. Seeing Is Believing Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said management's confidence in accelerating revenue growth moving forward was surprising.&quot;Valuation at 12X CY21e EPS remains undemanding, but investors likely have to see the growth before believing it,&quot; the analyst said. Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow said better-than-expected profitability and an expanding operating margin are evidence that Oracle is managing its expenses.&quot;As the headwinds from the transition to the cloud abate relative to the increase in recurring subscription revenue and as customers increasingly lift-and-shift database workloads to Oracle Cloud, we believe that Oracle can accelerate revenue and operating income growth,&quot; he said. RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin said the time frame for accelerating revenue growth is uncertain at this point.View more earnings on ORCL&quot;Management indicated that deals dropped off as the quarter progressed. However, it is also indicated that deals were not lost to competition, and it believes most will be booked,&quot; the analyst said. Oracle's Vulnerability Exposed Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz said the weaker demand environment exposed vulnerability in Oracle's recurring revenue model.&quot;F4Q results could infer that, while ORCL has a market discount valuation, the company may not be in a strong position to capitalize on what should be an attractive opportunity to pitch consolidation sales during a downturn and drive a better narrative on the name,&quot; Schwartz wrote.Needham analyst Jack Andrews said deal slippage is concerning, but Oracle also has clear emerging positives.&quot;ORCL has now signed some marquee OCI customers, and continues to take share in cloud ERP applications.&quot; Secular Challenges For Oracle Wedbush analyst Steve Koenig said Oracle has clear secular challenges ahead.&quot;As application development shifts to the cloud, we see a growing challenge from Amazon (AMZN - Pachter) as it incorporates database and other IaaS/PaaS functionality into its low-cost platform,&quot; Koenig wrote.Stifel analyst Brad Reback said he is skeptical that new focus areas can accelerate Oracle's revenue growth, and its $28 billion in debt limits its potential for meaningful acquisitions.&quot;Overall, while Oracle's recurring revenue base is fairly secure, given Oracle's weaker position in IaaS, and our view of the company losing share in the database market, we prefer Microsoft in mega-cap software,&quot; Reback wrote.Oracle Ratings, Price Targets   * Morgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating with a price target lifted from $53 to $58.   * Wells Fargo has an Overweight rating and $62.50 target.  * RBC has a Sector Perform rating with a price target lifted from $50 to $51.   * Oppenheimer has a Perform rating.   * Wedbush has a Neutral rating and price target lifted from $52 to $54.   * Stifel has a Hold rating with a target lifted from $44 to $48.   * Needham has a Hold rating.

2020-06-17,"Shares in Oracle (ORCL) are sinking after the company reported its fiscal fourth quarter earning results. Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 beat Street expectations by $0.05, as did GAAP EPS of $0.99 vs the $0.04 consensus. However, revenue of $10.44B missed by $240M, and represented a 6.3% year-over-year decline.Meanwhile cloud services and license support generated revenue of $6.85B, slightly lower than the Street estimated $6.91B. Similarly, cloud license and on-premise license revenue came in at $1.96B falling short of the $2.17B estimate.The board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of outstanding common stock.“Our overall business did remarkably well considering the pandemic, but our results would have been even better except for customers in the hardest-hit industries that we serve such as hospitality, retail, and transportation postponing some of their purchases” commented Oracle CEO, Safra Catz.Looking forward, guidance was positive, likely due to pushed-out deals, with F1Q total revenue expected to be (1%)–1% in USD, vs. consensus of (1.8%), and NG EPS of $0.84–0.88 vs. consensus of $0.85.Following the report RBC Capital’s Alex Zukin wrote “Oracle continues its transition to a Cloud-centric world unevenly. Its traditional on-prem license business is shrinking, and Cloud growth is only strong enough to keep total revenue modestly expanding”Citing better margins/ EPS, he raised his price target to $51 from $50 previously, and reiterated his hold rating. Management continues to talk to an acceleration, but the time frame is uncertain, he added. Zukin’s new price target still indicates downside potential of 7% lies ahead.Shares are currently sinking 3% in Wednesday’s pre-market trading, with a 3% gain so far year-to-date. Analysts are split between hold and buy ratings, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $55 is flat with the current share price.

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett finally made a deal, but those fireworks you heard weren’t for him. As the U.S. closed out the Fourth of July holiday weekend, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said that it’s acquiring nearly $10 billion of natural-gas assets and associated debt from Dominion Energy Inc. It may not be the awe-inspiring mega-purchase that his followers have patiently awaited. Still, there’s much that can be gleaned from it about Buffett’s frame of mind as the nation enters month five of a pandemic that’s otherwise kept the famed investor on the sidelines. This is Berkshire’s biggest acquisition since 2015, yet it’s small by Berkshire standards — a relatively low-risk deal in the midst of a recession that’s set to change the outlook for some industries for good. Even though Buffett recently signaled little appetite to make any big bets so long as the end of Covid-19 remains entirely unknown, energy is one area where he’s been poised to make smaller, opportunistic purchases. During Berkshire’s unusually somber shareholder meeting in May, he cited the energy division, along with the BNSF railroad and insurance unit, as parts of his conglomerate that were less affected by the virus. “These businesses will produce cash even though their earnings decline somewhat,” he said. In his annual letter in February, the billionaire wrote of wanting to invest more of the energy unit’s retained earnings to take on large utility projects. The Dominion deal hands Berkshire more than 7,700 miles of gas pipelines and 900 billion cubic feet of gas storage. And it comes as Dominion and Duke Energy Corp. pull out of plans for a controversial pipeline project along the U.S. East Coast; other projects like it have been scrapped as well, and pipeline stocks have taken a beating. That confluence of factors created a rare chance in this environment for Buffett to get a deal at a price he likes in an industry he’s comfortable with — and at a time when he and seemingly everyone else is scared to do much else. It also happens to be an industry that Buffett’s successor-in-waiting, Greg Abel, knows well as the current head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.What stood out as noteworthy in Berkshire’s deal announcement was that the first quote was from Buffett, not Abel. This says that Buffett, even as he is set to turn 90 years old next month, is still calling the shots and wants that known. It’s also a reminder that Berkshire’s history of striking sweetheart deals with favorable terms is very much because of Buffett’s celebrity and acclaim — there’s something to be said for selling your company to the Warren Buffett. That leaves the question: Will Abel be awarded the same preferential M&A treatment when Buffett’s gone? If not, what’s he to do with Berkshire’s more than $100 billion of cash that not even Buffett has been able to spend?With 2020 now marked by economic shutdowns, virus fears and a host of canceled trips, weddings and graduations, it hasn’t been a good year for anyone, not even the world’s sixth-richest man (he was fourth-richest before the crisis). Ideally, Buffett would be making a splash with one more giant deal right about now, and something more fascinating to the average investor than a bunch of underground pipes at that. (Costco Wholesale Corp. is one such example I speculated on recently.)Buffett may not seem much older than he did a year ago — he’s certainly just as sharp — but turning 90 is symbolic as a final chapter for the Oracle. He won’t want the last footnote of his legacy to be an unmemorable purchase of gas assets, even if it is a fine transaction. Then again, Covid-19 isn’t leaving him much choice. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

              <p>""One thing that's refreshing is that consumers want to travel. Right. I mean, there is a resilience and an appetite to be on the road, to explore, to experience.""</p>
              <p>It can't come soon enough for Las Vegas's Wynn Resort. Chief Information Officer Rajeev Rai told Reuters they've reconfigured the casino floor to cut down on contagion. </p>
              <p>""Our capacity of the casino was reduced drastically, so that's slot machines, we removed chairs to enable the physical distancing and the entire sanitization protocol in terms of number of times they are being sanitized at how they're being sanitized, has been completely redone. Then in the table games, which is a close proximity, we've install plexiglass. We require face coverings for both guests and our associates.""</p>
              <p>Hotels have upended their standard housekeeping protocols. According to the survey, 90% of hotels have increased or planned to increase cleaning and disinfecting. Another 70% of already are or are planning to adopt technology that cuts down on human contact, and hopefully viral transmission.</p>

              <p>""This last Saturday, we saw the highest occupancy level out of this particular dataset, which represents about 600 hotels -- the highest occupancy levels since March 14th. So, look, we need that to continue.""</p>
              <p>One change: Many say they prefer to drive, and stay closer to home, than fly internationally. </p>

2020-07-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Sudan’s government calls itself transitional, but what it is attempting is transformational. In the latest raft of reforms announced earlier this month, it abolished a law against apostasy, ended punishment by flogging, criminalized female genital mutilation, dropped rules requiring women to get a permit from a male family member to travel with their children — and loosened prohibitions on the sale and consumption of alcohol.Last week, the government also began the final phase of peace talks with rebels that could see the latter join the administration.Still a month short of its first anniversary, the government — headed by a council of civilian and military representatives, and led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, a former United Nations economist — seems determined to dismantle, without delay, the poisonous legacy of the ousted former dictator Omar al-Bashir. Sudanese activists and international rights groups are cheering it on.It is also being encouraged by the Trump administration, which has upgraded diplomatic ties. After a gap of more than two decades, Washington now has a Sudanese ambassador. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the U.S. will appoint an ambassador to Khartoum.But the U.S. continues to hold out on the gesture that would mean the most to the transitional government: removing Sudan from the State Department’s list of countries that sponsor terrorism. The designation, which it shares with Iran, North Korea and Syria, restricts the country’s access to aid, investment and remittances.As I wrote last year, shortly after Hamdok’s appointment, Sudan doesn’t belong on that list. Indeed, many in the national security establishment in Washington argue that it should have been dropped years ago. For all his tyranny, even Bashir had long been cooperating with American counterterrorism efforts. The Trump administration acknowledged this in 2017, when it removed most U.S. sanctions on Sudan.And yet, the U.S. remains reluctant to take the final step, even though the transitional government has repeatedly demonstrated its eagerness to curry Washington’s favor. Pompeo’s explanation, that “we always measure twice and cut once before we remove someone from a list like that,” is vague at best.There are other voices in Washington counseling caution. Keeping Sudan on the list, they say, gives the U.S. leverage over the military, to ensure that it doesn’t undermine the democratizing process. Better to save delisting as the final reward, for an elected government after the three-year transition has been completed.The risk of recidivism exists, of course. Witness a violent mutiny by members of the intelligence services in January. In March, Hamdok escaped an assassination attempt. Although the government has been able to imprison Bashir and some of his closest lieutenants — they face trial for genocide and other war crimes at the International Criminal Court — other dangerous figures in fatigues still wield considerable power in Khartoum. Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti,” leader of the infamous Janjaweed militias blamed for the genocide in Darfur, now runs the Rapid Support Forces, and portrays himself as a hero in the country’s fight against the coronavirus.But to imagine that keeping Sudan on the terrorism-sponsors list will ward off counter-revolutionary forces is to greatly exaggerate American leverage — and to underestimate the protest movement that brought down Bashir. The protesters maintain a sharp-eyed vigilance on the military, and despite the pandemic, have kept up pressure on the government to stay the course on reforms.Certainly, they could use international help to keep the government honest. To prevent backsliding in Khartoum, the U.S. has plenty of carrots and sticks it can use.Smoothing the way for investment and aid, for instance, would allow Hamdok to rebuild Sudan’s economy, which was decrepit even before the pandemic. Some investors, having taken their own measure of Africa’s third-largest country, are not waiting on a formal delisting. American companies ranging from Visa Inc and Oracle to Yum! Brands (which owns Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut) have announced partnerships in Sudan. International donors last month pledged $2 billion in aid. Many more would undoubtedly be emboldened to follow if the terrorism-sponsorship designation were removed. And success on the economic front would do much to legitimize civilian rule.Moreover, the threat of sanctions should suffice as a disincentive. After all, for those who need reminding, being taken off the list of terrorism sponsors is not a permanent condition: North Korea was delisted in 2008, and subsequently relisted by the Trump administration.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Bobby Ghosh is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-08-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Saturday is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. earnings day, but don’t count on there being many insights from Warren Buffett himself.As Berkshire prepares to report its latest operating results and an update to its even more closely followed cash figure, what investors want most of all is to hear from the Oracle of Omaha. But unlike other companies, Berkshire’s quarterly earnings aren’t that illuminating. They usually entail only a perfunctory statement of the overarching numbers, with no prepared remarks or chance to ask questions.Berkshire’s longstanding tradition of not hosting earnings calls has always made it an outlier in Corporate America — that and the unconventional practice of reporting on weekends. But not having any regular forum to hear from Buffett and Berkshire’s other executives is especially unfortunate during a global pandemic and recession in which shareholders are seeking direction.Buffett has lived through numerous crises, and each time he remained sanguine about America’s economic prospects, while the conglomerate and reputation he built always emerged relatively unscathed.  Covid-19 changed that. Shares of Berkshire have fallen 10% this year, while the S&P 500 index is back in positive territory.The last time shareholders heard directly from Buffett, he was in a lonely auditorium sounding dispirited during what should have been Berkshire’s annual investor summit. The company, which in the past has taken advantage of downturns to vacuum up good companies, was instead selling stocks as the virus worsened. Meanwhile, some of the most resilient members of the market have been technology companies and dividend payers — Berkshire is adamantly neither. Buffett did warm to two tech giants in recent years: Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., investments valued at $108 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. But Buffett was a latecomer to the space, which has boasted a 208% return over the past five years, compared with Berkshire’s 42% gain. Increasingly, observers are questioning whether Buffett has lost his touch. Berkshire’s operating results, which are fairly predictable, have become less relevant to its shareholders over time. That’s not just because its stock-market investments now account for more than half the company’s value. It’s also that so much of the reason for owning Berkshire stock is the prospect of what Buffett does with the company’s cash. Lately, that’s been very little. Berkshire did buy more shares in Bank of America Corp. in recent days, after ditching most of its Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stake, but investors won’t find out what else Berkshire bought and sold until next week. Last month, it agreed to acquire $10 billion of natural-gas assets and associated debt from Dominion Energy Inc., a deal that had strategic logic, but fell well short of the fireworks moment investors have long awaited. (In June, I wrote that  Costco Wholesale Corp. should be Buffett’s next takeover target — now that would set off fireworks.) Bill Ackman, the widely followed hedge-fund manager, even exited a position in Berkshire in May after determining Buffett’s reluctance to do deals may hold back its stock price. If not a deal, there’s at least one other announcement investors are bracing for: Buffett stepping down. He’s set to turn 90 years old at the end of the month, which he jokes is “urgent” territory. He has taken notable steps in recent years to line up his succession, such as elevating Greg Abel from the energy side of the business and Ajit Jain from the reinsurance side to vice chairmen. Abel also joined Buffett on stage during the virtual May meeting, as opposed to Charlie Munger, who is 96.Earnings calls can be mundane, especially when executives waste the time rattling off a financial report card that can be found in public filings. But they can also be fascinating opportunities to hear from people with a special vantage point in the broader economy. In the case of Berkshire, it would also be a chance for shareholders to get better acquainted with Abel or whoever is tasked with someday filling Buffett’s shoes, as well as the many other executives that run Berkshire’s dozens of businesses. And plus, how can Buffett retire without ever getting to hear “Nice quarter, guys?”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-08-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Technology giants may join the rush to sustainable finance after this week’s record bond sale from Google parent Alphabet Inc. Issuance aligns with growing investor focus on social and environmental matters, and it’s being done at very low rates.“You’re going to see tech companies continue to follow this model,” said Scott Kimball, a portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages about $100 billion in fixed income assets. “Google is a leader in technology and they were able to raise a lot of money pretty cheap.”Companies from a wide variety of sectors are expected to offer bonds to investors focused on environmental, social and governance themes this year. The tech sector is expected to be a major participant amid growing scrutiny of its social impact given its dominance in the global economy, as well as its focus on renewable energy.Alphabet sold $10 billion of bonds on Monday at record-low rates, including $5.75 billion of sustainability notes -- a corporate record. Investors placed almost $40 billion in orders for the deal, which paid about $4 million in fees to minority-owned underwriters, a sum the company claims was the highest ever.“When Google does something people notice, whether they are in the tech space or not. This will definitely lead to more issuance in the sustainability market, social market and certainly the green market,” said James Rich, senior portfolio manager of sustainable fixed income at Aegon Asset Management, which has about $395 billion in global assets.Big technology companies like Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. or even Facebook Inc. could also look to tap the ESG bond market, according to Kimball, who bought some of the Alphabet bonds and doesn’t have any specific knowledge of a deal from those other companies. Representatives for the three tech firms did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment on debt sale plans.Issuance of social and sustainability bonds, dominated by governments and supranationals, is on track to double to more than $100 billion by the end of this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ESG analysts Simone Andrews and Adeline Diab.“Alphabet’s deal certainly sets a new high watermark for anyone to consider coming to the sustainability bond market,” said Jonny Fine, head of investment-grade syndicate for the Americas at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a lead manager on the Alphabet bond sale, said in a telephone interview Wednesday.“We are getting calls from a very diverse corporate set of issuers wanting to understand more,” Marilyn Ceci, global head of ESG debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in an interview Thursday. “You’ll continue to see active participation from corporates globally in the sustainable finance space,” she added. JPMorgan was also a bookrunner on the Alphabet sale.Better PricingAlphabet will use this week’s bond sale to fund organizations that support Black entrepreneurs, businesses impacted by Covid-19, affordable housing and green buildings among others. It hopes to “help develop this new market,” Ruth Porat, chief financial officer at Alphabet and Google, wrote in a blog post Monday.“As investors that focus on both financial and impact returns, what is most important to us is that Google has committed to providing impact measurements for the projects that are funded through this issuance,” said Stephen Liberatore, head of the responsible fixed-income strategy team at Nuveen.Alphabet saved about three to five basis points on the funding cost by doing the deal in an ESG format, according to Goldman’s Fine. Borrowers with more debt outstanding could save as much as 15 basis points, he said.Sustainable finance may also become more widespread in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, according to Fine.

2020-08-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Once you really get into puzzles, you start seeing them in everyday objects.(1) Even a simple atlas can turn into a Conundrum: Without the labels, you’re left scratching your head trying to figure out what the symbols represent.This week we’re looking at two such mysterious maps, created in collaboration with one of my students who goes by the nom de plume Spaceman Spiff. Each one plots some structured information, and your challenge is to figure out what the points represent.And while of course the data must somehow be geographically distributed, we haven’t limited ourselves to purely geographic features like the presence of lakes and monuments. The underlying pattern could reflect pretty much anything: demographic data, the price of eggs, or even historical milestones.The first one is a bit of a warm-up – figuring it out shouldn’t be the biggest challenge.(2) The second is the main event. It’s more difficult because in some sense it’s a map in motion: if we had waited another couple of months, there’d be one more dot in Russia.You might use all your quantitative skill to figure out what this map represents, and then discover it actually isn’t about the numbers at all.A couple ground rules: Each map represents a single, well-defined category, rather than something subjective. And the answer to each has something to do with the actual places, rather than other features like wordplay. That means the answer will be something like “locations of the mountains more than 10,000 feet tall,” rather than “major cities with a prime number of letters in their name.” Additionally, the data we used is publicly available and easily accessible. That means if you get a hunch, it should be straightforward to figure out if you’re right. So what are you waiting for? Get out your charts and compass and start exploring!If you map out one or both answers – or if you even make partial progress – please let me know at skpuzzles@bloomberg.net before midnight New York time on Wednesday, August 12. (If you get stuck, there’ll be a hint announced in Bloomberg Opinion Today on Tuesday, August 11. Sign up here.) To be counted in the solver list, please include your full name with your answer.Last Week’s Conundrum Fourteen famous figures gave us clues that led to a single person:As solvers started identifying our celebrities, they noticed a shared feature that was too unusual to be an accident: Each one had the same first and last initial.(3)That enabled us to convert each person into a single letter; reading in order then gave the message, “WHO FACES APOLLO[?].”First row:Walt Whitman Helen Hunt Oona O’NeilSecond row:Fred Flintstone Alan Alda Chubby Checker Emilio Estevez Sylvester StalloneThird row:Adam Ant Pablo Picasso Ozzy Osbourne Lindsay Lohan Lucy Liu Olive OylBut where to go from there? There are many potential Apollos to choose from – the name appears everywhere from Greek myth to space exploration.But I had hinted that the Conundrum’s answer was “hardly hidden,” and there was only one Apollo related to our famous fourteen: Apollo Creed, whom Sylvester Stallone faces in multiple movies as Rocky Balboa.Once you were on that track, you could recognize several other clues pointing in the same direction: My description of the figures as having been “boxed up,” not to mention the lines “quest for an answer” and “rise up to the challenge” in the Conundrum text, both of which are riffs on Rocky theme music.So indeed, “Sylvester Stallone” was the answer. And as promised, he was “hardly hidden.” He was looking at readers the whole time.Lazar Ilic solved first, followed soon after by Anna Collins, Jeff Schwartz, Ellen & Bill Kominers, and Zoz. Others among the 28 solvers included Ross Berger(4) & Sally Bloom, Kid Beyond, Andrew Bradburn, Michael Branicky, Ryan Buell, Hensley Carrasco, Filbert Cua, Philip Davidson, Rosie & Jack DeStories, Karl Mahlburg, Jeffrey & Patricia Miron, Tamar Oostrom & Pari Sastry, Ross Rheingans-Yoo, Ari Shnidman, Clive Sindelman, Nancy & Murray Stern, and Jeff Young.Suproteem Sarkar wrote a software script to identify all the images using Google. FiveThirtyEight’s Riddler, Zach Wissner-Gross, submitted a boxing glove emoji.And as we learned with our pyramid puzzles a few weeks ago, sometimes stars collide in ways that give Conundrums multiple solutions. Jonathan Zandberg took a trip down the rabbit hole to uncover a particularly spectacular alternate answer: It turns out that there is a book series called “The Trials of Apollo,” the first volume of which is “The Hidden Oracle” (“hardly hidden”). On the cover, Apollo looks upward at (we might say, he “faces”) the name of the author – Rick Riordan, who has the same first and last initial, just like our fourteen.

Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite.

2020-08-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The competition over which U.S. technology company will win control of TikTok is heating up, and it just took a strange turn.Late Monday, the Financial Times reported that Oracle Corp. has held talks with Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. to acquire TikTok’s operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, putting the business-software developer in the running for the short-video platform alongside Microsoft Corp. and Twitter Inc.  According to the report, Oracle is partnering with current ByteDance investors General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital for the potential deal.The new development follows President Donald Trump’s latest edict on Friday that ordered ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations within 90 days, citing national security concerns. An earlier executive order from Trump restricts U.S. residents from doing business with the company as of late September.Certainly, Oracle — with a market value of $170 billion — has the wherewithal to be a serious contender for TikTok. It can easily afford the tens of billions that will likely be required to buy the popular app. And with Oracle’s extensive history in enterprise database software, the U.S. can be assured that the company would be able to safeguard TikTok’s user data, relieving any security and privacy concerns. Beyond those two points,  though, an Oracle-TikTok combination makes little sense.Oracle has virtually no experience in the consumer internet and social-media app businesses. Further, there is little corporate synergy between TikTok’s burgeoning offering for brand advertisers and the software company’s enterprise-focused sales channels. Frankly, it seems like a desperate attempt at relevancy as Oracle has struggled amid the industry’s secular shift to cloud computing from traditional on-premise deployments. To illustrate, during a time when revenue at many cloud-software companies is growing at heady double-digit rates, Oracle is shrinking, with its sales down 6% versus in its latest reported quarter from a year earlier. While Oracle is trying to market itself as a leading cloud player, the numbers show it is still a legacy software vendor at its core.The truth is, TikTok is a better fit for the other public bidders. Last month, I wrote how Microsoft may be the best match, noting that its advertising business anchored by the Bing search engine could make TikTok a powerful third competitor against the two dominant internet ad players, Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. In addition, Microsoft has other successful consumer offerings such as its Xbox gaming business and talented machine-learning engineers to maintain TikTok’s best-in-class algorithms. On a pure dollars and cents level, its Microsoft’s game to lose as well. The company is worth nearly $1.6 trillion and has the ability to top any bid from Oracle, if it so desires. And because Microsoft has similar businesses, where it can cross-sell and cross-promote TikTok, the company probably can value TikTok higher versus the enterprise-focused Oracle.As for Twitter, my colleague Tim Culpan wrote last week that buying TikTok would help increase the social media company’s scale and reach to younger viewers, improving the company’s ability to sell to advertisers. And of course, Twitter has specialized industry knowledge and long experience in social media.There may be another cross-current in the mix, though. It is reported Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is one of few technology executives who has supported President Trump politically. Some have speculated Ellison may be able to leverage his close relationship with the White House to get his company a better deal. But at the end of the day, even if Oracle can win out, that doesn’t mean it should go for it. From my perspective, an Oracle-TikTok combination is just too weird to work.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-08-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp.’s preliminary interest in making a bid for TikTok, on first glance, looks like an awkward fit -- the 43-year-old software giant best known for legacy corporate databases and the music-video sharing app beloved by teens seem as different as two companies can be.But the match may not be as far-fetched as it first appears. The world’s second-largest software maker has approached investors including Sequoia Capital to partner on a bid for TikTok’s business in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg late Monday.The company’s possible pursuit of a deal for the social network, owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., makes more sense in light of Oracle’s desire to build up its cloud-computing and consumer-data businesses -- and comes into even clearer focus considering Oracle’s close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump and Chairman Larry Ellison’s cheerleading for American tech interests.Microsoft Corp. has been seen as the front-runner in the race to acquire TikTok’s U.S. assets, and is the only company to publicly confirm talks with ByteDance. Trump told reporters Tuesday that Oracle also is interested in TikTok and “could handle” a purchase of the service.The president on Friday ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets within 90 days, adding to an earlier executive order that would prohibit U.S. persons and companies from doing business with TikTok effective 45 days from Aug. 6.While Microsoft at first seemed like an unlikely suitor, the company already has consumer-facing units -- gaming platform Xbox and LinkedIn, a social network for business professionals. Oracle and Microsoft are peers founded in the 1970s, but Microsoft has seen a resurgence because of its success in cloud computing. Oracle, meanwhile, has experienced stagnant sales and reduced relevance, and could badly use a win in the cloud-services market.TikTok has more than 100 million users in the U.S. When the company separates its technology from ByteDance, it will need to find new places to store the huge amount of data generated by these users. The app could be an anchor tenant for Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure unit, which hosts client information, but has struggled to keep up with rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft. Oracle has seven data-center regions for businesses across North America and Australia. The company has declined to comment on its potential interest in TikTok.Oracle is “one of the other players with the infrastructure to support an ecosystem and user base as massive as TikTok,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research. Forgoing payments to external cloud vendors could save TikTok “billions annually,” he said.While Oracle doesn’t have any consumer-facing business, Ellison has sought a piece of the lucrative ad-targeting market with the company’s Data Cloud, which includes a data-brokerage business that creates profiles of ordinary people and sells them to advertisers. The billionaire co-founder has boasted about how his trove of consumer data is second only to Facebook Inc., and has said that Oracle needs to help businesses target their customers “better than competitors.”The unit has struggled since the European Union’s data-privacy law, GDPR, went into effect in 2018, and the company curtailed its practice of tracking consumers in the region. Facebook also changed its ad-targeting practices after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, making it harder for third parties like Oracle to help advertisers find niche audiences. Oracle fired around 5% of the division’s staff in 2018. In June 2019, the company said that revenue had fallen 15% in the unit. A month later, the division’s leader, Eric Roza, departed the company.TikTok could spearhead a resurgence for the division, giving Oracle information about consumers that would be useful to advertisers, and also offer a platform where those clients could run their ads -- dramatically simplifying the process. ByteDance would still control TikTok’s European business, so Oracle wouldn’t have to worry about GDPR, but it would face all the other challenges of running a social-media company, including having to remove inflammatory and violent content and answering to U.S. lawmakers increasingly worried about consumer privacy and social-media disinformation. The company has little experience in this area and may face a more hostile administration if Trump loses re-election after Oracle secures a TikTok deal.Oracle is a rare Silicon Valley company with close ties to the president, even partnering with the White House on an effort earlier this year to track the effects of using hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19. Ellison and Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz personally support Trump’s re-election effort. Ellison has also emerged as a China hawk, saying in 2018 that it’s important the U.S. “wins the battle with China” and deciding to significantly reduce Oracle’s footprint in the country. Snatching TikTok’s American business would blunt Chinese progress in the U.S. tech market.Then there’s the matter of scale. Oracle, with $43 billion of cash and securities on hand, could easily fund a TikTok acquisition, which is estimated by bankers to be valued at $20 billion to $50 billion. After years of being acquisitive, Oracle has slowed its deals recently, saying it has all of the technology it needs to grow. Now, it seems even 76-year-old Ellison isn’t immune to the TikTok phenomenon.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle’s Improbable TikTok Talks Have a Simple Explanation: Data

2020-08-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp., the world’s second-largest software maker, is weighing a surprise bid for part of TikTok’s business, seeking to rival Microsoft Corp. in the race to acquire the viral video streaming app, according to people familiar with the matter.The company, controlled by billionaire Larry Ellison, has made a preliminary approach to other parties, including the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, to partner with it in a bid for the app’s operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the people said, asking not to be identified.It isn’t clear why Oracle, which focuses on business customers and has virtually no investments in consumer apps or social media, would want to acquire TikTok. However, co-founder Ellison is one of the few Silicon Valley moguls to openly support President Donald Trump. Ellison, whose company was once among the industry’s most aggressively acquisitive, hosted a fundraiser at his estate for the U.S. president in February.The entry of Oracle would challenge Microsoft’s bargaining position, as the Redmond-based company had been the only party to publicly confirm it was in talks with TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. Trump on Friday ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets within 90 days, adding to an earlier executive order that would prohibit U.S. persons and companies from doing business with TikTok effective 45 days from Aug. 6.Oracle didn’t immediately respond while ByteDance declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Sequoia, a venture investor in ByteDance, also declined to comment. The Financial Times reported on the talks earlier.The potential bid makes “little strategic sense,” said Anurag Rana, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, “given its subscale cloud business and TikTok’s lack of synergies with its core database or applications products.”Oracle’s shares were up 2.8% in premarket trading in New York Tuesday.Valued at roughly $166 billion, Oracle held about $43 billion in cash or near equivalents as of the end of May, making it one of few companies that could potentially afford the lofty price tag for TikTok. Analysts and bankers have estimated the value of TikTok’s U.S. business at between $20 billion and $50 billion, a wide range that reflects the complexity involved in separating TikTok’s American and global businesses.“A potential bid by Oracle to acquire certain assets of TikTok, according to news reports, makes little strategic sense, given its subscale cloud business and TikTok’s lack of synergies with its core database or applications products. A financial investment in conjunction with private equity or other tech companies may be more plausible, in our view.”Anurag Rana, Senior Tech Analyst, Bloomberg IntelligenceByteDance bought the Musical.ly app in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, creating an app with over 100 million users in the U.S. alone. That deal is being unraveled by U.S. officials, which have cited national security concerns amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. Now, the company is facing a fast-approaching deadline to reach a deal, or risk facing a complete shutdown of its American business.Other bidders potentially interested in the assets include Twitter Inc.

The software giant is already in preliminary discussions with US-based TikTok investors including venture capital firms General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital.President Donald Trump on Friday formally ordered the Chinese owner of TikTok to divest its US assets setting a 90-day deadline for a deal to be announced by Sept. 15 or face a ban.“There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands […] might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,” the executive order signed by President Trump read.Until now, Microsoft (MSFT), has been viewed as the frontrunner in the acquisition talks for TikTok’s operations in the US, who said it will move “quickly” to pursue a deal, while continuing the dialogue with the US government, including with the President. In addition to the announced acquisition talks, the tech giant is reportedly also interested in buying the UK operations of the popular music video app.Meanwhile, the FT report pointed out that Oracle’s billionaire co-founder Larry Ellison is one of the few US tech executives who has been openly supportive of Trump, though it’s not clear whether the software giant would be the White House’s preferred contender for TikTok.Oracle shares are currently advancing 3.8% in Tuesday’s pre-market trading, with a 1.9% gain so far year-to-date. (See ORCL stock analysis on TipRanks).Overall, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic on the stock split between 7 Buys, 11 Holds and 1 Sell, which gives the stock a Moderate Buy consensus.

Several reports suggest that TikTok's U.S. business might be valued at anywhere between $15 billion and $50 billion.Why It Matters: There are other tech players, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Twitter Inc.

However, TikTok reportedly remains hesitant to sell-off other international business operations.Micro-blogging giant Twitter is also said to be eying the acquisition, although there are concerns over its relatively smaller size. Twitter has a market cap of $30 billion, and might have to raise significant debt, or rely on its high-profile investors such as Silver Lake to aid the acquisition.Last month, President Donald Trump said there are privacy concerns surrounding TikTok and that the application is under scrutiny.

2020-08-19,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he called off last weekend’s trade talks with China, raising questions about the future of a deal that is now the most stable point in an increasingly tense relationship.“I canceled talks with China,” Trump said Tuesday in Yuma, Arizona. “I don’t want to talk to China right now.”The phase-one trade deal, which came into force in February, had called for discussions on implementation of the agreement every six months. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He was supposed to hold a video conference call with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, but it was postponed indefinitely.On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian deferred comment to the “competent department” when asked about Trump’s remarks on the trade talks.Chinese stocks slumped, led by biotech shares, amid growing concern over tensions between the world’s biggest economies. The CSI 300 fell 1.5% at the close, the largest decline in nearly a month, while the tech-heavy ChiNext gauge slumped 3.3%.Talks between the U.S. and China continue regularly at lower levels, according to Greg Gilligan, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. While the purchases by China could be happening more quickly, “there is absolutely commitment and progress that’s occurring” he said Wednesday.“I think both sides recognize that this is really the glue that is holding the relationship together. There’s not an awful lot of other channels of communication that are working well,” Gilligan said. “So that’s a reason for some optimism in an otherwise pretty bleak scenario in the larger relationship.”While China is making many of the structural changes it promised on issues such as intellectual-property protection, its purchases of U.S. goods are well below where they need to be to meet promised targets, and there’s almost no chance they can be fulfilled now with the damage Covid-19 has done to the global economy. A collapse of the deal risks leading to a return of the tit-for-tat tariff war that hurt trade and companies around the world.‘We’ll See What Happens’Addressing whether the U.S. would pull out of the phase-one deal, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens.” Terminating the deal would require a written notification and take effect 60 days later, unless both parties agree on a different date.The talks never made it on to any official public calendar in Washington or Beijing, but the South China Morning Post reported that they were set for last Saturday. Earlier, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that information on high-level talks will be released “in due course.”China Is Buying American But Not Enough to Hit Trade Deal Target“The recent U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies likely impacted the talks,” said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a think tank under China’s Commerce Ministry. “How can the talks proceed if the U.S. keeps creating new problems?”“Whether the U.S. wants to provide a stable or turbulent environment for businesses, that’s entirely up to them,” Mei said. “China should be the anchor of stability and order.”Trump has stepped up pressure on China over everything from democracy in Taiwan and Hong Kong to popular apps WeChat and TikTok as he looks to make up ground in the polls before the November election. One of his main goals with the trade deal was to lower the U.S. deficit with China, but now it’s rising again.Even if China can buy enough soybeans, corn or pork to meet its promises on agriculture, it’s unlikely it can buy enough oil and gas to meet those on energy. In addition, the collapse of international travel will hit Chinese demand for new U.S. planes and has stopped hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens from traveling to the U.S. for college or tourism, decimating U.S. services exports.Trump has been stepping up complaints about China, particularly over the spread of the coronavirus, which he regularly calls the “China Virus.”“What China did to the world was unthinkable,” Trump said Tuesday.(Updates with comments from U.S. chamber of commerce official from sixth paragraph.

2020-08-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Dear investors readers,In response to recent rumors, started by me, that I’m in talks to purchase the U.S. operations of TikTok, I’d like to clarify. I am indeed interested in buying the hip viral short-video service. I’d also like to fly to Mars, cure cancer, or climb Mount Everest. Just as with my bid for TikTok, I have no intention of doing so. However, I have “held talks” with TikTok. By which I mean I tweeted at them. They didn’t reply.Despite the fact that I have no money, no operational experience, no management team and even this actual letter being satire, I believe that I now ought to be name-checked alongside Microsoft Corp., Twitter Inc., Reliance Industries Ltd. and Oracle Corp.And while I am not American, I am fully qualified to own and operate TikTok’s U.S. business by virtue of me satisfying President Donald Trump’s key criteria: not being Chinese. My reasons for making this faux bid are as sound and logical as some of the real ones by my rival suitors, so hear me out.First, I have the technical qualifications. Because I not only studied some Java but have even written code in C (malloc that, Microsoft), I am perfectly qualified to manage and analyze millions of lines of code to ensure no nefarious algorithms are embedded within. Having taken Andrew Ng’s “Machine Learning” class on Coursera, I am now fully adept at running an advanced artificial intelligence company. My ability to protect America’s data is evidenced by the fact that I use long passwords for my Hotmail account and have a four-digit PIN code sent by SMS whenever I log in. In addition, I am very interested in keeping financiers happy. By making this spurious bid, I can ingratiate myself with ByteDance Ltd.'s bankers. The appearance of a bidding war will help keep them relevant and justify their fees in what is otherwise a government-mandated fire sale.I can also make my own bankers think I’m a real player, eager and willing to engage in mergers and acquisitions, as a way to get their fresh young recruits to work ridiculous hours at my beck and call to prepare long, detailed Powerpoints which I’ll never look at. Unfortunately, I don’t have any bankers at this time, but I do have a Bloomberg Terminal (seriously, bankers, MSG me). Now, let’s be frank.Here are some of the serious reasons why anyone would want to make a play for a business that’s entirely outside of their wheelhouse and makes no strategic sense.“Spoiler” bidding is an entirely legitimate practice in the M&A world. Even if one were not entirely sincere about buying the target, pretending to be interested could push up the price that an actual rival will end up having to pay. If I can force Microsoft to fork out even $100 more for TikTok, then my job is done.Getting a look inside this gargantuan purveyor of lip-sync videos and makeup tips would be valuable in itself. By knocking on the door, checkbook in hand, any wannabe bidders might expect that ByteDance will open up the books. That would allow the inquiring mind to understand how much money the Chinese company really has, with a view to later selling their own services at the highest price they can get away with. In addition, under the guise of due diligence, one might hope to be given access to TikTok’s source code, software stack, data and algorithms. This would better help me understand why teens are addicted and how I could make my boring cloud business sound hip, young and relevant. This column is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities. However, I do invite anyone tempted to make a play for TikTok to talk to me first, so that I can at least have a scoop on the next hat in the ring. I promise to take your bid as seriously as you take mine.I do not intend to provide further updates on this bid, though I’d love for TikTok to get back to me on Twitter (@tculpan). I’ll wait. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

In an interview Thursday, she said she’s made clear internally and externally that Tiktok strongly disagrees with the Trump administration’s stance, and said TikTok hadn’t been presented with any evidence to back up claims it shares data with the Chinese government.Pappas said TikTok will remain in the U.S. regardless of the Trump administration’s threats, and believes it has “multiple paths forward” depending on what happens. “It’s an extremely turbulent time, so our message is really just, ‘let's focus on the things that you can control, the things that matter,’” she said. This week, TikTok launched what it called its largest ad campaign to date, with television, radio and social media spots that pitch it as a positive force in the U.S. Still, chatter among TikTok employees about what some have begun to refer to as &quot;D-Day,&quot; or simply “Sept. 15” pop up in video meetings and the company's internal messaging app, Lark. Pappas scrolls through the Lark threads throughout the day and responds to concerns in hopes of heading off any unsubstantiated rumors and calming fears. The political crisis, say employees, is bizarrely disconnected from TikTok's rising revenue and exploding user base—the company passed 2 billion total downloads in April and has continued to outpace other social media apps, according to research firm Sensor Tower. While companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and IBM Corp. were cutting thousands of workers this spring, TikTok pledged to create 10,000 U.S. jobs. It began posting positions ranging from engineers and ad sales to communications and public policy staff. The company has run hundred-person on-boarding sessions in recent months, consisting of all-day training sessions followed by nightly homework assignments to practice creating TikTok videos.&quot;So many of us were getting laid off and the economic situation was really rough, but TikTok was still growing,&quot; said one employee who joined the company this spring after losing a previous job, and asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. &quot;There are so many questions right now, but I don't think the leadership team would be hiring and working so hard to keep the business going if they didn't know what they were doing.&quot;  Many people are working around the clock because hiring hasn’t kept up with the demands of the business’s growth. More than two thirds of TikTok's 1,500 U.S. employees have been hired since the beginning of the year, many of them since the pandemic began. Unable to meet their coworkers in person, they’ve bonded over the collective fight to keep the company alive, according to three employees who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Some TikTok performers who make money on the platform, however, aren’t just waiting around to see how the politics play out. Carrie Berk, who goes by @carrieberkk on TikTok, is one of many social media stars who appealed to TikTok fans to migrate to Instagram instead. &quot;It's like a ticking time bomb,&quot;  she said of TikTok. Advertisers are also making contingency plans in case of a potential TikTok shutdown, including writing so-called ban clauses into contracts that allow them to move their campaigns to other platforms if TikTok does disappear. &quot;We're negotiating contracts to give brands a level of comfort that if something does happen to Tiktok, it won't come out of their budget,&quot; said Eric Jacks, chief strategy officer at marketing agency Collab. Justin Kline, who runs a social media influencer marketing company Markerly, says he's advising brands to keep their advertising campaigns running on TikTok but that many of his clients are wavering. Advertisers like TikTok now, he said, but they’re also asking him, &quot;should we be investing in a platform that could get banned?'&quot; For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","TikTok Races to Calm Workers, Brands With 25 Days Until Ban"
2020-08-21,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok will continue to operate its hit music video app in the U.S., whatever comes of the threatened Trump administration ban on its business, senior executive Vanessa Pappas said.“We believe we have multiple paths forward to ensure that we continue to provide this amazing app experience to the millions of Americans who come to rely on it every day,&quot; Pappas said Thursday in one of her first interviews since U.S. President Donald Trump issued executive orders calling for the sale of TikTok’s U.S. business by its Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., or a complete shutdown of its American operations, citing national security concerns.The White House has been ratcheting up a fight with China's government and businesses and has issued restrictions on a number of Chinese tech giants, including Huawei Technologies Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Trump issued an executive order on Aug. 14 requiring TikTok to divest its U.S. business within 90 days under a ruling by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. Read More: TikTok Races to Calm Workers, Advertisers With 25 Days Until Ban“We’ve made it clear that we strongly disagree with the conclusions of CFIUS and we're certainly disappointed in the outcome that we saw there,” said Pappas, general manager of TikTok’s business in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia. “We still haven't been presented with any evidence to back up those claims and assertions.” Meanwhile, employees say they are following a daily drumbeat of reports over who might purchase the company’s U.S. business and become their new employer. Microsoft Corp. confirmed its pursuit of TikTok on Aug. 2, but Oracle Corp. and Twitter Inc. are among other tech companies that have explored bids, people familiar with the negotiations have told Bloomberg News. Before Trump called for ByteDance to divest its TikTok ownership in the U.S., the president ordered Americans to stop doing business with the company as of mid-September. Employees say they have asked questions about whether they’ll get paid after the order takes effect, and whether foreign workers could lose their visas, which afford them the right to live and work in the U.S. and are tied to their employment.Pappas declined to comment on the deal negotiations but said she’s tried to provide staff with multiple forums to express their fears and concerns openly, including weekly town hall sessions where she answers questions from TikTok’s 1,500 U.S. employees anonymously. She said the company hasn’t seen any exodus of staffers and pointed to India, where Bytedance has continued to pay workers despite a ban on TikTok in the country.“We're in extremely turbulent times. So our messaging is really, just let's focus on the things that you can control,” she said. “With pay, our commitment again has been steadfast. We have not wavered in our commitment either to our users or to our employees, that we believe we are here for the long run.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok's U.S. Chief Says Video Site Will Stay Despite Trump Ban
2020-08-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Google parent Alphabet Inc. considered participating in a group bid for TikTok, but the effort fizzled in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.Several firms discussed forming a consortium to invest in the popular video-sharing app, with Alphabet weighing a minority, non-voting stake through one of its investment arms, said one of the people. Alphabet didn’t lead the initiative. It isn’t clear which U.S. company did, or why the effort ended. Alphabet has not ruled out participating in future bids, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter.TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., is fielding interest in its operations in the U.S. and a handful of other countries. President Donald Trump recently ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. assets within 90 days, building on an earlier executive order that would prohibit U.S. people and companies from doing business with TikTok effective 45 days from Aug. 6.Read more: TikTok Races to Calm Workers, Advertisers With Ban LoomingRepresentatives of Alphabet and TikTok declined to comment. ByteDance representatives were not immediately available for comment.Microsoft Corp. has been in discussions for weeks to buy TikTok’s business in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Other companies have also emerged as potential bidders, including Oracle Corp. and Twitter Inc. It’s unclear how far those discussions have gone. Microsoft is the only company to publicly confirm acquisition talks.TikTok has emerged as a potent rival to Google’s video-sharing site YouTube, serving as an alternative for creative talent as well as advertising dollars. Google’s parent has multiple investment vehicles, including CapitalG, a private equity arm, which has backed Chinese firms. Google also invests directly off its balance sheet, funding companies such as Magic Leap Inc. and SpaceX.ByteDance bought the Musical.ly service in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, creating an app with more than 100 million users in the U.S. alone. That deal is being unraveled by U.S. officials who, against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, have alleged the Chinese government could gain access to TikTok users’ personal data and pose a national security risk. Now, the company is facing a fast-approaching deadline to reach a deal or risk a shutdown of its American business.Analysts and bankers have estimated the value of TikTok’s U.S. business at $20 billion to $50 billion, a wide range that reflects the complexity involved in extricating TikTok’s American operations.Mountain View, California-based Alphabet would need to tread gingerly around U.S. antitrust enforcers. The Justice Department, state attorneys general and Congress are all investigating Google for potential anticompetitive behavior, leading to more scrutiny of its acquisitions.

2020-08-22,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of WeChat users asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration from imposing a ban on what they say appears to be all uses of the Chinese messaging app in the U.S. over national security concerns.In a complaint filed Friday in federal court in San Francisco, Chinese-American lawyers who formed the U.S. WeChat Users Alliance claim President Donald Trump’s planned restriction on the app is unconstitutional. His Aug. 6 order bans Americans from carrying out transactions with WeChat and TikTok, another Chinese social-media platform, as of mid-September.The “vaguely worded” executive order doesn’t define what transactions will be prohibited and leaves individuals and companies at a loss whether they will violate the president’s order if they don’t fundamentally change the way they communicate or run their businesses, according to the lawyers. They linked the president’s order with his comments critical of China in recent months, including blaming it for the coronavirus pandemic.“Neither the Executive Order itself nor the White House provided concrete evidence to support the contention that using WeChat in the United States compromises national security,” the group said in the complaint. “The Executive Order was, however, issued in the midst of the 2020 election cycle, during a time when President Trump has made numerous anti-Chinese statements that have contributed to and incited racial animus against persons of Chinese descent.”They claim Trump’s order violates WeChat users’ free speech rights as well as their due process rights because it doesn’t provide notice of the specific conduct that is prohibited.Representatives of the U.S. Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to an email sent after regular business hours seeking comment on the lawsuit.WeChat, owned by Shenzhen, China-based Tencent Holdings Ltd., is used by millions of Americans and U.S. residents to communicate with people whose first language is Chinese, according to the alliance. Trump’s order would effectively ban WeChat’s use in the U.S., including anyone exchanging messages with friends, family or businesses in China, the group said.Trump’s order reflects growing concern by American authorities that Chinese businesses pose a grave security risk, a claim that has escalated tensions between the two countries and sparked denials from Beijing. Trump also ordered TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., on Aug. 14 to sell its U.S. assets, with potential buyers Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. showing interest.The president has wide powers under a 1977 law that allows him to declare a national emergency in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” including blocking transactions and seizing assets.Read More: Why Tencent and WeChat Are Such a Big Deal in ChinaU.S. companies with operations in China have expressed concern about the WeChat ban because the app is an integral tool for business in the country. Chinese consumers use it for all sorts of transactions, from buying coffee to airline tickets.The Trump administration is privately seeking to reassure U.S. companies including Apple Inc. that they can still do business with the WeChat messaging app in China, according to several people familiar with the matter, The case is U.S. WeChat Users Alliance v.

2020-08-24,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the fast-growing social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a U.S. courtroom.TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., sued on Monday in federal court in Los Angeles to challenge an Aug. 6 order from President Donald Trump prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok. Trump says TikTok is a security risk for user data. The company said the president’s decision was made “for political reasons,” is unconstitutional and violates rights to due process.While the order doesn’t take effect for weeks, it has escalated tensions between the U.S. and China. On Aug. 14, Trump ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets and said the U.S. should receive a cut of the proceeds. Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. have already shown interest in buying TikTok, which argues it poses no security threat.Trump’s actions would “destroy an online community where millions of Americans have come together to express themselves, share video content, and make connections with each other,” TikTok said. “The president has taken plaintiffs’ property without compensation.”The White House did not comment on the lawsuit.TikTok, a platform for creating and sharing short videos, has grown rapidly in the U.S. from about 11 million monthly active users in January 2018 to 100 million today, according to the filing. Global usage has risen to almost 2 billion from 55 million in January 2018, it said.TikTok has sought to distance itself from China and pushed back on the argument that it presents a threat to user data. In the lawsuit, the company said it has “taken extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok’s U.S. user data.”Those moves included storing data in the U.S. and Singapore, segregating TikTok data from other ByteDance offerings and appointing a U.S. leadership and content moderation team that is “not subject to Chinese law.”Read More: Why Tencent and WeChat Are Such a Big Deal in ChinaTrump’s decision to force the sale of ByteDance’s U.S. assets was based on an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Decisions by the interagency panel, which is led by the Treasury Department, are all but impossible to overturn in court.TikTok and ByteDance said in the lawsuit that they provided the committee with “voluminous documentation,” including about security measures. Yet the administration “ignored” the information, and the committee “repeatedly refused to engage with ByteDance and its counsel about CFIUS’s concerns,” TikTok said.The suit comes as Trump steps up his campaign against China, betting it will help him win November’s election despite upsetting millions of younger TikTok users. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has urged American companies to bar Chinese applications from their app stores, part of his “Clean Network” guidance designed to prevent authorities in China from accessing the personal data of U.S. citizens.TikTok suggested that Trump’s actions amounted to payback against the network for providing a platform for those who oppose him. It cited an incident in June, when TikTok users claimed they coordinated mass ticket reservations and inflated projected attendance for a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, so that many of the seats ended up empty. Trump’s re-election campaign has recently run online advertisements targeting the network, asking supporters to “sign the petition now to ban TikTok.”Trump made his move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that allows the president to declare a national emergency in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” which authorizes him to block transactions and seize assets.Uphill FightThe legal challenge faces an uphill fight, according to James Dempsey, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley. Courts don’t generally review the president’s determinations on questions of national security, Dempsey said.But the company may be successful with a due process argument, Dempsey said.“If there were ever a case to challenge the president on using national security powers without an adequate basis, this may be the one,” he said. “A First Amendment challenge is also possible, but TikTok will have to establish that it has a First Amendment right to be on the phones of Americans or that TikTok is a publisher, separate from the First Amendment rights of its users.”Read More: Why Trump Is Threatening Your Teen’s Favorite AppTrump has threatened penalties on any U.S. resident or company that conducts transactions with TikTok or WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging app, saying that having Americans’ personal data exposed to China creates a national security risk. The apps could get bumped off Apple Inc.’s and Google’s app stores.“This executive order risks undermining global businesses’ trust in the United States’ commitment to the rule of law, which has served as a magnet for investment and spurred decades of American economic growth,” TikTok said in a statement hours after Trump’s order was issued. “And it sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets.”A TikTok employee joined the fight on Monday, saying the government action would unconstitutionally deprive him of a job. Patrick Ryan filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco, hours after the company filed its own constitutional challenge in federal court in Los Angeles.On Friday, a group of WeChat users sued in San Francisco federal court saying Trump’s ban on the messaging app violated their right of free speech and due process rights because it doesn’t provide notice of the specific conduct that’s prohibited.The case is TikTok v.

He is said to favor the technology veteran company's bid.Trump signed an executive order last month to ban all U.S. entities from making financial transactions with ByteDance 45 days after it was signed. If a deal is not concluded by that period, the app faces a ban in the U.S.Oracle, Microsoft, and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) are all reported to be in discussions to acquire TikTok's domestic and international operations.Price Action: Oracle shares closed nearly 1.5% higher at $56.01 on Monday and gained another 0.45% in the after-hours session.

2020-08-26,"(Bloomberg) -- A top House Democrat rebuked President Donald Trump for commenting on the potential acquisition of the domestic operations of the popular TikTok video app by a U.S. company, but at the same time said such a deal could protect American interests.Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline, who is leading a probe of the technology industry, told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that it’s the job of federal enforcement agencies to determine whether TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., promotes competition or compromises national security and said that the president shouldn’t insert himself into the outcome of those decisions.Trump issued an executive order Aug. 14 forcing TikTok’s Chinese owner to divest its U.S. assets, citing national security grounds. He subsequently weighed in on possible bids by Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. Cicilline said it’s not the president’s role to decide who that buyer should be.“What we don’t need is the president of the United States injecting himself into a transaction in the way that he did,” Cicilline said. “I think that’s dangerous -- that kind of politicization of that company and their practices.”Trump has stepped up his attacks on TikTok as his administration increased pressure on China ahead of the November presidential election. Earlier this month, Trump threatened to shut down TikTok if its owners didn’t sell the business to a U.S. company by Sept. 15. Then, on Aug. 6, he signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting Americans from doing business with TikTok and another app, WeChat, which is also Chinese-owned, effective in 45 days.“I don’t mind whether it’s Microsoft or someone else, a big company, a secure company, a very American company buys it,” Trump told reporters on Aug. 3. “It’ll close down on Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal, so the Treasury of the United States gets a lot of money.”In an Aug. 19 speech in Arizona, Trump praised another possible bidder, Oracle.“Oracle is a great company,” said Trump during the speech. “I think its owner is a tremendous guy. He’s a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it.”Trump ordered TikTok to sell its U.S. assets after an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, which reviews acquisitions of American businesses by overseas investors for national security risk. Cfius found ByteDance’s 2017 purchase of the app Musical.ly and merger with TikTok did raise concerns and Trump’s order effectively called for a reversal of that transaction.Cfius will have to certify that a sale to a U.S. buyer resolves all outstanding national security concerns.“I guess Microsoft wants it and so does Oracle, and probably so do other people,” Trump told reporters earlier this month. “But they have to also make sure the United States is well compensated because we’re the ones making it possible. Very simple: We’re the ones making it possible. So our Treasury has to be very well compensated.”Cicilline said if a U.S. company buys TikTok, the purchase could give Facebook Inc. much-needed competition in the social media market and keep valuable data on American users out of the hands of Chinese authorities.“I think we have to obviously be conscious of the implications when that kind of data is collected by a foreign adversary,” Cicilline said, referring to TikTok. “I think it’s perfectly appropriate in reviewing a transaction to take into account the national security interests of the United States.”Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust panel of the House Judiciary Committee, has been investigating whether companies such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. are too dominant in the marketplace. Last month, the chief executives of the four U.S. technology giants appeared before the subcommittee to answer questions about whether they use their power to crush rivals.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Top Democrat Says Trump Remarks on TikTok Deal Are Inappropriate

2020-08-27,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok held a virtual town hall meeting with thousands of U.S. and European employees on Thursday to reassure them that they still have jobs and promised more clarity on the future of the besieged video-app soon, according to people familiar with details of the event.The meeting came after the surprise resignation of Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mayer. The former longtime Walt Disney Co. executive is leaving TikTok after only three months at the helm. In a letter to employees Wednesday, he cited the Trump administration’s push for the app’s Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., to sell its U.S. operations due to national security concerns. Many employees who were sleeping when Mayer sent a letter to staff late Wednesday woke up to the news reports, or were informed during early morning meetings.“As we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company,” he wrote in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg.Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have submitted bids to ByteDance for TikTok’s U.S. operations in a deal that could come within the week, people familiar with the matter said. Microsoft’s bid includes a partnership with Walmart Inc., which would also take a stake in the company and help TikTok expand its e-commerce operations.During the hour-long town hall, employees lobbed a stream of anonymous questions to interim TikTok chief Vanessa Pappas, general counsel Erich Andersen and Blake Chandlee, vice president of global business solutions.The executives acknowledged media reports of bids by Oracle and Microsoft-Walmart and assured employees that they will be able to tell them a lot more in the next couple of weeks. The town hall had already been scheduled for Thursday, but the company moved it a few hours earlier to address employee concerns.The executives answered questions about Mayer’s departure and whether the decision was mutual, striking a calm yet upbeat tone and telling people not to worry about their paychecks or let the corporate drama interrupt day-to-day operations, one person said.For weeks, chatter among TikTok employees about what some have begun to refer to as “D-Day,” or simply “Sept. 15” have popped up in video meetings and the company’s internal messaging app, Lark. The date was originally set by U.S. President Donald Trump for a potential ban on the app if it was not sold to an American buyer by then. But the president later issued a separate order with a 90-day deadline.Pappas has been scrolling through the Lark threads and responding to employees’ concerns in hopes of heading off any unsubstantiated rumors and calming fears.In an interview with Bloomberg last week, Pappas said she’s made clear to TikTok’s employees and business partners that the company strongly disagrees with the Trump administration’s stance and that TikTok will remain in the U.S. regardless of the threats to shut it down. She said the company had “multiple paths forward” depending on what happens.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Executives Reassure Employees After CEO Exit
2020-08-27,"TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer resigned as the head of the short-form video app on Wednesday, and a Wedbush analyst said it's a major setback for the beleaguered short-form video app as a standalone entity. TikTok's U.S. general manager Vanessa Pappas will replace Mayer on an interim basis.Wedbush On TikTok CEO's Exit: Mayer quit the company just months after joining on June 1, analyst Daniel Ives said in a Thursday note.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) buying TikTok would be like Christmas morning coming early for investors, especially at a valuation in the $35 billion to $40 billion range, or lower depending on negotiations, the analyst said.If navigated the right way, he said TikTok could reach a $200-billion valuation within a few years. Wedbush said it has an Outperform rating on TikTok. Mayer leaving at this juncture is additional evidence that TikTok and ByteDance know a sale of U.S. operations is a matter of when and not if, despite TikTok's court challenge, Ives said. &quot;We believe Mayer leaving is a huge blow to any prospects that TikTok had to trying to fight this battle and stay a standalone and is another indicator that TikTok's US Operations being sold eventually to Microsoft is likely on a path to being completed sooner rather than later given the Trump executive order.&quot;Trump's TikTok Order: Trump signed an executive order earlier this month that would effectively stifle TikTok's operations in the U.S. unless parent company ByteDance makes a sale within 45 days of signing the order.The president accused the company of siphoning off &quot;vast swaths of information&quot; from its users, and doing the biddings of the Chinese Communist Party.Oracle Interested In TikTok: With the 90-day deadline looming from the Trump administration for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. operations, it appears a handful of potential bidders besides Microsoft have entered the fray including Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Ives said. While Oracle is very interested in TikTok, the analyst said he continues to strongly believe it's Microsoft's deal to close at this point.See more from Benzinga  * TikTok Sale Looks Imminent As Microsoft Teams With Walmart, Oracle Finalizes Bid  * Why Anaplan's Stock Is Trading Higher Today  * Why Netflix's Stock Is Trading Higher Today(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-27,Kevin Mayer has quit his job as the chief executive of popular social media app TikTok after only three months in the role.,TikTok’s CEO Just Quit. Here’s Why.
2020-08-27,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mayer has resigned just months after taking the helm of the viral short video app, stepping out of the crossfire as the Trump administration targets the business owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd.Mayer told employees of his decision in an internal memo and a company spokeswoman confirmed his resignation. Vanessa Pappas, currently general manager of ByteDance’s prized international service, will take his place.Mayer’s departure adds to the turmoil engulfing the world’s largest startup, which is grappling with the forced sale of operations in the U.S., possible restrictions in the U.K. and an outright ban in India, TikTok’s largest market. ByteDance appointed Mayer in May to try and smooth relations with Washington, attempting to make the case that TikTok operates as a separate entity from its Beijing-based parent to assuage concerns about national security.Yet mere months later, the Trump administration forbade U.S. dealings with the viral video app and ordered its sale. That impending ban cast TikTok into the heart of worsening tensions between Beijing and Washington, which has leveled sanctions against a plethora of its fellow Chinese giants from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Huawei Technologies Co.“In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for,” Mayer said in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. “I understand that the role that I signed up for -- including running TikTok globally -- will look very different as a result of the U.S. administration’s action to push for a sell off of the U.S. business.”The executive left one of the top jobs at The Walt Disney Co. for TikTok. For more than a decade, he helped the world’s largest entertainment company strategize and expand its offerings. He provided the rationale for acquiring Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, and the entertainment assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. for $71 billion in March. A representative for the White House didn’t respond to a request for comment on Mayer’s departure, which the Financial Times first reported.Mayer “tried to reposition himself to ride the mobile content wave,” said Rich Greenfield at LightShed. “Unfortunately, the Trump administration appears to have made that impossible.”Read more: Kevin Mayer, Bob Iger’s Right-Hand Man at DisneyMayer’s role had been in question for weeks. Hired to run TikTok’s global operations, Mayer was instead pulled into a likely breakup of the business. Microsoft Corp. has confirmed it’s in negotiations to buy TikTok’s operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, while Oracle Corp. is also considering a bid, Bloomberg News has reported. Large venture capital and private equity firms including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic have billions of dollars on the line and are now angling for the best deal.On Thursday, ByteDance’s founder sought to reassure employees of the Chinese startup, which also operates AI-driven news service Toutiao and TikTok’s Chinese cousin Douyin. In an internal memo, the 37-year-old coder-by-training appeared to acknowledge the convulsions within his company, thanking workers for “shutting out the noise” and getting on with the job.“We are working quickly to find resolutions to the issues that we face globally, particularly in the U.S. and India,” ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming said in a separate memo obtained by Bloomberg announcing Mayer’s resignation.Mayer’s departure comes days after TikTok asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the fast-growing social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a U.S. courtroom. TikTok and its Chinese parent sued on Monday in federal court in Los Angeles to challenge an Aug. 6 order from President Donald Trump prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok. Trump says TikTok is a security risk for user data.The company said the president’s decision was made “for political reasons,” is unconstitutional and violates rights to due process. On Aug. 14, Trump ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets and said the U.S. should receive a cut of the proceeds. Other bidders potentially interested in the assets include Twitter Inc. The social media company is among U.S. tech firms that have explored possible bids, though it’s unclear how far those talks have gone, according to multiple people familiar with the deliberations.“We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin’s role would be going forward, and fully respect his decision,” the TikTok spokeswoman said in a separate statement.Read more: Oracle Said to be Weighing Bid for TikTok’s U.S. Business(Updates with analyst’s comment from the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok’s CEO Quits Months Into the Job After Trump’s Ban

2020-08-27,"There's been a flurry of TikTok  news today, and the flood doesn't seem to be letting up.  First was the announcement that Kevin Mayer, who joined the company just a bit more than three months ago, has stepped down overnight.  Walmart  has confirmed to multiple news outlets that it has expressed interest in teaming up with Microsoft in a bid for the fast-growing social app.","Walmart expresses interest in TikTok, teaming up with Microsoft"
2020-08-28,"Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) has cooled off a bit. After an absolutely breathtaking run this spring, FSLY stock has stabilized in recent weeks. For traders new to the company, it may seem like Fastly has lost its momentum.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com However, don't forget about how incredible the company's run has been in 2020. As of this writing, shares are up 347% year-to-date, even after the recent sell-off. Fastly is having good types of problems - namely that it set expectations extremely high and is struggling to keep up with the frenetic pace it set in the first half of 2020.Still, this a hyper-growth stock trading at a sky-high valuation, so even small signs of weakness can cause sizable corrections. And with Fastly, we now have two significant points of concern. The first is that Fastly's single largest customer is TikTok. Needless to say, that relationship is now fraught with risk. Secondly, FSLY stock is extremely expensive given its growth rate.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Will the ByteDance Business Keep Ticking?Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order forbidding American companies from doing business with ByteDance's social media network TikTok. If the order stands, TikTok will have to cease American operations by the end of September, and it will have a limited time to sell the business to a non-Chinese owner.So far, reportedly Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) are among the potential companies that may choose to buy TikTok from ByteDance. In the meantime, TikTok is filing a lawsuit to try to block the order. TikTok's chief executive officer (CEO) also just stepped down. Needless to say, it's a volatile situation at this point.  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to RunIn any case, this is a major potential pitfall for Fastly. TikTok makes up 12% of Fastly's revenues at the moment. Additionally, TikTok is Fastly's single largest customer. Losing 12% of revenues would be bad enough, if that should come to pass. Even worse, it would kill a large chunk of the growth thesis, as TikTok's bandwidth usage has exploded this year.Remember, folks plowed into FSLY stock on the idea that the novel coronavirus is accelerating the switch to digital hobbies and diversions. TikTok was, in that way, absolutely the perfect app for people bored and stuck at home. Fastly was able to use its logistical strengths to deliver a great product to TikTok and help it scale this spring. Now, however, that's all hanging in the balance. Plenty of Other Great ClientsWhile it's a distinct possibility that Fastly will lose the TikTok account, that's hardly the only growth avenue. Fastly's stock has soared in tandem with that of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), one of its key clients. Other well-known brands on Fastly include Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) and Microsoft's GitHub.Thus, there is plenty of life for Fastly beyond TikTok. And while losing the stay-at-home tailwind will certainly hit the growth rate, the longer-term trajectory around rising bandwidth usage and infrastructure needs isn't going anywhere.Fastly has a well-liked product in a big growth market. That's a healthy situation for long-term investors. Fastly Is Richly PricedFSLY stock is selling for a stunning 40 times trailing revenues and more than 25 times forward sales. These are simply mind-blowing figures. Even recently, more than 20 times sales was considered too expensive in nearly all cases.Maybe you could justify this sort of otherworldly valuation if Fastly was putting up triple-digit revenue growth. But revenue is growing at just 62% now and set for a sharp slowdown going forward. To be clear, I'm not knocking 62% growth - that's obviously excellent business performance. But when you see a stock at 40 times sales, usually they're well into triple-digit revenue growth, rather than down here.Particularly with TikTok potentially leaving and the tailwind from the pandemic fading, it's hard to see what traders are expecting here.It's also worth noting that Fastly's gross margins are significantly lower than most software stock peers. Some of Fastly's services are something of a commodity, and thus won't bring in the same level of monopoly profits as you'd get from more exclusive technology. These factors point to a significantly lower price-sales ratio going forward. The Verdict on FSLY StockA month ago, I warned that traders should slow down in regards to Fastly. The stock's ramp this spring was simply too much, too soon. And sure enough, since then, shares have since leveled off in the $80 to $90 range. That's probably about right given what we know now.It remains a red-hot market for software-as-a-service stocks. And Fastly continues to have powerful secular tailwinds, even as the specific work-from-home catalyst starts to fade.Still, particularly with the uncertainty around TikTok, it seems that Fastly may have topped out for the intermediate future.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held SPOT stock.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

2020-08-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is teaming up with Walmart Inc. in a contest against Oracle Corp. to buy the U.S. assets of the popular video-sharing app TikTok from China’s ByteDance Ltd.Oracle and Microsoft, with its new partner, both submitted bids in a deal that could come within the week, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Walmart would also own a stake in a newly spun off TikTok business, alongside Microsoft, the people said.Competing offers have been made in what augurs the closing process of a deal, although it will take longer for final details to be worked out, one person said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations.Walmart confirmed in an email that it is in “partnership” with Microsoft in its pursuit of TikTok, a move to bolster the retailer’s third-party marketplace and nascent advertising arm. A Walmart-Microsoft bid would “meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators,” Walmart said. TikTok and Microsoft declined to comment, while Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In China and other countries, ByteDance’s apps offer e-commerce features along with video clips, which haven’t been available in the U.S. so far. Adding Walmart to the deal would enable the retail giant to play that role for the U.S. TikTok app, said a person familiar with the planning. Microsoft and Walmart are already collaborating on cloud applications, brought together by mutual rivalry with Amazon.com Inc., which is the biggest cloud-infrastructure software seller, followed by Microsoft.The White House has been pushing for a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations due to concerns over its ties to China and implications for national security. Microsoft had emerged as the top contender to buy the company, announcing in a blog post earlier this month that it was in talks to acquire TikTok’s business in the U.S., New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Microsoft’s discussions are now centered around TikTok’s U.S. business, narrowing the scope from its original plans to include the three other countries, according to two people familiar with the matter.While ByteDance is asking about $30 billion for TikTok in the U.S., bidders have not been willing to offer that amount, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the negotiations.Executive OrderU.S. President Donald Trump has issued an executive order with a mid-September deadline for TikTok to be sold to an American company or prohibit U.S. people and companies from doing business with the app. The announcement set off a flurry of interest from other companies. A later order required ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. assets within 90 days. It’s not clear whether other parties have entered the process or plan to bid.The departure Wednesday of TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer, after less than three months at the company, suggests a deal is imminent. Mayer had left a long career at Walt Disney Co. to join TikTok in June. Mayer’s appointment was held up as an example of how the company was distancing itself from its Chinese roots and was seen as a way to smooth relations with Washington.“As we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company,” Mayer said in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. “In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for.”In a town hall with TikTok’s U.S. and European employees on Thursday, executives reassured employees that they will know more in the next couple of weeks, according to people familiar with the company who were not authorized to speak publicly.Analysts and bankers have pegged the value of TikTok’s U.S. business anywhere from $20 billion to $50 billion, a wide range that reflects the complexity involved in separating TikTok’s American and global businesses, in determining a reliable number of users, and how revenue breaks out just for the markets at stake in the deal.Public ScrutinyWith some 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. and a unique platform for making and sharing short videos, TikTok has drawn interest from an array of companies. Google parent Alphabet Inc. weighed pursuing a stake as part of a coalition that later came unraveled, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg this month. Walmart, it turns out, was part of that group, alongside SoftBank Group Corp., some of the people said Thursday. SoftBank, led by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, already owns a stake in ByteDance.Representatives of Alphabet and SoftBank declined to comment. CNBC previously reported Walmart’s involvement with the Google grouping.Aside from being crowded, the negotiations around TikTok have also become unusually public.Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who has come out against a potential sale to Microsoft and advocated banning TikTok completely, has been at odds with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who wants the app sold, according to a person familiar with the deliberations within the White House. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment. Navarro said there were “no tensions whatsoever” between himself and Mnuchin.Mnuchin had come around to support a TikTok purchase by Oracle, this person said, before Walmart entered the picture. The person asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.It’s unclear whether the entry of Walmart into deal negotiations changes the administration’s views on which suitor is best positioned to satisfy the government’s national security concerns.The move to ban TikTok or force a deal has drawn rebukes from Democrats. David Cicilline, the U.S. representative leading a high-profile antitrust investigation into Silicon Valley’s biggest companies, said in an interview this week that the government should embrace challengers to Facebook Inc., not hinder them. “We need more competition in this space,” he said. “What we don’t need is the president of the United States injecting himself into a transaction.”Deal terms would also have to be palatable to the Chinese government, which has criticized the Trump administration for its actions against TikTok. Microsoft will want to avoid going so low on its proposed price that China feels ripped off, a person familiar with the matter said.White KnightWalmart’s partnering with Microsoft is the “final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements” a successful acquisition of TikTok’s U.S. operations for $35 billion to $40 billion, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors. He called Microsoft the “only true white knight.”Oracle has proposed a deal of $20 billion in cash and stock, according to a report in Hollywood publication The Wrap. Oracle’s offer would be made up of $10 billion in cash and $10 billion in Oracle stock plus 50% of annual TikTok profit would flow back to ByteDance for two years, one unidentified person told The Wrap.The deal could be complicated by a lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from banning the app, a move that many of ByteDance’s investors sought to stop. Executives at General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, two major backers of ByteDance, tried unsuccessfully to dissuade Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming from moving forward with the lawsuit, people familiar with the matter said.They were concerned, in part, that challenging Trump would backfire and that the administration would respond by enacting additional roadblocks to completing a sale of the TikTok business, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital declined to comment.Bill Ford, CEO of General Atlantic, and Doug Leone, a managing partner at Sequoia Capital, have been acting as emissaries to the Trump administration on behalf of the Chinese company. Their main mission is to avert a ban by securing a deal, said the people. Even with Microsoft’s and Oracle’s bids submitted, they may need an extension beyond the deadline set by the president to work out details.But ByteDance’s legal team was eager for a fight, and Zhang was happy to oblige, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.Investor ConcernsThe Trump administration hasn’t been particularly eager to embrace Leone’s overtures, either. Leone has sought to develop relationships with Mnuchin and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, people familiar with the discussions have said. One official in Washington has described Leone as overconfident and aloof to the problems Sequoia’s large presence in China presents to the administration.However, the investors’ concerns were warranted, said two officials in Washington who asked not to be identified amid the litigation. The lawsuit is likely to have repercussions on the administration’s leniency toward any proposed deal, they said. Oracle has a decent shot of winning approval, two officials said, thanks to a public endorsement by Trump, the president’s relationship with its top executives and a collaboration between the company and the administration on 5G mobile infrastructure.Navarro echoed that endorsement Wednesday during an appearance on Fox News.“If you look at Microsoft versus Oracle, the one thing that separates the two companies with respect to national security is that Microsoft has a large footprint in China,” Navarro said. “Oracle on the other hand has a strong reputation of really putting a great firewall between its operations and China and that’s an important thing.”(Updates with details on SoftBank’s involvement in possible deal in 13th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft, Walmart Offer Joint TikTok Bid, Vying With Oracle"
2020-08-28,"Recent developments appear to have shown that my views on Fastly (NASDAQ:FSLY) were correct. As a result, I remain upbeat on FSLY stock.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com In my Aug. 13 column on Fastly, I predicted that either Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or a different American company would buy TikTok.As I noted in the previous piece, Fastly said that the app &quot;accounted 12% of its revenue in the first half&quot; of the year. I also wrote that &quot;the worries about Fastly's revenue from TikTok are overdone…{and} Fastly continues to effectively innovate and looks poised to be a huge disruptor.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips TikTok Looks Set to Be Acquired SoonOn Aug. 27, CNBC reported that TikTok &quot;is nearing an agreement to sell its U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand operations.&quot;  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to Run The app is in talks with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft about such a deal, the business news channel reported, citing unnamed sources. TikTok could unveil the sale &quot;as soon as&quot; the week of Aug. 31, CNBC added.In a sign that a deal is imminent, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer resigned, The Financial Times reported on Aug. 27. Mayer's departure suggests that a deal is close because, given the size of Microsoft  and Oracle and the vast experience of their executives, either company would probably want to replace Mayer with an internal manager. An Analyst Is Upbeat on Fastly's TechnologyResearch firm Raymond James shares my optimism about Fastly's technology. After meeting with Fastly's CFO recently, the firm upgraded the shares to &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;market perform,&quot; TheStreet reported on Aug. 24. According to the story, Fastly's superior platform and approach has made it sustainable.In other words Fastly technology appears to be better than that of its competitors, Raymond James believes.An analyst at Raymond James, Robert Majek, estimates that &quot;the $6 billion content-delivery market&quot; will increase around 9%-13% annually, and he noted that Fastly currently only controls about 5% of the sector at this point.According to Barron's, the analyst added, &quot;We don't believe investors fully appreciate the duration and durability of the company's growth profile… Compute@Edge and security that should&quot; enable the company's growth to beat analysts' average estimates and &quot;justify current valuation levels&quot; of FSLY stock.Fastly emphasized the importance of Compute@Edge and its security systems on its second-quarter earnings conference call.As I've said before, Computer@Edge is revolutionary. It allows e-commerce vendors to have the information they need closer to the devices using it, rather than stores centrally.The company added that its security solutions have been enhanced by its large investments and by the fact that it utilizes only one network. Fastly's Valuation Isn't That HighMuch has been made of the allegedly high valuation of FSLY stock. Moreover, some investors may be concerned that Fastly is nearing Raymond James' price target of $100.But in my previous column, I noted that Shopify (NYSE:SHOP),  Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) all had meaningfully higher price-sales valuations than Fastly.In an Aug. 24 column, a Seeking Alpha columnist Michael Wiggins De Oliveira wrote that the hares were &quot;cheaply valued.&quot; He pointed out that Fastly's revenue growth and valuation were both very similar to those of its competitor, Cloudfare (NYSE:NET).&quot;Cloudflare is burning through significantly more free cash flow than Fastly, despite having more revenues to offset its losses with,&quot; he wrote. The Bottom Line on FSLY StockAs I predicted, worries about TikTok disappearing from the U.S. appear to have been overdone, and my belief about the superiority of Fastly's technology has been somewhat validated by Raymond James' report.Meanwhile, it's clear that the valuation of FSLY stock is not as overvalued as some believe. Given these points, I continue to recommend that investors buy the shares.As of this writing, the author owned shares of FSLY stock.

2020-08-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Centricus Asset Management Ltd. and Triller Inc. are seeking to buy TikTok’s operations in the U.S. and several other countries from ByteDance Ltd. for $20 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.Investors led by London-based Centricus will partner with U.S.-based Triller, another video and music-based social networking app, which would have a minority stake in a newly proposed joint entity, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations.Centricus and Triller submitted their bid to Beijing-based ByteDance, this person said, for TikTok’s assets in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and India. The proposal would be made up of $10 billion in cash up front and $10 billion in profit-sharing from the resulting venture, the person said.The offer would rival those from more established tech industry players, including Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. Walmart Inc. said on Thursday that it has joined Microsoft’s bid.When asked about a Centricus and Triller bid, a TikTok spokesman replied, “What’s Triller?” Another spokesperson called the potential deal “preposterous.”A representative for Centricus confirmed the company had made an offer for TikTok assets in the U.S. and some other countries. A spokesperson for Triller didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.President Donald Trump this month threatened to ban the TikTok app in the U.S. and then ordered ByteDance sell its U.S. assets, citing national security concerns. Trump has issued an executive order with a mid-September deadline for TikTok to be sold or be barred in the U.S. A later order required ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. assets within 90 days. The administration is also demanding that the buyer of TikTok’s U.S. business be an American company, which makes it unclear how a Centricus bid will be received, even with Triller involved.Centricus was founded in 2016 by former investment bankers Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu, according to its website.

2020-08-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Less than two days after Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. submitted rival bids to China’s ByteDance Ltd. to acquire TikTok’s U.S. business, a dark-horse possible third bidder emerged as the two software makers waited for a response to their offers. On Friday, Centricus Asset Management Ltd. and Triller Inc. made a last-minute pitch to buy TikTok’s operations in several countries for $20 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.Centricus and Triller submitted their bid to Beijing-based ByteDance, this person said, for TikTok’s assets in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and India, including $10 billion in cash up front and $10 billion in profit-sharing from the resulting venture, the person said. A representative for Centricus confirmed the company had made an offer, while a TikTok spokeswoman pushed back on that potential deal, calling it “preposterous.”Under the expectant watch of executives and government officials from Seattle and Silicon Valley to Arkansas and Washington, ByteDance’s decision on which bid to choose — or whether to sell the app’s assets at all — could come as soon as this weekend, a person familiar with that company’s thinking said.Here’s what we know:Two big-tech bidders submitted proposals earlier in the week — Oracle and Microsoft, whose bid is backed by retail giant Walmart Inc. Both suitors are waiting for ByteDance to enter final-stage negotiations with one of them, and then to seek White House approval for a deal. ByteDance may also ask both bidders for revisions before making a decision, according to a person familiar with the matter. Walmart is contributing funds to Microsoft’s offer in exchange for a minority stake in TikTok’s U.S. business should that bid succeed, according to two people, who asked not to be named discussing private negotiations. Walmart had previously attempted to join a group of  bidders along with Alphabet Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp., but switched to Microsoft when that group opted not to make an offer, the people said. While ByteDance is asking about $30 billion for TikTok in the U.S., bidders haven’t been willing to offer that amount, the Wall Street Journal  reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the negotiations. The deal could be complicated by a TikTok seeking to block the Trump administration from banning the app, a move that many of ByteDance’s investors sought to stop. Executives at General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, two major backers of ByteDance, tried unsuccessfully to dissuade Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming from moving forward with the lawsuit, people familiar with the matter said, in part because they were concerned that challenging President Donald Trump could backfire. One further potential wrinkle: China's Ministry of Commerce on Friday announced new restrictions on artificial intelligence tech exports, including personalized content recommendations. China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted a trade expert as saying that ByteDance should study the new export list and &quot;seriously and cautiously&quot; consider whether it should halt negotiations. On Wednesday, TikTok Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mayer said he was departing the company after less than three months, suggesting a deal is imminent. In an internal memo announcing his exit, he said, “we expect to reach a resolution very soon.” There’s a mid-September deadline on Trump’s executive order for TikTok’s U.S. business to be sold to an American company, or he will prohibit U.S. people and companies from doing business with the app. The initial announcement set off a flurry of interest from other companies. A later order requires ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. assets within 90 days. According to Trump’s Aug. 14 order, ByteDance must notify Cfius of the buyer and give the panel an opportunity to review the sale. Analysts and bankers have pegged the value of TikTok’s U.S. business anywhere from $20 billion to $50 billion, a wide range that reflects the complexity involved in separating TikTok’s American and global businesses, in determining a reliable number of users, and how revenue breaks out for the markets at stake in the deal.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Centricus’s 11th-Hour Bid Adds Intrigue to Waiting Game on TikTok

Government permits will be required for overseas transfers to “safeguard national economic security,” it said.The new restrictions cover technologies ByteDance uses in TikTok and will require the company to seek government approval for any deal, according to the person, asking not to be identified because the details aren’t public. The new rule is aimed at delaying the sale and is not an outright ban, the person said.President Donald Trump’s administration has said ByteDance must sell the U.S. operations of its popular video-sharing app because of alleged national security risks. Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. have submitted rival bids to ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s U.S. business, while Centricus Asset Management Ltd. and Triller Inc. were said to have made a last-minute pitch on Friday to buy TikTok’s operations in several countries for $20 billion.China’s foreign ministry and commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.ByteDance said in a statement the company was aware of the new restrictions and would “strictly comply with” the Chinese regulations on technology exports. The company’s executives are working to understand the new rule, and the attempt to please two governments that are already at odds could make logistics for any deal more challenging, according to a person familiar with the situation.ByteDance should study the new export list and “seriously and cautiously” consider whether it should halt negotiations, Cui Fan, a trade expert and professor at Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics, told the official Xinhua News Agency.Additional approval in Beijing is likely to delay and could undermine any transaction. Because the Chinese government review will take time, the TikTok deal may be delayed until after the U.S. elections in November, the person familiar said.The revised rules would cover cross-border transfers of restricted technologies even within the same company, while the impact and consequences of failing to make appropriate applications would be very different if an international business is spun off, Cui said separately in an interview with Bloomberg.Centricus’ 11th-Hour Bid Adds Intrigue to TikTok Waiting GameTechnologies related to drones and to some genetic engineering methods and procedures were also added to the revised export-control list while others in areas like medical equipment were removed. The revisions are meant to promote China’s technological advancement and international cooperation, and “safeguard national economic security,” a commerce ministry representative said in a separate statement on Friday.Technology exports encompass various transfers out of China including via trade, investment and patents, according to the statement.

2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Imagine a bidder wanting to buy KFC, but being told the deal might not include the Colonel’s 11 secret herbs and spices. That’s effectively what Beijing has told the list of U.S. companies keen to purchase short-video app TikTok: The key ingredients may be out of reach. At first it looked like the Trump administration had it all figured out. ByteDance Inc., it decided, was a risk to national security and the Chinese company’s main product for international markets had to be sold. For reasons that remain confounding, Satya Nadella entered the fray and Microsoft Corp. put in a bid. Soon, suitors were apparently lining up to buy the hip new product that claims 100 million U.S. downloads. A short deadline — Sept. 15 — helped build a sense of urgency. TikTok is essentially going through a forced sale.Then Beijing stepped in. China’s Commerce Ministry added new items to its list of export controls late Friday. Now, artificial intelligence interface technologies such as speech and text recognition, as well as methods to analyze data and make personalized content recommendations, are matters of national security.That means ByteDance will need Chinese government approval to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations, Bloomberg News reported Sunday; a person familiar with the matter said the new rule is aimed at delaying the sale, not an outright ban. But with AI and its content recommendation engine among the key ingredients of the company’s success, Beijing becomes the arbiter of TikTok’s fate. Not the U.S. administration. As much as critics — including U.S. senators and the secretary of state —  express concern about the data TikTok collects, it’s really the algorithms that matter most to the company, and anyone who buys it. These are the magic formulae that tell the app which data points will predict future behavior, and keep you staring at the phone longer. If you linger on hip-hop videos and swipe past cooking tips, then chances are you’ll be seeing more lip-synced DJ Khalid and fewer turkey-stuffing recipes. Speech and text recognition allow TikTok to peer deeper into content to extract a better sense of what’s being said and written.Facebook Inc., Snap Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are among those pouring billions of dollars into better predicting user behavior. This is the bread and butter of search-engine results and timeline feeds, helping them sell more-targeted ads at higher prices. Notice that Google tends to return better results than Bing, despite having access to the same pool of data (the entire internet!), and you get a sense of why algorithms matter.(1)TikTok’s algos are gold. At least, that’s what bidders seem to think.And it looks like Beijing agrees. Effectively, the Chinese government is saying, “You wanna buy TikTok? Go ahead, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get your hands on the secret sauce.” This development will surely send Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and everyone else back to their bankers, and lawyers, trying to figure out what TikTok would be worth without those algorithms. ByteDance, for its part, will need to work out what it can and cannot throw into the package it’s being forced to sell. That’s not easy.At worst, this may require trawling through millions of lines of code to sort out whether content is allowable or forbidden. It’s not black and white. What one person considers AI may be viewed by another as mundane software technology. As bidders rush to guess what Beijing may allow them to buy, and reassess whether they want to make an offer, some may simply conclude that it’s too fraught with uncertainty. Any final transaction will surely be couched with provisions about what they’ll be able to obtain — management’s fiduciary duty to shareholders requires no less.This move puts the ball back in Donald Trump’s court. The U.S. president may need to contend with the real possibility that TikTok doesn’t find a buyer, and he’ll have to decide whether one of the nation’s most popular products should be removed from the app store of its most valuable company.Trump may think that strong-arming China will boost his re-election chances, but being outplayed could backfire. It’s also possible that if TikTok ends up being banned altogether, there will be a backlash by the app’s fans.With U.S.-China trade talks inching slowly forward, Beijing has found itself a bargaining chip. Whether or not Trump is found to be bluffing, both sides now think they have the stronger hand.(Updates with rule aimed at delaying sale, not an outright ban. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of herbs and spices in the KFC recipe.)(1) It's important to remember that the two search engines also create, and use, their own data based on user behavior.

2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Zhang Yiming’s plan to sell the U.S. operations of his short-video app TikTok to avoid a shutdown was thrown into jeopardy after China asserted authority over a deal already under scrutiny by the Trump administration.Beijing on Friday added uncertainty to already thorny negotiations over the sale of ByteDance Ltd.’s prized asset, claiming the ability to block a sale to foreign suitors Microsoft Corp. or Oracle Corp. with tighter restrictions on artificial intelligence exports. The commerce ministry added speech and text recognition and personalized recommendations to a list of products that require approval before they’re sold abroad.These new areas cover the very technologies ByteDance employed to make TikTok a viral teen sensation from America to India. The company is now required to seek the government’s sign-off on any deal, though it doesn’t mean an outright ban, according to a person familiar with the matter. TikTok is dissecting the new regulations and thinks they will make securing a deal more difficult, a second person familiar with the matter said.Shares of Oracle and Microsoft were each down more than 1% in early trading Monday. Walmart Inc., which has said it will partner with Microsoft on a bid, was down about 2%.For China, the move helps gain leverage to prevent what state-run media called the “theft” of technology while underscoring to the U.S. it has intellectual property worth protecting. It also increases the likelihood a deal could get held up and Trump will then move ahead with a TikTok ban ahead of November’s election, depriving millions of teenagers of any updates to the app though they may still be able to use the current version.“AI is a foundational technology and is one of the key sectors that China aims to lead, competing with the U.S.,” said Rebecca Fannin, founder of Silicon Dragon Ventures. “This pushback by Beijing could be seen as part of the growing U.S.-China tensions and tech cold war.”China’s opaque regulations introduce more unknowns into an already delicate process involving multiple corporations, agencies and federal court, all converging days before Donald Trump’s executive order banning TikTok takes effect ahead of November elections. It could take up to 30 days for ByteDance to get the greenlight to export AI, said Zhaokang Jiang, a trade attorney and managing partner of GSC Potomac.Read more: ByteDance Said to Need China Nod for TikTok Sale Under New RulesThe involvement of Beijing, which has denounced Trump administration bans on TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat, muddies the waters as American corporations and investors vie to hammer out a deal by the Trump administration’s deadline. Microsoft and Oracle have submitted rival bids to acquire TikTok’s U.S. business, while Centricus Asset Management Ltd. and Triller Inc. made a last-minute pitch on Friday to buy TikTok’s operations in several countries for $20 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.“We’ve been seeing U.S. restrictions on China on a daily basis. We can’t expect China to have no response at all,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization.China’s Foreign Ministry criticized the American government’s moves again on Monday.“We are opposed to the U.S. abusing the national security concept and state power to suppress specific businesses of other countries,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing. “The U.S.’s attempt to take economic bullying and political manipulation against non-American companies, whether it is politically coerced transaction or government enforced transaction, is no different from plundering.”Beijing’s new curbs on technology mirrors American sanctions against the sale of U.S. software or circuitry to a plethora of Chinese firms. Apart from giving it a say in any imminent deal, the seemingly innocuous changes provide another bargaining chip in the U.S.-China tech cold war.“Beijing’s responses to Washington over the past five months have largely been designed to appear retaliatory, but are in fact carefully calibrated to place Beijing on equal footing with the U.S. while not escalating tensions — yet,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of digital research at consultancy Trivium in Beijing. “This move is no exception: it may give Beijing more equal footing so that decisions can’t be made by the U.S. unilaterally, but doesn’t necessarily indicate Beijing will move to nix the deal.”ByteDance has become one of several Chinese companies at the heart of Washington-Beijing tensions. Trump accuses the company’s app of being a threat to national security, echoing charges against telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. The White House has now ordered Zhang’s company to sell the app’s operations in the U.S. and several other countries, with a valuation estimated at $20 billion to $50 billion.Read more: Centricus’ 11th-Hour Bid Adds Intrigue to TikTok Waiting GameIt’s unclear how the bidding process will now play out. Zhang has said the company, whose TikTok is also banned in India, is working rapidly to resolve its geopolitical headaches. But Beijing’s insertion into the process raises the chances that it may just decide to veto or at least delay a deal, with unknown ramifications.Those outcomes may appeal to Zhang, the 37-year-old founder who built ByteDance into the most valuable startup in the world with a $140 billion valuation, according to CB Insights. He had long resisted giving up control of TikTok because he thinks the service is evolving into one of a handful of major online advertising businesses, alongside Facebook Inc. and Google.His instincts may be to fight: He has scrapped with authorities in Beijing over politically sensitive content and with Chinese publishers over allegations of copyright infringement.TikTok has asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the fast-growing social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a U.S. courtroom.Read more: Combative TikTok Founder Races to Save App Before Trump BanEven before the latest regulations, Microsoft or any other American owner faced the difficult task of hiving off TikTok U.S. from ByteDance’s much larger Chinese business.ByteDance runs TikTok in various regions, often employing code from Musical.ly, the progenitor to the app that ByteDance acquired in 2017. With ByteDance engineers in China still working on TikTok, it’s unclear how Microsoft could split the code and the underlying technology to ensure it’s free from Chinese interference -- or determine the value of a standalone operation that may not have access to ByteDance’s technical wizardry.The rule revised Friday would cover cross-border transfers of restricted technologies even within the same company, while the impact and consequences of failing to make appropriate applications would be very different if an international business is spun off, said Cui Fan, a trade expert who’s a professor at Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics.“We are studying the new regulations that were released Friday.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $57.95.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $60.00  * Volume: 849  * Open Interest: 8205Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Contracts that have been traded, but not closed by a counter-party, are called open interest. A purchased contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for the option.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * A Look Into Oracle's Price Over Earnings  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: Oracle  * ROCE Insights For Oracle(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-01,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’s told people involved in the sale of the U.S. assets of ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok that the deal must be struck by Sept. 15 and the federal government must be “well compensated,” or the service will be shut down.“I told them they have until Sept. 15 to make a deal -- after that we close it up in this country,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin. “I said the United States has to be compensated, well compensated.”It remains unclear how the U.S. would collect compensation from the sale of TikTok. The president said last month that the popular video streaming app’s U.S. operation had to be sold because its Chinese ownership makes it a national security threat.TikTok has become a flashpoint for U.S. tensions with China. Trump has stepped up his attacks on the video app as his administration increases pressure on China ahead of the November presidential election. Then China on Friday imposed restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies like speech and text recognition, throwing the potential sale into jeopardy. The restrictions will likely make it harder for ByteDance to get government approval for any deal.“It’s difficult to tell now whether a deal will happen,” said Doug Barry, senior director of communications at the US-China Business Council. “Both countries want to dominate the key technologies of the future.”Trump believes that the U.S. deserves compensation for resolving the national security threat posed by TikTok and the administration is looking at ways to extract a payment from any deal that’s struck, according to a person familiar with the matter. Another person said it’s unclear what Trump means when he refers to compensation in any deal, and that it would be the Treasury Department’s job to figure out how to make it work. Both people asked not to be named discussing non-public deliberations.Microsoft Corp. has teamed up with Walmart Inc. to bid for TikTok’s U.S. assets and they’re vying against a competing offer from Oracle Corp.White House staff have looked at collecting the money from compliance costs, according to one person familiar with the matter.The U.S. assesses fees associated with deals under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which investigates overseas acquisitions of U.S. businesses. But those charges -- set on a sliding scale and no higher than $300,000 -- appear to fall short of what Trump has demanded.Microsoft declined to comment. The White House, TikTok and Oracle didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Microsoft committed in a blog post to “providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.” But that language referred to ordinary tax revenue and job creation, according to a person familiar with the matter.Now ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming is reconsidering his options and weighing the implications of Beijing’s involvement, according to people familiar with the matter. The company’s regulatory team and deal negotiators are huddling to discuss whether it’s still possible to craft a sale that can win approval from both governments, an acquirer, venture investors and ByteDance itself.Trump has the authority under U.S. law to block foreign acquisitions of American businesses on national security grounds. The administration’s order requiring the TikTok sale stems from ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, which operated in the U.S. and was merged with TikTok.Trump on Aug. 14 ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok in the U.S. within 90 days, citing risks to American national security. That followed an Aug. 6 order effectively banning the app in the U.S. within 45 days. TikTok has sued the administration to block the ban, arguing the move is unconstitutional and was driven by politics.The order on the ban cited China’s access to data collected from the app, including location and browsing data. TikTok, a platform for creating and sharing short videos, has grown rapidly in the U.S. from about 11 million monthly active users in January 2018 to 100 million today, according to the company. Global usage has risen to almost 2 billion from 55 million in January 2018, it said.“This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information -- potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,” the Aug. 6 order said.(Updates with comment from US-China council in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Insists on Compensation for U.S. in Any TikTok Sale

Microsoft is working on its bid with Walmart Inc., while Oracle has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital.But Beijing’s last-minute entry into the process raises the odds that Zhang will hold on to the U.S. operation beyond the stated American deadlines or even back out of a deal altogether. It’s likely the need for approval in Washington and Beijing -- along with the already complex negotiations -- will push any final deal beyond the November elections in the U.S. in any case, a person familiar with the matter has said.“I’m not sure price matters as much as pride,” said Rebecca Fannin, author of Tech Titans of China, and founder of Silicon Dragon Ventures. “From the start, Zhang wanted to build a global company. Without the U.S. market, he can’t fulfill those ambitions. He’s a maverick, fiercely independent-minded entrepreneur. He may just decide not to do the deal at all.”China Throws a Wrench Into Trump’s Plan to Force TikTok SaleTalks are fluid and it’s still possible Zhang will proceed with a sale, the people said. He could also negotiate a deal with an acquirer, then not complete the transaction because of government demands.The 37-year-old coder-by-training is something of a lone wolf in China’s tech industry, refusing to take money from rainmakers Tencent Holdings Ltd. or Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. He endured a succession of crackdowns yet managed to groom Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese cousin, into a rising internet star in the country. A fighter by nature, Zhang has several reasons to resist a TikTok sale in the clash with Trump.He and his company don’t need the money. Privately held ByteDance is already worth $140 billion, according to startup tracker CB Insights, and is said to have generated more than $3 billion of net profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019. Investment bankers had begun pitching Zhang’s team on going public in China or Hong Kong, even amid growing scrutiny in the U.S.Local demand for initial public offerings from technology companies is white-hot, with first-time share sales likely to surpass the heights of the dot-com bubble. Zhang stands to make billions no matter what happens with Trump.Just as important, if he sells the U.S. business, he can never get it back. Zhang would be relinquishing control over an asset that boasts upwards of a 100 million users in the U.S. and is on the cusp of monetizing that base. If TikTok gets banned in the U.S., the immediate outcome is it vanishes from Apple and Google app stores and software updates halt. Depending on how the U.S. Commerce Dept. defines Trump’s executive order, the sanctions could also cut off TikTok’s access to the local cloud services vital to maintaining data and streaming service.But industrious American teens can still side-load the app, working around domestic restrictions to get software from abroad. In the meantime, TikTok can keep operating in the rest of the world (apart from India, where it is already banned) and build up the business further. It also leaves open the possibility of re-entering the U.S. if political dynamics change.Separately, ByteDance is taking advantage of U.S. courts to see if it can stall Trump’s ban. Come November, there could be a new administration in power that may not regard shuttering TikTok as a high priority, not when the U.S. economy is reeling and Washington battles Beijing on a number of other geopolitical fronts from the South China Sea to trade and Taiwan.“Zhang is betting on a court injunction to get the case past deadline and hopefully even past the Trump presidency,” said Xiaomeng Lu, a senior analyst, geo-technology for the Eurasia Group. “His last hope is that the U.S. legal system still functions as a guard rail when the white house malfunctions.”Beijing’s involvement could end up benefiting Zhang. China’s assertion that its regulators will weigh in on any TikTok asset sale could give Zhang a possible out, said Ding Chenling, a tech entrepreneur who said he has known the ByteDance founder for a half-decade. It could take up to 30 days for Beijing to greenlight ByteDance’s application to sell tech to a foreign acquirer, which means it may well pass Trump’s target for banning TikTok.“He thought that by making a promise to follow international standards or rules he would be able to escape the regulation or the kind of pressure from the American government,” said Ding. “But I think now he realizes he might have been wrong and that if he doesn’t want to sell the company, the only one who can help him is the Chinese government -- which is what he’s tried to avoid the past few years.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Chief Reconsiders TikTok Options After New China Rules

2020-09-02,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is debating the scope and effective date of its bans on Chinese social media apps WeChat and TikTok and will make its decisions public later this month, according to people familiar with the matter.The Commerce Department, which will implement the bans on national security grounds, is drafting documents to clarify the specific transactions that will be prohibited between the Chinese companies and U.S. businesses -- and when those prohibitions will take effect, the people said.The decisions will be made public in the Federal Register around Sept. 20, said one of the people close to the discussions who asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. It’s not clear whether the bans will go into effect upon that publication, or whether there will be a transition period to give companies time to comply.Details on how the ban on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat will work are key to the bottom line of U.S. companies that do business with the Chinese firm. At stake is whether the restrictions, which President Donald Trump first announced on Aug. 6, will apply just to U.S. transactions or also extend to operations globally, which could cut into sales across a wide swath of American business.The Sept. 20 date comes at the end of the 45-day timeframe laid out in that initial order.While some U.S. officials have signaled to the business community that their China operations won’t be impacted, Bloomberg has reported that there are conflicting views between members of Trump’s cabinet and the final outcome isn’t certain.Transition PeriodCompanies have been pressing the administration to clarify whether they will be granted a transition period before the ban takes effect or if a Sept. 20 announcement becomes effective immediately.The ban’s scope and timeline are connected, according to one of the people. For example, if the administration were to apply the restrictions broadly to any Tencent dealings, including its games, companies would have a longer period to comply. If the ban is narrow, companies may get less time or no transition period at all, the person said.Ultimately, the final decision on whether to extend the ban outside the U.S. lies with Trump, according to the people familiar. A Commerce Department official said the agency doesn’t comment on internal deliberations.Company ReactionThe administration is taking into account feedback from companies and aims to craft clear guidance to avoid unintended consequences, one of the people said.If the order applies to American companies operating in China and American citizens there in addition to transactions in the U.S., it will hinder the competitiveness of U.S. firms and their ability to communicate in China, according to an Aug. 26 member survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.Almost half of the member firms that participated said they’d see lower revenues and 11.3% of them predicted the declines would be greater than 30%.Separately, Trump has directed TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. to spin off its U.S. operations by mid-September to avoid being banned in the U.S. ByteDance is reviewing bids from American firms, including Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp., which has teamed up with Walmart Inc. Any sale has to satisfy the Trump administration’s national security concerns, including around data collection and privacy.The president has the option not to impose a ban on Sept. 20 if TikTok addresses the national security risks outlined in the initial executive order, one person said, which could include selling its U.S. operations to an approved buyer.White House trade adviser Peter Navarro this week reiterated both apps were national security threats and said “there will be others” the administration will go after.On conference calls with large U.S. technology companies last week, Robert Blair, who is leading the interagency effort for Commerce, listened to their concerns about the order’s scope, but declined to provide details, people familiar with the discussions said.Blair, who served as special representative for international telecommunications policy in the White House before moving to the Commerce Department in April, also said on the call with companies that he couldn’t comment on whether there would be a transition period, they said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","White House Poised to Set Boundaries of WeChat, TikTok Crackdown"

2020-09-02,"(Bloomberg) -- A U.S. appeals court rejected Oracle Corp.’s challenges to the Pentagon’s disputed $10 billion cloud-computing contract.Oracle had raised a number of issues, including allegations of conflicts of interest involving Amazon.com Inc., and claims the Pentagon violated its own rules when it set up the contract to be awarded to a single firm. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Wednesday affirmed a lower court ruling that Oracle wasn’t harmed by any errors the Pentagon made in developing the contract proposal because it wouldn’t have qualified for the contract anyway.“Notwithstanding the extensive array of claims raised by Oracle, we find no reversible error” in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims’s decision to reject those arguments, Circuit Judge William Bryson wrote for the three-judge panel.Oracle was fighting its exclusion from seeking the lucrative cloud-computing deal, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The Pentagon awarded the contract to Microsoft Corp. in October over market leader Amazon Web Services. The project, which is valued at as much as $10 billion over a decade, is designed to help the Pentagon consolidate its technology programs and quickly move information to warfighters around the world.Oracle argued that the Defense Department unfairly and unnecessarily tailored the minimum contract requirements for Amazon and Microsoft. The company also alleged that the bidding process was fatally tainted by conflicts of interest, including former Pentagon employees who went on to work for Amazon after helping to craft the bid.The Federal Circuit agreed with the Defense Department that it “used competitive procedures,” rejecting Oracle’s argument that a requirement for data center capabilities ensured only Amazon and Microsoft would qualify for bidding. The panel also found the conflict-of-interest allegations raised by Oracle to be “troubling” but ultimately “had no effect on the JEDI Cloud solicitation.”Defense Department spokesman Russell Goemaere said in a statement that the appeals court affirmed the Federal Claims Court’s earlier ruling and rejected Oracle’s arguments.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives from Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment.The ruling is a win for the Pentagon, which over the last three years has faced criticism from lawmakers, industry and even President Donald Trump over its decision to choose just one company for the lucrative cloud deal. The Defense Department has said picking one vendor for the project would reduce its technical complexity and security risks.The Pentagon also faces vendor bias allegations in a separate lawsuit by Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud unit. That suit involves claims the Defense Department failed to fairly judge its bid because Trump viewed Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos as his “political enemy.” Trump has long criticized Bezos over everything from the shipping rates his company pays the U.S. Postal Service to his ownership of the Washington Post, which heavily scrutinizes his administration.A Federal Claims court judge paused proceedings in that case while the Pentagon revisits its decision to award the deal to Microsoft.Government lawyers said the Defense Department wanted to reevaluate elements of the bidders’ price proposals and online marketplaces. The Pentagon has until Sept. 16th to complete its review.The Defense Department’s inspector general found in April that the contract award wasn’t affected by any interference from Trump, though it said its probe was limited by the White House.The case is Oracle America Inc.

2020-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- China emphasized its right Thursday to approve or block the sale of technology abroad, confirming it will play a critical role in the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to suitors including Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.Beijing’s assertion jeopardizes negotiations over the sale of ByteDance Ltd.’s prized international asset, a complex deal already under scrutiny by Donald Trump’s administration. The Chinese government on Friday added several artificial intelligence features to a list of export-restricted technologies, effectively gaining the right to block a deal by targeting features such as the recommendation algorithms essential to the viral video service.The regulatory changes aren’t targeted at specific companies, Gao Feng, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, stressed during a weekly online briefing. But companies should consult with the relevant government agencies should any technology they employ fall under the list, he added.“If related enterprises are transferring technology abroad during trade, investment or technical cooperation that fall under the regulations, they are advised to immediately consult provincial-level commerce department offices and handle that in accordance with the law,” he said.Read more: ByteDance Chief Reconsiders TikTok Options After New China RulesBeijing’s last-minute entry and its opaque deal-approval process increase the likelihood a sale could get held up and Trump will then move ahead with a TikTok ban ahead of November’s election.

2020-09-04,"(Bloomberg) -- The Defense Department reaffirmed its decision to award Microsoft Corp. a $10 billion cloud-computing contract after a re-evaluation.The department said in a statement Friday that it “determined that Microsoft’s proposal continues to represent the best value to the government.”The Pentagon previously said it wanted to reconsider “certain aspects” of the procurement, including elements of the bidders’ price proposals and online marketplaces, after a legal challenge of the award by market leader Amazon.com Inc.The contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, is valued at as much as $10 billion over a decade.A Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement that the Pentagon confirmed that the company “offered the right technology and the best value. We’re ready to get to work and make sure that those who serve our country have access to this much needed technology.”Amazon said in a blog post that the Pentagon’s re-evaluation was “nothing more than an attempt to validate a flawed, biased and politically corrupted decision.”The Pentagon made its request to revisit the cloud award after Federal Claims Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith wrote in March that the Defense Department might have misjudged part of Microsoft’s pricing proposal.Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud unit, filed a lawsuit in November alleging that political interference by President Donald Trump cost the company the deal. Amazon said in the suit that the Defense Department failed to fairly judge its bid because Trump viewed Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos as his “political enemy.”As part of that lawsuit, Amazon argued that Microsoft’s bid failed to comply with a government requirement that the winner’s data storage be “highly-accessible” under one of six possible price scenarios. The government argued that Amazon was elevating “superficial labels over technical performance.”Campbell-Smith said it was likely Amazon’s “chances of receiving the award would have increased” if it weren’t for the Pentagon’s errors in evaluating the pricing proposals. After the ruling, the government requested to revisit the contract and allow bidders to revise the problematic part of that pricing scenario.Amazon had sought a broader review of the bidding process by the Pentagon.Judge Campbell-Smith has yet to rule on most of the merits of Amazon’s legal challenge. The court had paused proceedings in the case while the Pentagon revisited its decision to award the deal to Microsoft.Earlier this week, a U.S. appeals court rejected Oracle Corp.’s legal challenge fighting its exclusion from seeking the cloud-computing deal.(Updates with Amazon statement in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Pentagon Reaffirms Microsoft’s JEDI Cloud Award After Review

2020-09-08,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok’s Chinese parent has declared a rare half-month’s salary bonus for employees, hoping to calm a 60,000-plus workforce across the globe as negotiations around the sale of the video service’s U.S. operations approach the Trump administration’s September deadline.ByteDance Ltd. will dole out the bonus this month to reward employees at a time of unprecedented economic and social upheaval, the company said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News. While the Beijing-based startup is known for paying lavishly to poach experts in critical fields such as artificial intelligence, it’s unusual for the firm to declare a handout in the middle of the year. A ByteDance representative confirmed the memo.“Over the past few months, we have been working together to overcome challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and changing macro environment,” ByteDance said in its memo. “To thank everyone for their efforts and dedication, we will be issuing a cash bonus to all eligible employees,” it said, adding that it will pay out the bonus together with September’s salary to any full-timer who’s worked at least 26 days between July 1 and August 31.Read more: ByteDance Chief Reconsiders TikTok Options After New China RulesByteDance’s move contrasts with belt-tightening across scores of Asian startups from Singapore’s Grab to India’s Oyo. It echoes a handout from Huawei Technologies Co. in 2019, another Chinese company in Washington’s cross-hairs.ByteDance’s workforce, particularly in the U.S., is concerned about the company’s future now that Trump has banned the viral video phenom and prohibited American residents and entities from dealing with TikTok. While the Commerce Department hasn’t defined the scope of that executive order, TikTok’s once-sizzling pace of growth is slowing, users are migrating to rival apps such as Triller, and Washington officials continue to label the app a security threat.ByteDance is now embroiled in sensitive discussions about a TikTok takeover in the U.S. with suitors including Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., a deal estimated to fetch upwards of $20 billion. But uncertainty around the deal escalated sharply last week after China asserted its right to approve or block the sale of technology abroad, complicating an already complex process under scrutiny from the White House.Read more: TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTake(Updates with details from the memo in the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Owner Doles Out Bonuses to Assuage Beleaguered Staff
2020-09-08,"Last week, both the Dow Jones Industrial Index and the S&P 500 shed about 2%. Moreover, the Dow was pushed back negative territory while the S&P is still up about 6% in 2020 and it has Big Tech to thank for that. But, there are few big companies whose results the market is eagerly waiting for. They are Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), GameStop (NYSE: GME), Slack Technologies (NYSE: WORK), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Dave & Buster's Entertainment (NASDAQ: PLAY).Are Yoga mats still popular after the lockdown? Yoga-gear seller impressed investors with its last earnings report. Lululemon Athletica saw only a slight decline in sales when COVID-19 started its relentless march across the globe as mats became our quarantine must-haves. More importantly, the yoga accessories specialist even managed to generate a profit despite closures of its physical stores. However, the mid-June report raised new questions that will now be answered after markets close. One is how the company dealt with inventory. Did it resort to writedown charges that hurt peers like the almighty Nike, Inc. (NYSE: NKE) or succumbed to price cuts. But perhaps most importantly, investors are waiting on the updated outlook for the second half of the year. In 2020, the stock has beaten the market.Oracle- will improvements outweigh increased costs? On Thursday, Oracle will release its first-quarter fiscal 2021 results. Its results are expected to have benefited from strong demand for its Cloud Infrastructure services that gained traction across enterprises in Asia, with Nissan (OTC: NSANY) being among its key deal wins. Efforts in enhanced security and management, higher-performance and cost effectiveness are expected to have brought in improvements. Even the star of the pandemic, Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) implemented Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services to enhance video meeting solutions. On the other hand, increasing expenses on product development and competition from Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) are expected to have negatively impacted the fiscal first-quarter performance.GameStop - Can Profitability Be Achieved? Wednesday's GameStop earnings report should reflect several major challenges that the company is facing. Besides the pandemic-induced store closures, the video game retailer's profits are also being harmed with a pause in hardware spending as new console releases are yet to be released by the end of the year.These issues are likely to result in a modest improvement in its growth trend. GameStop's sales already declined at 22% compared to 34% last quarter. However, its margins should be protected by its light inventory. But the main question is whether it can achieve this year's profitability goal with these unprecedented first six months.Can restaurant and entertainment keep their heads above water? Investors are bracing for some bad news with every restaurant business these days, and Dave & Buster's Entertainment is no exception. This Dallas-based business will announce second-quarter results on Wednesday afternoon. With COVID-19 restrictions, sales plummeted by 56% in the first quarter and are overall predicted to fall more than 20% as customer traffic is expected to remain weak for the time being. Aggressive cost cuts and less expansion with new store launches are likely in the cards, but depending on its measures, the company can gain valuable opportunities to thrive in a prolonged recession that we are most likely in for.Takeaway If this unprecedented crisis has taught us anything is that anything is possible. Rules are not set in stone and they can be rewritten. Although Big Tech is winning this 'everything-but-fun' game, it does not exclude other companies from winning as well. What all amounts to are simple laws of nature that Darwin knew so well: those who are most adaptable to change are the ones who survive. In Big Tech's case, it was both the strongest and most adaptable this time round. But for flexible companies that embraced this change as an opportunity for improvement, &quot;miracles&quot; can happen.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-09-09,"(Bloomberg) -- The most popular Chinese-owned social media from WeChat to TikTok are increasingly censoring content in the U.S. and elsewhere, taking practices honed for years behind the Great Firewall to an international audience.ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok often buries or hides words that reflect political movements, gender and sexual orientation or religion in most countries where it operates, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said in a report released Tuesday. Most of the content censored on WeChat supported pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, as well as messages from the U.S. and U.K. embassies regarding a new national security law enacted by Beijing at the end of June that has provoked protests across the city.TikTok, which began as a place where teens lip-sync to music, has become a forum for political protest including the Black Lives Matter movement, said Fergus Ryan, one of the authors. Hashtags related to LGBTQ+ issues were also suppressed in several languages, according to the report. Other topics censored in the past included criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin.The findings may lend ammunition to the Trump administration, which banned TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat after accusing the apps of bending to Beijing’s will in censoring content, potentially influencing the November elections. While social media services like Facebook scrub content such as hate speech, Washington accuses services like TikTok of blocking content considered sensitive to the Communist Party. WeChat has long complied with controls back home, while TikTok -- which operates only outside China -- has pushed back against claims it’s influenced by that country’s government.Read more: WeChat Is China’s Everything App, and ‘We’ Is Looking Suspicious“TikTok is a more curated experience where the platform has a huge amount of power to decide what content to serve up to users,” said Ryan. “Most of these hashtags are categorized in TikTok’s code in the same way that terrorist groups, illicit substances and swear words are treated on the platform.”A Tencent representative declined to comment. The Australian institute cited TikTok as saying some terms “were partially restricted due to relevant local laws.” It was also cited as saying it “strongly supports our LGBTQ creators around the world, and is proud that LGBTQ content is among the most popular category on the platform with billions of views.”“As we’ve said before, TikTok user data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore, with strict controls on employee access,” a TikTok spokesperson said. “We have never shared user information with the Chinese government, and wouldn’t do so if asked.”Washington’s moves against TikTok and WeChat underscore how the concept of an internet decoupling is becoming reality. The Trump administration’s ban on TikTok and WeChat takes effect in mid-September, when both apps are likely to get taken off app stores but may continue to be accessible to many American users. WeChat can be a powerful vector in countries like the U.S. where the Chinese diaspora is substantial, because it is often a major source of information for that population.But principles like free speech do not form part of those apps’ core values, rather they’re more likely to over-censor to align with local government wishes, according to the report.ByteDance is now embroiled in sensitive discussions about a TikTok takeover in the U.S. with suitors including Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., a deal estimated to fetch upwards of $20 billion. But uncertainty around the deal escalated sharply last week after China asserted its right to approve or block the sale of technology abroad, complicating an already complex process under scrutiny from the White House. The law underscored how Beijing wants to retain some control over content moderation and that it considers ByteDance’s algorithms to be a matter of state security, Ryan said.“The rubber really hits the road with the algorithm,” he said. “TikTok’s algorithms are extremely sophisticated and powerful.”(Updates with TikTok’s comment from the seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","WeChat and TikTok Taking China Censorship Global, Study Says"

2020-09-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts’ estimates and projected rising sales, in a sign of greater demand for its cloud-computing services while businesses are working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic.Fiscal first-quarter sales rose 1.6% to $9.37 billion, the Redwood City, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $9.19 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oracle’s revenue had declined 6% year-over-year in the previous three-month period.Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz projected revenue in the current quarter will climb 1% to 3% from a year earlier. Analysts anticipated no sales growth.Catz and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison have tried to revamp Oracle’s business model for a new era of computing, in which software is delivered through the internet rather than shipped in boxes on discs. Thursday’s results show that Oracle’s cloud-based business applications lead the way on modernizing the business, even as demand withers for the company’s older technology.The pair’s latest bet is to try to acquire the U.S. assets of video-sharing platform TikTok, owned by China’s Bytedance Ltd. While the two companies occupy very different parts of the technology market, the deal could give the world’s second-biggest software maker another anchor tenant for its public cloud services that rival Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as provide a huge amount of consumer data Oracle could sell to advertisers for its ad-targeting business, Oracle Data Cloud. Catz declined to comment on the company’s bid during the call.After years of largely going it alone, Oracle has signed more partnerships with other software makers in an effort to make its cloud services more appealing and useful to corporate customers. While it has lost a bid to supply cloud services to the U.S. Defense Department, the company’s partnership with Microsoft, which is also in the running to buy TikTok, means that it could one day supply cloud software to the Pentagon. The 43-year-old software maker has also made its cloud technology work inside of customers’ own server farms, for firms that are unwilling or unable to outsource computing needs. Catz described the company’s results as “fantastic.”“I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past Covid-19,” she said in the statement.Profit, excluding some expenses, will be 98 cents to $1.02 a share in the quarter that ends in November, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 94 cents. The company recorded a profit of 93 cents a share in the quarter that concluded Aug. 31, while analysts were looking for 86 cents.Shares gained more than 3% in extended trading after the results. Earlier, the stock closed at $57.33 in New York, and has jumped 8.2% this year.Revenue from cloud services and license support climbed 2% to $6.95 billion. That metric includes sales from hosting customers’ data in the cloud, but a large portion is generated by maintenance fees for traditional software housed on clients’ corporate servers. Oracle said that McDonald’s Corp. has brought all of its North American financial systems to reside in Oracle’s cloud.Cloud license and on-premise license sales increased 9% to $886 million, suggesting the company is signing more new software deals. Revenue from the company’s accounting and financial-planning application for large businesses climbed 33% last quarter, while sales of NetSuite, which caters more to small- and mid-sized businesses, rose 23%.(Updates with the company’s guidance starting in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Returns to Sales Growth on Greater Cloud Demand
2020-09-10,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. is increasingly likely to miss a Trump administration deadline for the sale of its TikTok U.S. operations after new Chinese regulations complicated negotiations with bidders Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.ByteDance probably needs beyond the U.S. executive order ban on Sept. 20 to nail down an agreement with either party because of the regulatory review, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. In preliminary talks with Chinese officials, ByteDance has been told any proposal must be submitted for approval with detailed information about technical and financial issues, and the review will be substantial and take time, one of the people said. The officials haven’t been willing to give specific guidance on what kind of deal would work, the person said.Donald Trump said Thursday in the U.S. there would be no extension of the deadline.Microsoft and Oracle, which had submitted proposals before the Chinese regulations hit, both continue to be interested in buying the U.S. arm of the hit video app and have not been dissuaded by Beijing’s involvement, the people said. The bidders have asked ByteDance to get as much clarity as possible from Beijing on the new regulations, which prohibit the export of certain artificial intelligence technologies that TikTok uses, they said.The parties are still racing to present a preliminary deal to the White House before this month’s deadline, though no agreement could be finalized before Beijing’s signoff. It’s also possible that ByteDance pulls out of a sale altogether if it determines it can’t satisfy both governments, the bidders and its own shareholders.A company representative offered no immediate comment.ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has been caught in a clash between the world’s two preeminent powers. The serial entrepreneur has been reluctant to give up U.S. TikTok from the start because he sees the business as a viable long-term competitor to Facebook Inc. and Google. He came under pressure to cede control when the Trump administration said it would ban the app and his own venture investors pressed for a sale to salvage some value from the operation.The Trump administration had been considering whether to give more time, but the president’s comments appeared to put an end to such deliberation. “We’ll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it will be sold,” he told reporters Thursday before boarding the presidential aircraft for a campaign trip to Michigan. “There will be no extension of the TikTok deadline.”The specific deadline for ByteDance to act remains an open question in the U.S. due to a confusing series of Trump statements and orders. While Trump has said he wants a deal by Sept. 15, the ban on TikTok’s U.S. operations that he signed last month in a bid to force a sale requires the company to act by Sept. 20. A separate decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, requires a sale by mid-November.ByteDance has sued in the U.S. to block the executive order ban, arguing that putting it out of business without adequate notice and a fair chance to respond deprives it of its due-process rights in violation of the Constitution. The Beijing-based company has also denied its app represents a security threat and said no data from American users is shared with China.In negotiations earlier this year, ByteDance had attempted to work out a U.S. sale that would allow it to retain a substantial interest in the American operations, but the Trump administration has pushed back on that idea. Zhang would still like a small slice of the operation, the people said. But Microsoft and its partner in the deal, Walmart Inc., want full ownership of the business, one person said, while Oracle’s stance isn’t clear.Analysts and bankers have estimated TikTok’s U.S. business is worth at least $20 billion, although the price would vary widely depending on what is included with the sale. The specific offers from Microsoft, which is teaming up with Walmart Inc., and Oracle, which has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital, could not be determined.China made its 11th-hour entry into the TikTok process the last weekend of August, just as ByteDance had two offers in hand and planned to review them in hopes of making a final decision by the close of Sunday, a different person said. Beijing’s move blindsided the company, this person said.Without any discussion or public announcement, China posted notification of new restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, including speech recognition and techniques for personalizing content. The aim of the rules is not necessarily to block a sale of the U.S. operations, but to ensure Beijing is actively involved and to slow down the process, one person said. The review may well push finalization of any agreement beyond the U.S. elections in November, the person said.TikTok’s algorithms are not a big sticking point for the bidders, the second person said. Both Microsoft and Oracle have the technical chops to build their own algorithms and would get data to fine-tune them, the person said.ByteDance’s regulatory team and deal negotiators have discussed whether it’s still possible to craft a sale that can win approval from both governments, an acquirer, venture investors and ByteDance itself.Zhang is still operating from a position of strength. Privately held ByteDance is already worth $140 billion, according to startup tracker CB Insights, and is said to have generated more than $3 billion of net profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019.Investment bankers have begun pitching Zhang’s team on going public in China or Hong Kong, even amid growing scrutiny in the U.S., and demand for initial public offerings from technology companies in the market is surging.

2020-09-10,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is considering whether to give more time to TikTok’s Chinese owners to arrange a sale of the popular video-sharing app’s U.S. operations to an American buyer, according to people familiar with the matter.TikTok’s owner ByteDance Ltd. is likely to miss President Donald Trump’s publicly stated deadline of Sept. 15 for the company to strike a deal to divest its U.S. operations after new Chinese regulations complicated negotiations with bidders Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., Bloomberg News reported Thursday.In preliminary talks with Chinese officials, ByteDance has been told that any proposal must be submitted for approval with detailed information about technical and financial issues, and the review will be substantial and take time, according to the Bloomberg report.Advisers haven’t presented Trump with the decision yet on whether to extend the deadline, the people said. For now, the deal isn’t a top priority for the president, according to another person familiar with the matter. All of the people spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing nature of the discussions.The White House referred questions to the Commerce Department, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for TikTok and Oracle didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.TikTok is caught in a clash between the world’s two preeminent powers. Trump has ramped up his pressure campaign on China ahead of what promises to be a hotly contested presidential election in November. U.S. officials have criticized the app’s security and privacy practices, suggesting that user data collected through the app might be shared with the Chinese government.The real deadline for ByteDance to act remains an open question in the U.S. due to a confusing series of Trump statements and orders. While Trump has said he wants a deal by Sept. 15, the ban on TikTok’s U.S. operations that he signed last month in a bid to force a sale requires the company to act by Sept. 20.Documentation implementing that ban, possibly under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate international commerce in response to any unusual threat to the country, is expected to be made public in the Federal Register around Sept. 20, Bloomberg reported Sept. 2.A subsequent order issued by Trump on Aug. 14 on the recommendation of an interagency national security panel requires ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. business within 90 days -- giving it until after the Nov. 3 election -- further clouding the timeline for a TikTok sale.The parties are still racing to present a preliminary deal to the White House before this month’s deadline, though no agreement could be finalized before Beijing’s signoff.

2020-09-11,"Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL)  reported  better-than-expected first-quarter results and guided above consensus estimates for the second quarter. Here's what the Street has to say. The Oracle Analysts:  Stifel analyst Brad Reback maintained a Hold rating on  Oracle and increased the price target from $48 to $56.BofA Securities analyst Kash Rangan reiterated a Neutral rating and hiked the price target from $60 to $65.Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintained an Equal-weight rating and upped the price target from $58 to $62.Oracle's Cash Flow A Concern, Stifel Says:  Oracle's August quarter results were stable, with license revenues exceeding expectations and EPS beating the consensus due to disciplined spending, Stifle analyst Reback said in a note.However, cash flow from operations and free cash flow growth continued to lag, with both declining year-over-year, the analyst said. Oracle highlighted the growth of the company's modern Fusion applications and growing customer usage of its public cloud solution, he said. Even as Oracle's application suite is likely to continue gain share, the prospects for operating cash flow are bleak given the nearly insurmountable lead AWS/Azure have in the hyperscale cloud market, Reback said.&quot;That said, given Oracle's declining software-sector relevancy, we view this quarter's solid results as another positive data point that spending levels continue to rebound post the April lows.&quot; See also:  Oracle Joins Microsoft In Race To Acquire TikTok's Business In Major Markets: FT BofA Says Revenue Acceleration Timeline Unclear: Oracle's total revenue growth reaccelerated to 2% in constant currency versus a 4% decline in the fourth quarter, with upside likely driven by COVID-19-related deal delays and easier comps with respect to licenses sales, said BofA's Rangan. The most important metric -- cloud services/license support -- grew 2% year-over-year in constant currency, below the 3-5% range seen in recent quarters, the analyst said. The second-quarter revenue guidance for flat to 2% constant currency growth incorporated the macro impact, he said.Despite the revenue mix shifting favorably, the timing of a sustained revenue acceleration remains unclear for Oracle, Rangan said.BofA raised its fiscal year 2021 revenue and EPS estimates from $39.2 billion and $4.11, respectively to $39.9 billion and $4.25.Morgan Stanley Says Durability Of Growth In Question:  Oracle's first-quarter results bounced back nicely from the fourth quarter, thanks to 9% license growth and strong cloud momentum, Morgan Stanley's Weiss said in a note. After multiple false starts, investors likely remain wary on the durability of growth, but a P/E multiple of less than 13 times skews the risk-reward favorably, the analyst said.

2020-09-11,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok is pressing forward with plans for a sale of its U.S. operations ahead of a mid-September deadline, according to a person familiar with the matter, even as signs emerge that the video-sharing app is facing pressure to shut down rather than make a deal.The app, owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., is still considering bids from two possible buyers -- Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp., which has teamed up with Walmart Inc. TikTok intends to bring a proposal to the White House for approval before a deadline imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing internal plans. It will then be up to the Trump administration to approve a deal.Reuters on Friday reported that the Chinese government has privately expressed that it would rather ByteDance close TikTok in the U.S. than be forced to sell its U.S. assets. In response to the report, a TikTok spokesman said, “the government has never suggested to us that we should shut down TikTok in the U.S. or any other market.”TikTok has been at the center of deal negotiations and a political debate since early August, when Trump threatened to ban the app from the U.S., citing national security concerns. He then ordered it sold and has said he wants a deal by Sept. 15. Later that month, the Chinese government announced a handful of new restrictions around the sale of certain technologies, which has slowed a possible deal.Part of the confusion around sealing any deal is the number of interested parties that TikTok’s parent company must satisfy. Not only does it have to come to agreeable terms with an acquirer, as well as its profit-seeking venture capital backers, ByteDance also must find a way to please both the Chinese and U.S. governments. In China, ceding a top technology asset in the middle of a contentious battle with the U.S. is seen as unpatriotic. Within the Trump administration, certain advisers are pushing for an all-out shutdown of TikTok rather than a sale to an American company.China’s U.S. embassy referred Bloomberg to comments made Friday by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry. “The U.S. should immediately correct its mistakes and stop its unjustifiable suppression on Chinese companies and other non-U.S. companies,” he said. “The Chinese side retains the right to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese companies.”It also remains unclear which deal deadline TikTok has to abide by. The company is working toward a Sept. 20 deadline to provide something to the Trump administration, one person close to the company said, sticking with the 45-day timeline imposed in an executive order signed by Trump Aug. 6. But Trump has been insisting on a Sept. 15 deadline in media comments. TikTok also faces a November deadline to divest its U.S. assets in an order based on a recommendation from an interagency national security panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS.The companies involved in the negotiations were focused on getting a preliminary agreement by Sept. 20, and completing the sale by December, said one person familiar with the matter. But China’s move to assert authority over a sale upended talks, said the person, and now it’s uncertain whether that deadline can be met. Whether a deal can be struck will depend on ByteDance navigating a difficult negotiation that wins support from China and the Trump administration, said the person.(Updates with comments from China’s foreign ministry in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Pushing Forward With Deal to Meet Looming Deadline

2020-09-11,"U.S. stocks on Friday finished a volatile week and trading session mixed, with once-high-flying technology-related stocks suffering the heaviest losses since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March. Investors attributed the recent volatility to concerns about the presidential election, which is looming, but also to elevated valuations for e-commerce and mega-cap companies that have thus far led the market's rally from the depths of this public-health crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed up 131 points, or 0.5%, at 27,666, while the S&P 500 index  notched a less than 0.1% gain to finish at 3,340, and the Nasdaq Composite Index  declined 0.6% to end at 10,853. All three benchmarks marked weekly declines. The Nasdaq Composite notched its worst weekly skid, off more than 4%, since the over 12% tumble in the week ended March 20, according to FactSet data. The decline for the S&P 500 index, off 2.5%, was its worst since June, with all three benchmarks seeing losses mount as September, a seasonally weak period for stocks, lives up to its billing as the worst month for the equities. The Dow closed out the week down 1.7%.

2020-09-11,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he won’t extend his Sept. 15 deadline for ByteDance Ltd. to sell the U.S. operations of its popular TikTok video-sharing app.“We’ll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it will be sold,” Trump told reporters Thursday before boarding the presidential aircraft for a campaign trip to Michigan. “There will be no extension of the TikTok deadline.”Administration officials had been considering whether to give more time to TikTok’s Chinese owner to arrange a sale of the app’s U.S. operations to an American buyer, though a decision hadn’t yet been presented to Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.TikTok’s owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, is likely to miss Trump’s Sept. 15 deadline to strike a deal to divest its U.S. operations after new Chinese regulations complicated negotiations with bidders Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., Bloomberg News reported Thursday.Read more: ByteDance Is Poised to Miss U.S. Deadline for TikTok SaleTikTok is caught in a clash between the world’s two preeminent powers. Trump has ramped up his pressure campaign on China ahead of what promises to be a hotly contested presidential election in November. U.S. officials have criticized the app’s security and privacy practices, suggesting that user data collected through it might be shared with the Chinese government. TikTok representatives have repeatedly denied such allegations, noting that its data centers reside entirely outside of China.Analysts and bankers have estimated TikTok’s U.S. business is worth at least $20 billion, although the price would vary widely depending on what is included with the sale. The specific offers from Microsoft, which is teaming up with Walmart Inc., and Oracle, which has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital, could not be determined.Microsoft declined to comment. Oracle and TikTok didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.The real deadline for ByteDance to act remains an open question in the U.S. due to a confusing series of Trump statements and orders. While Trump has said he wants a deal by Sept. 15, the ban on TikTok’s U.S. operations that he signed last month in a bid to force a sale requires the company to act by Sept. 20.Documentation implementing that ban, possibly under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate international commerce in response to any unusual threat to the country, is expected to be made public in the Federal Register around Sept. 20, Bloomberg News reported Sept. 2.A subsequent order issued by Trump on Aug. 14 on the recommendation of an interagency national security panel requires ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. business within 90 days -- giving it until after the Nov. 3 election -- further clouded the timeline for a TikTok sale.ByteDance probably needs beyond the Sept. 20 date to nail down an agreement with any bidder because of China’s regulatory review, Bloomberg News has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. In preliminary talks with Chinese officials, ByteDance has been told any proposal must be submitted for approval with detailed information about technical and financial issues, and the review will be substantial and take time, one of the people said. The officials haven’t been willing to give specific guidance on what kind of deal would work, the person said.The parties are still racing to present a preliminary deal to the White House before this month’s deadline, though no agreement could be finalized before Beijing’s sign-off. It’s also possible that ByteDance pulls out of a sale altogether if it determines it can’t satisfy both governments, the bidders and its own shareholders.(Updates with TikTok valuation in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Won’t Extend Deadline for TikTok to Arrange U.S. Sale
2020-09-11,"Oracle shares are advancing 3.2% in Friday's pre-market session after the software company announced better-than-anticipated results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended Aug. 31. Notably, demand for cloud services spiked amid the pandemic.Oracle’s (ORCL) 1Q revenue grew 1.6% Y/Y to $9.37 billion, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $9.19 billion. Sales at its largest division, cloud services and license support, increased 2.1% to $6.95 billion Y/Y. Revenue from the cloud license and on-premise business rose 9.1% to $886 million. Hardware revenue was almost flat Y/Y while services revenue declined 8.4%.Adjusted EPS rose about 15% to $0.93, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $0.86. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said, “Our cloud applications businesses continued their rapid revenue growth with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. We now have 7,300 Fusion ERP customers and 23,000 NetSuite ERP customers in the Oracle Cloud.”“Our infrastructure businesses are also growing rapidly as revenue from Zoom more than doubled from Q4 last year to Q1 in this year. I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19,” Catz added.Looking ahead, the company expects 2Q revenue growth between 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS growth in the range of 10% to 14%. (See ORCL stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the 1Q results, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reaffirmed his Hold rating on the stock and noted that Oracle generated good application results despite an uncertain operating environment. However, the infrastructure business was slightly below his expectations, while the company's shrinking North American business leaves a “negative optic”, according to Schwartz.“Oracle’s cloud business and margin growth are trending positively and F1Q results overcame a low bar after last quarter's disappointment. However, we think the results and commentary are unlikely to meaningfully shift sentiment on the stock.” Schwartz wrote in a note to investors. “We see the potential for Oracle sustaining better consistency in future reports, offset by only modest revenue growth ahead and a below-market average EPS growth trend.”Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy analyst consensus on the stock based on 6 Buys, 13 Holds and 1 Sell. With shares up over 7% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $54.43 implies potential downside of 5.1% in the coming months.Related News:   Tower Semiconductor Expects Cyber Attack To Hit Q3 Results   Verint Up 10% On Earnings Beat As Cloud-First Strategy Pays Off   Zscaler 4Q Sales Outperform Fueled By Cybersecurity Demand More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Nikola Shares Hit As Short Seller Claims EV Maker Is An ‘Intricate Fraud’   * Twitter Expands Policy To Block Misinformation Posts Ahead Of US Election   * Rio Tinto CEO Resigns Bowing To Shareholder Pressure Over Blast Of Aboriginal Site   * Rosenblatt Initiates Penn National With A Buy, Street High PT; Shares Rise",Oracle Up 3% In Pre-Market As Cloud Business Drives Upbeat 1Q Results
2020-09-11,"(Bloomberg) -- It's looking increasingly likely that TikTok won’t be able to sell its U.S. operations by the mid-September deadline imposed in an executive order issued by President Donald Trump last month. That doesn’t mean the video app beloved by tens of millions of teens will go dark overnight.Trump on Thursday said he wouldn’t extend a Sept. 20 deadline for a deal. But ByteDance Ltd., TikTok’s Chinese owner, may need more time to negotiate with suitors after new regulations from Beijing complicated the deal. The president has said if a deal isn’t done by the specified date then he’ll shut down TikTok. But unlike India, which recently banned the app and immediately severed users’ access, the U.S. doesn't afford the president the authority to close down a social media site or require service providers to block access to an app. So TikTok could remain on people’s phones and they’d still be able to create dance videos, at least for a while.Experts say the more likely scenario would be requiring Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to kick TikTok out of their app stores and cut off access to developer tools, preventing new downloads and subsequent software updates to current users.  That, in effect, could render the app inoperable in the long run. The TikTok user experience could be degraded even sooner for purchasers of Apple’s upcoming iPhone model if TikTok loses developer access and can’t format the app and its features for Apple’s newest smartphone. “There is no authority in the U.S. to ban TikTok content, ban people from watching it, or ban people for working with TikTok, that’s just the president exaggerating his authority to put pressure on the deal,” says James Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington think tank. “You can put obstacles up, but there are workarounds.”TikTok has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration calling the executive order unconstitutional.The order could also make it difficult for other companies to do business with TikTok, such as buying ads or selling the company cloud services. Without access to U.S. servers from Amazon Web Services, for example, TikTok could be forced to route massive amounts of data through overseas servers and that could materially slow down the user experience, says Daniel Sinclair, an independent security researcher who studies TikTok and social media.  U.S. officials have been concerned about Chinese control over data of U.S. citizens for years. But Trump ratcheted up the pressure on ByteDance earlier this summer as part of a larger campaign against China ahead of November’s U.S. presidential elections. Trump has been frustrated by the slow implementation of a trade deal between the two countries and the spread of the coronavirus, for which he blames China.In August, Trump issued a pair of executive orders requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations or shut them down, citing national security concerns. The administration claims that ByteDance could be compelled to hand over U.S. users’ data to Beijing or use the app to influence the 100 million Americans who use it. Trump’s orders set off a deal-making frenzy by potential American suitors: Oracle Corp. and a joint bid by Microsoft Corp. and Walmart Inc. emerged as top contenders. But a new Chinese law limiting the sale of artificial intelligence technology outside its borders slowed deal negotiations as all sides seek clarity on what the new rules would mean for a TikTok sale.In preliminary talks with Chinese officials, ByteDance has been told any proposal must be submitted for approval with detailed information about technical and financial issues, and the review will be substantial and take time, a person familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg News. Trump isn’t being flexible. “We’ll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it will be sold,” Trump told reporters Thursday before boarding the presidential aircraft for a campaign trip to Michigan. “There will be no extension of the TikTok deadline.”Now, it’s unclear if TikTok will meet the September deadline to sell its American operations outlined in Trump’s initial executive order issued on Aug. 6. That order gave TikTok 45 days to sell itself or stop doing business with Americans, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president broad authority to regulate financial transactions in a national emergency. “The White House could argue that the terms and conditions users sign and consent to when they download an app is a financial transaction, even though no cash changes hands,” Lewis says. That means the Trump administration could order American companies like Google and Apple to stop carrying the app, but couldn’t stop American teens from finding workarounds to access the website or view the content.Apple and Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Already, heavy TikTok users have started to look for workarounds. One popular TikTok creator, who goes by @carrieberkk on the app, garnered 90,000 views with an informational video advising users to switch their phone’s region settings to Canada, where she reckoned the app wouldn’t be banned. Sinclair, the researcher, says this tactic doesn’t actually work. If the app was banned only in the U.S., users would have to sign up for a non-U.S. iTunes account. But it’s also unclear if the ban would prevent Apple, a U.S. company, from offering TikTok in its App Store overseas.“Some creators who rely on TikTok for their livelihoods would probably have to get a burner phone to keep TikTok working, but it’s certainly not impossible,” Sinclair says. ByteDance has already shut down operations in other locations. In Hong Kong, the company chose to halt operations after China passed a new national security law that would make it more difficult for TikTok to do business there.In India, where the country has the power to force service providers to block access to websites, government officials banned TikTok as part of a larger shutdown of Chinese-owned apps after a deadly border clash with China. TikTok’s app no longer shows up in India’s app stores and Indian users who already had the app downloaded on their phones now see an error message that delineates the company is &quot;complying with the Government of India's directive.&quot;A U.S. ban would be different. “There are laws on the books for pirated movies or child pornography, but if the U.S. wanted to do what India has done, they’d need new legislation and even then it might not stand up to a First Amendment challenge,” Lewis says. Trump’s second executive order, issued on Aug. 14, gave TikTok 90 days to divest its U.S. business under a separate authority, citing a ruling by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Experts say that order, which would take effect in November or later if extensions are granted, carries greater weight and more specificity, since CFIUS has broad powers afforded by Congress to unwind ByteDance’s 2017 purchase of lip-syncing app Musical.ly, which was later re-branded as TikTok. TikTok declined to comment on the deal negotiations. In an interview last month with Bloomberg News, interim Chief Executive Officer Vanessa Pappas said TikTok will continue to operate its hit music video app in the U.S., whatever comes of the threatened Trump administration ban on its business. She said the company was exploring multiple paths forward, declining to provide more specificity. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Won’t Just Disappear After Trump’s Deadline for a Sale

2020-09-11,"As the saying goes: If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. It seems like the market is taking that to heart as early indications point to another start in the green.The question is whether the second attempt at continuing a tech-related bounce will hold after yesterday's gains faded. Of note, crude oil is still seeing some weakness, which could mean there are some demand-related economic headwinds in the air.Four out of the last five sessions have ended in the red for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) as investors have been focused on a repricing in tech-related companies after strong gains following the coronavirus selloff.Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) was helping give a boost to the Information Technology sector in early going. After the bell yesterday, the business software provider reported quarterly results that beat expectations on its top and bottom lines and issued quarterly guidance that was ahead of forecasts for revenue growth and earnings. The company's shares were up more than 3.8% in pre-market trading.ORCL, which has focused on in-office database products, has been playing catch up in cloud computing but has managed to attract new cloud business during the coronavirus crisis, which has accelerated the shift toward working from home.In economic news this morning, the August CPI came in slightly above expectations with a 0.4% gain when a Briefing.com consensus had expected a rise of 0.3%. The average CPI year-over-year is up 1.3%. After the Federal Reserve's speech earlier this month indicating inflation could run higher than 2% if necessary, inflation numbers may be closely watched by investors.While it's nice the stocks seem on track for a start in positive territory, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) still near the 30 mark, investors can't get too comfortable with a market like this.Given that it's a Friday, some market participants may want to square up some positions ahead of the weekend.Reversal Of Fortune For a while on Thursday it looked like the tech rebound would continue. But the gains didn't hold and all three of the main U.S. indices ended deeply in the red. This pinballing around could be part of a consolidation period before the market decides whether it will resume a general uptrend or move meaningfully lower again.Stocks didn't move lower immediately following release of disappointing jobless claims numbers, which showed 884,000 initial claims when 813,000 had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus. But news that the Senate killed a Republican bill that would have provided less coronavirus relief than Democrats wanted added to the news flow to perhaps cause investors to want to retreat.However, it didn't feel like those were the main factors pushing stocks lower yesterday. It's also possible that market participants simply think that the re-valuation of tech-related shares isn't complete. Remember: the market in general--and tech shares in particular--have come a long way since the March lows (see chart below). Perhaps the combo of jobless numbers and the political news were reminders of the long haul for the economic recovery and the wide divergence between Main Street, where unemployment is high, and Wall Street, which until recently was on a solid march higher.Even though the big-name tech-related stocks have benefited from the stay-at-home trade, continued pain in the economy, especially without new stimulus, could still be a headwind.Checking In On The Stay-at-Home Trade Speaking of the stay-at-home trade, Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON) after the closing bell reported earnings and revenue that handily beat expectations and encouraged investors with strong quarterly and yearly sales guidance.The maker of stationary bikes, treadmills and workout apparel saw strong demand as people look to burn calories at home. Its shares were up about 11% in pre-market trading.Meanwhile, another stay-at-home play, pet food e-tailer Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) reported weaker-than-expected new sales per active customer, disappointing investors and sending its shares down in after hours trading.Still, not all was doom and gloom, with CHWY reporting better-than-forecast quarterly revenue. CHWY shares were down more than 1% in pre-market trading.CHART OF THE DAY: TECH SUPPORT. For the second time in three days, the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) closed on session lows--and right at the 50-day moving average (blue line). Chart watchers might see that as an area of solid support. Early movement in the major indices seem to point to a retention of the 50-day as a support level. But as a reminder of just how far the index has risen, even after the recent selloff, it's well above its 200-day moving average (purple line). Data source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  It's Not a Gas: Although every SPX sector ended in the red yesterday, Energy was a particularly notable loser, falling more than 3.6% when the next biggest decliner was the widely-watched Information Technology sector, which dropped roughly 2.3%. The day's losses for Energy came as government data showed a surprise rise in weekly crude stockpiles. As if the beaten-up sector needed more bad news, fresh numbers from OPIS, an IHS Markit Ltd (NYSE: INFO) company, showed that the recovery in U.S. gasoline consumption has plateaued. U.S. gasoline sales had improved rapidly from May to early July after the national shutdown, when sales were 50% below prior year levels. But the recovery had begun to sputter, and the latest numbers, out Thursday, show that demand actually fell 1.9% during the last full week of August from the previous week, with the four-week rolling average for the period ending Aug. 29 showing demand 18.2% below prior-year levels.A Long Way To Go: While the headline producer price index (PPI) figure came in as expected at 0.3% monthly growth in August, the core PPI reading came in a little hotter than expected. Core PPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, gained 0.4% for the month, ahead of the 0.2% gain expected in a Briefing.com consensus. The inflation could be a welcome sign that we can add to the green-shoots narrative of the economic recovery. But we still have a long way to go. The yearly core PPI figure came in at just 0.6% growth and the headline number was in negative annual territory. &quot;The soft year-over-year readings will overshadow the stronger month-over-month readings, because the year-over-year numbers play into the Fed's view that it isn't even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates,&quot; Briefing.com said, paraphrasing a recent comment by Fed chair Jerome Powell.Revolving Credit Contracts Again: With the latest initial jobless claims numbers rising more than expected, it might be a good time to review one of the consequences of unemployment on the economy. Without a job, people have less money to spend (of course), but they also have a harder time borrowing money that could help them make up the shortfall. Data this week showed that revolving consumer credit decreased by $0.3 billion in July, marking the fifth consecutive monthly contraction. &quot;That hasn't happened since late 2010-early 2011, underscoring the more restrictive credit stance adopted by lenders in the wake of the COVID shutdown and spike in unemployment,&quot; Briefing.com said. With consumer spending necessary to help power the economic recovery, consumer credit is worth watching.

2020-09-11,"Over the past three months, shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) moved higher by 9.54%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Oracle has.Oracle's Debt According to the Oracle's most recent financial statement as reported on June 22, 2020, total debt is at $71.60 billion, with $69.23 billion in long-term debt and $2.37 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $37.24 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $34.36 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Oracle has $115.44 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.62. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: Oracle Q1 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For September 10, 2020  * A Preview Of Oracle's Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-14,"Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) shares were up 5% on Monday after the company confirmed a deal with TikTok parent company ByteDance to become the company's &quot;trusted technology provider.&quot; The new deal between TikTok and Oracle comes after Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) said Sunday that ByteDance had rejected its buyout offer for TikTok.National Security Concerns: On Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he will be reviewing the proposed deal between ByteDance and Oracle this week.&quot;I will just say from our standpoint, we'll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans' data is secure, that the phones are secure and we'll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams,&quot; Mnuchin said.President Donald Trump has been extremely critical of TikTok and its Chinese parent company. In August, Trump issued an executive order requiring ByteDance to either sell, spin off or shut down TikTok in the U.S. due to national security concerns.Microsoft had reportedly teamed up with Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) to make an outright bid to buy TikTok. ByteDance was reportedly initially seeking a $30 billion valuation for TikTok.Details of the new deal between ByteDance and Oracle have not been released, but Trump has recently encouraged a deal between the two companies.&quot;I think Oracle is a great company and I think its owner is a tremendous guy, a tremendous person,&quot; Trump said in August following initial reports that Oracle was interested in TikTok.Voices From The Street: On Monday, Bank of America analyst Kash Rangan said a partnership with TikTok is even better for Oracle from a financial standpoint than a buyout.&quot;In our view, Oracle could potentially monetize Tiktok to $2bn+ in revenues if it were to double the number of users to 150mn across the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand at monetization of $15/user given typically higher monetization across the US and Western countries, using Facebook and YouTube peer comparisons,&quot; Rangan wrote in a note.In a statement, Microsoft said it believes its offer would have been both good for TikTok users and strong on national security, but Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said Microsoft and ByteDance ran into a deal-breaker.&quot;We believe Microsoft would only buy TikTok WITH its core algorithm, which the Chinese government and ByteDance was not willing to budge,&quot; Ives said.Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $65 price target for Oracle. Wedbush has an Outperform rating and $260 target for Microsoft.Benzinga's Take: Given Trump's personal relationship with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, it's likely his administration will approve the deal.

2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. edged out out rival Microsoft Corp. in negotiations over the weekend for the U.S. operations of TikTok, moving closer toward a deal for the Chinese-owned music-video app that could thwart a threat by U.S. by President Donald Trump to shut it down.A deal between TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. and Oracle will look more like a corporate restructuring than the outright sale Microsoft had proposed, though it is likely to include a stake in a newly configured American business, according to a person familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.The terms being discussed with Oracle are still evolving, one person familiar with the talks said. One of the options being explored is that Oracle could take a stake in a newly formed U.S. business while serving as TikTok’s U.S. technology partner and housing the video app’s data in Oracle’s cloud servers. Early offers from both parties valued the U.S. business at about $25 billion, but that was before Chinese officials weighed in with new rules imposing limits on technology exports, said people with knowledge of the matter.In a statement Monday morning, Oracle confirmed “it is part of the proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department over the weekend.”Oracle shares gained 6.5% at 10:29 a.m. in New York Monday.The sale of TikTok -- forced by a Trump administration ban on grounds of national security -- is one of the issues at the heart of the fraying Washington-Beijing relationship. Any deal still requires signoffs from both sides. Early on in the discussions, Trump had voiced support for a bid from Oracle, calling it a “great company” and co-founder Larry Ellison “a great guy.” Ellison is also one of the few Silicon Valley moguls to openly support Trump.Microsoft, which was working with Walmart Inc., had been seen as the likely winner but talks cooled in recent days, one person said. Microsoft wasn’t asked to make revisions to its initial offer in the face of recent signs of opposition to a deal from Chinese government officials, the person added.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Monday that the administration received a proposal from TikTok that includes Oracle as the app’s “trusted technology partner.” He said he’ll be reviewing the proposal this week and making a recommendation to Trump, reiterating that a deadline to make a deal remains Sept. 20.“We need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, phones are secure, and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical team,” Mnuchin told CNBC, adding that he had a lot of confidence in both Microsoft and Oracle. The Oracle proposal contains a commitment to make TikTok global a U.S. Headquartered company with 20,000 new jobs, Mnuchin said.Couching the deal as a corporate overhaul could help win approval in Beijing. It could allay fears about TikTok’s cache of sensitive U.S. data while addressing Chinese concerns over the export of key artificial-intelligence technology, said Yik Chan Chin, who researches global media and communications policy at the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou.“If you say this is a hostile takeover, that may not be nice for both parties,” she said. “But if you frame it as like a restructuring or spinoff,” that’s more acceptable to the two governments.China’s government on Monday declined to comment on the prospect of a ByteDance-Oracle tie-up.“China has talked about its position on TikTok many times. The U.S. is now encircling TikTok. This is a typical coerced transaction by the government,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a briefing in Beijing.The progress in the talks with Oracle ignited celebrations among TikTok’s mostly young devotees.“TikTok sold, you guys, that means we’re not going anywhere,” declared @ElianaGhen, who has 2.4 million followers, in a video touting the Oracle deal. “Best birthday gift ever, TikTok is here to stay!” said @mrsscott_teaches, who has 22,000 followers.The app, which lets people record and edit short video clips ranging from lighthearted lip-syncs to more serious political statements, gained popularity during the global pandemic that’s kept many people cooped up indoors. TikTok’s loyal following of more than 100 million in the U.S. helps explain the strong interest among early suitors, from Microsoft to private equity giants such as Sequoia and General Atlantic.Walmart remains interested in making a TikTok investment alongside a consortium of investors led by Oracle. A spokesperson for the retailer said Sunday it “continues discussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties. We know that any approved deal must satisfy all regulatory and national security concerns.”Talk of a corporate restructuring harks back to ByteDance’s original intentions earlier in the summer to sell a partial stake in TikTok’s operations, or restructure the company with a global headquarters and board of directors outside of China. Those aspirations were complicated by Trump’s threats to ban the app and subsequent executive orders, which prohibit U.S. people and businesses from doing business with TikTok.If the Chinese company is able to get a deal through the White House that doesn’t involve an outright, forced sale, it would be a major feat for ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, who has been reluctant to hand over such a prized asset. Yet critics were still questioning how a technology partnership with Oracle, rather than an outright sale, would assuage the White House’s national security concerns.“A deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok, and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift,” Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, said in a post on Twitter.Read more: China Throws a Wrench Into Trump’s Plan to Force TikTok SaleBeijing’s stance is another big question mark. Shortly after bids from Microsoft and Oracle were submitted, the Chinese government announced its right to be closely involved in approval of any deal as well as its opposition to exporting key algorithms, such as a recommendation engine that underpins TikTok. ByteDance appeared eager for a more limited sort of agreement than Microsoft wanted, where it would retain more control, one of the people familiar with the negotiations said.Some U.S. officials would prefer shutting down TikTok’s U.S. operations if a sale doesn’t meet their demands for putting the business and related data into American hands.“ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft,” Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said in a statement on Sunday. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests.”Microsoft representatives declined to comment beyond the statement. Representatives for TikTok declined to comment. The White House also didn’t respond to a request for comment.Microsoft was the early front-runner for the acquisition, having started talks with ByteDance weeks before Trump’s executive orders and believing it had the preliminary framework of a deal the U.S. government could back.Read more: Oracle’s Improbable TikTok Talks Have a Simple Explanation: DataThen Oracle, a company with a closer relationship to the U.S. president, emerged as a bidder with the backing of Sequoia Capital, a key ByteDance shareholder.For the corporate software giant, TikTok is a less obvious fit, but may make sense in light of the company’s desire to build up its cloud-computing and consumer-data businesses. Oracle creates profiles of ordinary people and sells them to companies looking to reach specific audiences. TikTok currently stores massive amounts of data and is a large customer of cloud services run by Amazon Web Services and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Oracle has nurtured a relationship with Trump since before his administration began. In 2016, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on the president’s transition team, and two years later, dined with him at the White House, where she complained about a government contract she deemed unfair, Bloomberg reported.Vice President Mike Pence visited Oracle’s headquarters in Redwood City, California. Catz has contributed more than $125,000 this year to support Trump’s re-election, according to Federal Election Commission data. And Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fund-raiser in February.In recent weeks, the U.S. president had publicly endorsed the Oracle bid and called Ellison a “tremendous guy.” Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who earlier came out against a potential sale to Microsoft and had at one time advocated banning TikTok completely, echoed that endorsement during an August appearance on Fox News.“If you look at Microsoft versus Oracle, the one thing that separates the two companies with respect to national security is that Microsoft has a large footprint in China,” Navarro said. “Oracle on the other hand has a strong reputation of really putting a great firewall between its operations and China and that’s an important thing.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Beats Microsoft in Deal for TikTok’s U.S. Operations

2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A flurry of corporate dealmaking in recent days is creating the illusion of an almost-return to normalcy — that is, buyers are confident enough to be buying again even as Covid-19 continues to burden the U.S. economy. But don’t let the billions of dollars suddenly swishing around the M&A market fool you: This isn’t a Merger Monday to celebrate. None of the announced deals necessarily signals renewed bullishness toward the economy, and in fact, one is flashing just the opposite.For starters, there’s the TikTok takeover saga, which looks like it will end without an outright takeover and rather a partnership with Oracle Corp. Remember, these negotiations were brought about not by natural market forces, but by geopolitical tensions with China and somewhat squishy national-security logic employed by the White House.Also in the tech space, Nvidia Corp. is buying chip designer Arm Ltd. from SoftBank Group Corp. for $40 billion, in what ranks as the biggest transaction of 2020 and a chance for Nvidia to cement its industry dominance. But the backstory is just as important: The deal is part of a larger retrenchment by SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son — also now known as the “Nasdaq whale” — after a series of ill-advised investments left his empire facing shareholder pressure to shed assets and shore up is finances. Just like TikTok, Arm is essentially a forced sale — not the kind used as a market barometer. A smaller acquisition announced by Verizon Communications Inc. on Monday may be even more telling. The company agreed to acquire TracFone Wireless for up to $6.9 billion in a bet that the market for prepaid, or pay-as-you-go, plans will see increased demand amid the crisis. Verizon is the biggest U.S. carrier, but when it comes to prepaid it’s been a laggard. That market had also been shrinking in recent years as U.S. wage and job growth enabled more customers to upgrade to postpaid plans that require better credit and get billed at the end of each month.When T-Mobile US Inc. bought Sprint Corp., I noted that their combined market share in prepaid could worry regulators — or it least it should have — because economists were already vaguely predicting a recession was on the way even before Covid-19 hit. It’s now here, and to the extent that the prepaid market serves as an inverse economic indicator of sorts, Verizon seems to be betting more people will have to resort to this kind of service amid what promises to be a slow and uneven U.S. recovery. As I wrote last week, various consumer-spending patterns provide stark evidence of a K-shaped rebound exacerbating the nation’s wealth inequality. In other M&A news, Gilead Sciences Inc. agreed to buy Immunomedics Inc. for $21 billion to expand beyond its core HIV-treatment business and gain a promising breast-cancer drug. My Opinion colleague Max Nisen cautions that Gilead looks to be overpaying, though, and may wind end up experiencing buyer’s remorse. Unfortunately, it’s yet another example of how this Merger Monday feels a bit more like the Sunday Scaries. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

The Chinese social app will instead become software giant Oracle’s (ORCL) “trusted tech partner” in the U.S.On Sunday night, Microsoft stated that TikTok – owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance - had pulled out of the deal. Microsoft, in turn, has said it would have been a good fit for TikTok users, while at the same time alleviating the national security issues, which have been cited as the reason behind the proposed ban.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has an idea why Microsoft’s offer fell through.“We believe Microsoft would only buy TikTok WITH its core algorithm which the Chinese government and ByteDance was not willing to budge,” the 5-star analyst said. “Our view has been that Microsoft (along with Walmart) was in the driver’s seat to get a TikTok deal done for ~$30 billion+ given the strategic fit for its consumer business and the crown jewel asset/customer base this would give Redmond.”Following the deadline date set by Trump, in a retaliatory move, the Chinese government updated its export rules, which included a ban on the sale of a number of technologies, including “personalized information recommendation services based on data analysis.” TikTok’s resounding success is based on such algorithms. Rumors so far indicate the Oracle deal is not a sale, but rather an agreement in which Oracle will handle TikTok’s U.S. user data.Overall, Ives sticks to his MSFT Outperform rating, along with a $260 price target. Investors could be pocketing a 27% gain, should the target be met over the next 12 months. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street’s confidence backing MSFT remains strong.

2020-09-14,Oracle confirmed it is part of the proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department in which Oracle will serve as the “trusted technology provider.”,Oracle Won’t Acquire TikTok as Part of ByteDance’s Proposal. What to Know About the Deal.
2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp.’s closely watched bid for TikTok’s U.S. operations will not only have to pass a U.S. national security review, it’s also going to need to win the blessing of President Donald Trump.The U.S. government will undertake a two-track national security review of Oracle’s TikTok proposal this week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday.The deal, if finalized, would create what Mnuchin called “TikTok Global.” He added that the unit would have its headquarters in the U.S. and create 20,000 jobs -- potentially a move to sweeten the deal as Trump faces what promises to be a hotly contested presidential election in November.Instead of buying the business outright, Oracle would make an investment in a newly restructured TikTok, people familiar with the proposal said. At least two shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company, General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, would take stakes in the new business, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t finalized. The details could be worked out in the next 48 hours, the person said.The sale of TikTok -- forced by a Trump administration ban on national security grounds due to TikTok’s Chinese ownership -- is one of the issues at the heart of the fraying Washington-Beijing relationship. Any deal still requires signoffs from both the U.S. and China.TikTok confirmed it submitted Oracle’s proposal to Treasury, saying it “would resolve the administration’s security concerns,” according to a spokesperson. Mnuchin said the deadline for a deal, according to Trump’s executive order, is Sept. 20.Trump has also insisted that any sale of the TikTok video app include a cut for the federal government. That demand -- which is more akin to a high-stakes real estate deal than a government-ordered divestiture -- has baffled policy experts and lawyers who say such a payment would stretch his authority under U.S. law.A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on whether a deal with Oracle will include the fee that Trump has talked about.Oracle confirmed in a statement Monday it’s part of the proposal submitted by TikTok’s owner ByteDance Ltd. to the Treasury Department over the weekend in which Oracle will serve as the “trusted technology provider.”Oracle edged out rival Microsoft Corp., which had been working with Walmart Inc., and had been seen as the frontrunner, but those talks had cooled in recent days. Oracle rose 4.3% to $59.46 in New York.“We need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, phones are secure, and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical team,” Mnuchin told CNBC during an interview early Monday.Oracle has nurtured a relationship with Trump since before his administration began. Oracle’s co-founder and chairman, Larry Ellison, is one of the few Silicon Valley moguls to openly support Trump, who has called him a “great guy,” and voiced support for Oracle’s TikTok bid. Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fundraiser in February.Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz has contributed to Trump’s re-election campaign, served on the president’s transition team and has dined with him at the White House.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, will meet this week before it makes its recommendation to Trump, who will make the final decision. The deal must also go through a separate national security review, he said, in order to comply with Trump’s executive orders last month. That process will be overseen by the Commerce Department.QuickTake: All About CFIUS, Trump’s Watchdog on China DealmakingA deal between ByteDance and Oracle will look more like a corporate restructuring than the outright sale Microsoft had proposed, though it is likely to include a stake in a newly configured American business, Bloomberg News reported.The terms being discussed with Oracle are still evolving, according to a person familiar with the talks. One of the options being explored is that Oracle could take a stake in a newly formed U.S. business while serving as TikTok’s U.S. technology partner and housing the video app’s data in Oracle’s cloud servers. Early offers from both parties valued the U.S. business at about $25 billion, but that was before Chinese officials weighed in with new rules imposing limits on technology exports, said people with knowledge of the matter. Softbank Group Corp. and Walmart have also expressed interest in joining any bid.While Mnuchin led the effort on behalf of the Trump administration to find ways to sell TikTok rather than ban it, the deal may still not be approved by Cfius. The panel, led by the Treasury secretary, includes nearly 10 agencies including State, Defense and Homeland Security. Representatives from the national security and intelligence community may reject the deal because it doesn’t comply with Trump’s original order: A full sale.Even if TikTok’s data is stored by Oracle in the U.S., that could mean that ByteDance would still keep at least some control over the app’s algorithms, the computer code behind what the service uses to pick and choose which videos are shown to which users, which ByteDance has perfected over many years. If TikTok’s algorithms remain in the hands of ByteDance, they could run the risk of being manipulated by Beijing to run information campaigns or deliberately show video to American users that could influence, say, the U.S. elections. The administration cited the possibility of disinformation campaigns on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party when Trump issued an order banning the app last month.Analysts say another possibility is that Oracle builds a brand new algorithm for TikTok’s U.S. operations to run on, controlled by Oracle or TikTok engineers that are based in the U.S. That way, the idea is that Oracle would “own” the algorithms, which would be out of China’s reach.If the Chinese company is able to get a deal through the White House that doesn’t involve an outright, forced sale, it would be a major feat for ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, who has been reluctant to hand over such a prized asset. Yet critics were still questioning how a technology partnership with Oracle, rather than an outright sale, would assuage the White House’s national security concerns.“A deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok, and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift,” Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, said in a post on Twitter.Early indications of the structure of the deal suggest it’s a far cry from Trump’s stated aim to push TikTok into the arms of an American company through an outright sale.The outlines of the transaction hearken back to what ByteDance originally proposed to the administration: Create a new U.S.-based entity with a global headquarters in New York, as well as a reconstituted board of directors that would provide some distance from Beijing. Oracle would also have to host all the U.S. user data in country, something that TikTok already does using Amazon Web Services and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud.Oracle would have to go further than that and re-engineer the algorithms to please the U.S. government, analysts say. “The algos need to be ‘owned’ by Oracle in order to satisfy U.S.-government requirements that Chinese government interests could not censor content or influence users on the TikTok platform,” wrote Macquarie Research analyst Sarah Hindlian-Bowler.Mnuchin appeared optimistic. “We have a lot of confidence in Oracle,” he told reporters at the White House later Monday.(Updates with deal term details in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle’s TikTok Bid Heads for U.S. Review—and Trump’s Verdict

2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Don’t Get Too ComfortableIs it safe to put a price on technology again? After great excitement, the solemn date of Sept. 11 proved to be the first trading day of the month when the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 didn’t move by more than 1%, in one direction or another:It is just possible that a lot of speculation, largely placed by making bullish bets on individual stocks in the options market, has now unwound. However, it would be unwise to bet on it. As this chart from Deltec Bank & Trust Ltd. shows, trading in options has in the last two months outstripped trading in underlying cash equities for the first time on record. There aren’t too many good precedents for this, then. It would probably be wise to assume that there are more shoes to drop before calm is restored:The volatility and excessive speculation of the last few months are obvious. As with the great tech bubble 20 years ago, this is the unsurprising result when a lot of easy money meets a plausibly exciting narrative. But while trades have obviously been taken to excess, it doesn’t necessarily follow that the entire market is overvalued. Resorting to some basic arithmetic on the cash flow generated by companies helps to draw some distinctions. Some stocks, such as Netflix Inc. or Tesla Inc., have an exciting growth story but are burning cash. Others, like Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., are turning into licences to print money, growing steadily and producing lots of cash. The latter are a better long-term bet than the former. In the following chart, also from Deltec, we can see the growth of Microsoft Office 365’s monthly active users. It was doing very well before lockdown, and working from home has only sped the process, as more and more people have used its Microsoft Teams product:Deltec therefore suggests threading a way through the tech mess by loading up on stocks that are producing strong cash flows and “winning” the battle to help everyone work from home, while shorting companies that are losing out to them. Examples include Slack Technologies Inc. and Dropbox Inc., which were lagging Microsoft heading into the crisis, briefly caught up in the rebound earlier this year, and have now dropped back to a point where they are lagging the S&P 500 over 12 months:Rob Buckland, Citigroup Inc.’s chief global equity strategist, offered another way to crunch the numbers for Apple. Incredibly, the iPhone maker is now bigger than the FTSE-100, by market cap:Indeed, Apple is bigger than every world stock market bar the U.S., China and Japan, according to MSCI indexes:So, Buckland tries to decompose the valuations of Apple on the one side, and the FTSE-100 on the other. First of all, we discover that at the most basic level of arithmetic, Apple has been using all that cash to raise its earnings per share, by buying back stock — a phenomenon that Buckland himself christened “de-equitisation” about 15 years ago. The treasurers of the 100 biggest British-listed companies haven’t been able to perform any such trick, and so over the last five years their share count has stayed static while Apple’s has been cut by a quarter. It’s that much easier for Apple to keep rising if there is always someone there (Apple) to buy on the dips:Next, the FTSE-100 is now plainly a “value” stock, if treated in aggregate, and in current circumstances that isn’t a good thing to be. The big U.K.-based multinationals include no big tech names, but lots of miners, energy groups, banks and tobacco. All of these sectors look cheap compared to their fundamentals, and in every case for good reason. As a result, a comparison of Apple’s performance relative to the FTSE-100 with growth’s performance relative to value over the last five years is startlingly similar.As a general rule, we can expect value to start to do well again when growth is no longer thought to be scarce, and when real yields are rising. In current circumstances, that is another way of saying that we cannot expect value to start doing well again until there is confidence that the pandemic has been decisively put to rest. And that is another way of saying that this pattern will endure for a while:Finally, Buckland tried a very interesting exercise mapping the last five years’ growth in earnings per share against forward multiples for Apple and the FTSE-100, along with a range of global sectors. As a general rule, higher growth should justify a higher price-earnings multiple, so it isn’t surprising that there is a discernible relationship. The FTSE-100 has declining earnings, and a low multiple which, judging by the “best fit” that Buckland finds, leaves it slightly cheap. Meanwhile Apple shows up as having been notably cheap at the beginning of this year, but does look expensive now:Assuming none of the big companies in the FTSE-100 can come up with a product as dominant as the iPhone any time soon, what can be done? Buckland suggests they are in a strange position where the market is prodding them to do almost exactly what politicians hoping for an economic recovery would prefer them not to do:Finally, what messages are markets sending to CEOs? Investors have significantly rerated Apple. Its out-sourced business model is very profitable but requires little capex. It employs remarkably few people, just 132,000. That’s $15m of market cap per employee. Apple generates extraordinary levels of free cashflow which can then be used to buy back shares and enhance future growth rates.Alternatively, the FTSE 100 does a lot more capex, $108bn vs Apple’s $8bn. Companies in the UK benchmark employ 4.6m people (so each employee valued at just $426k) and generates much more sales ($2tn vs $275bn at Apple). But the equity market has responded to the latest bout of QE by rerating Apple not the FTSE 100. This may encourage CEOs of the UK’s biggest 100 companies to adopt more Apple-like business models, so shed employees and reduce capex. Policymakers should take note. Presumably, they want CEOs to do exactly the opposite.Note also that the new breed of ESG investors might also prefer them to move in this direction. The FTSE-100 is full of companies that don’t tend to look good on ESG criteria, which favor big Apple-like companies that aren’t labor-intensive and don’t invest a huge amount in capital and equipment. Apple has reached the kind of valuation where it is no longer an obvious buy. Still, such companies should continue to do well — and that might not be helpful for hopes of a swift economic recovery, in the U.K. or elsewhere. That leads us to another repetitive issue for the U.K.: Brexit Is Back With a BangFor reasons best known to itself, the U.K.'s government has decided to start another fight over Brexit, the long-running saga of the country's decision to leave the European Union. By bringing a bill that would revoke parts of its agreement signed with the EU over how trade with Northern Ireland would be regulated after Brexit, and admitting that this would breach international law, it has brought back all the pathologies that dominated British markets and politics for all of last year. It has also enraged its counterparts in the EU, with which it has to negotiate a new trade agreement by the end of this year. In consequence, the pound has dropped toward the bottom of the range in which it has traded against the euro since Britain voted to leave in 2016:Politically, there may be a judgment that being aggressive with the EU will show the working-class voters who flocked to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives in last year’s election that he is trying to fulfill his promises. The political logic is similar to President Trump’s continuing attempts to build a border wall with Mexico, and spar with China. But there are serous issues here.As with the last tortured 12 months before the December 2019 general election, there are threats of rebellion from Conservative MPs over the government’s announcement that it will deliberately break conditions on the treatment of trade with Northern Ireland agreed to less than a year ago. However, these aren’t the same Conservative rebels who tried to stop Brexit from happening, almost all of whom are now out of the party, out of parliament, or both. Rather, opposition is now led by enthusiastic proponents of leaving the EU. For example, Lord Howard, a former Conservative leader said the admission that the government planned to breach international law were “words which I never thought I would hear uttered by a British minister - far less a Conservative minister.” He added: “How can we reproach Russia or China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?”This is strong stuff, and very relevant. The point of leaving the EU is that the U.K. can set itself up as “global Britain” and make new trade agreements with countries around the world, without having to go through the Brussels bureaucracy. Getting such accords with anyone will be much harder now that the government proposes to breach a vitally important trade agreement less than a year after a signing it.There may be some clever game theory going on; if so, it is an extremely dangerous game. As for the pound, a weaker currency might help a little to alleviate the problem of leaving a large free trade bloc. But if the British government really does go through with the strategy it is now advertising, the chances are that it will leave the bloc without a deal and therefore that the worst will finally come to the worst, in the eyes of the currency markets. If, as is perhaps on balance more likely, the forces of reason within Britain manage to force a climbdown and a messy compromise (which is how the current agreement on Northern Ireland came into being in the first place), then sterling is nicely positioned for a strong rise.  Survival TipsSometimes you have to admit defeat. I find the whole process by which it appears that Oracle Corp. is to end up owning TikTok so bizarre that I cannot come up with anything to say about it. Oracle is about helping productivity in the workplace, and TikTok is about diminishing productivity more or less everywhere. I don’t see the synergy.Having failed to come up with anything in the way of worthwhile analysis, I can at least offer this guide on how to TikTok. Meanwhile, the worst thing about the whole episode is that it leaves no doubt at all that I’m getting older. The kids love TikTok.

2020-09-14,"The exact nature of the agreement between TikTok and Oracle remains unclear, but it was not described as an outright sale.",TikTok to Pursue Partnership with Oracle; Microsoft Proposal Rejected
2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Heartiest of congratulations go to Microsoft Corp. Six weeks after announcing to the world it was in talks to buy TikTok, the American software giant comes out to tell us it didn’t get the gig.Instead, Oracle Corp. looks set to buy the international version of the short-video service from Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., though deal terms are still to be finalized. In missing out, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella dodges a bullet. Now, it’s aimed straight at Oracle and Chairman Larry Ellison, a cheerleader for American technology and supporter of President Donald Trump — who fired one of the guns in this bizarre scenario.What Nadella’s team started out offering around $25 billion for ended up being a whole lot less than they thought, and will go down in history as one of the most calamitous examples of government interference in corporate history.Let’s recap: TikTok went viral around the world as an app popular with lip-syncing kids, but the U.S. government claims it’s a national security threat because the company collects reams of data on American citizens. Recognizing those concerns, Microsoft announced in early August it was in talks to buy TikTok, and would let us know the result by Sept. 15 (it subsequently brought Walmart Inc. into the deal). Days later, Trump issued an executive order banning any American entity from doing business with ByteDance. That effectively forced the sale of TikTok, with a deadline this week.Beijing eventually called Trump’s bluff and decided that any sale of Chinese artificial intelligence technology needs to get prior approval. That threw a spanner in the works, because while data is what Washington fears, it’s the technology and algorithms that are truly of value. TikTok had developed its share. Beijing is reported to prefer that the service be shut down entirely than have it carved up in a forced sale.While Microsoft’s initial interest is a head-scratcher — it’s been moving away from consumer technology for the past decade — the reality of this involuntary divestiture has become clear. TikTok and ByteDance are caught between two governments that maybe aren’t so different after all. That the pawn in this tech Cold War doesn’t make weapons or semiconductors but purveys short videos for adolescents makes the situation even more absurd.Just weeks ago, there was reportedly a lineup of big names keen to get their hands on this hip new app, which makes Instagram look middle-aged. Oracle figured it should have a shot, perhaps reasoning that the technology and algorithms that TikTok developed are of greater value beyond a library of teenage make-up tutorials.But now a deal may go ahead, to a company with no business in consumer technology and most likely without the underlying technologies that helped make TikTok such a phenomenon. Despite Ellison’s backing for Trump, there’s no guarantee the separation of TikTok from ByteDance will be clean enough to pass White House muster. There's also great uncertainty whether Beijing will let the deal proceed at all.Welcome to the new era of tech Cold War deal-making: absurd, calamitous and only just beginning. The companies that win in this new world order of cross-border acquisitions will be the those most willing to walk away when things fall apart.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-09-14,"ByteDance is pursuing a partnership with Oracle as a way to avoid the sale of US operations of its TikTok business, Reuters reported.According to the Reuters report, Oracle (ORCL) will become ByteDance's preferred technology partner and will take control of TikTok’s US operations. Additionally, Oracle is also in talks to take an equity stake in TikTok’s US assets.Notably, President Donald Trump administration had imposed a deadline of September 20 for the Beijing-based company to announce a sale of TikTok’s US business by September 20 or face a complete ban by September 29. Therefore, the company had been in talks with companies including Walmart and Microsoft to divest the TikTok’s US assets.However, by partnering with Oracle, ByteDance hopes that it could avoid the ban without selling the business. Microsoft said ByteDance had informed it that it would not be selling it TikTok’s U.S. operations, according to the report.For Oracle, the transaction would provide exposure in the fast-growing social media industry and help diversify its business from only enterprise-facing to consumer-facing as well. Oracle has significant technological prowess in handling data. (See ORCL stock analysis on TipRanks).On September 11, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow raised Oracle stock’s price target to $59 (3.5% upside potential) from $52 and reiterated a Hold rating. Lenschow is impressed with the company’s strong 1Q results despite continued macro-economic headwinds.Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 7 Buys, 15 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average price target of $60.14 implies upside potential of about 5.5% to current levels.

2020-09-14,"Oracle Corp.

(NASDAQ: MSFT) in a bidding war that would reportedly not result in an outright sale.The back-and-forth came about after U.S. Presient Donald Trump threatened to ban the app if a deal wasn't reached by Sept. 20.Per the WSJ, Oracle is expected to be announced as TikTok's &quot;trusted tech partner&quot; in the U.S.Some StatsTikTok touts approximately 100 million U.S. monthly active users. That's up abut 800% percent from Jan. 2018.The service, owned by the Chinese technology giant ByteDance, claims to have been downloaded some 2 billion times globally. About 50 million users are active on the app each day.TikTok users have wielded the platform to create viral content and even achieve fame. Among the app's most popular users are Charli D'Amelio, Addison Rae, Chase Hudson, Dixie D'Amelio and Avani Gregg.The app, popular among Gen Z, first drew the ire of Trump back in June in the weeks leading up to a political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

2020-09-14,"Over the past three months, shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) moved higher by 14.06%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Oracle has.Oracle's Debt According to the Oracle's most recent financial statement as reported on June 22, 2020, total debt is at $71.60 billion, with $69.23 billion in long-term debt and $2.37 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $37.24 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $34.36 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Oracle has $115.44 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.62. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Price Over Earnings Overview: Oracle  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * What Does Oracle's Debt Look Like?(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Douyin, the Chinese-market version of ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok video-sharing app, surpassed 600 million daily active users in August, rising from 400 million at the start of the year.The service has produced 41.7 billion yuan ($6.1 billion) in revenue for more than 22 million creators over the past year and the company intends to spend $1.5 billion in a push to double that figure over the next 12 months, said ByteDance China Chief Executive Officer Kelly Zhang. Speaking at the Douyin Creator Conference Tuesday, Zhang detailed the growth of Douyin’s audience and the efforts to bolster and diversify income streams for creators.ByteDance has seen its international hit TikTok banned in India and under existential threat in the U.S., where the company is negotiating a deal to appease authorities in partnership with Oracle Corp. That makes Douyin, already an important growth driver, even more critical to the parent company’s fortunes. ByteDance previously disclosed that its global stable of apps has 1.5 billion monthly active users.Started in 2016, Douyin has overtaken older rivals like Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed Kuaishou to become China’s biggest short-video-sharing platform, with the backing of ByteDance’s powerful algorithms. While advertising remains a major revenue stream for Douyin as well as ByteDance as a whole, Douyin has in recent years introduced new features including live streams and e-commerce that allow users to spend more time and money within the app.Reputable Douyin creators are able to set up their own in-app stores -- featured prominently on their profile pages and linked to during their online sessions -- that hawk everything from lipstick to smartphones.

A recommendation, Mnuchin added, would be made by the end of the week.Mnuchin, who clarified that the deadline for a sale was September 20, said &quot;we'll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure; Americans' data is secure; that the phones are secure; and we'll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams&quot;.&quot;We'll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it will be sold,&quot; US President Donald Trump said last week.

Feels like this soap opera is not over yet.&quot;In July, Trump declared that TikTok must have an American owner to insure that the large amounts of user data it possesses was not handled improperly. That left the app, which is owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance, less than three months to complete a transaction.Talks for the sale stalled earlier this month when the Chinese government passed new rules restricting the export of artificial intelligence technology - possibly including that used by TikTok - that could require Beijing's approval for any sale of the company to a non-Chinese owner.Without the AI technology powering the algorithm that TikTok uses to analyse user behaviour, analysts said the app would become much less valuable.On Thursday, the White House was reportedly considering whether to give the company more time to reach a sale.ByteDance was also reportedly in discussions with the administration about alternatives that would let it sell part of TikTok's assets, yet bypass any approval by China.But Trump denied such consideration and said he would not extend his deadline.&quot;There will be no extension of the TikTok deadline. We'll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it will be sold,&quot; he told reporters on Thursday.Oracle confirmed it had reached a deal to become the &quot;technology partner&quot; of TikTok, the popular video-sharing app. Photo: Getty Images North America via AFP alt=Oracle confirmed it had reached a deal to become the &quot;technology partner&quot; of TikTok, the popular video-sharing app. Photo: Getty Images North America via AFPWhen Trump said in July that TikTok must have an American owner to insure that the large amounts of user data it possesses were not handled improperly, the comment raised questions about whether the government could ban an app.But - also citing national security concerns - the administration had already taken similar action against Huawei Technologies, the Chinese tech giant, putting the company and its affiliates on the Commerce Department's &quot;entity list&quot;. Being placed on the list sharply restricted the ability of those companies to do business with American firms; in one result, Google blocked Huawei's access to its Android operating system.ByteDance kicks ball into Trump's court by picking Oracle as TikTok partnerThe US first put TikTok on its radar last year, saying that the app, which has more than 100 million American users, posed a national security risk because of a Chinese law that obliges its Chinese owner to hand over user data to the Chinese government.The White House ordered CFIUS to review ByteDance's 2017 US$1 billion purchase of Musical.ly - an app that was later renamed TikTok.In an effort to distance itself from ByteDance, TikTok in May brought on Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive, as its US chief. But Mayer abruptly resigned in late August, saying that the job had shifted, given the &quot;sharply changed&quot; political environment.Kevin Mayer left after three months as chief executive of TikTok's US operations, saying the job had shifted because of the &quot;sharply changed&quot; political environment.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the app in a pair of executive orders issued last month based on U.S. national security concerns.The terms of the agreement seem to fall short of meeting those national security concerns expressed by administration officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to people familiar with the matter. Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr and other members of the administration have been talking directly with Oracle executives, one person said.Trump, speaking Wednesday with reporters, said he is getting a briefing on the issue Thursday morning, adding that he didn’t like the idea of ByteDance retaining control of TikTok.“Just conceptually, I can tell you I don’t like that,” he said after a reporter told him that Bytedance would retain a majority of the company’s assets, with Oracle acquiring a minority stake.“I’m not prepared to sign off of anything,” Trump said. “I have to see the deal.”TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The president is trailing his Democratic opponent Joe Biden in the polls and seeking to use his tough stance with Beijing as a selling point to voters. TikTok declined to comment. Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment.ByteDance plans to create a new standalone company for TikTok’s U.S. operations in which it would remain majority owner, but give Oracle and other American investors minority stakes in the new business. Public statements made by both companies calling Oracle the newly formed company’s “trusted technology partner” were met with confusion, one of the people said.The new details shed light on Oracle’s role in the partnership and go beyond just housing data inside the software company’s U.S. cloud servers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Oracle will be able to check all source code from the algorithms that decide which TikTok videos get shown to which U.S. users to ensure there are no entry points for the Chinese parent. Oracle, the world’s second-largest software maker, will be able to continue to review the technology as updates come in to make sure there are no new points of access to the data, the people said.Under the proposed deal, the newly formed TikTok would also hire an independent board approved by the U.S. government. The new U.S.-based company would allow oversight by a third party, which will report to the U.S. government and provide continuous audits, reports and protocols for handling any incidents that may arise, according to the people. That means if, say, Beijing finds a way to infiltrate TikTok’s code, Oracle and the independent board would have the means and agency to spot it.Despite the terms, administration officials remain wary about the proposed new ownership structure and how much influence that would give China over the company.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reviewed the proposed deal. Attorney General William Barr was only briefed on the deal Wednesday and is reviewing it, according to a Justice Department official who declined to comment further. Barr spoke with Oracle executives Wednesday morning, two people familiar with the situation said. Pompeo had a conversation the company officials last week.The Treasury, State and Justice departments are all part of the Committee for Foreign Investments in the U.S., or Cfius, which reviews deals for national security implications. In a meeting Tuesday afternoon, officials raised concerns about a deal that would leave a majority stake of TikTok’s U.S. assets in ByteDance’s hands, with Oracle taking a minority share, the people said.The proposal also calls for the newly formed U.S. company to hire 25,000 American workers in a wide range of jobs from content moderation, engineering, product and marketing.However, the company is not going to recreate the powerful algorithms that run the app based on data that ByteDance has collected for years, one person said. ByteDance will still have visibility into the algorithms, but Oracle will be able to monitor the data flows and review and approve all updates to the code.(Updates with comments from Trump in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Would Get Access to TikTok Code in Proposed Deal

2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’s not happy with what he’s heard about the terms of Oracle Corp.’s bid for the Chinese-owned video app TikTok but added he won’t be briefed on details until Thursday morning.“Just conceptually, I can tell you I don’t like that,” he said after a reporter told him that TikTok’s Chinese owner, Bytedance Ltd., would retain a majority of the company’s assets, with Oracle acquiring a minority stake.“I’m not prepared to sign off on anything,” Trump said, adding that he needs to hear more details of the proposal.Top Trump administration officials have raised concern that Oracle’s proposal for TikTok’s U.S. operations falls short of satisfying national-security concerns, according to people with the matter.

2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp.’s bid for TikTok falls short of resolving concerns of Trump administration officials that the Chinese-owned video-sharing app poses a risk to U.S. national security, according to people familiar with the matter.President Donald Trump has the authority to sign off on a deal, but continuing concerns from national security officials might sway his decision. The agreement remains on the table, with discussions continuing between administration officials and the companies, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are confidential.Addressing those remaining issues could clear the way for U.S. approval, the people said. The companies are still working to make their case with the government, according to the people, and think they can still prevail.At a press conference on Wednesday evening, Trump said he was not happy about what he was hearing about the bid, but added that he would be briefed on the details Thursday morning. “I’m not prepared to sign off on anything,” he said.He now has four days until a self-imposed Sept. 20 deadline to decide whether to approve a proposal by TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. to restructure the video app’s global operations as a new standalone company that would give Oracle and other American investors a minority stake.The officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, are concerned that after a potential transaction, ByteDance Ltd. could still have have access to user data from its nearly 100 million users in America, said the people. The officials remain wary about the proposed new ownership structure and how much influence that would give China over the company.Terms of the proposed deal would give Oracle full access to TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to access data on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter describing provisions submitted to the U.S. government over the weekend.The terms illuminate what the companies and security officials mean when they call Oracle a “trusted technology partner,” which goes beyond just housing data inside Oracle’s U.S. cloud servers, according to people with knowledge of the terms, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.Oracle would be able to check all source code from the algorithms that decide which videos get shown to which users to ensure there are no back doors and will be able to continue to review the technology as updates come in to make sure there are no new points of access, the people said.The newly formed TikTok would be headquartered in the U.S. and would hire an independent board approved by the U.S. government. The standalone company would also have oversight by a third party, which would report to the U.S. government and provide continuous audits, reports and protocols for handling any incidents that may arise, according to the people.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reviewed the proposed deal, according to some of the people. Attorney General William Barr was only briefed on the deal Wednesday and is reviewing it, according to a Justice Department official who declined further comment. Barr spoke with Oracle executives Wednesday morning, two people familiar with the situation said. Pompeo had a conversation the company officials last week.TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

The Justice Department official didn’t immediately reply to a question about whether the attorney general had spoken to Oracle.TikTok declined to comment.While user data from Americans would be stored by Oracle in the U.S., it appears the rest of the technology underpinning the app, including ownership of the prized algorithms that pick and choose which videos to show users, and the engineering teams in China that work on them, would remain in the hands of TikTok’s Chinese owner.Regardless of where the data is stored, critics of the deal say that national security concerns can’t be resolved as long as Tiktok’s Chinese parent wields financial control of the company.The Oracle agreement is facing sharp pushback in Congress, where some lawmakers have argued that its terms don’t go nearly far enough to address the reason why Trump demanded the sale in the first place. A letter sent to Trump on Wednesday by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and five other Republicans said the deal in its current reported form “leaves significant unresolved national security issues.”In a separate letter to Mnuchin, Texas Senator Ted Cruz also said the deal fell far short. Like other opponents, Cruz called for an “outright sale” of Tiktok if necessary. Some have also demanded TikTok turn over the algorithm that helps determine the content seen by users.Opposition like that from the senators is important because many of them have a direct line to Trump and will almost certainly lean on him to reject any deal they don’t like. Congressional rejection could also raise the prospect of reputational risks for Oracle because lawmakers could seek to shame the company for cutting a deal that they argue undercuts U.S. national security.The proposal presented to Cfius stands in stark contrast to what was originally called for by President Trump in a pair of executive orders issued last month calling for a ban of the app unless it was sold to an American owner.The new TikTok deal with Oracle doesn’t call for the software company to buy the business outright. Instead, Bytedance would maintain majority ownership and provides Oracle with a stake in the business and a role as a key technology partner.At least three shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company -- General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management -- would take stakes in the new business, said the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t finalized. Walmart Inc., which had previously partnered with Microsoft Corp. to make an outright bid for TikTok’s U.S. business, remains interested in investing as well, the company said earlier this week.The Oracle proposal being considered by Cfius also lacks the payment to the U.S. government that the president had insisted be the condition of any deal, according to two people familiar with the plan. Yet TikTok will try to use the promise of creating 20,000 new jobs through the popular video app as a way to win his approval, they said.The deal would also have to get the blessing from the Chinese government, which has outwardly scolded Trump for pushing a fire-sale of TikTok and publicly shown its support for Bytedance, recently giving the tech giant the green light to acquire a company with a coveted national digital payment license — a competitive arena that Beijing strictly controls.(Updates with Trump reaction, proposed deal terms, from fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle’s TikTok Bid Leaves Open Some U.S. Security Concerns
2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The more desperately Chinese firms seek a haven for their international operations, the more they’ll lean toward Singapore. Will their love be reciprocated? Amid the drumbeats of a U.S.-China cold war, the Southeast Asian island-state is often talked about as a sanctuary for capital looking to flee the clash of superpowers. But aging Singapore, with excess savings of its own, doesn’t want a truckload of new money. Business investments, however, are very different from potentially destabilizing financial flows. They create jobs, provide new orders to local vendors, and spark optimism about the future, something rather badly needed amid the Covid-19 despondence. That’s why Singapore must be pleased to see Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd. coming to the city with investment plans worth billions of dollars.All of them have their own reasons for flocking to the nation of 5.7 million people. According to Bloomberg News, Alibaba is exploring a $3 billion investment in Grab Holdings Inc., which is pivoting from a Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm to a regional super app with finance at its core.Grab has applied for a Singapore digital bank license, and so has Alibaba-backed Ant Group, the world’s hottest fintech,  awaiting its initial public offering in Hong Kong.(1) Reuters reported in June that Grab and Tencent-backed Sea Ltd., a Singaporean maker of online games, have made the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s shortlist.Running a regulated bank in Singapore comes with a valuable coupon: free admission into the U.S.-dominated global financial network. This may be important for Chinese fintech firms in case Beijing decides to run a parallel system of its own. The vehicle for that push might be the digital yuan, which could erode the moat built by Ant’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay. More immediately, access to Grab’s customers in Southeast Asia may help Alibaba-backed online bazaar Lazada in its fight against Tencent-backed rival Shopee app, Bloomberg Intelligence has noted. Tencent, meanwhile, may also be eyeing Singapore to skirt situations like New Delhi’s ban on the video game PUBG mobile, for which it had the India publishing rights. WeChat is already a Trump administration target. As escalating violence on its border with China draws India closer to the U.S., globally-minded Chinese firms need neutral addresses to avoid becoming collateral damage. Ditto for ByteDance, which is trying to save its TikTok video-sharing platform’s U.S. operations by partnering with Oracle Corp. The Beijing-based firm, which has also applied for a Singapore virtual bank license, will make the city its beachhead for Asia. Singapore, which never had powerful domestic business interests to protect, isn’t new to foreigners wanting a piece of it. In the late 1960s, the likes of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp. came for semiconductor assembly. Young women putting together pieces of ceramics, aluminum wire and a one-inch-wide lead frame played a big role in turning Singapore — along with Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan — into Asian exporting powerhouses. It’s too early to say if the U.S.-China conflict will have a similarly large and enduring impact. In areas like data centers, Singapore is benefiting. Measured by power supply, it’s the world’s largest repository for storing and processing data, with Facebook Inc. alone setting up an 11-story facility. Hong Kong has lost its special trading status with the U.S. over a Beijing-imposed national security law. Singapore has free-trade accords with both countries. The one with China was widened last year to include e-commerce.  To be sure, Singapore’s population is far less willing than before to accept a never-ending stream of overseas professionals in exchange for prosperity. Still, what’s the alternative? Visitor arrivals in July were down 99.6% from a year earlier. Singapore Airlines Ltd. is slashing a fifth of its workforce. As long as the new Chinese investors don’t ask for too many foreign employment passes, Singapore will give them a shelter to sit out the cold war. If nothing else, the island’s nascent startup economy will get a fillip. Financial capital won’t be walking on the same red carpet. Hong Kong can live with private-sector credit three times the size of the economy and a property market pushed into the stratosphere of unaffordability. The same strategy would amount to political suicide in Singapore, where the bedrock of prosperity is real estate. A deflated housing bubble could prove costly for the People’s Action Party, in power since 1959. Unlike Hong Kong, which ultimately has the protection of the bigger Chinese economy, Singapore has no parachutes. It dare not crash.(1) Ant, though, has applied for a wholesale digital bank license, which means it can't take retail deposits.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-09-16,Oracle's is still trying to placate the Trump administration's national security concerns about its deal for TikTok.,Oracle Scrambles To Address Trump's TikTok National Security Fears: Reports
2020-09-16,"Shares of Oracle Corp.  edged higher in the extended session Wednesday after dipping in the regular trading day after a report that its bid for TikTok had not resolved national-security concerns. According to Bloomberg News, which cited people familiar with the matter, the software giant's proposal for the Beijing-based social-media company remains on the table and discussions are ongoing. According to the report, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, remain concerned that TikTok's owner ByteDance Ltd. would still have access to user data from its nearly 100 million users in the U.S. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that national-security regulators are reviewing the proposal and aiming for a resolution by Sunday. Shares of Oracle ended the regular trading day down 0.8%.",Oracle's TikTok proposal falls short of security concerns: report
2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is preparing to decide whether to approve Oracle Corp.’s alliance with the Chinese-owned video app TikTok after security experts examined the companies’ proposal.A U.S. national security panel reviewed the bid Tuesday afternoon, but didn’t make a recommendation that the president approve or reject the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said his staff are “very close to a deal” and signaled what could be telling support for Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman.“I have a high respect for Larry Ellison,” he said. “He’s somebody I know, he’s been really a terrific guy for a long time.”The proposal, unveiled in part, doesn’t call for Oracle to buy the business outright. Instead, the company would invest in a newly restructured global TikTok, with operations based in the U.S., according to people familiar with the proposal. Bytedance would maintain majority ownership and at least three shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company -- General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management -- would take stakes in the new business, said the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t finalized.Oracle’s proposal lacks the payment to the U.S. government that the president has insisted be the condition of any deal, according to two people familiar with the plan. Yet the company will try to use the promise of creating 20,000 new jobs through the popular video app as a way to win his approval, they said.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has played a central role in brokering a deal that would shift the Chinese-owned video app’s U.S. operations over to an American company, leads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, and has promised to give Trump the panel’s recommendation this week.White House adviser Jared Kushner voiced strong support for Oracle’s bid for TikTok during an interview with CNBC earlier Tuesday, even though the proposal could still fall short of President Donald Trump’s demands that any deal protect national security and include the payout to the U.S. government.The U.S. is undertaking a two-track national security review of the TikTok proposal this week and any sale still requires sign-offs from both the U.S. and China. One is through Cfius, and a separate one is through the Commerce Department.While details of the agreement between Oracle and China’s ByteDance Ltd. remain under wraps, Kushner expressed optimism that it would clear the administration’s key hurdles.“Hopefully the application qualifies on the merits for what we’re trying to accomplish from a national security point of view,” Kushner said. “America’s interest in that is really national security -- we want to make sure that people’s data is protected.”The deal unveiled Monday by Oracle seeks to address the national-security concerns that Trump raised last month when he ordered the sale of TikTok’s U.S. business. The administration says that Chinese ownership of the app poses a risk to American users’ data security and that Beijing could use the service to deliver disinformation and propaganda to the service’s 100 million active users in the U.S.Based on what’s been revealed so far about the deal, national security experts say the arrangement doesn’t satisfy those concerns, which the Trump administration laid out in executive orders and public statements.“It’s not clear the first goal has been met and the second goal is even more difficult,” said Stewart Baker, a national security lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson and a former assistant secretary with the Homeland Security Department. “There could still be a lot of negotiating to do.”The companies haven’t fully addressed Trump’s repeated demand for a payment to the U.S. Government. “I said the United States has to be compensated, well compensated,” he reiterated earlier this month, a demand that has confounded security experts who say such a payment would stretch his authority under U.S. law.Even if security officials recommend Trump block the deal, the president has the final say and he can overrule their recommendation. Trump has until Sept. 20 to make a decision.The deal, if finalized, would create what Mnuchin called “TikTok Global.” The unit would have its headquarters in the U.S. and create 20,000 jobs, he said, without offering details.It’s unclear how a new subsidiary would create that many U.S.-based jobs. TikTok has hundreds of open jobs listed right now, from content moderation to advertising sales. Snapchat Inc., which operates a social media app similar to TikTok, employs 3,000. By comparison, Facebook Inc., the owner of Instagram Inc., had more than 52,000 employees at the end of June.TikTok and the Treasury Department declined to comment. A representative for Oracle didn’t reply to requests for comment.Cfius includes members from the State, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security departments. The panel assesses deals for national security implications by looking at factors that include: U.S. business’s contracts and ties with the federal government; as well as whether the deal involves critical infrastructure, such as transport systems, data networks and other communication systems.Bytedance has been working with Cfius since October 2019 on addressing the committee’s concerns, according to a person familiar with the matter, and for months has been trying to separate somewhat from China, including hiring a new CEO and giving autonomy to U.S. executives for the app’s bug fixes and product changes. The company had already began moving data and content moderation to the U.S., where it stores its data with firms like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, with backup servers in Singapore. If Cfius accepts these remedies, it could allow Bytedance to keep control of one of its prized assets, the person said.Even if TikTok’s data is stored by Oracle in the U.S., that could could still leave ByteDance with some control over the computer code behind how the app chooses which videos are shown to users. If TikTok’s algorithms remain in ByteDance’s hands, security experts say, the code could be manipulated by Beijing to run information campaigns or deliberately show video to American users, perhaps even to influence the U.S. elections.(Corrects Facebook employee figures in 17th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Nears Decision on Oracle-TikTok Bid
2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of Republican senators sent a letter to the Trump administration Wednesday outlining their opposition to a proposed deal between Oracle Corp. and ByteDance Ltd. that would allow the Chinese company to maintain majority ownership of TikTok, despite an order by the U.S. president that the popular video app sever its ties to China on national security concerns.The lawmakers are trying to get ahead of a ruling expected this week by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, on a plan that includes Oracle as a “trusted technology partner.” TikTok sent a proposal to the U.S. Treasury Department over the weekend and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the committee’s members would deliver a verdict to President Donald Trump this week.The deal, which needs the blessing of Trump and the Chinese government to become final, would create what Mnuchin called “TikTok Global.” It would see a newly structured global company headquartered in the U.S., with Oracle and other U.S. investors taking minority stakes in the business.The proposal stands in stark contrast to the original outlines of a deal requested by Trump, which required TikTok’s Chinese parent to sever ties with the app in the U.S. and agree to an outright sale of the U.S. operations. Now, lawmakers are questioning how any deal in which ByteDance Ltd. remains the majority owner of the app and retains control over TikTok would address the U.S. government’s national security concerns.“We remain opposed to any deal that would allow China-based or controlled entities to retain, control or modify the code or algorithms that operate any U.S.-based version of TikTok,” wrote the group, which included senators Marco Rubio, Thom Tillis, Roger Wicker, Rick Scott, Dan Sullivan, and John Cornyn.“We are heartened that this deal still requires government approval, and if reports indicating this proposed deal will retain links to ByteDance or other Chinese-controlled entities, we strongly urge the Administration to reject such a proposal on national security grounds,” they said.Republican Senators Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn have also pushed back against the deal. “If we’ve got American ownership and there’s a new platform built out from top to bottom and the backdoors in the code are closed, I think that’s fine,” said Hawley. If the U.S. agrees to a deal that doesn’t include those things, he added, “we’ve got a big problem.”In a speech to the National Democratic Institute on Wednesday, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, criticized how the Trump administration has handled the TikTok deal in ways that will invite retaliation.“When we draw lines to prohibit certain technologies that don’t meet those principles from entering the U.S., it must be done honestly or else it smacks of the kind of protectionism that we have fought against in managed economies,” Warner said. “To this end, the Trump administration’s Clean Network Initiative and haphazard actions on TikTok fail that test and will only invite retaliation against American companies.”(Updates with Josh Hawley comments in the seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Republican Senators Send Letter To Trump Opposing TikTok-Oracle Deal
2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- With just days to go until President Donald Trump’s ban on TikTok in the U.S. comes into effect, the race is on for the video-sharing app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., to win approval for its plan to avoid a shutdown.Technology giant Oracle Corp. has emerged as the Beijing-based company’s chosen partner for a deal, beating out Microsoft Corp. But instead of an outright sale as ordered by Trump, the deal on the table affords Oracle only a minority stake in a company that will continue to be controlled by ByteDance. There’s still much to be decided before the Sept. 20 deadline. Here’s a rundown what we know so far, what’s still up in the air and what could happen next.What We KnowWho’s in and who’s outOracle confirmed in a brief statement Monday that it’s part of the proposal ByteDance has submitted to the U.S. Treasury Department to resolve the row over TikTok. The statement was light on details, but referred to Oracle as the company’s “trusted technology provider.” Microsoft, the previous presumed frontrunner, said its bid had been rejected.What the deal looks likeInstead of an outright sale, the transaction is being seen as a corporate restructuring. People familiar with the proposal have said Oracle would make an investment in TikTok, alongside existing ByteDance shareholders including General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Capital.Oracle would be responsible for storing users’ data in the U.S.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has referred to the new entity that would come out of the Oracle deal as “TikTok Global.” He said the business would have its headquarters in the U.S. and create 20,000 jobs.Oracle will try to use the promise of jobs as a way to win Trump’s approval, according to people familiar with the matter.What Trump thinks of it, for nowThe president said Tuesday that a deal is “very close.” He added that Oracle founder Larry Ellison has been “really a terrific guy for a long time,” a show of potential support for the deal.Trump won’t get his payoutThe president has repeatedly insisted that any deal would have to include a substantial payment to the U.S. But the current outlines of the deal don’t include any such payment.Senators Oppose the dealA group of Republican senators sent a letter to the Trump administration Wednesday outlining their concerns that the deal would allow ByteDance to retain majority control.What We Don’t KnowThe exact terms of the dealWhile Oracle and some existing shareholders are likely to invest, it’s unclear how much of the new TikTok entity they would own or how it would be valued. Walmart Inc.’s role is also unknown: the retail giant had teamed up with Microsoft as part of that company’s proposal, but has since said that it remains in talks with ByteDance and other interested parties.If it’ll pass a national-security reviewThough details are light, based on what’s been revealed so far about the deal, national security experts have told Bloomberg News that the arrangement doesn’t satisfy concerns laid out by the Trump administration in executive orders and public statements. However, even if security officials recommend Trump block the deal, the president has the final say and can overrule their recommendation.When it’ll get doneWhile Trump initially said he wanted a deal by Sept. 15, the ban on TikTok’s U.S. operations that he signed last month in a bid to force a sale requires the company to act by Sept. 20. Trump indicated last week that the deadline wouldn’t be extended. A separate decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, requires a sale by mid-November.What will happen to the algorithmsOne of the big questions is what will happen to the source code underpinning the social media platform in a restructuring.

2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc. Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman took his company’s record $3.36 billion initial public offering in stride, describing it as just another step in the software maker’s plan to disrupt the database market.“So far, so good,” Slootman said Wednesday in an interview. “We needed to do this for a number of reasons, especially to raise the stature of the company in the marketplace. We sell to the largest companies in the world and we also compete with the largest companies in the world, so it’s really important.”The San Mateo, California-based company made a name for itself earlier in the day, with the biggest U.S. IPO of the year and the largest ever for a software maker. Snowflake’s shares more than doubled to $253.93 after the debut, which came in the midst of high Wall Street enthusiasm for cloud-computing stocks. Many of these companies, which deliver applications or services over the internet, have resisted the worst effects of a pandemic-fueled recession, and some have thrived while businesses, schools and governments operate remotely.Investors have been on the lookout for the next Zoom Video Communications Inc., which has generated triple-digit year-over-year sales growth two quarters in a row. Rapidly growing Snowflake seems well on its way -- attaining a market value of $70 billion after its first day of trading.Slootman said he has spent a year trying to build a base of institutional investors who would keep billion-dollar stakes in Snowflake for at least five to 10 years and be shareholders more focused on long-term success than short-term “momentum.” This is part of the “carefully orchestrated” strategy he and longtime business partner, Chief Financial Officer Mike Scarpelli, put in place.Snowflake’s IPO surge is a culmination of the broader success of cloud-based companies, said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research.“Cloud has gone from a proof of concept or for things that were less critical to companies realizing it will enable a much more agile and modern architecture and working style,” Elman said.Snowflake is the third technology company Slootman has publicly listed and he admits the novelty and excitement of an IPO has worn off a bit. He said he’s more interested in hiring, building partnerships and selling technology so that the company can meet its potential -- and he has no designs on pulling off a fourth IPO.“Just staying on this growth trajectory takes one hell of an effort,” he said. “I’ll be here until they rip the jersey off my back.”At the request of clients, the company has put more resources into developing databases that can process online transactions, to boost future growth, he said. The CEO, who is now a billionaire because of Snowflake’s stock surge, acknowledged how improbable it is that an eight-year-old upstart is now a formidable rival to the likes of Amazon.com Inc., the leader in public cloud services, and database stalwart Oracle Corp.“Industries get attacked from the most unpredictable places,” he said. “You never see them coming because they’re under the radar and I’m sure Oracle never felt they had anything to fear from a company called Snowflake. But I always like to say, babies become soldiers.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Snowflake’s CEO on Having Year’s Biggest IPO: ‘So Far, So Good’"
2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Is this really what it’s come to?Two companies, one American and one Chinese, make a deal. The deal is contingent on U.S. government approval. It is difficult to see the U.S. company’s justification for doing the deal — it sells boring-but-necessary software to businesses while the Chinese company is a quirky social media phenomenon beloved by teenagers.Except for one thing: the top two leaders of the American company — which of course is Oracle Corp. — are staunch supporters of President Donald Trump. Oracle founder Larry Ellison threw a fund-raiser for Trump, and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz has donated more than $130,000 on his reelection bid. Minus that relationship, it is a near certainty that Trump would reject its deal with the Chinese company, ByteDance Ltd., which created TikTok. Because of that relationship, it is a near certainty that he will approve it.I can scarcely imagine a situation that is a greater violation of American capitalism. The idea that a country’s leader  decides which deals get done and which don’t — and that it’s contingent on how friendly the company is with the leader — is how it works in, say, Putin’s Russia. One of great strengths of American-style capitalism is that companies succeed or fail on the merits — and that government’s role is mostly that of impartial referee. Trump has repeatedly trampled over the norms of American governance and weakened the rule of law. If he approves the Oracle-TikTok deal, which seems likely, he will be continuing his degradation of American business practices as well.And yet — and this is the part I find astounding — nobody even blinks. “Oracle’s courting of Trump may help it land TikTok’s business and coveted user data,” read the headline in the Washington Post the other day, as if this were the most normal thing in the world. According to the Wall Street Journal, several ByteDance investors in Silicon Valley “went in search of a tech company with close ties to the administration”— knowing that a company that Trump favored had perhaps the only chance of succeeding. Again, this was reported as if it were unremarkable.At this point, nobody expects the Republicans in Congress to object seriously to anything Trump does, no matter how awful, although a group of GOP senators sent a letter to the administration on Wednesday expressing their concerns. But even Democrats have raised few objections to the Oracle deal. Experts on authoritarian regimes often talk about how people gradually become accustomed to government practices that should, by all rights, horrify them. The reaction to the Oracle-TikTok deal would suggest that is happening here.Even before Oracle entered the arena, Trump’s moves against TikTok were — or should have been — unacceptable. In July, Trump first suggested a TikTok ban as a way of punishing China for what he called its role in spreading the coronavirus. A few weeks later, when he issued an executive order calling for the popular app to be banned by Sept. 15, his rationale was national security: TikTok “threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information,” which, he claimed, might give China the ability to blackmail federal employees.Even if this were true — and there are many doubters — a ban was hardly an appropriate response from an American president. As Wired put it, “Outlawing TikTok would … mean the U.S. would be participating in the same Chinese-style internet-sovereignty tactics it has long criticized.”As companies circled TikTok, hoping to keep it alive in the U.S. by buying it outright from ByteDance, China struck back. It issued new export control rules that outlawed the export of certain technologies that TikTok used. That’s the kind of arbitrary move you expect from the Chinese. When TikTok’s primary suitor, Microsoft, proposed a deal that would have satisfied the Trump administration’s concerns — it was going to buy TikTok outright, which would have given it control of its algorithms — ByteDance turned it down. It didn’t have much choice.Oracle, of course, is not buying TikTok. It will not take control of its algorithms. Its label is going to be TikTok’s “trusted technology partner.” The deal has been submitted to the Treasury Department for review, with both companies saying that it will “resolve the administration’s security concerns,” as TikTok said in a statement. But who knows?The bet Oracle and TikTok are making — and a very cynical wager at that — is that Ellison and Catz’s long-standing support of Trump will cause the president to forget about his supposed national security concerns and allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. pretty much the same as it had before this whole dust-up began. It seems pretty likely that is what will happen. “I have a high respect for Larry Ellison,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “He’s really a terrific guy.”With Trump, that’s pretty much all you need to know.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok-parent company ByteDance Ltd., is showing Donald Trump he knows something about dealmaking too.In his proposal to partner with Oracle Corp. to address U.S. security concerns about the hit video app, the Chinese entrepreneur is offering Trump something the president has already declared unacceptable. The question now is whether Trump rejects the proposal, acquiesces or, perhaps most likely for the man behind the ‘Art of the Deal,’ opens negotiations for a compromise.The president has said that TikTok must be sold to an American owner -- or shut down. What Zhang has proposed instead is a partnership with Oracle that would allow ByteDance to retain majority ownership of the business, while the U.S. software giant becomes its “trusted technology provider” to protect user data. Trump said Tuesday a decision would come “soon,” and a security panel met to review the proposal.Final details are in flux, but ByteDance’s venture investors may also take equity stakes in the TikTok business. It’s also possible the Chinese parent will try to keep full ownership of the unit, according to one person familiar with the discussions.China hawks quickly declared the offer dead on arrival. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, wrote a letter to the U.S. Treasury Secretary saying that the administration should “promptly reject” the partnership and press the Chinese parent to work out a “more acceptable solution.”Zhang’s opening gambit may simply be aimed at buying himself more time as he tries to survive the clash of the world’s two superpowers. He is starting from a tough stance to open negotiations and avoid an immediate TikTok shutdown. It’s a lesson that could have been taken directly from Trump’s memoir on his days in real estate.“The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it,” the president wrote in his best-selling autobiography with Tony Schwartz. “That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you’re dead.”Zhang is offering a few things likely to resonate with Trump. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday ByteDance’s proposal would create 20,000 jobs and bring to the U.S. the headquarters for “TikTok Global,” presumably the video app’s entire international operation. Trump has made bringing jobs to the country a cornerstone of his campaign as he heads toward November’s presidential election.Zhang has also aligned himself with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a fervent supporter of the president who appears to have his trust. That alliance may persuade Trump to accept a deal from Oracle he wouldn’t from another company.Trump called Ellison “a tremendous guy” in August and praised him again on Tuesday.“I have a high respect for Larry Ellison,” the president said. “He’s somebody I know, he’s been really a terrific guy for a long time.”Oracle’s proposal lacks a payment to the U.S. government that the president has insisted be the condition of any deal, according to two people familiar with the plan.Trump has made TikTok the central example of his campaign to get tough on China. He signed an executive order that bans the app in the U.S. on Sept. 20, and, in addition, ruled that ByteDance must sell the video app’s U.S. assets by mid-November under an order from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS.QuickTake: All About Cfius, Trump’s Watchdog on China DealmakingHeading into the last weekend of August, Zhang had been leaning toward a proposal from Microsoft Corp., where he had briefly worked. The agreement called for a full buyout of TikTok U.S. by the software giant and partner Walmart Inc.But the Chinese government intervened at the last minute with a new set of restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, including those used in the app. Beijing insisted its regulators must also approve any asset sales by ByteDance.China’s move was seen as an effort to give Zhang more leverage. He couldn’t give away too much to the Trump administration or Beijing wouldn’t sign off.Instead, Zhang turned to Ellison and Oracle. Best known for its corporate software, the Redwood City, Calif.-based company has a growing cloud computing business that could be used to host videos and strong technical capabilities for securing user data. Ellison is also known for his fierce combativeness. When Hewlett Packard fired its CEO for an alleged inappropriate relationship, Ellison called it -- publicly -- “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs.”What Zhang and Ellison crafted is nothing like the deal that the Trump administration had anticipated. Instead of buying the business outright, Oracle would make an investment in a newly restructured TikTok, people familiar with the proposal said. At least two shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company, General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, would take stakes in the new business, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t finalized.“Based on the information that we have at the moment about the Oracle deal, I can’t say that I’m hugely reassured,” Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Bloomberg Television. “ByteDance is essentially under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.”Yet Mnuchin made it sound like the proposal is worthy of serious consideration.“We need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, phones are secure, and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical team,” Mnuchin told CNBC during an interview early Monday.Even if TikTok’s data is stored by Oracle in the U.S., ByteDance could keep some control over the app’s algorithms, the computer code behind what the service uses to pick and choose which videos are shown to which users. If TikTok’s algorithms remain in the hands of ByteDance, they run the risk of being manipulated by Beijing.“The CCP has enormous leverage over this company and that means it would be trivially easy for the CCP to force ByteDance to very subtly nudge up or promote content that would be preferential to one presidential candidate, for instance,” said Ryan.Ultimately, Zhang circled back to proposing a transaction similar to what he originally offered to address American scrutiny. ByteDance had been willing to set up a global headquarters for TikTok with a separate board, although he always wanted to keep his ownership.Perhaps in the end, the Chinese entrepreneur decided he could live with the dire consequences of a ban. Trump may be able to shutter TikTok in the U.S., but Zhang would maintain full ownership elsewhere -- and perhaps return to the country in the future if the political environment changes.It’s a mindset Trump may be able to comprehend.“It’s been said that I believe in the power of positive thinking. In fact, I believe in the power of negative thinking,” the president wrote in his book. “If you plan for the worst — if you can live with the worst — the good will always take care of itself.”(Updates with Trump comments on timing of decision)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","In Trump Clash, TikTok Founder Takes Page From ‘Art of the Deal’"

2020-09-17,"(Bloomberg) -- The Treasury Department, TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. and Oracle Corp. have tentatively agreed to terms for Oracle’s bid for the U.S. operations of the social-media service, according to people familiar with the matter.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sent Bytedance a revised terms sheet late Wednesday and the company and Oracle accepted it, the people said. They described the changes as addressing national security concerns about the transaction and asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.Bytedance is trying to win U.S. approval for a transaction with Oracle that would leave the Chinese-headquartered parent company with majority ownership of TikTok. President Donald Trump demanded the sale of the service in August, declaring in executive orders that the popular video-sharing app is a national security threat.Any deal needs to be approved by both Trump -- who could still reject the transaction -- and the Chinese government, where officials have accused the U.S. of “economic bullying.”White House senior adviser Jared Kushner is aware of the revised terms but hasn’t reviewed the latest details in depth and hasn’t weighed in on whether Trump should sign off on the deal, one person familiar with the matter said.The White House and Treasury declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t respond to requests for comment.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said early Thursday that he’s concerned that Oracle’s bid for TikTok may be a “repackaging” that won’t meet the president’s goals.“We’re still looking at the potential details of the deal, and whether it meets the national-security thresholds, the American-interest thresholds,” Meadows said. “My big concern is if all we’re doing is repackaging it and still keeping it as a predominantly Chinese-government run company, that would not sit well with the original goal the president outlined.”Under the plan, Oracle would acquire a minority stake in a newly formed TikTok that would be headquartered in the U.S. with an independent board approved by the U.S. government.The new terms, which are designed to protect the data of U.S. citizens from falling into Chinese hands, include 20 pages of detailed provisions over data and national security, the people said. Under those terms, the board of directors would have to consist entirely of U.S. citizens and would include a national security committee.That body would be chaired by an American data-security expert who would be the primary contact with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which would oversee any issues of concern to the U.S. government. The previous terms hadn’t included language on the formation of that committee.Terms of the proposed deal would give Oracle full access to TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to access data on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, Bloomberg reported.At least three shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company -- General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management -- would take stakes in the new business, Bloomberg has reported.Walmart Inc., which had previously partnered with Microsoft Corp. to make an outright bid for TikTok’s U.S. business, remains interested in investing as well, and could also end up with a seat on the board, according to one of the people. With Oracle, Walmart and the continued involvement of existing U.S. investors, the new company, TikTok Global, would have a strong contingent of American investors, some of the people said.(Updates with details on Kushner and deal terms from fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Oracle, ByteDance Accept New Treasury Terms on TikTok"

2020-09-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather data on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter.TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd. and Oracle submitted these details in their proposal to the Trump administration with a goal of averting an outright sale of the app or a shutdown of its U.S. operations set to take effect Sept. 20. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the app in a pair of executive orders issued last month based on U.S. national security concerns.The terms of the agreement seem to fall short of meeting those national security concerns expressed by administration officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to people familiar with the matter. Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr and other members of the administration have been talking directly with Oracle executives, one person said.Beijing is less likely to oppose the current deal since it doesn’t involve the transfer of ByteDance’s algorithms, which recently enacted export restrictions specifically encompass, a person close to the negotiations said. But Trump, speaking Wednesday with reporters, said he is getting a briefing on the issue Thursday morning, adding that he didn’t like the idea of ByteDance retaining control of TikTok.“Just conceptually, I can tell you I don’t like that,” he said after a reporter told him that ByteDance would retain a majority of the company’s assets, with Oracle acquiring a minority stake. “I’m not prepared to sign off of anything,” Trump said. “I have to see the deal.”TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The president is trailing his Democratic opponent Joe Biden in the polls and seeking to use his tough stance with Beijing as a selling point to voters. That’s despite the fact that American investors collectively hold roughly 40% of ByteDance’s equity, with the rest owned by founder Zhang Yiming, ByteDance employees and non-U.S. investors, the person said.TikTok declined to comment. Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment.ByteDance plans to create a new standalone company for TikTok’s U.S. operations in which it would remain majority owner, but give Oracle and other American investors minority stakes in the new business. Public statements made by both companies calling Oracle the newly formed company’s “trusted technology partner” were met with confusion, one of the people said.The new details shed light on Oracle’s role in the partnership and go beyond just housing data inside the software company’s U.S. cloud servers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Oracle will be able to check all source code from the algorithms that decide which TikTok videos get shown to which U.S. users to ensure there are no entry points for the Chinese parent. Oracle, the world’s second-largest software maker, will be able to continue to review the technology as updates come in to make sure there are no new points of access to the data, the people said.Under the proposed deal, the newly formed TikTok would also hire an independent board approved by the U.S. government. The new U.S.-based company would allow oversight by a third party, which will report to the U.S. government and provide continuous audits, reports and protocols for handling any incidents that may arise, according to the people. That means if, say, Beijing finds a way to infiltrate TikTok’s code, Oracle and the independent board would have the means and agency to spot it.Despite the terms, administration officials remain wary about the proposed new ownership structure and how much influence that would give China over the company.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reviewed the proposed deal. Attorney General William Barr was only briefed on the deal Wednesday and is reviewing it, according to a Justice Department official who declined to comment further. Barr spoke with Oracle executives Wednesday morning, two people familiar with the situation said. Pompeo had a conversation with the company officials last week.The Treasury, State and Justice departments are all part of the Committee for Foreign Investments in the U.S., or Cfius, which reviews deals for national security implications. In a meeting Tuesday afternoon, officials raised concerns about a deal that would leave a majority stake of TikTok’s U.S. assets in ByteDance’s hands, with Oracle taking a minority share, the people said.The proposal also calls for the newly formed U.S. company to hire 25,000 American workers in a wide range of jobs from content moderation, engineering, product and marketing.However, the company is not going to recreate the powerful algorithms that run the app based on data that ByteDance has collected for years, one person said. ByteDance will still have visibility into the algorithms, but Oracle will be able to monitor the data flows and review and approve all updates to the code.(Updates with Beijing’s stance and ByteDance structure from the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Would Get Access to TikTok Code in Proposed Deal
2020-09-17,"Trump Administration wants investors from the United States to hold a majority stake in ByteDance-owned short-form video app TikTok, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.What Happened: The Beijing-based company is partnering with Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) to form a new U.S.-based firm that would run TikTok's global operations, where it will continue to hold a majority stake.Nearly 40% of ByteDance is presently owned by U.S. venture capitalists such as Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic. Zhang Yiming, the company's founder, controls 25%, and another 20% of the ownership is held by employees. Non-U.S. investors hold another 20%, according to the Journal.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. officials reportedly want the U.S. stake in the company to increase beyond the levels being proposed.The officials want an ownership structure in place where all of ByteDance's assets are placed in a new company and Oracle and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) are brought in as investors.

2020-09-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There have been enough leaks over the past few days to get a sense of what the TikTok-Oracle Corp. deal looks like. The details are revelatory, with two aspects in particular worthy of note.First, TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd. would maintain majority ownership, leaving Oracle and other American partners collectively in a minority, Nick Wadhams and Shelly Banjo of Bloomberg News reported late Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Secondly, Oracle would have full access to TikTok’s codebase, according to the report.In summary, Oracle would get the keys to the castle but ByteDance would still own the kingdom.There’s an important caveat: the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. haven’t signed off on the deal.  President Trump said he’ll get a briefing Thursday morning, Washington time, and isn’t yet prepared to approve it. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump administration officials remain committed to having TikTok under U.S. control.ByteDance’s determination to hold onto majority ownership seems jarring. Despite being a global phenomenon, TikTok’s worldwide revenue last year accounted for about 2% of ByteDance’s total sales. The Beijing-based company has plenty more products in its suite, including a domestic version of TikTok called Douyin and news aggregator Toutiao. It would be a small financial sacrifice to let go of TikTok if that means keeping the business alive and operating in the U.S.I have no doubt Beijing has made its views on a majority sale clear to ByteDance management. After all, the Chinese government would prefer to see TikTok shut down than forced into American hands, according to a Reuters report.Yet the second aspect of the deal, as it stands now, is also revealing. Giving Oracle full access to TikTok’s codebase indicates ByteDance is confident it’ll be just fine if the Americans get to peek under the hood at the software that has made the app such a global sensation.Software and algorithms don’t stand still. The TikTok of today is vastly different from the TikTok of a year ago, and the product we’d see next year would be better again. If improvements get slowed, or even halted, under U.S. management then ByteDance probably won’t sweat it because it has thousands of engineers tweaking and refining the algorithms at its other products. And since TikTok is only a small part of its business, a certain amount of stagnation won’t kill the company.Of course, that may be a harsh assessment — U.S. software engineers remain the best in the world and would probably do a good job of developing the product. But either way, ByteDance can afford not to care too much as long as it still controls the company and can determine key decisions, such as whether to go for an initial public offering or make an acquisition. It would also remain in the driver’s seat should a future U.S. administration reverse course.That seems to be the Chinese company’s endgame. Signing over majority control has a finality that the Chinese company hopes to avoid. Access to the codebase, on the other hand, can be reversed at anytime. ByteDance is playing chicken with President Trump.

2020-09-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then retailing rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. have been offering each other some serious compliments lately. Bloomberg News’s Spencer Soper reported this week that Amazon is planning to add 1,000 small delivery facilities to suburbs and cities, giving the e-commerce giant more of the proximity to its customers that Walmart has long enjoyed. That came shortly after the launch of Walmart+, a membership program that is an answer to Amazon’s Prime subscription, and a statement by Walmart that it continued to be interested in investing in TikTok Inc., moves that show the big-box chain’s desire for its business model to look more like that of the tech company. As Amazon and Walmart each try to gain an edge or neutralize advantages seen in the other, the end result is that the two are becoming more like one other. How successful each is with these moves and countermoves will shape how their rivalry plays out for years to come. In this latest round, Amazon’s move is perhaps less bold but seems more certain to work, giving it a win this time in the ongoing shopping showdown. For Amazon, speed has always been central to the promise of Prime, and while that once meant two-day delivery, it increasingly has been redefined as same-day. The new small-format facilities, especially if strategically packed with most frequently ordered items in that area, should help with that. Walmart has long argued that its vast collection of physical stores is a help, not a hindrance, in its e-commerce pursuits. The retailer says 90% of Americans live within 10 minutes of a Walmart store, a setup that has been particularly helpful in its positioning for grocery delivery and pickup. Its stores have served as fulfillment centers for these goods, helping the chain to get orders into shoppers’ pantries and refrigerators more quickly than if they were being ferried from a far-flung distribution center. Essentially, Walmart’s stores act as mini warehouses already, and Amazon’s embrace of small outposts closer to where people live is an indirect acknowledgment that there’s some benefit in that model. Meanwhile, Walmart+ is a variation of the successful Prime subscription model. For $98 a year, members get free delivery of groceries and certain other orders, as well as such extras as discounts on fuel. It’s cheaper than Prime, which costs $119 per year, and has clear value to people who already do plenty of shopping at Walmart. But Prime is so entrenched at this point with its roughly 150 million members and loaded up with non-shopping goodies such as TV programming that it’s hard to see Walmart peeling away many people from that group. Maybe that’s OK; there are plenty of people who have only recently stepped up their online shopping amid the pandemic, especially for groceries, and Walmart has a decent shot at winning them over. Amazon may have a bigger selection, but I find Walmart’s website better designed and easier to use — a valuable distinction for time-starved shoppers. Bottom line: I highly doubt Walmart+ will make a perceptible dent in Amazon’s subscriber count. But if it allows Walmart to defend the customer base it already has and attract customers that aren’t locked in to Prime yet, it’s probably worth doing. While the arrival of Walmart+ wasn’t a surprise — it’s the evolution of a grocery delivery program the company had been piloting for a while — its decision to join the TikTok fray surely was. In August, the company said it had joined with Microsoft Corp. in pursuit of the social media juggernaut owned by ByteDance Ltd. Later, after reports that Oracle Corp. had been selected as TikTok’s U.S. partner, Walmart released a terse statement saying it was still interested in investing in the company. Whatever TikTok’s ultimate fate, Walmart revealed something of itself by parachuting into the competition. TikTok, in theory, would help Walmart bolster its nascent digital advertising business and its marketplace for third-party sellers. In other words, it would help Walmart shore up areas of business that have helped with Amazon’s growth and profitability. It was already clear those were areas of focus for Walmart, but chasing TikTok made it clear just how aggressive it is willing to be in its pursuit of revenue streams that would give it a more Amazon-like profile.Even though the pandemic has pushed a great deal more purchases online, I expect consumers will continue to bounce between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar shopping for a long time. That will likely leave Amazon and Walmart to continue encroaching on each other’s turf — and taking inspiration from each other in the process. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Having failed to complete a huge wall along the U.S. southern border, President Donald Trump’s administration now seems desperate to build one in cyberspace for similar spurious reasons. Whereas the bogeyman four years ago was a supposed influx of drugs and criminals from Mexico, the U.S. announced early Friday that Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s instant-messaging app WeChat will essentially be shut down in America from Sept. 20 because of some vague notion that it poses an immediate threat.In announcing the move, which also includes a ban on ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok to go in effect Nov. 12 unless it resolves its pending issues, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross made it sound as if there was incontrovertible evidence of their nefarious nature.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has demonstrated the means and motives to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the U.S.That’s not quite true.There’s no doubt that Beijing, its governing Communist Party and the nation’s military and intelligence services have waged sustained cyberoffensives against the U.S. and dozens of other countries. This year alone, two Chinese hackers were accused of attempting to pilfer coronavirus research across 11 countries, while more than 100 targets are thought to be among victims in a sophisticated infiltration scheme outlined by the U.S. this week.But the evidence against WeChat is lacking. The app offers services that are roughly akin to an amalgam of Facebook, Venmo, Instagram, Twitter and Postmates. Its core feature is messaging, similar to Whatsapp. And yes, it collects data. Reams of it. As does Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and even Oracle Corp. In the U.S., WeChat is largely used by the Chinese diaspora. And it’s quite probable that a small segment of those users oppose the U.S., its democratic system of government and maybe even communicate their plans over chat. In truth, an even bigger risk to the freedoms for which the U.S. stands is that Chinese dissidents in America might use the app and Beijing most likely tracks them. A third concern is that the Communist Party’s increasingly heightened censorship regime is being deployed on WeChat at the expense of American citizens (largely of Chinese ethnicity) entirely within U.S. borders.And yet, any such manipulation or data infiltration pales in significance to that already perpetrated against entirely American institutions like Facebook and Twitter. Instead of stamping out any threats posed by the Chinese government, which do exist, the U.S. administration has simply handed Beijing another item to add to its folio of propaganda that paints the U.S. as a belligerent and hypocritical regime.Just as Chinese officials can use examples of U.S. police officers killing unarmed black men as a counter to Washington’s allegations of human rights abuses in Hong Kong and against Uighurs, they now have this unnecessary WeChat ban as proof that the U.S. isn’t an open freedom-loving nation after all.The predictable reaction from Beijing will also be hypocritical. It’s true that thousands of Chinese in the U.S. will struggle to communicate directly with friends and family back home once WeChat access is shut off. But that’s only because more ubiquitous options in the U.S. — Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger and Twitter — have already been banned by China.A U.S. move to shut WeChat, and possibly TikTok, still pales in comparison to the Great Firewall that Beijing has had in place for more than a decade.And that’s why this move will prove to be so desperate and ineffective. It won’t stop teams of state-sponsored hackers from infiltrating corporate and government networks, nor prevent manipulation of America’s open internet and independent media. But it will provide fodder for the growing belief that the U.S. truly is no better than any authoritarian state seeking to clamp down on the free flow of information in the name of national security.Like that barrier along the Mexican border, this virtual wall against China will have untold costs and little benefit.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-09-18,"The drama over the fate of popular Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok is ongoing Friday, with the U.S. Commerce Department announcing that it will ban U.S. business transactions on TikTok starting Sunday.What Happened? Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat will seemingly no longer be able to do business in the U.S. starting on Sunday, presumably unless the two companies announce deals with U.S. companies that gain the approval of President Donald Trump.Why It's Important: TikTok has taken the U.S. by storm in 2020, and the app now has more than 100 million users.Trump has pushed for TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell the platform to an American company due to national security concerns.ByteDance was reportedly seeking a $30-billion valuation for TikTok in buyout negotiations, but the company recently rejected a bid from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and partner Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).On Monday, TikTok announced a deal proposal to add U.S. company Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) as a &quot;trusted technology partner,&quot; pending Trump's approval.The word from the Commerce Department on Friday suggests the Oracle deal failed to satisfy Trump.Sunday reflects a deadline Trump set via executive order back on Aug. 6 that gave ByteDance and WeChat parent company Tencent Holdings ADR (OTC: TCEHY) 45 days to sell their U.S. businesses to American companies or face bans.Trump has said he is concerned about the degree to which the apps give the Chinese government access to American users' data.What It Means: The Commerce Department's directive on Friday would ban Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) from listing the TikTok and WeChat apps in their app stores.The statement also bans U.S. companies from providing internet hosting and services to TikTok starting on Nov. 12 -- language that might specifically address at the potential Oracle deal.TikTok's interim CEO even called on Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB) Instagram to join the fight.&gt; We agree that this type of ban would be bad for the industry. We invite Facebook and Instagram to publicly join our challenge and support our litigation. This is a moment to put aside our competition and focus on core principles like freedom of expression and due process of law.&gt; &gt; -- Vanessa Pappas (@v_ness) September 18, 2020On Friday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said he still believes a deal can be reached in the next 48 hours to prevent bans of TikTok and WeChat.Both the U.S. and China potentially have a lot riding on this game of high-stakes poker, the analyst said.&quot;The broader worry is that if a deal is not reached over the next 48 hours with approval by the Chinese government around source code access and majority ownership, this shutdown move could be a Fort Sumter moment in the US/China cold tech war tensions with retaliation on the horizon,&quot; he said.Benzinga's Take: Trump seems to be willing to anger American TikTok users in his efforts to crack down on China and preserve national security.Fox Business reports that 15% of TikTok users will be first-time voters in November, but a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll suggests voters under the age of 40 are overwhelmingly already supporting Trump's opponent Joe Biden in the polls by a more than 20% margin.Related Links:'Partnership Better Than Acquisition': Analysts React To Oracle-TikTok Deal How TikTok's Value Per User Compares To Facebook And Other Social Media PlatformsLatest Ratings for ORCL  DateFirmActionFromTo  Sep 2020B of A SecuritiesMaintainsNeutral  Sep 2020Credit SuisseMaintainsOutperform  Sep 2020StifelMaintainsHold    View More Analyst Ratings for ORCL   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * How TikTok's Value Per User Compares To Facebook And Other Social Media Platforms(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg) -- IPhone users in the U.S. are rushing to install messaging app WeChat days before President Donald Trump is set to ban downloads in the country.WeChat downloads surged to make it the 100th most-downloaded app in the U.S. on Friday, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower. It has typically ranked between 1,000th and 1,500th this year. Friday is the first time the app has entered the top 500 so far in 2020, a spokesperson for SensorTower said in an email.The U.S. government on Friday moved to ban WeChat, run by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., and another popular Chinese-owned app TikTok, citing national security concerns. The prohibitions are slated to take effect on Sunday, and will prevent U.S. consumers for downloading the apps or installing updates.WeChat will also be hit on Sunday with a ban on using American companies to run transactions and conduct internet traffic, meaning people still using the app will likely experience slowdowns and glitches because third-party tech services that keep it running won’t work anymore.“WeChat U.S. for all practical purposes will be shut down,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Fox Business.TikTok’s ranking as the fourth-most popular app on the iPhone store was unchanged on Friday, SensorTower said. It hasn’t dropped out of the top 15 for all of 2020.The video-sharing app’s owner ByteDance Ltd. is negotiating a deal to hand control of its U.S. operations and data to Oracle Corp. in order to satisfy U.S. concerns that the data of Americans who use the app could fall into the hands of the Chinese government. TikTok will still be able to do business with American companies until Nov. 12. That means the app, which is extremely popular with young Americans, will likely keep working for users until after the Nov. 3 presidential election.Chinese officials, who will have to approve the final TikTok deal, have called the U.S. actions against the two apps “economic bullying.”(Updates with quote from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",WeChat iPhone Downloads Surge in the U.S. Ahead of Trump Ban
2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok lobbyists told Trump campaign officials that an all-out ban on the app could sour millions of voters against him in the November election, taking aim at one of the president’s top concerns, according to people familiar with the matter.TikTok walked campaign officials through how the app works in detail and explained that the platform has 100 million U.S. users, many of whom are of voting age, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be named because they weren’t unauthorized to speak publicly on the matter.The recent briefings also pointed out that TikTok’s largest markets are key battleground states for the 2020 election, including Florida. The TikTok lobbyists also shared data on how young Trump supporters have grown increasingly active on the app, the person familiar said.Videos with the Trump2020 hashtag have notched 10.3 billion views on the app, compared to 2 billion views for Biden2020.After President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok last month, the app was flooded with videos of users crying and telling their friends to go out and vote against Trump in retaliation for taking aim at their digital hangout.It’s unclear if the Trump campaign shared considerations about TikTok’s influence over voters with the president or administration officials. It couldn’t be determined whether these considerations affected deliberations about banning the app or deal negotiations between the Treasury Department, TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. and Oracle Corp. to create a new global TikTok that would satisfy U.S. national security concerns. “President Trump’s job is to protect Americans and stand up to China as they attempt to steal users’ data and spread propaganda – and he will not shirk that responsibility just because of an election,” campaign spokeswoman Samantha Zager said.Representatives for TikTok didn’t respond to requests for comment.ByteDance has been building up its U.S. lobbying muscle over the last year. In a matter of months, it’s amassed a Washington operation with at least three dozen staffers and a number of outside lobbyists with close ties to the Trump administration, including David Urban, a senior adviser to Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. Last quarter it spent a company record on federal lobbying, filings show.The proposed Oracle deal, designed to create a ring-fenced version of TikTok to protect the data of U.S. citizens and prevent China from spying, would have Oracle, Walmart Inc. and venture capital investors holding a minority stake.Despite indications in recent days that Trump was moving toward accepting the companies’ proposal, allowing them to avoid a ban, the U.S. Commerce Department on Friday said that it plans to expel TikTok from U.S. app stores by Sunday, but allowed the company until Nov. 12 to reach a final deal or face further restrictions on business in the U.S. Commerce said it could reverse the ban on TikTok’s video-streaming service if the company presents a deal that satisfies national security concerns.Over the summer, thousands of young people organized through TikTok to flood the campaign’s app with bad reviews and prank Trump’s first post-shutdown campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At that time, Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg News that “TikTok users don’t affect anything we do. What we do know is that the Chinese use TikTok to spy on its users.”(Updates with campaign statement in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Lobbyists Took Case Against Ban to Trump Campaign

The board would include a national security committee -- led by an American data-security expert who would be the primary contact with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. -- which would oversee any issues of concern to Washington.The new terms include 20 pages of detailed provisions over data and national security, the people said. Under the existing proposal, Oracle has power to review the software or source code underlying the TikTok service, but ByteDance maintains ownership.That technological division could remain even if American investors end up with control of TikTok’s equity. Oracle and ByteDance have accepted Treasury’s conditions, people familiar with the talks have said.ByteDance executives have also spoken to Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom about a possible role in the new organization, according to another person familiar with the discussions. It’s not clear if the discussions are advanced, the person said.ByteDance representatives declined to comment. In its latest statement to Chinese media, ByteDance said a final deal needs approval from Chinese and U.S. regulators.TikTok Drags On: Next ChinaTikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The president is trailing his Democratic opponent Joe Biden in the polls and seeking to use a tough stance with Beijing as a selling point to voters. That’s despite the fact that American investors collectively hold roughly 40% of ByteDance’s equity, with the rest owned by Zhang, his employees and a clutch of non-U.S. investors such as SoftBank Group Corp., a person familiar with the structure has said.On the flip side, there are signs Beijing is backing one of its biggest internet companies, firing off a litany of comments condemning U.S. “coercion” and “bullying.” ByteDance also recently acquired a company with a coveted national digital payment license — a competitive arena that Beijing rigidly controls.“ByteDance has been trying to get this license for a long time,” said Mason Xu, founding partner of Heyi Capital. “The fact that it happened only recently, I would say -- at least from an external perspective -- it is a kind of endorsement from the Chinese government.”ByteDance Is Playing Chicken With Trump on TikTok: Tim CulpanDespite the security measures in the revised Oracle deal, Trump administration officials remain wary about the proposed new ownership structure and how much influence that would give China over the company. If Trump balks, ByteDance and Oracle may have to tweak the deal.In their opening proposal to the Trump administration, ByteDance and Oracle outlined a plan for Oracle and other American investors -- including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Coatue Management -- to get minority stakes in the standalone business. The newly formed U.S. company will then hire 25,000 American workers in a wide range of jobs from content moderation and engineering to product and marketing.ByteDance has tried to argue that TikTok will in effect have majority American ownership -- if you combine the minority direct stake in TikTok Global with the 40% of parent ByteDance that U.S. investors already hold. Yet some of Trump’s advisors have advocated for Americans to hold a direct majority of the new TikTok outright.Regardless, ByteDance will not sell or transfer its proprietary technologies to Oracle. The newly created company isn’t going to recreate the powerful algorithms that ByteDance has built and trained with the help of data collected over many years, one of the people said.Instead, the U.S. software giant will be able to check all source code to make sure there’re no back doors that may let ByteDance gather data on the video-sharing app’s users, according to people familiar with the matter. The world’s second-largest software maker can continue to review the code as updates come in, to make sure ByteDance doesn’t create new points of access to the data, the people said. ByteDance itself will still have visibility into the algorithms, but Oracle will be able to monitor the data flows and review and approve all updates to the code.(Updates with Pompeo’s stance and analyst’s comment from the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok’s Owner Is Getting Surer Beijing Will Okay U.S. Deal

If the latest proposal is okayed by Trump, “we can’t say Beijing wins, but it definitely loses less.”Read more: ByteDance Plan for U.S. TikTok Company Envisions IPO in a YearIn a sign the deal may go through, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who held some of the strongest reservations about the agreement, has softened his opposition and told Trump so on Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the matter.The plan revised with Treasury calls for the new TikTok to be headquartered in the U.S. with an independent board, approved by the U.S. government and made up entirely of U.S. citizens. The board would include a national security committee -- led by an American data-security expert who would be the primary contact with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. -- which would oversee any issues of concern to Washington.The new terms include 20 pages of detailed provisions over data and national security, the people said. Under the existing proposal, Oracle has power to review the software or source code underlying the TikTok service, but ByteDance maintains ownership.That technological division could remain even if American investors end up with control of TikTok’s equity. Oracle and ByteDance have accepted Treasury’s conditions, people familiar with the talks have said.ByteDance executives have also spoken to Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom about a possible role in the new organization, according to another person familiar with the discussions. It’s not clear if the discussions are advanced, the person said.ByteDance representatives declined to comment. In its latest statement to Chinese media, ByteDance said a final deal needs approval from Chinese and U.S. regulators.TikTok Drags On: Next ChinaTikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The president is trailing his Democratic opponent Joe Biden in the polls and seeking to use a tough stance with Beijing as a selling point to voters. That’s despite the fact that American investors collectively hold roughly 40% of ByteDance’s equity, with the rest owned by Zhang, his employees and a clutch of non-U.S. investors such as SoftBank Group Corp., a person familiar with the structure has said.On the flip side, there are signs Beijing is backing one of its biggest internet companies, firing off a litany of comments condemning U.S. “coercion” and “bullying.” ByteDance also recently acquired a company with a coveted national digital payment license — a competitive arena that Beijing rigidly controls.“ByteDance has been trying to get this license for a long time,” said Mason Xu, founding partner of Heyi Capital. “The fact that it happened only recently, I would say -- at least from an external perspective -- it is a kind of endorsement from the Chinese government.”ByteDance Is Playing Chicken With Trump on TikTok: Tim CulpanDespite the security measures in the revised Oracle deal, Trump administration officials remain wary about the proposed new ownership structure and how much influence that would give China over the company. If Trump balks, ByteDance and Oracle may have to tweak the deal.In their opening proposal to the Trump administration, ByteDance and Oracle outlined a plan for Oracle and other American investors -- including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Coatue Management -- to get minority stakes in the standalone business. The newly formed U.S. company will then hire 25,000 American workers in a wide range of jobs from content moderation and engineering to product and marketing.ByteDance has tried to argue that TikTok will in effect have majority American ownership -- if you combine the minority direct stake in TikTok Global with the 40% of parent ByteDance that U.S. investors already hold. Yet some of Trump’s advisors have advocated for Americans to hold a direct majority of the new TikTok outright.Regardless, ByteDance will not sell or transfer its proprietary technologies to Oracle. The newly created company isn’t going to recreate the powerful algorithms that ByteDance has built and trained with the help of data collected over many years, one of the people said.Instead, the U.S. software giant will be able to check all source code to make sure there’re no back doors that may let ByteDance gather data on the video-sharing app’s users, according to people familiar with the matter. The world’s second-largest software maker can continue to review the code as updates come in, to make sure ByteDance doesn’t create new points of access to the data, the people said. ByteDance itself will still have visibility into the algorithms, but Oracle will be able to monitor the data flows and review and approve all updates to the code.(Updates with Pompeo’s stance and analyst’s comment from the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Owner Is Gaining Confidence Beijing to Okay U.S. Deal
2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg) -- The new U.S. company that TikTok’s owner ByteDance Ltd. plans to form with Oracle Corp. intends to hold an initial public offering in about a year, according to people familiar with the matter.The new company, which would be called TikTok Global, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will be the result of a transaction forced by President Donald Trump last month because of national security concerns about TikTok’s Chinese ownership. Bloomberg News reported earlier that the Treasury Department, ByteDance and Oracle agreed to terms for the deal late Wednesday.Mnuchin sent ByteDance a revised terms sheet late Wednesday and the company and Oracle accepted it. People familiar with the matter described the government’s changes as addressing national security concerns about the transaction and asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.An administration official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, said Thursday night that Trump had been briefed on some of the parameters of the deal and that the president didn’t want China to retain a controlling interest in TikTok that would imperil Americans’ personal information.‘Situation Is Very Fluid’As he left the White House for a campaign trip to Wisconsin, Trump told reporters that administration officials had spoken with the companies involved in the deal on Thursday but didn’t elaborate.“We spoke today, to Walmart, Oracle, I guess Microsoft is still involved, we’ll make a decision but nothing much has changed.”ByteDance rejected Microsoft Corp.’s bid for the U.S. operations of TikTok last weekend, and a person familiar with the company said Thursday night that it was no longer involved in talks related to TikTok.During the trip to Wisconsin, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said, “The situation is very fluid. There’s no definite proposal that the president’s being asked to consider or reject at this point. And obviously he’ll need to weigh in before the deadline” on Sept. 20.In a sign that the deal may go through, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who held some of the strongest reservations about the agreement, had since softened his opposition and told Trump so on Wednesday morning, according to two people familiar with the matter.ByteDance is trying to win U.S. approval for a transaction with Oracle that would leave the Chinese-headquartered parent company with majority ownership of TikTok.Any deal must be approved by both Trump -- who could still reject the transaction -- and the Chinese government. Beijing is unlikely to oppose an arrangement that doesn’t involve the transfer of ByteDance’s technology, especially if the Chinese parent retains majority control of TikTok, another person close to the negotiations has said.White House senior adviser Jared Kushner is aware of the revised terms but hasn’t reviewed the latest details in depth and hasn’t weighed in on whether Trump should sign off on the deal, one person familiar with the matter said.The White House, Treasury and TikTok declined to comment.China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin urged the U.S. to “provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for foreign companies operating in the U.S.” during a briefing.Meadows said earlier Thursday that he’s concerned that Oracle’s bid for TikTok may be a “repackaging” that won’t meet the president’s goals.“We’re still looking at the potential details of the deal, and whether it meets the national-security thresholds, the American-interest thresholds,” Meadows said. “My big concern is if all we’re doing is repackaging it and still keeping it as a predominantly Chinese-government run company, that would not sit well with the original goal the president outlined.”Under the plan, Oracle would acquire a minority stake in a newly formed TikTok that would be headquartered in the U.S. with an independent board approved by the U.S. government.The new terms, which are designed to protect the data of U.S. citizens from falling into Chinese hands, include 20 pages of detailed provisions over data and national security, the people said. Under those terms, the board of directors would have to consist entirely of U.S. citizens and would include a national security committee.That body would be led by an American data-security expert who would be the primary contact with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which would oversee any issues of concern to the U.S. government. The previous terms hadn’t included language on the formation of that committee.Terms of the proposed deal would give Oracle full access to TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to access data on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, Bloomberg reported.At least three shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company -- General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management -- would take stakes in the new business, Bloomberg has reported.Walmart Inc., which had previously partnered with Microsoft Corp. to make an outright bid for TikTok’s U.S. business, remains interested in investing as well, and could also end up with a seat on the board, according to one of the people. With Oracle, Walmart and the continued involvement of existing U.S. investors, the new company, TikTok Global, would have a strong contingent of American investors, some of the people said.(Updates with Pompeo’s position, in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Plan for U.S. TikTok Company Envisions IPO in a Year
2020-09-18,"ByteDance plans to take TikTok public in the United States after it forms a partnership with Oracle Inc (NYSE: ORCL), the Financial Times reported Wednesday.What Happened: The Chinese parent of TikTok made a commitment to list the short-form video app's shares in the U.S. as a part of its efforts to avoid a ban in the country, according to FT.An IPO was suggested to the government as a part of the proposal to rearrange TikTok's ownership and may be held within a year, people familiar with the matter told FT.Concessions made by ByteDance reportedly include a U.S. headquarters for TikTok Global, ensuring all board members are American citizens, and the creation of a security committee led by a person with government security clearances.Kevin Systrom, the founder of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) subsidiary Instagram, is said to be under consideration as the new CEO of the emergent company. Why It Matters: ByteDance's proposals would give Oracle and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) 20% ownership of TikTok's global business, noted FT.The Chinese company would reportedly retain the algorithm that underpins the app but Oracle would oversee its implementation and processing in the U.S.At present nearly 40% of ByteDance is owned by venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic.There is no clarity on whether ByteDance would sell part of its stake in a future IPO, according to FT.Price Action: Oracle shares closed nearly 0.4% lower at $60.18 on Thursday and gained almost 0.4% in the after-hours session.See more from Benzinga  * Confusion Over ByteDance, TikTok Ownership Pattern Said To Be Latest Sticking Point In Oracle Deal  * TikTok Parent In Talks With US To Retain Part Ownership Of Video App: WSJ(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration has asked gaming companies to provide information about their data-security protocols involving Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., people familiar with the matter said.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which is chaired by the Treasury Department, has sent letters to companies, including Epic Games Inc., Riot Games and others, to inquire about their security protocols in handling Americans’ personal data, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.Tencent, the world’s largest gaming company, owns Los Angeles-based Riot and has a 40% stake in Epic, which is the maker of the popular video game Fortnite. Representatives for the companies declined to comment or didn’t immediately respond. The Treasury Department declined to comment.The inquiry builds on the Trump administration’s heightened scrutiny of Chinese companies and their ties to U.S. firms -- a source of fresh tension with the Beijing government and a pillar of President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. Tencent’s shares sank as much as 2.8% in Hong Kong, trimming their gains for the year to roughly 36%.Trump already has ByteDance Ltd., owner of the TikTok video app, in his sights and is cracking down on Tencent’s WeChat app.Cfius investigates foreign acquisitions of American businesses for national security risks. It has authority to examine full acquisitions as well as non-controlling investments and recommend that the president block or unwind deals. It can also scrutinize deals that weren’t voluntarily reported to the committee before closing.Sensitive DataAimen Mir, who ran Cfius reviews at the Treasury Department when he was the deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV after the report that the committee has traditionally been concerned about protecting sensitive data like health, financial and government-employee information but is now broadening the type of data it’s focused on.“When you’re talking about massive amounts of data, there’s probably something for the committee to look at,” said Mir, now a lawyer at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. “The question then becomes is the risk high enough that it actually warrants forcing deals apart.” That carries risks, including retaliation against U.S. companies doing business in China, he added.Congress in 2018 increased Cfius’s jurisdiction to review transactions by foreign companies retroactively for non-controlling investments if the companies involved maintain or collect sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens.Popular GamesTencent has more than 300 investments in its portfolio, according to PC Gamer. That makes it the force behind many of the world’s most popular games. In 2011, Tencent paid $400 million for a 93% stake in Los Angeles-based Riot Games, the studio behind League of Legends, the No. 1 game on PCs. Four years later, it scooped up the rest.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysTencent’s U.S. gaming investments, including Riot Games, Epic Games and Activision Blizzard may be at risk of forced divestment similar to ByteDance’s TikTok with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. launching an inquiry on national security grounds.

2020-09-19,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government delayed a ban on TikTok that would have forced Apple Inc. and Google to pull the video app from their U.S. app stores.“In light of recent positive developments, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, at the direction of President Trump, will delay the prohibition of identified transactions pursuant to Executive Order 13942, related to the TikTok mobile application that would have been effective on Sunday,” the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.The order has been delayed until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m. local time, the statement added.The Department of Commerce on Friday ordered the app stores to stop distributing ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and another Chinese-owned app, WeChat. The removals would have prevented new users from downloading the apps and TikTok and WeChat would not have been able to update the software for existing users.That’s on hold now for TikTok, at least for seven days. The delay followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision Saturday to approve Oracle Corp.’s bid for the U.S. operations of TikTok “in concept.”Read more: Trump Says He’s Approved Oracle Deal For U.S. TikTokThe looming ban has sparked deep concern across the internet industry.

2020-09-19,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration made good on longstanding threats to take action against Chinese internet giants in the U.S. by issuing a ban on WeChat and TikTok from Apple Inc. and Google’s app stores.For months, President Donald Trump has said he planned to crack down on WeChat, a tool for messaging and money-sharing owned by Shenzhen-based Tencent Holdings Ltd., and TikTok, a music video app owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., alleging that both apps could let Chinese officials gather data on tens of millions U.S. users and manipulate information shared by Americans.U.S. officials have already limited the activities of Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., saying their telecom gear could give China inroads into critical American networks. The moves against TikTok and WeChat mark an extension of the administration’s anti-China hostilities into the consumer realm, and give Trump a way to project a tough-on-China stance ahead of the Nov. 3 election.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that the U.S. would bar WeChat and its parent company from letting users send money to friends, family or businesses. It also banned business relationships with certain third-party technology providers starting Sunday. The move will make it harder to access and use a tool that helps more than 19 million people in the U.S. conduct business and stay in touch with contacts in China.Read more: WeChat IPhone Downloads Surge in the U.S. Ahead of Trump BanThe action against TikTok adds urgency to already complicated efforts to comply with another Trump order that forces ByteDance to find a buyer for TikTok’s U.S. operations. ByteDance had reached a deal early in the week to sell a minority stake to Oracle Corp. and other investors, but the accord so far has failed to address all the security requirements outlined by the administration. Walmart Inc. aims to take part in the transaction, and the company’s chief executive officer, Doug McMillon, could end up having a seat on the new company’s board.China’s Ministry of Commerce condemned the move against WeChat and TikTok, saying in a statement on Saturday that it would take “necessary measures” to protect the legal interests of Chinese firms, without elaborating.“The U.S. has, with no evidence, employed national powers to ‘hunt’ and suppress the two businesses on groundless bases,” the ministry said. “This has severely interfered with normal business activities and harmed the confidence of global investors in the U.S. investment environment, and damaged a normal international trade order.”ConsensusRoss said the government could reverse its decision to block TikTok downloads if ByteDance, Oracle and the Trump administration reach a consensus before Nov. 12. Trump spoke by phone with Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and Walmart’s McMillon on Friday and told them he was close to making a decision on the proposal, people familiar with the matter said.The Commerce Department restrictions lay out two, largely separate, timelines for WeChat and TikTok. Restrictions on U.S. app stores for both take effect on Sept. 20, but prohibitions on companies providing services to TikTok won’t kick in until the November deadline. Commerce officials said Friday that they took pains not to disrupt ongoing deal negotiations. And if a deal is reached by Sunday, TikTok could avoid being blocked from the app store, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.“I can just say our goal is really very straightforward -- protecting the American information and data from ending up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. “And so while we are reviewing the proposal, trying to evaluate if we can successfully achieve those outcomes, that will be our measure.”Oracle shares fell less than 1% to $59.75 on Friday in New York.The action against TikTok and WeChat rattled advocates for freedom of speech and an open internet. Alex Stamos, Facebook Inc.’s former security chief, said the order was “huge strike against the freedoms of U.S. citizens.”Still, the Commerce order was less severe than some American businesses feared because the ban on WeChat and TikTok is limited to the U.S., left out enforcement mechanisms that would ensnare individual users, and didn’t include restrictions on internet service providers. Extending a ban to China would have dealt a blow to businesses such as Starbucks Corp. and Walmart Inc. that rely on the app for some of their China operations.“We have engaged in extensive discussions with the U.S. government, and have put forward a comprehensive proposal to address its concerns,” WeChat owner Tencent said. “The restrictions announced today are unfortunate.”U.S. officials said that American users who have the WeChat app on their phone will still be able to use it to talk with family and friends overseas after the ban goes into effect on Sunday. Americans in China will also be able to continue using WeChat. What is changing is that new users won’t be able to download WeChat in U.S. app stores and existing users will not receive software updates.Also, because Tencent relies on third-party providers to host and send data, users will experience slowdowns and some dysfunction so a message might time out or there may be a temporary outage. Over time, as users can’t update the app, the WeChat experience will degrade. However, the order doesn’t go so far as to restrict internet service providers or require them to block access to WeChat in the form of the content firewall that’s in place in China.The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a trade group, said the rule puts an “unnecessary burden on U.S. companies,” and that it “puts consumers at risk by cutting them off from software updates including necessary security updates.”The ban could still affect U.S. companies that allow payment via WeChat and U.S. users who rely on the app to send money to friends and family. While WeChat has a relatively small footprint in the U.S., with only 19 million daily users, it has more than 1 billion users in China and other countries. TikTok has 100 million users in the U.S. and has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally.Read more: WeChat Users in U.S. Renew Bid to Block Trump Ban of AppThe Commerce restrictions now place the onus on Apple and on Alphabet Inc.’s Google to remove TikTok and WeChat from their U.S. app stores on Sunday.Apple and Google are ready to comply with the deadline, after administration officials worked in multiple discussions with the companies to ensure that there’s no risk of confusion as the ban is applied, according to a U.S. official.U.S. officials declined to comment on enforcement penalties, saying that the Commerce Department would work with companies including Google and Apple to protect user data and that it was prepared for any legal challenges that may arise. The U.S. government acknowledges that individuals might find work-arounds to update the apps and that it doesn’t intend to haul a person using WeChat before a federal judge, one official said. Google and Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment.“We disagree with the decision from the Commerce Department, and are disappointed that it stands to block new app downloads from Sunday,” a TikTok spokesperson said. “In our proposal to the U.S. administration, we’ve already committed to unprecedented levels of additional transparency and accountability well beyond what other apps are willing to do.”TikTok said it would continue a lawsuit against the U.S. government over Trump’s August executive orders.Read more: TikTok Lobbyists Took Case Against Ban to Trump CampaignThe Commerce Department held a number of briefings in late August with companies and lobbying groups who scurried to figure out what the potential ban could mean for them and for doing business with Tencent, a major mobile gaming platform and a huge force in social media globally, according to people familiar with the matter. Some American tech firms pressed the Trump administration to let them continue to do business with the Chinese company through their operations in Asia and to allow American citizens to use the apps there.Industry executives telephoned and wrote a flurry of letters -- including Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who discussed the matter with Ross -- but Commerce officials reassured them it would be a narrow ban, according to the officials.The Treasury Department, ByteDance and Oracle have tentatively agreed to terms for TikTok that would address U.S. national security concerns, Bloomberg reported Thursday. The proposal calls for ByteDance to own most of a ring-fenced TikTok, with Oracle, Walmart and venture capital investors holding a minority of a new company that will pursue an initial public offering in about a year. Trump has the final word and has said he doesn’t want the Chinese parent to retain majority control.(Adds China ministry’s statement in sixth and seventh paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Trump Backs Threats Against China With TikTok, WeChat Bans"

2020-09-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration’s curbs on WeChat were put on hold by a judge, upending an effort to halt use of the Chinese-owned app in the U.S.U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction at the request of a group of U.S. WeChat users, who argued the prohibitions would violate the free-speech rights of millions of Chinese-speaking Americans who rely on it. The app, which was supposed to disappear from U.S. app stores on Sunday, has 19 million regular users in the U.S. and 1 billion worldwide.The ruling means that neither WeChat nor TikTok, another Chinese-owned mobile app targeted by President Donald Trump’s executive order, will become immediately unavailable in the U.S. Trump cited national security concerns in banning the apps, but TikTok Inc. and the WeChat users’ group have said the president is trying to bolster his re-election chances by attacking China and Chinese companies.WeChat “serves as a virtual public square for the Chinese-speaking and Chinese-American community in the United States and is (as a practical matter) their only means of communication,” the judge wrote in the ruling, dated Saturday and released early Sunday. Effectively banning it “forecloses meaningful access to communication in their community and thereby operates as a prior restraint on their right to free speech.”The judge found the government provided insufficient evidence of a security threat. “Certainly the government’s overarching national-security interest is significant,” she wrote. “But on this record -- while the government has established that China’s activities raise significant national security concerns -- it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns.”The Department of Justice and Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The government is likely to appeal the ruling.The ruling will probably survive if it’s appealed to the Ninth Circuit, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.“Judge Beeler’s ruling seems very careful especially in clearly finding that plaintiffs have sufficiently satisfied the requirements for entering a preliminary injunction on the First Amendment claim,” Tobias said. “The judge also treats the weaker portions of both plaintiffs’ and the government’s arguments, especially the lack of evidence presented by the government, and finds that plaintiffs have the better of it.”Michael Bien, an attorney for the U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, said the U.S. “has never shut down a major platform for communications, not even during war times.”“There are serious First Amendment problems with the WeChat ban, which targets the Chinese American community and trampled on their First Amendment guaranteed freedoms to speak, to worship, to read and react to the press, and to organize and associate for numerous purposes,” he said in a statement.The U.S. has claimed that WeChat is a threat because its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd., is intertwined with the Chinese Communist Party, which can use the app to disseminate propaganda, track users, and steal their private and proprietary data. It’s a similar argument that the administration has used to target the TikTok app, while also forcing a sale of that app’s U.S. operations.TikTok DelayThe U.S. government on Saturday delayed its plan to prohibit downloads of TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, after Trump said he approved Oracle Corp.’s bid for the U.S. operations of TikTok “in concept.” The TikTok ban was also set to go into effect Sunday, but the order has been delayed until Sept. 27. TikTok on Friday filed suit in Washington, D.C.At a court hearing Saturday, Bien said the restrictions on WeChat are a far cry from the “narrowly tailored” measures that the government is required to impose so as not to unnecessarily curtail people’s constitutional rights.Michael Drezner, a lawyer for the the government, said at the hearing that the anxiety and uncertainly U.S. WeChat users may experience because of the prohibitions doesn’t entitle them to an order halting the implementation of the restrictions. Their reliance on WeChat is the result of China’s ban on other social media, which has made WeChat the exclusive, Chinese government-controlled option for them to communicate with people in China, according to Drezner.Drezner also noted the app will remain available for use by people who already have it on their phones, although its use will degrade over time because updates won’t be available. But Beeler responded that the ability for the app to function would be “essentially eviscerated.”Beeler had rejected a request for a preliminary injunction on Friday, which the users had sought on the grounds that the executive order was too vague. The Commerce Department on Friday detailed which transactions with WeChat and its Chinese parent company won’t be allowed under the Aug. 6 executive order. The judge scheduled the hearing Saturday in response to a revived request from the users group.The case is U.S. WeChat Users Alliance v.

2020-09-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp.’s agreement to take a stake in TikTok has won the long-awaited blessing of U.S. President Donald Trump.The proposal, which would give Oracle and other investors minority ownership of a new company called TikTok Global, still needs approval from regulators in China, where TikTok’s parent ByteDance Ltd. is based.Trump’s praise for the agreement suggests that weeks-long deliberations over the fate of a popular music and video-sharing app are nearing completion. ByteDance began holding discussions with investors in its U.S. operations after the Trump administration threatened to shutter the business, saying that it poses a threat to national security.While some of the terms remain undetermined, here’s what’s known about the deal, based on public statements and people with knowledge of the matter:What We KnowWho’s in and who’s outOracle plans to take a 12.5% stake in a round of financing that would precede an IPOTikTok also said that together, Oracle and Walmart Inc. could end up with as much as 20%The new company, called TikTok Global, will raise a pre-IPO round of financing and seek a U.S. IPO in less than 12 monthsA host of other companies made proposals or considered bidding; Microsoft Corp. was rebuffed because it wanted to control all of TikTok in the U.S., a condition that didn’t sit well with BeijingWhat the deal looks likeOracle will be TikTok’s “trusted technology provider,” meaning Oracle will house the entity’s data in its U.S. servers -- a boon to a cloud computing business that has lagged behind those of Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft.

2020-09-20,"• TikTok could fetch a valuation of $60 billion in the deal that its parent company ByteDance is working to complete with  (ORCL) and  (WMT) that would see the two U.S. companies take significant stakes in the popular video-sharing app, Bloomberg reports.  Under the reported terms of the deal, which is being pursued to address U.S. national security worries, Oracle will buy a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global and host all U.S. user data, and Walmart would take at 7.5% stake.  President Donald Trump said Saturday that he supported the deal in principle would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States, even though it doesn’t seem to fully satisfy the terms of an earlier executive order calling for ByteDance to divest from TikTok.","TikTok Could Have a $60 Billion Valuation If Oracle, Walmart Deal Goes Through"
2020-09-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump gave his blessing to Oracle Corp.’s bid for the American operations of TikTok, putting the popular video-sharing app on course to escape a U.S. ban imposed as part of his pressure campaign against China.“I approved the deal in concept,” Trump told reporters Saturday as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”The new company, which will be called TikTok Global, has agreed to funnel $5 billion in new tax dollars to the U.S. and set up a new education fund, which Trump said would satisfy his demand that the government receive a payment from the deal. “They’re going to be setting up a very large fund,” he said. “That’s their contribution that I’ve been asking for.”Oracle plans to take a 12.5% stake in the new TikTok Global, while Walmart Inc. said it has tentatively agreed to buy 7.5% of the entity. Walmart’s Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will serve on TikTok Global’s board of directors, the retailer said in a statement. Four of the five board seats will be filled by Americans, according to the statement.TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for the app, according to a person familiar with the matter. Oracle and Walmart would pay a combined $12 billion for their stakes if they agree to that asking price. The final valuation had not been set as the parties worked out the equity structure and measures for data security, the person said. Terms are still in flux and the proposed valuation could still change.U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo characterized Bytedance’s proposed role as similar to a “passive shareholder.” The Chinese company would have “no decision-making authority, no ability to peer into” what the U.S. company is doing, he said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”The TikTok deal was forced by a pair of bans Trump issued in August over concerns that ByteDance posed a national security risk, thrusting the video-sharing app into the center of the president’s confrontation with Beijing.Shortly after Trump signaled his approval, the Commerce Department on Saturday delayed by a week a ban that would have forced Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pull the TikTok video app from their U.S. app stores on Sunday.Trump is ramping up pressure on Chinese-owned apps in the weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential elections, citing national security concerns about the data U.S. citizens provide to them and the potential for Beijing to use them for spying. The president is trailing his opponent Joe Biden in polls and has sought to portray himself as tougher on Beijing than the Democrat.TikTok said in a statement that it was “pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the U.S. administration and settle questions around TikTok’s future in the U.S.”The company confirmed Oracle will host all its U.S. data and secure its computer systems. Oracle’s Generation 2 Cloud fully isolates running applications and responds to security threats autonomously, according to the statement, which eliminates the risk of foreign governments spying on American users or trying to influence them with disinformation.“Oracle will quickly deploy, rapidly scale, and operate TikTok systems in the Oracle Cloud,” said Oracle CEO Safra Catz in a statement. “We are a 100% confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok’s American users.”Oracle will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather data or to spy on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter.‘Real’ FirewallThe deal, if approved, ensures “that no American’s data has any access to anyone in China that has any capacity to move this to a place we don’t want it,” Pompeo said.“We will ensure that that firewall is real, that the protection is serious, that the data resides in places that aren’t connected to the Chinese information system,” he said.TikTok Global, together with Oracle, SIG, General Atlantic, Sequoia, Walmart and Coatue will create an educational initiative to develop and deliver an online video curriculum driven by artificial intelligence, according to the statement.TikTok said it’s working with Walmart on a commercial partnership and said that it will take part in a TikTok Global financing round along with Oracle before an initial public offering in which the investors can take as much as a 20% cumulative stake in the company.TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said. TikTok will need to hire thousands of content moderators, engineers, and marketing staff that were previously located in China and around the world. The company will also pay more than $5 billion in new tax dollars to the Treasury, according to the statement.To sweeten the deal for Trump, TikTok promised to hire an additional 15,000 jobs, more than the 10,000 positions the company already pledged to fill earlier this year. It’s unclear if there’s a timeline to achieve that target, or guarantees that it will follow through. Facebook Inc., the largest U.S. social media company, employed about 45,000 people in 2019, while Twitter Inc. employed only 4,900, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Proponents of the deal told the Trump administration that the new company would be controlled by American investors by counting the passive stakes of existing shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent, people familiar with the matter said. Although ByteDance will have an 80% stake in the new company, existing U.S. investors hold a 40% stake in ByteDance. That tallies up to 53% ownership by U.S. companies and investors -- although that doesn’t entail majority control or voter rights, the people said.TikTok Global, which will be an independent company, will hold an initial public offering in less than 12 months and the stock will be listed on a U.S. exchange, according to the statement. After going public, U.S. ownership of TikTok Global will increase and continue to grow over time, it added.While the Chinese government must now sign off on the transaction for it to go forward, as of earlier this week, ByteDance was growing increasingly confident that the proposal would pass muster with Chinese regulators, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Early reaction from Chinese state media appeared positive. “This scheme is still unfair, but it avoids the worst result, that TikTok is shut down or sold to a U.S. company completely,” wrote Hu Xijin, the influential editor in chief of China’s state-owned Global Times.Under the terms of the agreement reached early in the week, ByteDance would retain a majority of TikTok’s assets and control over the algorithm, with Oracle and other U.S. investors taking minority stakes.Trump seemed to contradict that on Saturday. “It will have nothing to do with China, it’ll be totally secure, that’ll be part of the deal,” he said. “All of the control is Walmart and Oracle, two great American companies.”Trump spoke with Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and Walmart’s McMillon on Friday, telling them he still expected the U.S. government to receive a cash payment as part of the transaction, according to people familiar with the matter. They agreed to the educational donation as a way to satisfy Trump’s demand, one of the people said. ByteDance first heard about the $5 billion education fund from news reports, a company spokeswoman said.The deal came together last weekend, the result of high-level negotiations between ByteDance, Oracle and top Trump administration officials after ByteDance rejected a bid from Microsoft Corp. and Walmart to buy the U.S. TikTok service outright.Beijing has signaled it would greenlight a deal as long as ByteDance doesn’t have to transfer the artificial intelligence algorithms that drive TikTok’s service, Bloomberg has reported.The Treasury Department said the deal is subject to a security agreement that requires approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius. The term sheet that’s been negotiated between Cfius and the companies will now have to be formalized in a document that details the mechanics for implementing the terms of the deal.That document would likely include requirements related to the establishment of the new company, arrangements governing its relationship with ByteDance, whether an IPO is part of the deal, whether ByteDance will have to divest its entire stake in the IPO and what would happen if for some reason the IPO doesn’t occur, said Aimen Mir, a lawyer at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and a former deputy assistant secretary for investment security at Treasury.In a video posted on TikTok with the caption WeAreTikTok and we are here to stay, interim head of TikTok Vanessa Pappas thanked users for “sticking by us,” she said. “We’re here for the long run.” In the comments below, users said they were happy that the ongoing drama around the ban would subside. “This on and off situation is working on my nerves,” said @iamdavante, who has 4.1 million followers on the video app.(Updates with Pompeo comments in sixth and 14th paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Trump Blesses Oracle’s TikTok Deal, Delays App Store Ban"

2020-09-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp.’s deal to attain a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global and provide computing services to the video-sharing app furthers the software maker’s years-long plan to become a cloud computing heavyweight.Executive Chairman Larry Ellison leaned on his company’s close ties to the Trump administration to land the partnership with the newly formed company, which will help fulfill an ambitious strategy outlined with fanfare half a decade ago to become a credible cloud rival to Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.Retailer Walmart Inc. will buy as much as 7.5% of TikTok Global, which will be headquartered in the U.S. and pursue a public listing in less than a year, the companies announced Saturday in a statement.While other Silicon Valley giants have kept U.S. President Donald Trump at arm’s length, Oracle has embraced him, which may have helped the company gain preliminary U.S. approval for the deal. Ellison spoke directly with the president Friday, two days after Trump said that he “conceptually” didn’t like the TikTok proposal, which would leave computer code and ownership mostly in the hands of its Chinese parent Bytedance Ltd.There’s little to indicate the investment structure of the deal has dramatically changed since then, but Trump nonetheless gave his blessing Saturday. The deal does call for the addition of 25,000 jobs, the creation of a $5 billion education fund, a mostly U.S. led board and several precautions aimed at safeguarding the data of American users.There are very few leaders of Fortune 1000 companies who back Trump and the president is “giving a cloud contract and investment opportunity” to a firm “whose CEO is openly supporting him,” said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University. “The only way I would describe the proposed agreement is strange and a giant step backward for the government’s approach to capitalism.”Much-Needed WinThe administration’s assent gives the Redwood City, California-based company a desperately needed win. Oracle, the world’s second-largest software maker after Microsoft, has struggled to find its footing in the fiercely competitive public-cloud market. In 2019, Oracle’s share of the cloud infrastructure market was so small that Gartner lumped it into an “Others” category of niche players.“For Ellison and Oracle this is a strategic win on the infrastructure/cloud front by inking this partnership and should competitively help its efforts within the Beltway going forward,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note. “A TikTok technology partnership is a symbolic shot in the arm and could have positive financial ripple impacts.”Ellison’s courtship of the president predates this business opportunity. In February, the Oracle co-founder, who is the world’s ninth-wealthiest man, let Trump use one of his California estates to host a political fund-raiser. Not long after, he offered his company’s help in building a database to track the effects of hydroxychloroquine, which the president said was a treatment for Covid-19. The anti-malaria drug proved ineffective.Trump has expressed his admiration for Ellison on more than one occasion, calling him a “tremendous person” in August and saying Oracle was a “great company.””I have a high respect for Larry Ellison,” the president said earlier this month. “He’s somebody I know. He’s been really a terrific guy for a long time.”Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz supported Trump since before his administration began, visiting him in Trump Tower after the 2016 election, serving on his transition committee and dining with him at the White House. Most recently, Catz personally donated more than $125,000 to the president’s re-election bid this year.Pentagon ContractLast year, Oracle missed out on a deal to provide cloud services to the U.S. Department of Defense. Catz told Trump at a 2018 dinner that the process was unfair and designed to favor Amazon, Bloomberg reported. Amazon had been widely expected to win the contract, but Microsoft instead prevailed. Amazon sued the U.S. government, alleging that Trump unfairly interfered in the process.Oracle Loses Appeal in $10 Billion Pentagon Contract FightThe Pentagon deal, valued at $10 billion over a decade, could have helped Oracle catch up to rivals. For more than half a decade, the company has promised to become a cloud powerhouse, with Ellison in 2014 saying that year would be an “inflection point” in its cloud advancement.Oracle’s heritage is producing essential databases that help businesses process transactions -- high-priced technology that was stored in client’s own server farms. The company waited too long to make databases and applications accessible over the internet, and its attempts to provide web-based computing and storage have flailed in the face of more mature offerings from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.The company’s cloud efforts fizzled last year, when it trimmed the workforce in Seattle offices that are focused on the public cloud. Oracle has said that it is moving full steam ahead, hiring staff for other roles and broadening a network of data centers in regions around the world.Oracle made headlines during the coronavirus pandemic when it announced a deal with Zoom Video Communications Inc. to help the video-conferencing company cope with a surge of usage while businesses and schools operated remotely.In the cloud services market, Oracle has touted its aggressive pricing, to be a more affordable option than AWS. That means that its contract with Zoom, which maintains data centers and an AWS partnership, isn’t a cash cow for Oracle.Instead of padding revenue, Zoom, and likely TikTok, will fill space in Oracle’s larger network of servers and be proof points in Ellison’s marketing efforts. The billionaire already touts the Zoom deal during every public statement, to demonstrate to prospective clients and the market that its cloud helps underpin a vibrant service that hundreds of millions of people rely on.TikTok CoupEllison framed TikTok as a coup for Oracle in a statement Saturday, and said that its cloud service has high customer satisfaction.“TikTok picked Oracle’s new Generation 2 Cloud infrastructure because it’s much faster, more reliable, and more secure than the first generation technology currently offered by all the other major cloud providers,” he said.Oracle said that TikTok was “heavily influenced” by Zoom’s decision. It also pointed to a long history of securing sensitive data. The company’s first client was the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and it is now responsible for safeguarding TikTok’s user data from foreign manipulation. Oracle says that its technology will find any backdoors in TikTok’s code.Michael Coates, the CEO of Altitude Networks and former chief information security officer at Twitter Inc., said that’s easier said than done.“With the speed of development and iteration for a social media platform of that scale, it’s infeasible that they would be able to detect a maliciously planted back door to siphon off data if a clever developer put their mind to it,” he said.Being TikTok’s “secure cloud technology provider” won’t be easy because of the complexity of hosting a bandwidth-intensive video-sharing app and lingering security concerns. But Oracle is on the lookout for more anchor tenants.To succeed, it will need to support more than just two social networks, as large as they are. The company will also need to get some of its big legacy clients to bring their workloads to the cloud, which has so far proven to be a tough task.In the meantime, Ellison, who like Trump has a braggadocious demeanor in business, will have two successes to point to, while the president can argue he’s helping to create more American jobs and is making TikTok a U.S. company.The men, both billionaires known for their love of deals, finally pulled one off together.Ellison has said that he is a “dispassionate” political centrist rather than a fervent ideologue. Before the pandemic-fueled recession, he said in a 2018 interview with Fox Business that he appreciated Trump’s economic accomplishments.“I don’t think he’s the devil,” Ellison said about Trump in a Forbes interview earlier this year. “I support him and want him to do well.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Boosts Cloud Ambitions With Help From TikTok and Trump

2020-09-20,"Oracle (ORCL) and Walmart have issued a joint statement confirming their plans to snap up a minority stake in TikTok's U.S. business. Oracle will acquire a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global, while Walmart will take a 7.5% interest.The move came after President Donald Trump approved the deal “in concept” on Saturday. The President has also announced that TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance “has received tentative approval for an agreement with the U.S. Government to resolve the outstanding issues.”To facilitate the deal, TikTok is creating a new company called TikTok Global, as the Trump administration was concerned about TikTok’s Chinese ownership and therefore demanded that TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, divests its U.S. operations to America.TikTok Global will be an independent American company and will be majority owned by American investors. The new company also has plans to bring 25,000 jobs across the country. (See ORCL stock analysis on TipRanks).Software giant Oracle will become its secure cloud technology provider and will host all US user data, and ensure data privacy to TikTok’s users in the U.S. Retail behemoth Walmart (WMT) will provide services including e-commerce, fulfillment, payments to the new company.&quot;All the TikTok technology will be in possession of TikTok Global, and comply with U.S. laws and privacy regulations. Data privacy for 100M American TikTok users will be quickly established by moving all American data to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud data centers, the most secure cloud data centers in the world,&quot; the companies said.On Sept. 15, Needham analyst Jack Andrews assigned a Hold rating on the stock. He cited many unanswered questions related to the TikTok deal structure, its due diligence regarding IP, data privacy and security and the chances of an Oracle-TikTok deal receiving regulatory approval.He added “given the lack of clarity on the deal and further pending news flow, we await more details to assess the partnership’s full impact.”Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on Oracle.

2020-09-21,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he might rescind his tentative blessing for a deal between Oracle Corp. and ByteDance to create a new U.S.-based TikTok service, casting doubt on the agreement as Chinese state media signaled reluctance in Beijing.Speaking in an interview on Fox News on Monday, Trump said he wouldn’t approve the deal if the Chinese company retains control of TikTok. However, he also indicated that he expected Chinese influence to be diluted by a future public offering of the new company.“They will have nothing to do with it, and if they do, we just won’t make the deal,” Trump said, referring to ByteDance, which owns TikTok. “It’s going to be controlled, totally controlled by Oracle, and I guess they’re going public and they’re buying out the rest of it -- they’re buying out a lot, and if we find that they don’t have total control then we’re not going to approve the deal.”Shortly after Trump’s comments, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the China state-affiliated Global Times, tweeted that Beijing would likely reject the deal “because the agreement would endanger China’s national security, interests and dignity.”The Global Times is a tabloid run by the People’s Daily -- the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party. Hu’s tweets are closely watched after accurately forecasting previous moves by China’s government, though his statements at times don’t reflect official policy.ByteDance was pressured into a deal for TikTok in August, when Trump threatened to ban the app in the U.S. over national security concerns about the service’s data gathering. After Microsoft Corp. made a proposal for a full buyout, ByteDance instead turned to Oracle’s offering, in which the Chinese parent will maintain a solid majority stake.ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80% of TikTok Global, which would include the app’s operations in the U.S. and the rest of the world excluding China. On Friday, Trump said that he had approved of the deal with Oracle and WalMart Inc. “in concept.”Under the current proposal, there will be five seats on the board of TikTok Global. Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will become a director, the retailer said in a statement. TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said.The valuation for TikTok has been a looming question in the wake of Washington and Beijing clashing over the negotiations.

2020-09-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Doubts emerged Monday about Oracle Corp.’s deal to take over TikTok as President Donald Trump said he may still renege on his approval and the Chinese government signaled reluctance through state-owned media.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin remains confident that Trump will sign off on the transaction, but U.S. national security officials continue to raise concerns that the data of more than 100 million American users would remain in the hands of a Chinese firm, according to four people familiar with the matter.U.S. officials are bracing for Trump to reject the deal if it becomes obvious that it doesn’t meet criteria the president himself laid out publicly, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Chiefly, the agreement with Oracle leaves TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. as the majority owner of the service, at least until a public offering of the new company created in the deal.Trump said Monday in an interview on Fox News that he wouldn’t approve the deal if the Chinese company retains control of the new entity, TikTok Global.For now, Trump has delayed by one week an order that would have shut down TikTok in the U.S. on Sunday. He could keep extending that deadline until the details of the deals are resolved, two of the people said.“They will have nothing to do with it, and if they do, we just won’t make the deal,” Trump said Monday, referring to ByteDance. “It’s going to be controlled, totally controlled by Oracle, and I guess they’re going public and they’re buying out the rest of it -- they’re buying out a lot, and if we find that they don’t have total control then we’re not going to approve the deal.”Shortly after Trump’s comments, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the China state-affiliated Global Times, tweeted that Beijing would likely reject the deal “because the agreement would endanger China’s national security, interests and dignity.”The Global Times is a tabloid run by the People’s Daily -- the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party. Hu’s tweets are closely watched after accurately forecasting previous moves by China’s government, though his statements at times don’t reflect official policy.Mnuchin has played a central role in working with TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, and Oracle. WalMart Inc. will also invest in the newly created TikTok Global, should the deal be completed.The Treasury chief has kept Trump apprised of the main points of the deal and has openly laid out its limitations, people familiar with the matter say, though it’s unclear if the president fully grasps how different the final outcome could be from his original demands.A Treasury spokesperson said the department had no comment.Since August, Trump has said that he wants a full sale of TikTok to ensure that all Chinese access to American data is cut off. He also wanted the federal government to be compensated in some way for making the deal happen.Instead, the deal that Mnuchin has helped negotiate would leave ByteDance with as much as an 80% share of TikTok Global. Proponents for the deal have said that because of closely held ByteDance’s American investors, Americans would have slightly more than a 50% stake in the new company.Terms of the deal between the administration and the companies will have to be formalized in a document detailing the mechanics of the agreement. A government national security panel will monitor compliance with the agreement after it is implemented, which can include periodic reporting to the government, third-party audits and on-site inspections by government officials.Under the current proposal, there will be five seats on the board of TikTok Global, four of which will be held by Americans. Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will become a director, the retailer said in a statement. Doug Leone and Bill Ford will each have a seat on the board, representing ByteDance investors Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic respectively, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sequoia Capital’s Neil Shen will remain on the ByteDance board, the person said.Sequoia and General Atlantic declined to comment. TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said.Instead of compensation paid directly to the Treasury Department, as Trump demanded, the deal includes $5 billion for an education fund, according to the president. The details of that element of the transaction remain unclear and as of Sunday weren’t included in any updated term sheets for the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.Oracle will host all of TikTok’s U.S. data and secure its computer systems. The company will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the video-sharing app’s Chinese parent to gather data or to spy on its 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter.Giving Oracle access to the code that runs the TikTok app to ensure there are no entry points for ByteDance to gather data carries some security risks, according to Stewart Baker, a national security lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson and a former assistant secretary with the Homeland Security Department. Protecting against vulnerabilities can be challenging and expensive and depends on Oracle having an incentive to devote resources to the task, he said.“What the security agencies have discovered is that access to source code puts an enormous burden on the company that’s supposed to be reviewing the code, and it isn’t a guarantee that you will find all the problems,” Baker said. “Anything that has been reviewed can be changed a day later with an update.”(Updates with details of new board in 15th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Oracle Deal for TikTok in Doubt After Trump, China Remarks"

2020-09-21,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s ByteDance Ltd. is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for TikTok as Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. take stakes in the short-video app’s business to address U.S. security concerns, according to a person familiar with the matter.Oracle and Walmart have rights to buy 12.5% and 7.5% respectively of a newly established TikTok Global under an agreement that won the approval of President Donald Trump, the person said, asking not to be named discussing private negotiations. The two companies would pay a combined $12 billion for their stakes if they agree to that asking price.The final valuation had not been set as the parties worked out the equity structure and measures for data security, the person said. Terms are still in flux and the proposed valuation could still change. Beijing also has yet to approve the deal, though regulators are said to favor any transaction in which ByteDance maintains control of its valuable recommendation algorithms and other proprietary technology.ByteDance was pressured into a deal for TikTok when Trump threatened to ban the app in the U.S. over national security concerns. After Microsoft Corp. made a proposal for a full buyout of the service, ByteDance instead turned to Oracle’s offering in which the Chinese parent will maintain a solid majority stake.“I approved the deal in concept,” Trump told reporters Saturday as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”ByteDance and Oracle representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the November U.S. elections. Tensions between Washington and Beijing are escalating as the Trump administration wages a campaign to contain the country’s technology ascendancy that’s also ensnared Tencent Holdings Ltd., whose WeChat social media app faces a ban in the U.S.”This is part of the broader technology decoupling of our two countries, “ said Melissa Hathaway, president of Hathaway Global Strategies and an advisor to the Obama and Bush administrations. “We’re using our different rules or policies or authorities within our countries to drive that wedge, and forcing choices between our companies and its overall customer base, unfortunately.”The valuation for TikTok has been a looming question as Washington and Beijing clashed over the negotiations. The service for the U.S. market alone has been estimated to be worth $20 billion to $50 billion, or even more. Snap Inc., for context, trades at a $35 billion valuation.ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company, is the most valuable private startup in the world at $140 billion, according to market researcher CB Insights. The TikTok Global deal does not include the app’s China twin, Douyin, which has become an enormous hit in its own right.ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80% of TikTok Global, which would include the app’s operations in the U.S. and the rest of the world excluding China. Venture firms, including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, may also acquire equity in the new business.Under the current proposal, there will be five seats on the board of TikTok Global. Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will become a director, the retailer said in a statement. TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said. It will need to hire thousands of content moderators, engineers, and marketing staff that were previously located in China and around the world.TikTok Global intends to hold an initial public offering within 12 months, Oracle and Walmart said. And Trump said Saturday he wants $5 billion from companies creating the new TikTok venture for an education fund that would teach American children “the real history of our country.”TikTok plans to use proceeds from its IPO for the $5 billion grant, a person familiar with the matter said.

The U.S. software giant has given reassurances it can protect TikTok user data from foreign influence.“Oracle will quickly deploy, rapidly scale, and operate TikTok systems in the Oracle Cloud,” CEO Safra Catz said in a statement. “We are a 100% confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok’s American users.”(Updates with details of $5 billion payment in 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Owner Seeking $60 Billion Valuation in U.S. Deal
2020-09-21,Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) announced today that it was chosen to become TikTok's secure cloud technology provider. This technical decision by TikTok was heavily influenced by Zoom's recent success in moving a large portion of its video conferencing capacity to the Oracle Public Cloud.,Oracle Chosen As TikTok's Secure Cloud Provider
2020-09-21,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. emphasized it will remain in control of a hived-off TikTok Global business, appearing to contradict President Donald Trump’s statements about how the new entity will be directed by Americans and pay an unusual $5 billion fee to the U.S. government.The world’s most valuable startup sought to play down speculation it’s giving up control of valuable Chinese technology and assets after striking a deal with Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. to create TikTok Global. ByteDance will retain full control of its prized social media algorithms and allow Oracle only limited access to view source code for “safety” purposes, the company said in a statement posted to its domestic news service Toutiao Monday.Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will join TikTok’s board. But ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming and the Chinese company’s current directors -- which include Sequoia China’s Neil Shen and General Atlantic’s William Ford -- will reprise their roles. The statement made no mention of Oracle getting a seat, even though ByteDance said Larry Ellison’s company is slated to own 12.5% after a round of funding before TikTok Global goes public within a year. Walmart and Oracle have said American citizens will take up four of the five board seats for TikTok Global.In a blog post entitled “clarifying groundless rumors about TikTok,” ByteDance contested Trump’s assertions his government will get $5 billion as part of the deal. It said that figure was just an estimate of the amount of taxes TikTok Global would pay over several years if the business proved successful.TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the November U.S. elections. Tensions between Washington and Beijing are escalating as his administration wages a campaign that’s also ensnared Tencent Holdings Ltd., whose WeChat app faces a similar ban.ByteDance’s statement raises more questions over an arrangement cobbled together over just a few weeks to prevent the banning of the popular social video platform, which the White House accuses of spying on Americans and potentially influencing the elections. The Chinese company is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for TikTok Global, in which ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80% after Oracle and Walmart invest.Trump has previously said the White House deserves a cut of the deal for making it possible. On Saturday, he said the companies agreed to pay $5 billion to bankroll an education fund that would teach American children “the real history of our country.” TikTok will pay more than $5 billion in “new tax dollars to the U.S. Treasury” and develop an AI-driven online video curriculum, according to a joint announcement from Oracle and Walmart.But ByteDance said the promised tax payment had nothing to do with the deal.“As for the so-called $5 billion tax to the U.S. Treasury, that refers to an estimate of the corporate income tax and other taxes TikTok will have to pay in coming years as part of its business development,” ByteDance added. “TikTok is confident in its future but the actual tax amount will have to be determined in accordance with the actual state of the business and American tax structures.”While Trump is portraying the agreement as a victory, the business remains under Chinese control. ByteDance said Monday Oracle -- which won the right as part of the transaction to review TikTok’s source code for security threats -- will only review the software in a controlled environment. ByteDance cited past examples such as Microsoft Corp.’s transparency center in China, which lets experts review code in a designated location only.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Asserts Control of TikTok and Contests $5 Billion Fee

2020-09-21,"(Bloomberg) -- The TikTok video-sharing app was already under U.S. scrutiny when users pranked President Donald Trump’s campaign by pretending to reserve thousands of tickets to a June re-election rally in Oklahoma.For Trump administration hardliners who wanted a tougher stance toward Beijing and viewed the Chinese-owned app as a national security threat, it was the perfect moment to pounce. The president, furious over the Covid-19 pandemic and embarrassed by empty seats at his campaign event, obliged.Linking TikTok to Beijing’s handling of the raging coronavirus outbreak, Trump in July threatened to ban the app used by 100 million Americans unless China handed over control of the company, its algorithms and data to the U.S. Hearkening back to his New York real estate days, he also insisted the U.S. government get compensated in the process.The deal Trump signed off on Saturday, hours before a Sept. 20 deadline, does almost none of that.Trump said he wanted the U.S. part of the business owned by an American company. But China’s ByteDance Ltd. remains the majority shareholder in a new U.S. company that will include fresh investments by Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. in a future fundraising round.Trump said he wanted the data to stay in American hands, for national security reasons. And he succeeded: Oracle becomes TikTok’s cloud provider, taking over the responsibility of hosting user data on servers within the U.S. But the algorithm itself -- the thing that makes TikTok TikTok, and that critics warn can influence public opinion if its recommendations engine is abused -- will still belong to ByteDance so national security concerns remain, experts said.TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTakeAnd the government payout? That turned into a vaguely worded promise of new tax dollars, and a new education initiative to teach kids reading and math online.“As for the so-called $5 billion tax to the U.S. Treasury, that refers to an estimate of the corporate income tax and other taxes TikTok will have to pay in coming years as part of its business development,” ByteDance said in a statement Monday. “TikTok is confident in its future but the actual tax amount will have to be determined in accordance with the actual state of the business and American tax structures.”Still, Trump said he was satisfied.“They’re going to be setting up a very large fund,” Trump said Saturday. “That’s their contribution that I’ve been asking for.”The president did get a partial victory. He said the new company will have a Texas headquarters and promised to hire 25,000 Americans, although no breakdown or timeline for the hiring was provided. The board will be American-run. Most importantly, the move wraps up a crisis six weeks before the U.S. election, concluding one of the more extraordinary episodes in a presidency that has been filled with them.“It’s a great deal for America,” Trump said Saturday. “It’ll be a brand new company, it will have nothing to do with any outside land, any outside country, it will have nothing to do with China, it’ll be totally secure, that’ll be part of the deal.”All About Cfius, Trump’s Watchdog on China Dealmaking: QuickTakeStatements like those are causing skeptics to say Trump singled out TikTok for political reasons -- either because of a perception its users dislike him, or to bludgeon China -- and that he took an agreement that met few of his terms for the same reason. They add that the president’s direct involvement and his acceptance of a deal brokered by a key ally -- Oracle founder Larry Ellison -- reeks of political interference.“The government should be in the business of citing national security concerns but they shouldn’t be in the business of brokering a back-room deal with a U.S. company,” said Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University. “You have to ask yourself -- why didn’t they go through the proper steps?”For national security hawks, a key issue all along was Chinese control of American users’ data. Traditionally, U.S.-developed software and apps were exported abroad -- think Facebook or Twitter. TikTok was the first Chinese app to rocket to such popularity in the U.S., giving Beijing a chance to project the sort of “soft power” abroad that it long craved.Trump Blesses Oracle’s TikTok Deal, Sets Up App Store Ban DelayFor Trump, it was more personal, according to a person familiar with the matter. The White House was furious that TikTok users may have encouraged people to request but never use tickets to the June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The rally was billed as Trump’s first big event after months sheltering from the coronavirus, and the campaign expected tens of thousands of people to show up. In the end, about 6,000 people turned out and Trump was greeted by rows of empty seats.At the same time, a security review of the app was underway. The scrutiny stemmed from ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, a lip-synching app based in China but whose majority of users were in the U.S. It was folded into TikTok. ByteDance didn’t report the deal to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. for approval, but two years later the panel contacted ByteDance.The issue simmered into 2020 as tensions between Washington and Beijing soared and the Covid-19 pandemic initially dismissed by Trump began killing tens of thousands of Americans. Cfius opened a formal investigation into the acquisition in June.Oracle Boosts Cloud Ambitions With Help From TikTok and TrumpThe Cfius probe was in keeping with much stricter investigations against China under Trump. He previously blocked three acquisitions by Chinese investors, the most of any president, while numerous other deals have collapsed after the committee raised national security alarms.It was worries about personal data, for instance, that prompted Cfius last year to force the Chinese owner of the gay-dating app Grindr to sell the business.With a Sept. 20 deadline Trump set for a deal looming, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin got to work. By last week, a resolution appeared to have been found. Treasury sent a term sheet to ByteDance that laid out the conditions which were eventually approved: four out of five people on the board would be American, including a representative from Walmart, along with a national-security committee led by an American with cyber-security credentials to oversee any issues that arise.TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTakeIn addition, the sides agreed that the new company -- which Mnuchin dubbed TikTok Global -- would file for an initial public offering next year. The company will seek a valuation of $60 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.That seemed to persuade the most significant participants on the Cfius executive committee. Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross were always on board. But even Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who had long warned about the dangers of China exploiting U.S. user data, eased his own opposition. Several Republican senators who had also expressed early opposition came around.Questionable math is being leaned on to get around Trump’s demand that U.S. investors have majority control of the company. ByteDance will retain an 80% stake in the new company. But because existing U.S. investors hold a 40% stake in ByteDance, counting the new investments by Oracle and Walmart as well as other minority American shareholders, the Trump administration claimed there is 53% ownership by the U.S.Then there are the clear political overtones associated with the new investors. Oracle CEO Safra Catz was on Trump’s transition team and was considered a possible candidate for top jobs including national security adviser and World Bank president. Company founder Ellison hosted a fundraiser for Trump and met with Pompeo along with other tech titans in January.Credibility QuestionsIt’s not just Oracle: Sequoia Capital, a major investor in ByteDance who helped broker the TikTok deal, will also retain its stake in the Chinese company. Sequoia managing partner Doug Leone donated $50,000 last year to Trump Victory, which splits contributions between the campaign and the Republican National Committee. He also gave the same amount that year to America First Action, a super-PAC that supports Trump, although a person familiar said Leone doesn’t have a personal relationship with the president.“There are reasons to be skeptical about President Trump’s own motivations to ban the app, given the perverse political incentives in play,” said Elsa Kania, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “Different rationales and motivations with varying degrees of credibility appear to come into play.”Officials at Sequoia declined to comment. Officials at Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether political factors gave them an edge in getting the deal approved. White House officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on that issue or the role the Tulsa rally played in motivating Trump to act.As part of the deal, Oracle will get access to TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather user data, people familiar with the matter said last week. Yet ByteDance will allow Oracle only limited access to view the source code for “safety” purposes and retain full control of its algorithms, the company said in its statement Monday.Security experts said the original source of concern about TikTok still hasn’t been resolved, even with Oracle and the U.S. board having insight into the app’s technology and data.“These sound like great political talking points,” said Michael Coates, chief executive officer of Altitude Networks and former chief information security officer at Twitter. “The whole notion that this is protecting national security is pretty challenging. There are plenty of instances where U.S. companies bundle data and put national security at risk. Picking the odd foreign company that does this and targeting them won’t help.”(Updates with cloud arrangement detail in the sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Celebrates TikTok Deal That Falls Short of Key Demands

2020-09-22,"Investors who owned stocks in the 2010s generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return for the decade was 250.5%. But there's no question some big-name stocks did much better than others along the way.Oracle's Difficult Decade: One poor performer of the last decade was cloud service stock Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL).Oracle spent much of the past decade transitioning away from its legacy businesses of on-premise database services, hardware and business software to a new cloud services-centric model.In 2016, Oracle paid $9.3 billion for cloud pioneer NetSuite. Unfortunately, Oracle's major investments in cloud services aren't generating the type of growth investors had hoped. Revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2020. Cloud license revenue and on-premise license revenues have been particularly weak in recent quarters.TikTok Drama: The good news for Oracle investors is that the company has made two potentially game-changing deals during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, Oracle landed Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) as a cloud customer earlier this year. Second, Oracle emerged as a winner from a messy bidding war among American companies to partner with popular social media app TikTok.When Chinese TikTok parent company ByteDance rejected a buyout offer from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), Oracle swooped in to secure a deal to become TikTok's &quot;technology partner.&quot; As part of the deal, Oracle will not have access to TikTok's prized algorithm, but it will reportedly take a 12.5% ownership stake in TikTok.Oracle started the 2010s trading at around $25. By mid-2010, the stock had dipped to $21.24, its low point of the decade. By late-2015, Oracle hit $45.71, but it wouldn't reach the $50 level for the first time for nearly two years. Oracle spent much of 2017 and 2018 trading between $42.50 and $52.50 before breaking out to the upside in early 2019.Oracle hit its high point of the 2010s in mid-2019 when the stock peaked at $60.502020 And Beyond: The COVID-19 sell-off sent Oracle shares tumbling as low as $39.71 in March 2020, but its deals with Zoom and TikTok had the stock back making new all-time highs of $62.60 just this week.Oracle shares have been a profitable investment over the past decade, but the return isn't particularly outstanding. In fact, $1,000 worth of Oracle stock in 2010 would be worth about $2,528 today, assuming reinvested dividends.Looking ahead, analysts are optimistic Oracle will hold onto its 2020 gains. The average price target among the 23 analysts covering the stock is $63, suggesting about 4.2% upside from current levels.Related Links:Here's How Much Investing ,000 In AMD At Dot-Com Bubble Peak Would Be Worth Today Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Nvidia At Dot-Com Bubble Peak Would Be Worth TodayPhoto credit: Raysonho, via WikimediaCommonsSee more from Benzinga  * Why Trump's TikTok Ban Could Be 'Fort Sumter Moment' In Cold Tech War Between US, China  * 'Partnership Better Than Acquisition': Analysts React To Oracle-TikTok Deal  * How TikTok's Value Per User Compares To Facebook And Other Social Media Platforms(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

ByteDance &quot;will have nothing to do with it, and if they do, we just won't make the deal,&quot; Trump said.&quot;They are going to buy it,&quot; he said, referring to Oracle and Walmart. &quot;They're going to have total control over it. They're going to own the controlling interest. And if we find that they don't have total control, then we're not going to approve the deal.&quot;Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.Trump also indicated that he expected Chinese influence to be diluted by a public offering of TikTok Global, which an offering process has started.Soon after Trump's Monday comments, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the China state-affiliated Global Times, tweeted that Beijing would likely reject the deal &quot;because the agreement would endanger China's national security, interests and dignity&quot;.Global Times is a tabloid run by People's Daily &#92;- the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party.The rapid-fire comments from both sides reflected the critical stage the deal has entered to hash out an agreement that would keep both Washington and Beijing happy, a likely delicate balance.The Trump administration requires the US operations of TikTok, which has more than 100 million US users, to be owned by an American owner to protect sensitive data for national security reasons. China has recently updated its tech export control rules that requires Beijing to sign off on foreign ownership of Chinese technologies such as the algorithm TikTok uses.ByteDance said in a post on Monday, following Trump's weekend announcement of allowing the deal to go through, that it will retain 80 per cent of stake in TikTok Global after a small pre-IPO funding round. Oracle will take a 12.5 per cent stake while Walmart has tentatively agreed to acquire 7.5 per cent.The owner of TikTok has faced pressure in China for giving in to the Trump administration too easily as the discussions to sell its US business to an American buyer ramped up.In a post on news site Jinri Toutiao, ByteDance also denied the company had committed US$5 billion in taxes to the US Treasury or to create a US$5 billion education fund in the US as conditions of the deal.On Saturday, Trump said TikTok US &quot;will be totally controlled by Oracle and Walmart&quot; and &quot;the security will be 100 per cent&quot;.When Trump insisted in August that ByteDance sell the app's US operations, he was aiming for a clear-cut deal that would hand him a win over China. Trump said that TikTok's Chinese owner can turn users' personal data over to the Chinese government. Failing to reach a deal will result in a ban of the app in the US.Oracle, which has close ties to the Trump administration, emerged late in negotiations, edging out Microsoft in a bid.Under the current structure, TikTok founder will remain on the board. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon will become a director. TikTok Global is likely to be headquartered in Texas and will hire at least 25,000 people, said Trump.The price tag for TikTok has been a moving target ranging from US$20 billion to US$60 billion.Oracle will get full access to review TikTok's source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company's Chinese parent to gather data.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-09-22,"President Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview on Monday that he would not approve the TikTok deal, if its Chinese parent ByteDance retains control.Trump’s comments cast some doubt on the potential that Oracle and Walmart will get approval to acquire a 20% stake in TikTok Global, which would be a newly formed US- based company. Trump had demanded ByteDance to divest its US operations.Trump had approved the TikTok deal “in concept” on Sept. 19, after which software giant Oracle (ORCL) announced its plans to snap up a 12.5% interest in TikTok Global. According to the terms of the deal, Oracle would become TikTok Global’s “secure cloud technology provider.”Retailer Walmart (WMT) would take a 7.5% stake in TikTok’s US business and will provide e-commerce, payments and fulfilment services to the new company.However, ByteDance issued a statement on Monday morning saying that it will retain 80% ownership in TikTok after selling a total of 20% to Oracle and Walmart. He also said the board of TikTok Global would include the founder of Bytedance and the current directors of Bytedance, as well as the CEO of Walmart.Trump warned &quot;Everything is going to be moved into a cloud done by Oracle, it's all through the cloud. And it's going to be totally controlled by Oracle ... and if we find that they don't have total control, then we're not going to approve the deal. It's going to bring 25,000 jobs, and it's going to be located in Texas.&quot; (See ORCL stock analysis on TipRanks).Needham analyst Jack Andrews maintained a Hold rating on Oracle stock on Sept. 21, as he anticipates modest revenue impact from the deal.“While it is difficult to gauge the ultimate financial gain as a result of the investment, our previous work estimated a more modest revenue impact from hosting fees for OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure],&quot; Andrews wrote in a note to investors. &quot;Nonetheless, we believe the addition of yet another marquee cloud reference customer may help further momentum with large enterprises.”Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on Oracle. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 8 Buys, 11 Holds, and 1 Sell. The $61.69 average price target implies upside potential of 1.4% to current levels.

2020-09-22,"China is unlikely to approve an ""unfair"" deal Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc said they have struck with ByteDance over the future of video-streaming app TikTok, the state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial.  The U.S. majors have said they would buy into a new mainly U.S.-owned company, TikTok Global, with a board of directors comprised mainly of Americans, as the parties work to pacify the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which had planned to ban TikTok in the United States on security grounds.  In contrast, ByteDance has said TikTok Global would be its U.S. subsidiary with 80% ownership.","Beijing unlikely to approve Oracle, Walmart's TikTok deal - Global Times"
2020-09-22,"(Bloomberg) -- The TikTok sale saga reached an apparent conclusion over the weekend when President Donald Trump approved a deal. The agreement would allow Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. to buy a minority stake in a new joint entity, called TikTok Global. “I have given the deal my blessing,” Trump said.But the harmony was short-lived. Just one day after Trump promised “no Chinese involvement,” TikTok owner Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. said it would retain 80% control over the new company.By contrast, Oracle said that ByteDance would eventually relinquish its shares. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck said that once TikTok Global is created, “Americans will be the majority [shareholders] and ByteDance will have no ownership.” It’s rare for the parties involved in a major deal to disagree so radically on its contours, analysts say.A key reason for the discrepancy lies in differing views over the eventual distribution of TikTok’s shares. One statistic that’s been touted by both Oracle and Walmart is that American investors will control more than 50% of the new TikTok Global. At first, that sounds like it’s at odds with ByteDance’s insistence that the company will get a 80% stake.But U.S. citizens own a substantial chunk of ByteDance itself: American investors, including General Atlantic and Coatue control 40% of the Chinese internet giant, people familiar with the matter have said. That means they will in theory own 40% of ByteDance’s TikTok stake, too. Combined with Oracle and Walmart’s 20%, that brings U.S. investor control to more than half.Put another way, imagine TikTok Global issues 100 shares:Oracle and Walmart own 20 shares, combined.Bytedance owns 80 shares.Bytedance’s U.S. investors would own 40% of Bytedance’s 80 shares, or 32 shares.The result: U.S. investors would own 52 shares combined, or more than 50%.Even as Oracle and Walmart stress American ownership, though, ByteDance’s statements have shown that the company may not be inclined to relinquish control over TikTok Global to its American investors. If ByteDance does remain the largest shareholder, depending on how the deal is structured, the company could have voting rights conferring greater decision-making authority than is granted to TikTok’s minority shareholders.The exact math may not matter very much, given Trump’s demand that China have no involvement in the new TikTok. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes the 50% U.S. ownership stake is important to the Trump Administration, but Ives also doesn’t think ByteDance will step out of the picture entirely. “ByteDance is still going to have a significant role in TikTok,” Ives said. “Any suggestion saying the opposite would be misguided.”Simply diluting ByteDance’s 80% stake in the company with U.S. investments might not be enough for Trump. “Something’s gotta give because you can’t have 80% and 0% at the same time,” said Mark Shmulik, an analyst at AB Bernstein.TikTok Global’s board is slated to have five seats, including at least four American members. Walmart says its chief executive officer, Doug McMillon, will take one board seat, and others will go to existing ByteDance investors, including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, Bloomberg reported. In Sequoia’s case, Global Managing Partner Doug Leone, who is in the Bay Area, will join the board, while Managing Partner Neil Shen, who founded Sequoia Capital China, will stay on ByteDance’s board.Elsewhere, many of the details are still undecided or are not yet publicly known. Trump on Monday said that the new TikTok Global would be “totally controlled by Oracle” after a planned public offering sometime next year. But the deal approved over the weekend calls for Oracle to buy up to 12.5% of the new TikTok entity, which appears to be far from total control. “If we find that [Oracle doesn’t] have total control then we’re not going to approve the deal,” Trump said Monday.It’s possible, though, that a creative corporate structure could give Oracle outsize power. Some tech companies like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have special super-voting shares, meaning a minority investor could still control the company, assuming their shares carry extra votes. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg owned just 12.9% of all Facebook’s outstanding shares as of April 3, for example, but controlled nearly 58% of the vote thanks to super-voting shares. TikTok could theoretically do the same, issuing special voting shares to Oracle in order to ensure the company has control over TikTok.Despite months of fraught negotiations, the deal could still fall through -- and not just because of Trump. ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has also been reluctant to give up control of his company, which some believe could be the world’s next great entertainment platform. And Chinese state-owned media on Monday suggested that Bejing wouldn’t approve a deal like the one floated over the weekend.Bernstein’s Shmulik says he’s never before seen a tech deal play out like this one. “I’m not even sure the companies fully understand what’s going on,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The Math Doesn’t Add Up on TikTok’s Deal With Oracle and Walmart

2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Attorney General William Barr and other U.S. national security officials haven’t signed off on plans to let Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. take a stake in TikTok to avert President Donald Trump’s threat to bar the social network from the U.S., according to a person familiar with the matter.The officials have unresolved concerns about the national security implications of the proposal, as competing camps emerge inside the administration, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has led officials supporting the plan.TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., faces a deadline this weekend to win approval for a sale of its U.S. operations or face a de facto ban in the U.S. stemming from an Aug. 6 executive order by Trump. The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to questions about Barr’s current thinking on the TikTok deal.ByteDance has asked a federal judge for a preliminary injunction to block the order that would force TikTok off of the app stores run by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Justice Department spokeswoman Mollie Timmons declined to comment on whether the department will challenge the injunction.The development was reported earlier by Fox Business. Over the weekend, Oracle and Walmart agreed to take 20% of a new U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global. Trump praised the TikTok agreement on Saturday, calling it “a great deal for America.”“It’ll be a brand new company, it will have nothing to do with any outside land, any outside country, it will have nothing to do with China, it’ll be totally secure, that’ll be part of the deal,” Trump said.But questions have been raised since then about most of those assumptions, with initial outlines of the deal showing ByteDance would continue to control the valuable artificial intelligence algorithms for TikTok’s popular short videos and would initially maintain majority ownership of the U.S. spinoff. Ownership percentages could change after a proposed initial public offering.National security experts have also cast doubt on the technical feasibility of Oracle being able to police TikTok’s code in real timeTrump’s order to ban TikTok followed an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews proposed acquisitions of domestic businesses by overseas investors for national security concerns. Trump’s threat set off a flurry of attempted deal-making, pushing ByteDance to seek a sale of the app’s American operations to a U.S. company.The Justice Department is one of the agencies represented on Cfius, which is led by the Treasury Department.Resistance to the TikTok deal has developed in China, where state-run media have denounced it as “an American trap” and a “dirty and underhanded trick.”(Updates with Fox Business reporting the development, in paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Barr Remains Wary of Security Concerns in Oracle’s TikTok Deal
2020-09-23,"TikTok filed for an injunction Wednesday to stop President Trump from banning the video-sharing app from being downloaded, an action that is expected to happen Sept. 27 unless a deal involving Oracle Corp.  and Walmart Inc.  is completed. President Trump issued an executive order last month that sought to ban TikTok and WeChat, a messaging app owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. , due to their Chinese ownership. WeChat managed to receive an injunction through the court system to stop its ban, as TikTok attempted to strike a deal for a new corporation in the U.S. that would be partially owned by Oracle and Walmart. That deal is still in doubt, however, so TikTok and Chinese parent company ByteDance filed for an injunction Wednesday. &quot;If allowed to remain in place, the Prohibitions will irreversibly destroy the TikTok business in the United States: they will devastate TikTok's user base and competitive position, destroy the goodwill necessary for TikTok to maintain commercial partners in the United States, and cripple Plaintiffs' ability to attract and retain talent,&quot; the filing seeking an injunction states.",TikTok seeks injunction to stop Trump ban
2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump’s spat with China over “total control” of TikTok raises a corporate governance question: Does majority ownership actually give you control over a business empire? The Chinese, and the broader conglomerate world, may have a very different view from the administration. The first details that surfaced from TikTok’s planned deal with Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. would put most of the company in American hands. U.S. investors already own 40% of TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd. The current proposal would give 32% of TikTok to American investors (40% of ByteDance’s 80% stake), plus Oracle and Walmart’s 20%. This gets us to 52%.But just because you have a majority stake doesn’t mean you have control. It all depends on the corporate structure. Asia’s conglomerates routinely grip onto their empires via pyramid-shaped ownership. Often, those with the most shares are mere passive investors, enjoying economic interests only. South Korea’s chaebol take this art to perfection, using just a few billion worth of shares to control empires multitudes larger. For instance, the fund industry is the largest holding bloc of blue chip Samsung Electronics Co., and Korea’s National Pension Service is its single biggest shareholder. But the founding Lee family is firmly in the driver’s seat, mostly through the 13.5% stake held by Samsung C&T Corp. and Samsung Life Insurance Co. At about 5%, the Lee family’s direct holdings in Samsung Electronics are tiny. Or consider Korea’s third largest conglomerate, SK Holdings Co. The Chey family has about a 25% stake in the company, which owns 27% of SK Telecom Co. That business, in turn, has 20.1% interest in chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. In other words, with just $3.2 billion worth of shares, the family has the $51 billion semiconductor crown jewel at its command. This is the capital-efficient way to control empires. Founders build layers of holding companies, owning more shares than any other single entity at each level above the flagship assets. These are often too expensive to hold directly.China’s conglomerates are taking to the Korean fashion of layering, too. For instance, Tsinghua Unigroup Co., a commercial arm of the prestigious Tsinghua University and the closest thing the country has to the Samsung group, has built a labyrinth of holding companies to control cutting-edge (by Chinese standards) flash-memory chipmaker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. In terms of money spent, the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, known simply as the Big Fund, is by far YMTC’s largest shareholder, owning 49% via direct and indirect holdings. But since Unigroup has more than a 50% stake at each level of YMTC’s ownership tree, it has control, even though it has put in only 13% of the registered capital. In many ways, corporate layering is even more important to the Chinese than the Koreans. While chaebol simply want to maximize control, mainland entities sometimes use this structure to hide ballooning debt. As part of its deleveraging campaign two years ago, Beijing pressed pause on costly public-private partnership projects. State-owned entities would insist on large minority interests on paper so they didn’t have to consolidate these infrastructure build-outs and report the new debt that arose from them higher up the chain.Beijing might be able to curb this behavior among its affiliates, but it can’t stop private entities from mimicking the chaebol structure. Real-estate developers, for example, have also used joint ventures to hide debt from their balance sheets. The trend of conglomerate structuring will only blossom in China.So how to structure the new TikTok Global makes a world of difference. ByteDance owning an 80% stake outright is a very different proposition from Oracle’s vision, which involves distributing the 80% proportionally to ByteDance’s current shareholders. The former leaves the Chinese firmly in control, while the latter is perhaps more palatable to the U.S.  When it comes to voting rights, indirect stakes give you nothing. Trump’s claim that the U.S. will have control is self-serving. As a dealmaker, he’s a long way away from turning TikTok into an American company. He'd better have an army of corporate lawyers ready to scrutinize the art of layering.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg) -- A Facebook Inc. tool that state election officials are using to find and report voting misinformation doesn’t effectively monitor most posts on the social media service, including those in private groups or from most individual users, according to a watchdog group’s report.Facebook has been encouraging elections authorities to use CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned content-monitoring system, to find voting misinformation in their states. CrowdTangle’s dashboard covers public Facebook pages and groups but “doesn’t include posts from most individual users or from private Facebook groups,” according to the report from the Tech Transparency Project. It also doesn’t include content from Instagram accounts with fewer than 75,000 followers.“Facebook isn’t providing states with all the data they need to spot disinformation, such as voter suppression efforts, ahead of the November election,” the report concludes. The TTP is part of the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit research group that investigates corporate influence in Washington.While the company uses its own machine-learning technology and fact checkers to flag misleading or inaccurate voting information, Facebook will be relying on election authorities to spot and report issues quickly during the vote, to help understand local issues and to decide what to prioritize. The social-media company has expanded its policies to label or remove more voting misinformation ahead of the U.S. election, including posts from politicians that claim victory before official results are available.But Facebook has also been criticized for failing to enforce its voting misinformation policy against U.S. President Donald Trump, who has used the service to share misleading information about vote-by-mail efforts in various states. Experts fear voting misinformation could flourish in the lead-up to the election on social platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter Inc.A Facebook spokeswoman said the company doesn’t rely on election officials for the vast majority of its fact checking, but has established a dedicated reporting channel for those officials to report “suspicious claims about voting and polling conditions.” The company said it doesn’t allow most individual accounts to be monitored using CrowdTangle for privacy reasons.“There is no silver bullet to combating misinformation, which is why we’re taking a multi-pronged approach that includes a global fact-checking program and ongoing work with state election authorities to fight voter suppression,” the representative said in a statement.TTP said that Facebook has pushed CrowdTangle as a good tool for election authorities. Emails obtained using public records requests show Facebook was suggesting the service in March of this year, and also presented the tool to state officials last fall, according to the report. “We want to leverage the on-the-ground knowledge that you have on the threats to election integrity in your state,” a Facebook employee told officials during a CrowdTangle training presentation last October.But Facebook itself has questioned CrowdTangle’s usefulness in detecting viral content on the service. CrowdTangle measures engagement -- likes, comments and shares -- but doesn’t measure total impressions, or the number of times a story appears in front of a Facebook user, even if they don’t engage with it. A Facebook product executive in July tweeted that popular story lists compiled using CrowdTangle “don’t represent what most people see” on Facebook.“That argument appears to undercut what Facebook has been telling state officials -- that CrowdTangle is an effective way to track the ‘most seen content’ on the platform,” TTP wrote in its report.Facebook has criticized previous reports from TTP, including one that suggested the company delayed a voter registration drive because of criticism from Republican officials. TTP was formerly the Google Transparency Project, which published several critical studies of the internet giant. Oracle Corp., a rival of Google, confirmed in 2016 that it was one of the funders of the project, but TTP Director Katie Paul said it no longer accepts corporate funding.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Tool Faulted for Lapses in Finding Voter Misinformation

2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese state media blasted Oracle Corp.’s proposed deal with the hit video app TikTok, calling the agreement hammered out under pressure from the Trump administration a “dirty and underhanded trick.”“What the United States has done to TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing an unreasonable and unfair business deal on a legitimate company,” the state-run China Daily wrote in a Wednesday opinion piece.That came after the Communist Party-backed Global Times tabloid called the TikTok deal an “unpalatable gambit” and accused the U.S. of resorting to “extortion” in its efforts to compel the app’s owner, ByteDance Ltd., to give up control of its U.S. operations.“Any single company is weak on its own,” the Global Times said in an editorial late Tuesday. “But China as a big country will not accept blackmail from the U.S. nor will it hand over control of an outstanding high-tech Chinese company to extortionists.”The tabloid’s Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin tweeted that Beijing likely wouldn’t approve the current agreement as it endangered China’s national security.“Realizing that banning TikTok in the U.S. market would not go down well with the millions of young users in the country,” China Daily wrote, “the administration then sought to disguise its attack by ordering the developer ByteDance to sell TikTok to a U.S. company, resulting in the proposed deal between ByteDance and Oracle and Walmart.”Oracle Deal for TikTok in Doubt After Trump, China Remarks Doubts about the deal for the popular video app were fueled earlier this week after U.S. President Donald Trump said he may not approve it, and China’s government signaled hesitation through official media.While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin remains confident that Trump will sign off on the transaction, U.S. national security officials are raising concerns that the data of American TikTok users would remain with a Chinese company, Bloomberg reported. U.S. officials are bracing for Trump to reject the deal if it becomes obvious that it doesn’t meet criteria the president himself laid out publicly.A commentary carried by the overseas edition of People’s Daily on Wednesday called the deal with TikTok an “American trap.”“Under the current agreement, this Chinese company will definitely lose its control and core technologies. It is extremely unfair and will bring severe damage to China’s national security, dignity and relevant company’s long-term development,” the commentary said.China Daily’s editorial repeated previous claims by Beijing that the U.S. is using national security as a pretext to ban the app.“National security has become the weapon of choice for Washington when it wants to curb the rise of any companies from foreign countries that are out-performing their U.S. peers,” it said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China State Media Blasts U.S. for ‘Extortion’ in TikTok Deal

2020-09-24,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration was ordered to postpone a U.S. ban on TikTok set for Sunday or respond by Friday to a request by the app’s Chinese owner for a court order temporarily blocking the ban.The owner, ByteDance Ltd., is seeking a preliminary injunction on the ban even as it continues to pursue approvals from the administration for a sale of the video-sharing app’s U.S. operations to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. forced by President Donald Trump. It has asked the court to weigh its request ahead of the prohibition, which takes effect just before midnight on Sunday.Following a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols gave the U.S. until 2:30 p.m. Friday to agree to delay its deadline or file court papers opposing ByteDance’s bid for the injunction. Without a delay of the ban, the judge would hold a hearing on the injunction request on Sunday morning.The U.S. argued against an expedited schedule in the case, saying ByteDance had filed a separate suit more than a month ago and was late in requesting the injunction in this one.“TikTok is allowed to continue operating with respect to existing users but cannot add users, and the reason for that is that there are significant national security risks” Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Schwei told the judge.Read More: TikTok Pushes Back on Trump in Court While Angling for DealBoth TikTok and WeChat, which is owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., have been labeled national security threats by the Trump administration, which is seeking to stop their use in the U.S. -- or, in TikTok’s case, force a sale to U.S. companies -- on the grounds they could allow China’s government to gain access to personal data from millions of Americans. The TikTok ban, proclaimed in an Aug. 6 executive order by the president, is part of a wider effort by the administration to take a hard line against Beijing, betting that a tough approach will help win the president re-election.The ban on TikTok, effective at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 27, would mean removing it from the app stores run by Apple Inc. and Google’s Android, the most widely used marketplaces for downloadable apps, so people who don’t yet have the app wouldn’t be able to get it. Those who already have it wouldn’t have access to updates needed to ensure its safe and smooth operation. Over time, it would become useless.John Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, told the judge the company sought relief as soon as it was allowed to under the law and that the government would have argued it was premature if filed earlier.Hall said the looming ban was affecting the company’s reputation with users, who are considering moving to less attractive platforms. In the social media industry, Hall said, “users retained is absolutely the lifeblood of their business.” He argued that the ban would increase risks to existing users by preventing them from getting regular security updates.“The urgency of this is created by the Sunday night ban,” Hall said. “That part of it makes absolutely no sense to us.”The case is TikTok Inc. v.

An op-ed said Beijing has &quot;no reason to give the green light to such a deal.&quot;What Happens Next: Final approval of TikTok's merger for its U.S. operations is not in sight as a fallout could come from with side and the number of parties involved.The deal goes far beyond the control of user data as both China and U.S. lock horns with each other to prove their might to be leaders in technology.As the deal waits for approval from both U.S. and China, TikTok is keeping its legal option open. ByteDance has filed for a preliminary injunction against the ban on its U.S. operations requesting the judge's decision by Sunday night to avoid blocking app downloads, the New York Times reports.Related Links:Billionaire Barry Diller Blasts TikTok-Oracle Deal, Kyle Bass Says Security Threat 'Grave'What The TikTok Deal Means For WalmartSee more from Benzinga  * United Wholesale Mortgage Takes SPAC Route To Go Public  * Encouraged By Robust Recovery, Housing Market Demand: KB Home CEO  * 3M Looks To Sell Food Safety Business For .5B: Bloomberg(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-24,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok’s Chinese owner asked a federal judge to stop President Donald Trump from enforcing a ban that would remove the viral video-sharing network from U.S. app stores this weekend.ByteDance Ltd. filed on Wednesday for a temporary block on the ban even as it continues to pursue approvals from the Trump administration for a sale of its U.S. operations to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. The Chinese company asked the Washington court to set a hearing before the rules take effect at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 27 and proposed that both sides file additional briefs this week.ByteDance’s request deploys many of the same arguments a group of WeChat users made to win their own preliminary injunction last weekend against a similar ban. Both TikTok and WeChat, owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., have been labeled national security threats by the Trump administration, which is seeking to stop their use in the U.S. -- or, in TikTok’s case, force a sale to U.S. companies -- on the grounds they could allow China’s government to gain access to personal data from millions of Americans.The TikTok ban, proclaimed in an Aug. 6 executive order by the president, is part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to take a hard line against Beijing, betting that a tough approach will help win the president re-election. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has urged U.S. companies to bar Chinese applications as part of his “Clean Network” guidance.ByteDance also needs China’s approval to proceed with the deal. The company submitted an application this week, though it’s unclear how long Beijing’s review will take.Ticking ClockByteDance’s preliminary-injunction request challenges new Commerce Department rules that would remove TikTok from app stores and require changes to the viral network’s core functionality that the company says would effectively shut it down in the U.S. by mid-November.Filing in response, the U.S. said “there is no need for the parties (or for this court) to conduct emergency proceedings and wade into sensitive issues of national security and foreign policy on the basis of a limited record prepared on an extremely short time frame.”Justice Department spokeswoman Mollie Timmons declined to comment on whether the department would challenge the injunction. The Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.ByteDance argues that the TikTok ban exceeds the Trump administration’s legal authority. Its filing echoes a number of the arguments made by WeChat, which said a ban would infringe on its First Amendment rights and cause irreparable harm to the company.‘Irreparable Harm’TikTok has “made extraordinary efforts to try to satisfy the government’s ever-shifting demands and purported national security concerns,” ByteDance said in its filing. “In the absence of preliminary injunctive relief, the August 6 order and the prohibitions will cause plaintiffs irreparable harm.”Trump has given his conditional blessing to the plan for Oracle and Walmart to take a stake in TikTok, but the arrangement is by no means final. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. still needs to sign off, as do officials in China, where the state-run news media have denounced the plan as “an American trap” and an “underhanded trick.”There are also significant disagreements over the specifics of the deal. ByteDance says it plans to retain 80% of TikTok Global, the new company that would result from the deal. Oracle says the company will be mostly owned by U.S. entities and that ByteDance will have no ownership.U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols set a hearing for 10 a.m. Thursday to discuss the scheduling dispute.(Updates with ByteDance’s request for China approval in fifth graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Pushes Back on Trump in Court While Angling for Deal
2020-09-24,"• After no police officer was charged directly over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, President Donald Trump applauded Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s response to the case.  “He’s handling it very well,” Trump said, after reading a statement from Cameron that said justice is beholden “only to the facts and to the law.”  “We’re going to have to see what happens,” Trump said.",Trump Says Kentucky Attorney General Is Handling Breonna Taylor Situation ‘Very Well’
2020-09-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Just a few days ago, the TikTok deal looked like a win for China. Now its state-run media are denouncing it as “an American trap” and a “dirty and underhanded trick.”The quick shift in sentiment shows the complications of concluding an agreement that is about much more than finding a proper valuation for an addictive video app that has enthralled teenagers around the world. It also has big ramifications for how the world’s biggest economies handle security threats related to new technologies that will drive growth over the next few decades.For China, the political stakes are similar to the marathon trade talks that ended with a phase-one deal in January. Any agreement that makes it look like the Trump administration forced China’s hand could hurt President Xi Jinping, who has repeatedly hailed the Communist Party’s emergence as a great power in contrast to the humiliations suffered under colonial powers centuries ago.“Beijing basically doesn’t want to set a precedent where the U.S. can be allowed to unilaterally flex in this way,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of digital research at the Trivium consultancy in Beijing. “Having some role to play in the decision balances things out a bit.”Over the weekend, Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. agreed to take 20% of a new U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global that would ringfence the app’s international operations and data, said to be worth up to $60 billion. ByteDance Ltd. appeared to get most of what it wanted, including getting to keep the valuable artificial intelligence algorithms for its short-video app.That appeared to appease both Donald Trump, who declared victory and called off a ban on TikTok, as well as China’s most nationalistic media. Hu Xijin, the influential editor-in-chief of the Party-run Global Times, said the deal was “still unfair but it avoids the worst result.”Read more: The Math Doesn’t Add Up on TikTok’s Deal With Oracle and WalmartBy Monday, signs of trouble emerged. ByteDance asserted that it would remain in control of TikTok Global, appearing to contradict Trump’s earlier comments about how Americans would direct the new entity. Oracle issued a statement backing Trump’s view, and the American president warned he could still torpedo a deal if U.S. parties didn’t have a majority hold.“They will have nothing to do with it, and if they do, we just won’t make the deal,” Trump said, referring to ByteDance, which owns TikTok. “It’s going to be controlled, totally controlled by Oracle, and I guess they’re going public and they’re buying out the rest of it -- they’re buying out a lot, and if we find that they don’t have total control then we’re not going to approve the deal.”On Wednesday, two of China’s most prominent state-backed media mouthpieces denounced the deal.“What the United States has done to TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing an unreasonable and unfair business deal on a legitimate company,” the state-run China Daily wrote in a Wednesday opinion piece. Hu from the Global Times tweeted that Beijing likely wouldn’t approve the current agreement as it endangered China’s national security.Read more: Oracle Deal for TikTok in Doubt After Trump, China RemarksThe saga has sparked “complete disbelief” among Chinese leaders, said Gao Zhikai, a former diplomat and translator for late leader Deng Xiaoping who is now chair professor at Soochow University. “China wants to emphasize that the Chinese companies’ legitimate rights cannot be violated without consequences.”On Wednesday in the U.S., ByteDance asked a federal judge to stop Trump from implementing a ban on TikTok that is scheduled to begin this weekend.It’s unheard of for the major parties to a mega-deal to diverge so drastically on its basic contours. While Trump has yet to give his final sign-off and the deal therefore remains in flux, Beijing will intervene if it feels ByteDance risks giving up too much, Trivium said in a Tuesday note.How exactly that would happen is unclear. The Commerce Ministry or the Ministry of Science and Technology could step in if they have concerns over technology transfer. Several others could get involved for antitrust issues. And reservations around national security could involve any body from the State Council or cabinet on down.“The decision could be well out of the hands of the Ministry of Commerce and decided by top leadership from both sides,” said Xu Ke, a law professor at the University of International Business and Economics. “The TikTok case needs to be seen in the context of the trade war, tech decoupling and wider competition on technology between China and the U.S.”While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin remains confident that Trump will sign off on the transaction, U.S. national security officials are raising concerns that the data of American TikTok users would remain with a Chinese company, Bloomberg reported. TikTok’s algorithm could also potentially still be used to influence public opinion -- particularly ahead of the Nov. 3 elections.China is getting ready to hit back. The Commerce Ministry on Saturday said it could restrict trade, investment and visas for companies on an “unreliable entity list” without naming anyone specifically.How Blacklisting ‘Entities’ Became a Trade War Weapon: QuickTakeIt’s still possible a deal gets done. ByteDance has made clear its AI technology remains in Chinese hands, while TikTok’s data on more than 100 million Americans will be stored by Oracle on U.S. servers.Now it appears to be more a question of the political feasibility, both for Trump and Xi.China’s leaders “don’t want to play in favor of Trump for nothing,” said Ding Chenling, a tech entrepreneur who said he has known ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming for over five years. “That will also anger nationalists in China.”(Updates with ByteDance lawsuit in 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China Threatens to Kill TikTok Deal Over ‘Dirty’ Trump Tactics
2020-09-24,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese parent of video app TikTok, submitted an application in Beijing for permission to export technology, as it tries to work out an agreement with the Trump administration that will avoid a U.S. ban on the service.The company said it filed the request with the city’s commerce bureau after China tightened restrictions on the export of certain technologies, including those used in TikTok. A spokesman for the commerce ministry acknowledged the filing Thursday, saying it’ll be assessed “in accordance with the relevant rules and procedures.”China has asserted it would have to sign off on any deal for TikTok, after the White House pressured ByteDance into ceding control over the wildly popular app.TikTok has been caught in the escalating battle between the world’s two most powerful nations. ByteDance worked out an agreement for TikTok with Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. that appeared at first to win President Donald Trump’s blessing, but negotiations have been thrown into chaos because of disagreements over the supposed terms. TikTok is scheduled to be banned in the U.S. this weekend if the deal isn’t finalized.Initially, China seemed likely to approve the TikTok agreement, as long as ByteDance retained control of its technologies. But Chinese state media has voiced increasing opposition to the deal as the Trump administration has expressed demands for more equity in American hands and more control over data and technology.Whether ByteDance ends up with a majority or minority stake in the new TikTok Global, it likely needs government approval.“ByteDance needs to license to TikTok the use of its software and tech, which is a form of tech export,” said Zhaokang Jiang, a trade attorney and managing partner of GSC Potomac. “It should be covered by China’s export control law.”ByteDance said it is waiting for a decision from the bureau on acceptance of the application, without giving details of the application.(Updates with China acknowledging the filing in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Files for China Approval to Export TikTok Tech

2020-09-25,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump asked a San Francisco judge to stay an injunction blocking a ban on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat, as the legal fights grow over the administration’s moves against Chinese-owned apps.U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler issued a preliminary injunction on Sept. 19 at the behest of users who argued those prohibitions trampled the free-speech rights of millions of Chinese-speaking Americans. The app, which was supposed to disappear from American stores Sunday, hosted 19 million regular users in the country and more than a billion worldwide.“The Court’s preliminary injunction permits the continued, unfettered use of WeChat, a mobile application that the Executive Branch has determined constitutes a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,” government lawyers wrote in their filing Thursday. It would allow Beijing to “surveil the American people and collect and use vast swaths of personal and proprietary information from American users to advance its own interests.”In a separate filing Friday, the U.S. said it would submit classified information supporting its motion, including an assessment by the Director of National Intelligence.WeChat has emerged as a top target in Trump’s crackdown on China ahead of the November elections. Tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated after his administration waged a campaign that’s also ensnared ByteDance Ltd. and its short-video service TikTok. The U.S. faces a 2:30 p.m. deadline in Washington from another judge who ordered the government to postpone its ban on TikTok set for Sunday or respond to a request by the app’s Chinese owner for a court order temporarily blocking the ban.Read more: Chevron Asks Global Employees to Delete WeChat After Trump BanThe U.S. says WeChat is a threat because Tencent is intertwined with the Chinese Communist Party, which can use the app to disseminate propaganda, track users, and steal their data. It’s a similar argument Washington has used to force a sale of TikTok to American firms Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc., a mega-deal now awaiting Trump’s and Beijing’s sign-offs.The judge in California has previously found the government provided insufficient evidence of a security threat. “While the government has established that China’s activities raise significant national security concerns -- it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns,” Judge Beeler wrote in her order.The case is U.S. WeChat Users Alliance v.

2020-09-26,"(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge scheduled a rare Sunday morning hearing to decide whether the U.S. can go through with its ban on the popular video-sharing app TikTok.ByteDance Ltd., TikTok’s Chinese owner, has asked the court to block the ban, set to begin on Sunday night, even as it pursues approvals from the government for the sale of a stake in its U.S. operations to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. under pressure from President Donald Trump. It argued in court filings Friday that the ban would trample constitutional free-speech protections.Trump cited national security risks in August, when he announced a ban on the widely-used network from U.S. app stores. The president, who’s also barred WeChat, owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., has told ByteDance its only alternative is to sell its American TikTok business. The U.S. Justice Department argues the apps potentially give the China’s government access to millions of Americans’ personal data.The government emphasized those concerns in a filing on Friday, urging U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols not to grant the temporary block. U.S. lawyers cited FBI Director Christopher Wray’s assessment that China poses the “greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information and intellectual property” as a reason for the ban.Communist Party Ties“One of the tools that the PRC uses to further its goals is bulk data collection,” the U.S. government said, referring to the People’s Republic of China.ByteDance, founded in 2012 by Zhang Yiming, has close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and must abide by laws that require it to cooperate with China’s government, the U.S. said.“In April 2018, the CCP forced ByteDance to shutdown one of its other platforms, and Mr. Yiming issued a public apology in which he pledged to cooperate with and elevate official CCP media,” the U.S. said. “Following this public atonement, ByteDance underwent organizational restructuring with CCP infrastructure now built into it.”Read More: TikTok Pushes Back on Trump in Court While Angling for DealThe ban, announced in an Aug. 6 executive order, is part of a wider effort by the administration to take a hard line against Beijing, which Trump bets will help him win re-election. Starting at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 27, it would remove TikTok from the app stores run by Apple Inc. and Google’s Android, the most widely used marketplaces for downloadable apps. People who don’t yet have the app wouldn’t be able to get it, and those who already have it wouldn’t have access to updates needed to ensure its safe and smooth operation. TikTok is used regularly by 19 million Americans.‘Security Risks’Ahead of the looming deadline, ByteDance had argued for an expedited schedule in the case. The U.S. pushed back at a hearing on Thursday, saying ByteDance had filed a separate suit more than a month ago and was late in requesting the injunction in this one. In defense of the ban, the government again cited security concerns.“TikTok is allowed to continue operating with respect to existing users but cannot add users, and the reason for that is that there are significant national security risks,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Schwei told the judge.Read More: Trump Suffers Another Loss in the TikTok Showdown With ChinaTikTok said that the ban was already undermining its business model by scaring users away, and that it had sought relief as soon as it was allowed to under the law. It said the government would have argued its request was premature if filed earlier.“The urgency of this is created by the Sunday night ban,” attorney John Hall said. “That part of it makes absolutely no sense to us.”User RisksHall added the ban would increase risks to existing users by preventing them from getting regular security updates. The deadline also was affecting the company’s reputation with users, who are considering moving to less attractive platforms, the attorney noted.In the social media industry, Hall said, “users retained is absolutely the lifeblood of their business.”In Friday’s filing, TikTok’s lawyers argued that Trump is exceeding his authority with the proposed ban and acting in an “unreasonable and capricious manner” by seeking to cut off all transactions on the service.The law being invoked “states the President’s authority does not extend to the direct or indirect regulation or prohibition of ‘personal communication’ and the international flow of ‘information or informational materials,’ such as film, photographs, and artwork, regardless of the ‘format or medium of transmission,”’ the Chinese company’s lawyers argued.Such a ban also would trample free-speech rights of U.S. users of the Chinese company’s platform, TikTok’s lawyers added. Millions of Americans “engage in core protected speech on TikTok in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, and cultural ends,” according to the brief. “The Prohibitions unlawfully restrict this speech in violation of the First Amendment.”The case is TikTok Inc. v.

2020-09-27,"A federal ruling is expected to be announced tonight on whether downloads of the video-sharing app TikTok will be banned throughout the U.S.A hearing took place Sunday morning at 9:30 a.m. EST before U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington. During the ninety-minute hearing, TikTok's lawyers argued, via dial-in, that the looming ban from the Trump administration would be &quot;devastating&quot; and an attack on free speech.President Donald Trump has called the app a &quot;national security&quot; risk, citing how it is owned by Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd. If TikTok found a U.S. buyer, the ban would likely not go into effect, he had said. Trump had originally given TikTok's deal with Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) &quot;his blessing,&quot; seemingly putting an end to the dramatic back-and-forth. Once details of the agreement were made public, however, TikTok found itself under scrutiny once again.Under the terms, Oracle would hold a 12.5% stake and Walmart would own just 7.5%. The board of the new company, dubbed TikTok Global, would consist of four American citizens and ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming.ByteDance would own the remaining 80% majority stake of TikTok Global, making it a subsidiary still under the ownership of a Chinese entity.Unless Judge Nichols blocks Trump's order, the ban would go into effect Monday, Sept. 27.Oracle maintains that ByteDance will have &quot;no ownership&quot; of TikTok Global, contradicting what ByteDance announced.It's also worth noting that about 70% of the equity capital ByteDance had raised from investors came from the United States. Among ByteDance's investors are American firms such as Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic.Whatever deal ends up getting announced needs final approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS).TikTok tried to clapback against the ban by filing a complaint in a Washington federal court challenging the prohibitory measures taken by Trump.Currently TikTok has about 1,400 U.S. employees. It intended to hire 10,000 more employees in the weeks leading up to a ban that would have shut down virtually all of TikTok's U.S. operations.The original ban was expected to start on Sept. 20, but the Oracle/Walmart announcement delayed the process.Mcrosoft Corp.

2020-09-28,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s ban on TikTok was temporarily blocked by a federal judge, dealing a blow to the government in its showdown with the popular Chinese-owned app that it says threatens national security.After an unusual Sunday morning hearing, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols granted a preliminary injunction against the ban on new downloads of the video-sharing network, which would have gone into effect at 11:59 p.m. in Washington. The judge declined to grant an injunction on a separate set of prohibitions scheduled for Nov. 12 that are designed to further curb the app’s use in the U.S.TikTok’s owner, ByteDance Ltd., requested the hold after the president ordered the app out of American stores unless the company sold a stake in its U.S. operations to a domestic buyer. The ban would have removed TikTok from stores run by Apple Inc. and Google’s Android, the most widely used marketplaces for apps. People who didn’t yet have the app wouldn’t have been able to get it, and those who already had it wouldn’t have access to updates needed to ensure its safe and smooth operation. TikTok has been downloaded by more than 100 million Americans.“We’re pleased that the court agreed with our legal arguments and issued an injunction preventing the implementation of the TikTok app ban,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue defending our rights for the benefit of our community and employees. At the same time, we will also maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the President gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement.”Vanessa Pappas, TikTok’s general manager, also tweeted support for the judge’s decision.It’s the second legal ruling against the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on popular apps with Chinese owners. Trump has called for bans on both TikTok and WeChat, owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., arguing that the apps could give China’s government access to millions of Americans’ personal data. WeChat users won a court injunction against a ban last week. The bans are part of an increasingly hard line Trump has taken on Beijing as the election approaches.The TikTok order was issued with a sealed opinion, so the reasons for the judge’s ruling weren’t immediately available. The judge asked both parties to submit filings by 11 a.m. on Monday to say whether the opinion should be unsealed. The government submitted sealed papers on Friday that it said contained “confidential business information,” but much of that filing was later released with minor redactions. The judge also ordered both parties to submit a joint proposed schedule for further hearings “on or before” Sept. 30.“The government will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the E.O. and the secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges,” the Commerce Department said in a statement, referring to the president’s executive order.A Treasury Department spokeswoman noted that the November sale deadline remains in effect. If the government chooses to appeal the decision, it would go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one level below the Supreme Court.ByteDance is fighting the Trump administration in court even as it pursues its approval for the sale of a stake in the U.S. business to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. The ruling Sunday doesn’t effect a Nov. 12 deadline for the sale. A lawyer for TikTok told the judge at Sunday’s virtual hearing that the ban was irrational given that ByteDance is in talks to strike a deal the president himself has demanded.“How does it make sense to impose this app-store ban tonight when there are negotiations underway that might make it unnecessary?” attorney John Hall asked.Even as the sale of TikTok is still awaiting final U.S. approvals, two of China’s most prominent state-backed media mouthpieces last week denounced the deal.“What the United States has done to TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing an unreasonable and unfair business deal on a legitimate company,” the state-run China Daily wrote in an opinion piece. Hu Xijin, the influential editor-in-chief of the Party-run Global Times, tweeted that Beijing likely wouldn’t approve the current agreement as it endangered China’s national security.After the U.S. decision, he tweeted that he welcomed the ruling.“I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,” he wrote.On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular news briefing in Beijing that his country opposes “the U.S. abusing the concept of national security.”TikTok’s lawyer told the judge Sunday that banning it from U.S. app stores would undermine security by preventing existing users from receiving weekly security updates. He argued that the government has less burdensome alternatives, such as the sale, to achieve its national-security aims. ByteDance says Trump is exceeding his authority with the ban.“The consequences immediately are grave,” Hall told the judge. “It would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square.”His language echoed the ruling of a judge in California who put a hold on Trump’s WeChat ban last week, citing its effect on free speech and the irreparable harm that the ban would cause to the business.At the hearing Sunday, Daniel Schwei, a lawyer for the Justice Department, countered that “the concern here is about data security risk and leaving data vulnerable to the Chinese government. It is a threat today, it is a risk today, and therefore it deserves to be addressed today.” The U.S. government decided last week to extend its deadline to allow for more sale discussions.In a filing on Friday, the U.S. cited FBI Director Christopher Wray’s assessment that China poses the “greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information and intellectual property.”TikTok is “challenging a national security determination by the president as well as the judgment of the secretary of commerce about what’s necessary to mitigate those national security harms,” Schwei told the judge. “And I think the court owes significant deference to that.”The case is TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 20-cv-2658, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).(Updates with Global Times editor comment from 12th paragraph.

2020-09-29,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok unveiled an election guide within its social-media network, an effort to rally potential voters at a time when many users have become more politically aware amid threats by the Trump administration to ban the app.TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., is rolling out a guide to verified information about the November election from outside sources such as state election authorities and nonprofit groups like BallotReady and SignVote, the company said Tuesday. The guide will be offered in dozens of languages and linked at the bottom of election-related content, an attempt to stem the tide of misinformation that social networks have seen regarding elections.The music-video sharing app, popular with teens and young adults, is positioned to reach people who may be voting for the first time, alongside rival Snap Inc. TikTok is also in a uniquely controversial position. President Donald Trump has ordered that TikTok be banned from U.S. app stores unless its local operations are sold to a domestic buyer, saying it poses a risk to national security. Trump’s executive order has sparked criticism and mockery from some teenagers, who say the app has helped entertain them with lighthearted content during the pandemic.The app’s ban was temporarily blocked by a judge on Sept. 27. Meanwhile, ByteDance is trying to appease Trump with a sale of a stake in TikTok to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc., in time for a Nov. 12 deadline for a full shutdown in the U.S.TikTok said the election guide will provide its 100 million American users with reliable information on how and where to vote, and what candidates stand for. The company will also be including videos teaching users how to spot misinformation and understand their voting rights, courtesy of MediaWise, which promotes digital literacy.With the automatic link to its guide on voting-related posts, TikTok’s approach is similar to Facebook’s. Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. have been working to provide users more context around potentially false information. On a case-by-case basis, Twitter has hidden or labeled Trump’s tweets that mislead users about mail-in voting, saying explicitly when the information is false. On Facebook, the company automatically applies a label to posts about voting, directing users to its own election guide, without adding any judgment on the content.“Our goal is to help keep TikTok a place where authentic content can thrive, and our elections guide reflects our ongoing effort to protect the integrity of our platform and the U.S. elections,” said Michael Beckerman, the company’s head of U.S. public policy, in a blog post.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Unveils U.S. Voter Guide Amid White House Battle
2020-09-29,"Despite an ongoing pandemic and the U.S. economy barely limping along, the Nasdaq is still trading more than 50% above its March lows. The surge in tech stocks in 2020 has understandably led investors to draw comparisons to the dot-com bubble in 2000.The Nasdaq ultimately peaked at 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000. Of course, some dot-com bubble stocks have performed much better than others in the 20 years since the bubble burst.Oracle's Past 20 Years: Without a doubt, cloud services stock Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) had major difficulty returning to its dot-com bubble levels.Oracle went public back in 1986, about 15 years before the dot-com bubble peak. In the 1980s, Oracle's business flourished thanks to co-founder Larry Ellison and the company's database programs that helped bridge the gap between legacy mainframe computers and the booming PC industry. Oracle IPO investors likely never could have foreseen the rise of the internet, smartphones, cloud computing and many of the other tailwinds that have driven Oracle's business in the past 20 years.However, in 1990, Oracle narrowly avoided bankruptcy after the company reported huge losses, laid off nearly half of its workforce and issued corrections to financial filings that had overstated revenues.Dot-Com Bubble Fallout: Oracle's high watermark of the dot-com bubble was a split-adjusted $40.10 back in 2000. In March 2000, Oracle's market cap stood at $245 billion. When the bubble burst, Oracle shares tanked, dropping 59.8% in the year following the Nasdaq top compared to a 59.3% overall decline for the index. Unfortunately, Oracle shares continued to struggle for several more years.Oracle's share price hit $6.26 in early 2002 before rebounding to a pre-financial crisis high of $20.38 in late 2008. During the sell-off in 2009, Oracle shares dropped as low as $11.91. By late 2009, Oracle made it back above $20. In early 2011, Oracle pushed through the $30 level for the first time since 2001.Oracle eventually made it back to its dot-com bubble peak in late 2014, a round-trip journey that took roughly 14 years. In the six years since, the bullish momentum has carried Oracle shares as high as $62.60 this year.Oracle will forever be known as one of the quintessential dot-com bubble stocks given its market cap exceeded a quarter of a trillion dollars. The good news for Oracle investors who bought at the height of the bubble is that the stock eventually helped investors turn a profit overall over the past two decades.In fact, $1,000 invested in Oracle stock at the dot-com bubble peak would be worth about $1,703 today, assuming reinvested dividends.Related Links:Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Intel At Dot-Com Bubble Peak Would Be Worth TodayHere's How Much Investing ,000 In Oracle Stock In 2010 Would Be Worth TodaySee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Oracle Stock In 2010 Would Be Worth Today  * Why Trump's TikTok Ban Could Be 'Fort Sumter Moment' In Cold Tech War Between US, China(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-01,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court opens its new term next week in a swirl of uncertainty, amid a new justice’s politicized confirmation battle and a divisive presidential election the court might have to resolve.The death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ushered in President Donald Trump’s third nomination to the court, Amy Coney Barrett, and the prospect she may tip the balance further toward conservatives in time to decide election-related disputes.The docket already is a meaty one, highlighted by a bid to overturn the Affordable Care Act, a high-stakes clash between religious and gay rights, a battle stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and multibillion-dollar disputes involving Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Oracle Corp., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.On top of that could come a showdown over the Nov. 3 presidential election, with Barrett in place if Senate Republicans meet their aggressive timetable for confirmation. The court already is being hit with pre-election skirmishes over the rules for casting and counting ballots in the contest between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.“Everybody’s kind of on a hair trigger on both sides of the aisle filing litigation this year about the election,” said Paul Smith, vice president of the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for expanding voting rights.Trump has spent months laying the groundwork for a legal fight, claiming despite limited evidence that mail-in voting will produce widespread fraud. Though the court can operate with only eight justices, Trump says it needs nine in time to decide any election cases.“I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely,” Trump said at Tuesday night’s debate. “I hope we don’t need them in terms of the election itself.”Election-related cases could arrive in many forms. This week Pennsylvania Republicans asked the court for an emergency order blocking the state from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.More than 200 lawsuits have already been filed testing how to hold an election during a pandemic, with key fights raging in the pivotal states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida.After the election, one side could challenge state results and create a sequel to Bush v. Gore, the 2000 Supreme Court case that put Republican George W. Bush in the White House by blocking continuing Florida recounts. Or the court may have to referee the electoral vote count fight that formally determines who is sworn in Jan. 20.In a concession to the coronavirus, the justices will again hear arguments by telephone with live audio release, at least in October. The court held remote arguments for the first time in its history in May.Affordable Care ActA more certain fight is set for a week after the election, when Republican-led states and the Trump administration will argue for invalidating the Affordable Care Act, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.Republicans have tried repeatedly to kill the 2010 measure, also known as Obamacare. The Supreme Court upheld the law’s core in 2012 in a 5-4 decision centering on closely related issues. The fight turned on the individual mandate, an ACA provision that originally required people to acquire health insurance or pay a tax penalty.Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said the individual mandate was a legitimate use of Congress’s taxing power. A Republican-controlled Congress later joined with Trump to zero-out the tax penalty, leaving the mandate without any practical consequences.Republican-led states then sued. They now argue that, without the tax penalty, Roberts’s rationale for upholding the individual mandate no longer applies. And the Republicans say the mandate is so integral to the law, even without any penalty attached to it, that the court now must strike down the whole thing.Paul Clement, the lawyer who argued against the law in 2012, said opponents “have a very uphill battle” in seeking to invalidate the entire law. Both Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh have said courts generally should be reluctant to strike down a whole statute because of a constitutional flaw in one provision.Still, Barrett’s potential involvement could give Trump and the Republican-led states a boost. She criticized Roberts’s reasoning in the 2012 case as pushing the law’s text “beyond its plausible meaning.”Religion and Gay RightsThe day after the election, the court will consider what could be a major religious-rights case. The question is whether Catholic Social Services can be excluded from participation in Philadelphia’s foster-care system because the group won’t work with same-sex couples.A federal appeals court said Philadelphia, which contracts with private charities to screen potential foster families, could enforce a city anti-discrimination law.The case raises issues the court sidestepped in the 2018 case of a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake to celebrate a same-sex wedding. Like the Philadelphia clash, the Colorado dispute tested the intersection of religious rights and equal treatment.The Roberts court has consistently backed religious rights, doing so three times in the term that ended in July. The court might rule for the Catholic group without reaching the biggest issues, said Marty Lederman, a law professor at Georgetown Law Center in Washington.Lederman said he expects “there will be many justices who are inclined to find a way to rule for Catholic Social Services, even though I think the city ought to win on the facts of the case.”Mueller RedactionsA Dec. 2 argument centers on a lower court order that would require the Justice Department to give the House redacted parts of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election, along with underlying grand jury transcripts and exhibits.The Supreme Court in July ensured that Democrats won’t get pre-election access to the material, blocking the order while the justices hear the appeal.The House Judiciary Committee sought the records as part of its impeachment inquiry last year. Trump was impeached on different grounds by the Democratic-controlled House before being acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate this year.As with several cases this term, the Mueller fight could look very different should Biden win the Nov. 3 election. His Justice Department potentially could make the case moot by turning over the materials if he takes office in January.Fannie and FreddieThe justices on Dec. 9 will consider whether investors can challenge the 2012 agreements that let the federal government collect hundreds of billions of dollars of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s profits.The Trump administration is appealing a ruling that would force the government to defend against a shareholder lawsuit. The investors say the agreements exceed the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the two mortgage giants.A ruling in the investors’ favor would give them a chance to collect a massive settlement. Fannie and Freddie have paid more than $300 billion in dividends to the Treasury under the so-called net-worth sweep.Businesses clashesThe business-heavy term will also feature:Google’s appeal of a ruling that the company improperly used Oracle’s copyrighted programming code in the Android operating system. Oracle says it’s entitled to at least $8.8 billion in damages. The case, set for argument Oct. 7, promises to reshape the legal protections for software code.A Dec. 1 case that could give companies a broader shield against lawsuits by victims of overseas atrocities. Nestle SA’s U.S. unit and Cargill Inc. are urging the court to end a suit that accuses them of complicity in the use of child slavery on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast.A Dec. 8 argument on a lawsuit that accuses Facebook Inc. of sending unwanted text messages in violation of federal law. The case will clarify what types of technologies are covered by a 1991 law that bans unsolicited robocalls to mobile phones.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Supreme Court Gets Star Turn in Own Drama Over Vacancy, Election"

2020-10-04,"Despite an ongoing pandemic and the U.S. economy barely limping along, the Nasdaq is still trading more than 50% above its March lows. The surge in tech stocks in 2020 has understandably led investors to draw comparisons to the dot-com bubble in 2000.The Nasdaq ultimately peaked at 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000. Of course, some dot-com bubble stocks have performed much better than others in the 20 years since the bubble burst.FANG Stocks Of Dot Com Bubble: Today's investors are very familiar with the FANG stocks, Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). These four stocks both led the bull market since the 2008 financial crisis and dominate today's market with their massive market caps.The dot-com had its own growth of FANG-esque stocks that dominated the tech sector back in 2000:  * Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) reached a dot-com bubble peak market cap of $561 billion back in March 2000.  * Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) reached a peak market cap of $555.4 billion.  * Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) peaked at a $509 billion market cap in August 2000.  * Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) had its dot com market cap top out at $245 billion in March 2000.  * Finally, IBM (NYSE: IBM) had a peak dot com-era market cap of $215 billion.Altogether, these five tech stocks had a peak combined dot com market cap of more than $2.08 trillion, but that valuation certainly didn't last for long.See Also: 5 Ways Today's Market Resembles The Dot-Com BubbleDot-Com Bubble Fallout: A year after the Nasdaq peaked in March 2000, the Nasdaq was down 59.3%. All five of these big tech stocks had taken a hit. IBM was the most resilient of the group, declining just 5.4%. Microsoft shares were down 43.8%, Intel shares were down 51%, Oracle shares were down 59.8% and Cisco shares were down 69.7%.By March 10, 2010, the Nasdaq was still down 53.2% from its dot-com bubble peak a decade later. IBM was the only stock that had generated decent returns, gaining 19.5% overall during that 10-year stretch. Oracle shares were down 39%, Microsoft shares were down 42.6%, Cisco shares were down 62% and Intel shares were down 64.7% during the first decade following the dot com bubble peak.20 Years Later: Fortunately for investors, the last 10 years has been a much better decade for tech stocks than the previous 10 years. Thanks in large part to the FANG stocks, the Nasdaq is now up 120.4% from its dot-com bubble peak.Some of the five big tech stocks mentioned above have recovered to perform well overall 20 years after the dot com bubble. Others have not. Here's a look at how much buying $1,000 in each stock on March 10, 2000 would be worth today, assuming reinvested dividends:  * Microsoft: ,419  * IBM: ,778  * Oracle: ,687  * Intel: ,347  * Cisco: 5Overall, a $5,000 investment in these five stocks split evenly during the dot-com bubble peak would be worth $11,976 today, a 139.5% gain over a 20-year period.Benzinga's Take: Four out of the five big tech stocks of the dot com era have lagged the 120.5% overall gain by the Nasdaq over the last 20 years. In addition, Microsoft is the only stock of the five that beat the 252% total return of the S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) since March of 2000.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Analysts On Twilio Investor Day: 'More Confidence In Owning TWLO For The Next Decade'  * Experts React To Trump's Coronavirus Diagnosis And Its Impact On The Stock Market(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-07,The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday considered whether to protect Alphabet Inc's Google from a long-running lawsuit by Oracle Corp accusing it of infringing Oracle copyrights to build the Android operating system that runs most of the world's smartphones.,U.S. Supreme Court hears Google bid to end Oracle copyright suit
2020-10-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google got a mixed reception at the U.S. Supreme Court as it sought to overturn a ruling that could force the company to pay billions of dollars for improperly using Oracle Corp.’s copyrighted code in the Android operating system.Holding a low-tech telephone session in one of the biggest software fights in American history, the justices on Wednesday questioned Google’s contention that it had no way to replicate the code without forcing millions of software developers to learn a new programming language.Justice Neil Gorsuch told Google’s lawyer that Apple Inc. and other companies have “come up with phones that work just fine without engaging in this kind of copying.”But Gorsuch also raised the possibility of returning the case to a federal appeals court for another look at Google’s contention that it engaged in legitimate “fair use” of Oracle’s Java programming language.Oracle says it’s entitled to at least $8.8 billion in damages. A jury found that Google’s code copying was a legitimate fair use, but a federal appeals court reversed that finding.The court’s ruling, due by July, promises to reshape the legal protections for software, particularly the interfaces that let programs and devices communicate with one another. The case could change how programmers develop new applications and operating systems for devices critical to everyday living, including mobile phones and computers.Safe-CrackingThe argument was scheduled for an hour but went on more than 90 minutes as the justices peppered the lawyers with analogies to restaurant menus, football teams and typewriters. In a skeptical line of questioning, Chief Justice John Roberts likened Google’s actions to those of a safe-cracker.“Cracking the safe may be the only way to get the money that you want, but that doesn’t mean that you can do it,” Roberts told Google’s lawyer, Thomas Goldstein. “If it’s the only way, the way for you to get it is to get a license.”Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested she was was more sympathetic to Google. She asked Oracle’s lawyer, Joshua Rosenkranz, why the court “should now upend what the industry has viewed as the copyrightable elements” of computer code.Tech companies such as Mozilla Corp., Microsoft Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. supported Google in the case, arguing that software developers need the freedom to create new platforms and programs that can communicate with existing technology and devices without the fear of facing copyright liability.Media and entertainment businesses backed Oracle because their industries rely on strong copyright standards. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the Walt Disney Studios, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Netflix Inc., and the News Media Alliance, which represents news outlets such as The New York Times and News Corp., were among the trade organizations that filed briefs in the case.The Trump administration also is backing Oracle.The case centers on pre-written directions known as application program interfaces, or APIs, which provide instructions for such functions as connecting to the internet or accessing certain types of files. By using those shortcuts, programmers don’t have to write code from scratch for every function in their software, or change it for every type of device.Oracle says the Java APIs are freely available to those who want to build applications that run on computers and mobile devices. But the company says it requires a license to use the shortcuts for a competing platform or to embed them in an electronic device.Existential ThreatOracle says Google was facing an existential threat because its search engine -- the source of its advertising revenue -- wasn’t being used on smartphones. Google bought the Android mobile operating system in 2005 and copied Java code to attract developers but refused to take a license, Oracle contends.Google contends the appeals court ruling would make it harder to use interfaces to develop new applications.Google argues that software interfaces are categorically ineligible for copyright protection. The company also contends that the appeals court restricted the “fair use” defense so much as to make it impossible for a developer to reuse an interface in a new application.Android generated $42 billion for Google between 2007 and 2016, according to Oracle court filings.The Supreme Court had planned to hear arguments in March but scrapped that session when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.The case is Google v. Oracle America, 18-956.(Updates with more excerpts from argument starting in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Gets Mixed Reception in Supreme Court Clash With Oracle

2020-10-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Pakistani regulators moved to block the popular video app TikTok in the country, citing the parent company’s inability to police immoral and indecent content on the service.TikTok, which is owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance Ltd., has a sizable user base in Pakistan. The app has been installed nearly 43 million times in the country, including 14.7 million installs this year alone, according to data from research firm SensorTower. That makes Pakistan TikTok’s 12th largest market. The U.S., by comparison, has seen over 200 million downloads, according to SensorTower.A TikTok spokeswoman said the company is in regular communication with Pakistani authorities and removes content in violation of its policies in all markets where it operates. The company’s transparency report shows that it removed nearly 6.5 million videos in Pakistan between January and June, the third-most of any country behind India and the U.S. The same report shows the Pakistani government made four requests to TikTok about content, citing 40 user accounts. Only two of those accounts were removed or restricted.Pakistan, one of China’s close allies, joins a wave of countries moving against the video app. Over the summer, India banned TikTok as part of a broad purge of Chinese apps. Indonesia, Egypt and Bangladesh have also taken steps to restrict TikTok.President Donald Trump is pushing to ban TikTok if ByteDance doesn’t come up with an arrangement to spin off the app to U.S. owners by early November. Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. have agreed to purchase a minority stake in a proposed TikTok spinoff, and while Trump has approved the deal in concept, many of the details are still being worked out.The spokeswoman for TikTok said the company hopes to get the app back online in Pakistan as it seeks to avert bans elsewhere. “TikTok is an inclusive platform built upon the foundation of creative expression, and we are hopeful to reach a conclusion that helps us serve the country’s vibrant and creative online community,” she said in a statement.The Pakistani Telecommunication Authority said in a statement that it issued instructions for the blockage but that it’s open to reversing the ban if TikTok complies with its orders. “TikTok has been informed that the Authority is open for engagement and will review its decision subject to a satisfactory mechanism by TikTok to moderate unlawful content,” the agency said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Banned in Pakistan After Racking Up 43 Million Downloads

2020-10-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc., a software maker whose stock debuted with the biggest U.S. initial public offering in 2020, signed a deal worth millions of dollars with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said.The renewal contract was signed in Snowflake’s second fiscal quarter, which ended in July, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a deal that hasn’t been publicly disclosed. Representatives for Snowflake and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs acted as one of the lead underwriters for that listing. Since the IPO pricing, the stock has almost doubled to $238, pushing the company’s market value to about $67 billion.Snowflake has sought to sign more large enterprise clients and sees the financial-services industry as a key part of that effort. Capital One Financial Corp., which is known for being early to adopt cloud technology, became a Snowflake client in July 2017. That contract is now valued around $100 million, a person familiar with the situation told Bloomberg in September.

2020-10-14,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok Inc. asked a federal judge to block a broad set of government restrictions designed to curb use of the Chinese-owned video-sharing app in the U.S., less than three weeks after the company succeeded in halting the Trump administration’s ban on new downloads.U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington blocked the download ban on Sept. 27, ruling that the U.S. likely exceeded its legal authority under the emergency powers statute it invoked to justify the prohibition. TikTok on Wednesday asked Nichols to issue an injunction against proposed rules forbidding companies from providing the underlying web services that make the app accessible in the U.S.If those prohibitions go into effect on Nov. 12, people who currently have TikTok installed on their phones would still be able to use it, but the app’s functionality would degrade over time. That would amount to a “complete shut-down” in the U.S., the company said in its filing, and make it harder for it to recruit employees.“There would be permanent, devastating harm to TikTok’s user base and competitive position,” the company said, “even if the government ban were to be lifted after a period of weeks or months.”TikTok argued that the prohibitions, like the download ban, are rooted in an improper invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.S. contends that TikTok is a national security threat because its ownership by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. gives the Chinese government access to the personal data of millions of Americans. President Donald Trump has demanded that ByteDance find an American buyer for TikTok, and the company is seeking U.S. approval for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc.A lawyer for TikTok argued at a hearing last month that it “makes no sense” for the government to ban the app while ByteDance is still in talks for the deal the president has sought.Last week, the Trump administration appealed Nichols’ ruling blocking the download ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington. The court on Wednesday issued a briefing schedule for the appeals process: The government will submit an opening brief by Oct. 16, with TikTok required to respond by Nov. 6.The Court of Appeals case is TikTok v. Trump, 20-5302, U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia (Washington).(Updates with detail from the filing)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Seeks to Block Second Round of U.S. Restrictions

2020-10-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Fastly Inc. shares plunged as much as 31% Thursday morning after saying that Chinese internet giant ByteDance Ltd., its No. 1 customer, spent less than predicted in the third quarter on cloud computing services as a result of rising U.S.-China trade tension.Shares of other cloud providers, including Akamai Technologies Inc., Datadog Inc. and Cloudflare Inc., also fell.Fastly, a cloud-platform provider said revenue for the period will be in the range of $70 million to $71 million, compared with its previous guidance of at least $73.5 million. Analysts were estimating sales of at least $74.2 million.“Due to the impacts of the uncertain geopolitical environment, usage of Fastly’s platform by its previously disclosed largest customer did not meet expectations, resulting in a corresponding significant reduction in revenue from this customer,” Fastly said in a statement.The stock declined the most since becoming a public company last May. The shares were trading at $86.57 at 9:42 a.m. in New York.The San Francisco-based company is referring to ByteDance, owner of the video-sharing app TikTok, which this year became the center of a standoff between the U.S. and Chinese governments. The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok in the U.S., forcing ByteDance to seek a buyer. While Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. have agreed to take a stake in a reorganized TikTok, ByteDance is still working out the details with U.S. regulators.Wednesday’s announcement was not the first time that Fastly has been burned by its dependence on ByteDance. In August, the company’s shares fell after Chief Executive Officer Joshua Bixby told analysts ByteDance accounted for about 12% of Fastly’s revenue over the previous 6 months. Less than 50% of that revenue was from the U.S.Fastly has been among the biggest pandemic winners in the stock market this year, with its shares gaining more than 500% as a result of increased internet traffic due to stay-at-home measures.Content delivery networks use a tech distribution platform to push speedy internet content in front of consumers whether they’re buying cases of beer on Shopify, or loading videos on TikTok.Growth hungry investors have been bidding up software stocks this year. Fastly’s rapid share advance pushed its price-to-sales ratio above 50 this week, more than twice what it was just four months ago.“The current global environment has in some ways fueled our business, but has also created areas of uncertainty,” Bixby said in its statement. “While our preliminary third-quarter results reflect the challenges of a usage-based model, we believe the fundamentals of Fastly’s business remain strong, as does demand for our platform.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Fastly Plummets After Tension Over ByteDance Curbs Sales

2020-10-16,"(Bloomberg) -- China is set to pass a new law that would restrict sensitive exports vital to national security, expanding its toolkit of policy options as competition grows with the U.S. over access to technologies that will drive the modern economy.China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, is expected to adopt the measure in a session that concludes on Saturday. The Export Control Law primarily aims to protect China’s national security by regulating the export of sensitive materials and technologies that appear on a control list. It would apply to all companies in China, including foreign-invested ones.The measure would add to Beijing’s regulatory arsenal, which also includes a tech export restriction catalog and an unreliable entity list. The law would also help put China on a similar footing to the U.S., which regularly uses export controls and licenses strategically against its adversaries.Mounting tensions between China and the U.S. have spilled over into the realm of technology. Big Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co., ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. find themselves in Washington’s cross-hairs.“Chinese authorities may have learned a lesson from the U.S. and other countries,” said Qing Ren, a partner at Global Law Office in Beijing.A report carried by official Xinhua News Agency said the draft law stipulates that China could take reciprocal measures against a certain country or region that has “abused export control measures and damaged China’s national security and interests.”The official Legal Daily reported on Thursday that some legislators had suggested source codes, algorithms and technical documents be added as controlled items, and that China should set up some restrictions on exporting technologies on which Beijing has a competitive edge, such as 5G and quantum communications.Whether Beijing will allow the export of valuable Chinese technology is one of the biggest uncertainties hovering over the partial sale of TikTok to Oracle Corp. and American investors. China in August asserted the right to block the deal by adding speech recognition and recommendation technology -- the core of TikTok’s global popularity -- to a list of regulated exports.How Blacklisting ‘Entities’ Became a Trade War Weapon: QuickTakeThe existing control lists are much narrower than the one used by the U.S., staying limited to materials that could be used for nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, Ren said. If it’s expanded in the future “then more products or technologies will be subject to export control in China,” he said.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce partially updated its export control list in August, putting cutting-edge technologies such as recommendation algorithms and drones under Beijing’s watch.While the U.S. is generally ahead of China in most spheres, China controls critical aspects of technology in industries from wireless networking to unmanned aerial vehicles.Tech HeadwayAmerican officials have warned that Huawei -- the leader in next-generation wireless patents -- controls a 10th of worldwide essential 5G patents, and its deep involvement in international standards-setting could post a threat to U.S. national security. The company ranked among the top 10 recipients of U.S. patents in 2019 -- helping China become the fourth-biggest recipient of American patents, behind Japan and South Korea but ahead of Germany for the first time.Chinese companies have also made headway in dominating certain niches. Shenzhen-based SZ DJI Technology Co. controls something like three-quarters of the global consumer drones market. Display maker BOE Technology Group is aggressively filing patents in its bid to get into next-generation OLED screens for smartphones.And in artificial intelligence, companies from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent and upstarts like SenseTime Group Ltd. are taking advantage of unparalleled reserves of data to advance in areas such as facial recognition.How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTakeWhen approved, China’s law will be applied extra-territorially, taking a page from the U.S. Export Administration Regulations’ long-arm jurisdiction that Beijing has frequently criticized. Foreign Ministry officials have repeatedly accused Washington of stretching and abusing the concept of national security in justifying actions against Chinese companies.China is the biggest exporting country in the world and overseas sales provide jobs for millions of people, so it will be careful not to abuse the law, said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a research group under China’s Commerce Ministry. “We highly value China’s image as a reliable supplier in the international market,” Mei said. “So we wouldn’t expand the scope of export control at will.”China’s Ministry of Commerce first published a draft of the legislation in June 2017. It went through two reviews by the NPC in December 2019 and at the end of June. When the draft bill was introduced for its first review, Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan explained to the national legislature that export control is a mechanism aimed at “honoring international obligations such as nonproliferation and safeguarding national security and developmental interests.”But in a draft reviewed in June, national security was given higher priority.“Threats to national security could come from various fields, including the economic field,” said Cui Fan, a professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics. “But we can’t confuse normal competition between companies with threats to economic security and national interests.”Why Trump Is Threatening Your Teen’s Favorite App: QuickTakeThe latest version further clarifies the scope of controlled items and punishment measures for violations. Government departments overseeing export control should publish export control guidance in a timely manner, a spokesperson of the NPC’s legislative affairs commission said on Monday, without elaborating.Foreign companies need not fear the law since it applied equally to all companies operating in China, according to Ren from Global Law Office. Still, he said, foreign-invested companies should be careful if their activities involve the export of technologies.“Chinese employees maybe are not allowed to release the controlled technologies to their foreign colleagues,” Ren said. “This depends on the very specific circumstances of the each individual company. But it could happen.”(Updates with more detail on current control list in tenth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China Set to Pass Law Protecting Vital Tech From U.S.

2020-10-18,"(Bloomberg) -- China passed a new law to restrict sensitive exports to protect national security, helping Beijing gain reciprocity against U.S. as tech tensions mount.The country’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, adopted the measure on Saturday that applies to all companies in China, including foreign-invested ones. The law will be effective Dec. 1.Souring ties between China and the U.S. had led Washington to take action against several Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co., ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok app, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. The new law provides a framework for Beijing to better fight back.While its existing control list is much narrower than the one used by the U.S., the country’s commerce ministry made an amendment in August that included technology such as algorithms and drones. The list could be further expanded to include even more products and technologies.The law stipulates export controls over items of both civilian and military use, military and nuclear products, as well as “goods, technologies and services” that are related to national security, including data related to them. Relevant government departments have been tasked to publish lists of controlled items.Under the law, China can take reciprocal measures if any country or regions abuse their export controls in ways that hurt its national security and interest.Violation of the new export control law will lead to fines of as much as five million yuan ($746,500) and revocation of export licenses. Breaches that jeopardize national security and interests will also face criminal charges, with organizations and individuals outside of China also punishable under the law.Whether Beijing will allow the export of valuable Chinese technology is one of the biggest uncertainties hovering over the partial sale of TikTok to Oracle Corp. and American investors.

Tech Stocks: International Business Machines (IBM)

Former IBM CEO Virginia Rometty missed the cloud. Under her watch, IBM went from being the world’s unquestioned technology leader to a laggard. Facebook is now worth over six times more.
IBM has recognized its mistake. Rometty gave up the CEO chair in April to Arvind Krishna, who was running its cloud operations. He named Jim Whitehurst from Red Hat, the leading open source company in the world, as president.
Since Krishna took over, however IBM stock has barely budged. Despite the cloud experience of its new leaders, IBM remains a hardware company. Its primary profit center remains its Z Series mainframes, and the proprietary software that runs on them. After delivering new versions in the second quarter, systems sales jumped 69%, year over year, to $1.9 billion, and profits rose 4.3%.
But that profit center has been milked dry. Getting rid of older workers just drained its talent pool, and put the government’s eyes on it.
It will take tricky financial engineering for IBM to find the cash flow needed to compete. It could sell the hardware units to private equity, spin out Red Hat, or spin its cloud operations into a REIT, as companies like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) have done.
For now, IBM says it’s focusing on “hybrid cloud.” Here, enterprises retain their own data centers built to cloud standards, then arbitrage larger public clouds like those of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). It’s also pushing its quantum computing efforts, although they won’t contribute to profit for years.

Dell Technologies (DELL)

Dell Technologies is even bigger than International Business Machines and even more undervalued.
The story starts in 2016, when Dell bought EMC, which controlled VMware (NYSE:VMW), for $67 billion. Four years later, $45 billion of the debt remains on Dell’s books. That means the “enterprise value” of Dell, including its debt, is $95 billion. The same calculation, applied to IBM, leads to an enterprise value of $165 billion, on revenue of $77 billion.
VMware and IBM’s Red Hat are valuable because they offer virtualization and other cloud infrastructure software. It’s the kind of franchise the market often values at 10 times revenue. VMware had sales of about $11 billion for its fiscal 2020.
Here is the problem. Because of the funky corporate structure, it is hard to value Dell. What is it really worth without its massive stake in VMware?
The answer is to break Dell up again. Analysts think both companies would be worth more separate. Dell had fiscal 2020 net income of $4.6 billion. VMware could be worth $15-$20 per share more, nearly $10 billion. VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger says VMware could tie up with more hardware vendors if it were independent.
Selling VMware would also bring Dell enough cash to retire its debt and compete more closely against Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). HPE is currently killing it  in “hyperconverged” hardware, a key data center market, and now matches it in server market share.
A spinoff is planned, with Dell and hedge fund partner Silver Lake maintaining a majority stake. The big issue? The move will not raise cash to pay down debt. Moreover, the split wouldn’t happen until September 2021.
Even so, analysts call this a big win that will unlock Dell’s value in hardware, where many of its products are considered leaders. Take it all together, and a patient investor should do well buying Dell here. But you’re buying financial engineering, not the real kind.

Tech Stocks: Cisco (CSCO)

Cisco Systems has been adrift ever since Chuck Robbins became CEO in 2015
Robbins’ strategy has been to shift Cisco’s revenue from expensive networking gear to software subscriptions. It’s not working. The revenue today is the same as it was in 2016. Profits have been uneven. Still, the stock’s low price has analysts pounding the table for it, calling it cheap and undervalued.
But that’s not how tech stocks work. When a company stops growing, it starts dying. A small cut tells the sharks to feed.
Cisco has made a half-dozen security acquisitions since Robbins took over, and 11 acquisitions since the start of 2019. But it’s not solving the problem. The number of bugs hitting Cisco software is increasing. Some impact key products like its high-end switches.
BabbleLabs is one of these recent deals, bought to improve its videoconferencing experience. But that only serves to underline Cisco’s weakness. Cisco practically invented videoconferencing. But when the pandemic hit, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) became a verb. Cisco is now worth only 15% more than Zoom, which came public in April 2019 and covers just one of Cisco’s product niches.
Competitors can smell blood in the water. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished its acquisition of Silver Peak, a software-defined networking company that will be part of its Aruba unit. The move accelerates the shift of networking from a product to a service. It increases the pressure on Cisco.

Nokia (NOK)

The move of hardware to software, and of software becoming open source, has also hit the telecom equipment market hard.
Nokia lost its niche in cell phones, bought into the equipment market, and is now seeing its lead there threatened.
Part of the threat comes from China’s Huawei, which can make equipment for less and has been making inroads into the carrier market as a result. Nokia’s response is to support OpenRAN, a common set of interfaces for Radio Access Networks.
Nokia has been using OpenRAN support mainly to compete with Huawei and its Scandinavian rival, Ericsson. It says a complete set of OpenRAN interfaces will be available next year.
The hope now is that small, OpenRAN companies can be bought out, or parts of the emerging standards held back. That would let Nokia limit competition while still claiming openness. A short price war, initiated by the larger vendors, could quickly finish off the OpenRAN folks, analysts believe.
But there’s another threat.
Microsoft has already bought Affirmed Networks and Metaswitch, making its bid for an OpenRAN company look likely. Facebook is backing the Telecom Infra Project, the consortium that created OpenRAN. Open source, in other words, is coming.
Will Nokia be able to main relevance among tech stocks?

Tech Stocks: Ericsson (ERIC)

While Nokia has been beating a drum for OpenRAN, rival Ericsson has been dismissing the threat.
Ericsson is copying the strategy of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has patents, copyrights and trademarks for all modem buyers to take its licenses. Importantly, these licenses come at a cost that makes rivals uncompetitive. But Qualcomm fought a bitter five-year legal war on three continents to achieve its dominance. Ericsson lacks that time, and it lacks that money.
Ericsson insists that OpenRAN has security issues. It has already made its own equipment fully compliant with existing security and encryption standards. It has introduced an integrated packet core firewall to boost security further. This also increases its proprietary advantage.
What might settle the dispute between open source and proprietary would be for Ericsson to buy Nokia.
Rumors of such a deal were floated in February. President Donald Trump has been pushing for more control over the 5G equipment market, even suggesting Cisco Systems should buy one of the two Scandinavian companies.
All this is leading to a new technology, Cloud RAN. This idea should dominate the new market for managed services, which is growing rapidly. What is this? The idea is to run radio networks according to what are called “cloud principles.” Ericsson is already pushing its own proprietary framework for this “journey.”

Workhorse (WKHS)
Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com

	
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) became the most valuable car company in the world by proving that cars represent technology, not manufacturing.
This has spurred interest in other electric car companies like Workhorse.
Since late June, WKHS stock has skyrocketed. Why? The reason is a U.S. Postal Service contract, which Workhorse has yet to win, for 140,000 electric mail trucks. Workhorse is one of three finalists. Its C1000 design features a light body with 1,000 cubic feet of storage, and a short range that recharges overnight.
There is more than hype involved here. Workhorse’s first vans have traveled 8.5 million miles. It’s been in this niche for a decade. The trouble is its batteries are not yet competitive with gasoline engines. At the present price of $300 per kilowatt hour, a battery-powered van costs $30,000 to make.
If Workhorse wins the postal contract, and if other last-mile companies follow suit, WKHS stock will be a big winner.
But that’s a lot of ifs. This makes Workhorse less an investment than a speculation. Don’t bet any money on this stock you can’t afford to lose.
There’s reason to speculate. It’s probable that, over the next decade, electric vehicles will take over the market. It’s likely that, in last-mile delivery, with a limited number of players, this can happen quickly. Contracts offered at scale are always valuable, and often profitable.
But there is a lot of wishful thinking going on here. If the niche Workhorse is focused on proves out, why won’t Tesla just take it?

Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff criticized rival SAP SE’s business performance in stark terms, rejecting the notion that the German software giant’s challenges are an omen for his company.At “SAP, you can see they’re having very significant troubles with the CEO transition they’re going through,” Benioff said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “They, as you know, moved from one CEO to two, they fired one of those two CEOs. The CEO transition is just not going well and their customers are saying that. Now you can see that their revenues are also reflecting this trouble.”Benioff, the co-founder of San Francisco-based Salesforce, used to needle mature rivals such as Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in his company’s early days. Since Salesforce has become a market leader in cloud-based applications, he generally avoids directly criticizing his competitors. But on Monday, investor concern over SAP’s decision to cut its full-year forecast helped drag down other software makers, including Salesforce. Benioff seemed keen to set the record straight that his German foe’s troubles shouldn’t be seen as relevant for the entire software industry.“They have not executed the cloud opportunity well,” Benioff said. “SAP’s troubles, I think, are unique to them.”In August, Salesforce reported quarterly sales increased 29% and raised in its revenue forecast for the year. “Our market share continues to grow,” Benioff said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Salesforce’s Benioff Says SAP’s Troubles Are ‘Unique to Them’

2020-10-26,"Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved down to $57.65 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $60.00  * Volume: 2262  * Open Interest: 3564Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For October 14, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma, the former English teacher who co-founded Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with $60,000, is poised to become the world’s 11th richest person after Ant Group Co. priced shares for a record initial public offering.Ma’s 8.8% stake is worth $27.4 billion based on the stock pricing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That will take the 56-year-old’s fortune to $71.1 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, exceeding that of Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison, L’Oreal SA heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and individual members of the Waltons, whose family owns Walmart Inc.Ant’s mammoth listing is poised to boost the fortunes of a group of early investors and employees. The company has granted staff share-based awards since 2014 and at least 18 other people have become billionaires from the IPO. Lucy Peng, a director at the payments giant through August, is the biggest individual Ant owner after Ma, and has a $5.2 billion stake. Chairman Eric Jing’s holding is worth $3.1 billion.Ant is set to raise almost $35 billion, beating Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion sale last year. The Shanghai stock priced at 68.8 yuan ($10.27) apiece and its Hong Kong shares at HK$80 ($10.32) each. The company could raise another $5.2 billion if it exercises its green shoe options, taking its market value to about $320 billion. That would be more than JPMorgan Chase & Co. and four times bigger than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.The big winners of the listing own their stakes through two limited partnerships registered in Hangzhou that together hold about 40% of Ant. Alibaba, in turn, has a third of the fintech firm. Hong Kong’s Li Ka-shing, the family behind a French supermarket giant, the son of a Taiwanese real estate billionaire and Chinese retail tycoon Shen Guojun are among the other owners who have invested in the company over the year.Ant began when Alibaba launched the Alipay payments app in 2004 as an escrow service for buyers and sellers on Ma’s e-commerce website. In 2013, they were given the ability to save money and earn interest on the balances stored on their accounts. The firm then started offering credit to small businesses, branching out from its consumer-finance focus, and eventually expanded to services such as block chain, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.Since co-founding Alibaba with Ma, Peng served in different roles. She set up Alibaba’s human-resources department and, after helping create Ant, was its chief executive officer until Jing took over in 2016. Two years later, he succeeded her as executive chairman of the fintech company.Both Peng and Jing are members of the Alibaba Partnership, a 36-person group with the power to determine the annual cash bonuses for all members of management.(Updates Jack Ma’s wealth in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Jack Ma Becomes Richer Than Walmart Heirs With Mega Ant IPO
2020-10-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. is planning to stop taking investor orders for the Hong Kong leg of its initial public offering a day earlier than scheduled as the record stock sale has already been heavily subscribed, according to people familiar with the matter.Demand has been so great the Hangzhou-based firm is set to close the institutional investor order book on Wednesday, said the people, requesting not to be identified because the matter is private. The company was initially planning to close the Hong Kong book at 5 p.m. Thursday for each region globally, according to terms of the deal obtained by Bloomberg News. The potential move would bring the closing in line with the Shanghai leg.A representative for Ant declined to comment.Ant is seeking to raise about $34.5 billion through IPOs in Shanghai and Hong Kong, a blockbuster listing that will be the biggest IPO ever and make it one of the most valuable finance firms on the planet. The operator of the Alipay platform will have a market value of about $315 billion based on filings Monday, bigger than JPMorgan Chase & Co. and more than the gross domestic product of Finland. The sale vaults Ma’s fortune to $71.6 billion, topping the Walmart Inc. heirs.This is “a homecoming for capital markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong,” said John Ho, founder of Janchor Partners. Ho, who invested $400 million in Ant two years ago, said he’s trying to get more Hong Kong shares, adding that being able to invest in Ant “is priceless.”The IPO is attracting interest from some of the world’s biggest money managers, and sparking a frenzy among individual investors in China clamoring for a piece of the sale. In the preliminary price consultation of its Shanghai IPO, institutional investors subscribed for over 76 billion shares, more than 284 times the initial offline offering tranche, according to Ant’s Shanghai offering announcement.T. Rowe Price Group Inc., UBS Asset Management and FMR LLC, the parent of Fidelity Investments, are among the money managers angling for a piece of the deal, a person familiar with the matter has said. Hong Kong stockbrokers are so confident the IPO will go smoothly that they’re offering to let mom-and-pop investors buy the stock with as much as 20 times leverage.The strong demand puts the much-anticipated IPO on track to surpass Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion sale last year. Ant priced its Shanghai stock at 68.8 yuan ($10.27) apiece and its Hong Kong shares at HK$80 ($10.32) each. The company may raise another $5.17 billion if it exercises the option to sell additional shares to meet demand, known as the greenshoe.Ant will trade under the ticker symbol 688688 in Shanghai and 6688 in Hong Kong, in keeping with Ma’s fondness for the number eight, which is often associated with wealth in China. Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns about a third of Ant, trades under the ticker 9988 in Hong Kong.The fintech giant is charging ahead with its landmark offering just days ahead of the U.S. election. The Hong Kong trading debut will be on Nov. 5., only two days after the U.S. vote, an event that could spark market volatility if the vote is disputed or counting delayed.Ma, the former English teacher who co-founded Alibaba with $60,000, is poised to become the world’s 11th-richest person after the Ant IPO.Ma’s 8.8% stake is worth $27.4 billion based on the stock pricing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That will lift the 56-year-old’s fortune to $71.6 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, exceeding that of Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison, L’Oreal SA heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and individual members of the Waltons, whose family own Walmart.The IPO promises a lucrative pay-day for some of the world’s biggest investment banks. Ant picked China International Capital Corp. and CSC Financial Co. to lead its Shanghai leg of the IPO. CICC, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan. and Morgan Stanley are heading the Hong Kong offering.

2020-10-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Dire earnings results at SAP SE wiped out more than 35 billion euros ($41 billion) from the German software company’s market value in a matter of minutes, sending a warning to tech investors about the health of the business software industry.In a surprise release late Sunday, SAP, one of Europe’s largest tech companies, cut its revenue forecast for the full year and said it expected the fresh wave of Covid-19 lockdowns to hurt demand through the first half of 2021. The results caused shares to fall the most ever in a single day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg since 1989.SAP’s collapse caused the wider tech market to drop, with Europe’s Stoxx Technology index falling 7.6%, its biggest one-day loss since March. Shares of cloud-applications giant Salesforce.com Inc. fell 4.1% at 2:28 p.m. in New York. Oracle Corp. -- SAP’s main rival -- dropped 3.9%.“SAP is a bellwether stock for European technology and global software,” said Citigroup Global Markets analyst Amit Harchandani. “They have an insight into Fortune 500 companies and when SAP tells you they see headwinds, there will be some truth to the fact that some of the customers are challenged and don’t have the money to spend.”For some investors, SAP’s results have called into question the wider assumption that software companies will prosper during the pandemic, due to millions of employees working from home. Many of these companies, which deliver applications or services over the internet, have so far resisted the worst effects of a pandemic-fueled recession, and some have thrived while businesses operate remotely.Some major SAP clients may be reconsidering signing large contracts to update their software, as the pandemic continues to limit any global economic recovery. SAP has a wide range of products, many of which rely on winning and renewing major new deals for databases, as well as accounting, expenses or human resources software. Unsurprisingly, SAP said business travel had been particularly hard hit over the past quarter.Still, SAP has fared worse during the pandemic than many of its software peers. The company said in April that the virus had hindered new business, prompting worries that software vendors around the world might underperform. A few companies later weakened their forecasts, but most reported healthy growth. More recently, San Francisco-based Salesforce said in August that revenue climbed 29% to $5.15 billion in the previous quarter, and raised its revenue projection for the year.SAP’s poor results and weak outlook may suggest that a recovery for vendors of on-premise software -- based on a company’s own network rather than on the internet -- could take longer than anticipated, as clients continue to delay major IT upgrades, analysts at Citi wrote in a note Monday.Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, may be more affected than cloud-based providers since it offers database and financial-planning tools like SAP, and has a large base of customers who buy software for their own server farms. Last month, Oracle reported a return to sales growth in the previous quarter after years of largely stagnant revenue expansion, due to rising demand for its cloud-based products and falling interest in everything else. Oracle projected its sales would grow 1% to 3% in the current period.“The bigger surprise to us was the sharp deceleration in [SAP’s] cloud backlog numbers,” said Anurag Rana, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Given that Workday and Salesforce.com had good quarters with healthy pipelines, it seems that could be losing share to pure-play cloud vendors, which would make it hard for them to attain any meaningful recovery in the near-term.”Investors now have an anxious wait before the major U.S. cloud software providers such as Salesforce, Workday Inc. and Oracle announce earnings in December.(Corrects spelling of analyst in 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SAP Sends Warning for Software Earnings With Forecast

2020-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. pulled most of its TikTok traffic from the network of Fastly Inc., suggesting a crackdown by the Trump administration is forcing the Chinese technology giant to change its operations.Fastly runs a content delivery network that pushes data quickly around the internet so businesses can help consumers shop online or watch videos on apps and websites. ByteDance has used this service to deliver videos on its wildly popular TikTok app, making the Chinese company Fastly’s largest customer.San Francisco-based Fastly said on Wednesday that ByteDance “removed a majority of their U.S. and non-U.S. traffic from our platform” by the end of the third quarter.“Based on publicly available information, we believe this global traffic reduction was in response to the potential of a prohibition of U.S. companies being able to work with this customer,” Fastly added in a shareholder letter.TikTok has become embroiled in a political standoff between the U.S. and China and President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the app if it doesn’t work out a deal to be sold to a U.S. company. Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. have agreed to take a stake in a reorganized TikTok, but ByteDance is still working out the details.“We intend to fully support this customer unless and until we are prohibited from doing so,” Fastly Chief Executive Officer Joshua Bixby wrote in the letter to shareholders. “We are prepared to accept additional traffic from this customer if conditions enable it to return. However, if it becomes clear that we should no longer support this customer, we believe the reserved capacity for this customer can be reallocated over the medium- and long-term.”During a conference call with analysts, Bixby added that any ban of the TikTok app by the U.S. “would create uncertainty around our ability to support this customer.”Fastly reported results on Wednesday, too. The cloud-technology provider said it will lose 8 cents to 12 cents a share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $80 million to $84 million. Wall Street was looking for a loss of 2 cents a share and sales of $82.3 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The company also said it generated 42% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and experienced the second highest quarter of new customer additions in its history as a public company. “Our underlying business remains strong,” Bixby wrote.Fastly stock rose about 1% in extended trading, after closing at $71.61 in New York earlier on Wednesday.The company surprised Wall Street about two weeks ago by cutting its revenue forecast for the third quarter and noting that ByteDance was spending less on its services. Fastly shares have soared this year, but when the company cut its outlook, the stock plummeted 27%.

2020-10-30,"(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge in Pennsylvania blocked a broad set of government restrictions designed to curb the use of the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok in the U.S.U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone issued a temporary injunction on Friday blocking the TikTok ban in response to a lawsuit filed by a group of plaintiffs who use TikTok to make a living. The proposed rules, scheduled to go into effect Nov. 12, would forbid companies from providing the underlying web services that make the app accessible in the U.S.The U.S. contends that TikTok is a national security threat because its ownership by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. gives the Chinese government access to the personal data of millions of Americans. President Donald Trump has demanded that ByteDance find an American buyer for TikTok, and the company is seeking U.S. approval for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. ahead of the Nov. 12 deadline.In Friday’s ruling, Beetlestone said the TikTok prohibitions likely exceed the government’s authority under the emergency powers act it has repeatedly invoked to justify the ban. She also wrote that the ban would cause “irreparable harm” to the TikTok users who sought the injunction, shutting down their “influencing activities.”“Plaintiffs will lose the ability to engage with their millions of followers on TikTok, and the related brand sponsorships,” she wrote. The judge had previously ruled against the app users in September in an earlier phase of their case.Read More: Tencent Surges After U.S. Court Upholds Stay on WeChat Ban“We are deeply moved by the outpouring of support from our creators, who have worked to protect their rights to expression, their careers, and to helping small businesses, particularly during the pandemic,” Vanessa Pappas, interim head of TikTok, said in a statement. “We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to continuing to provide a home for them to do so.”A lawyer for the three TikTok creators who brought the Pennsylvania case hailed the ruling as a victory for free speech.“We are pleased that the judge has halted this ban, which exceeds the president’s authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,” attorney Ambika Kumar Doran said in a statement.The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.A federal judge in Washington previously blocked a separate portion of Trump’s ban that would have gone into effect in September and prevented TikTok from being downloaded from app stores. The administration has cited national security concerns in trying to ban another Chinese app, WeChat, and that move has also been blocked by a U.S. judge.In the Washington case, lawyers for TikTok are also seeking to block the broader Nov. 12 prohibitions.

2020-11-02,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok has secured the rights to recordings from thousands of artists, including Beyonce and Travis Scott, under a new deal with Sony Music Entertainment that will deepen ties between the world’s second-largest record-label group and the popular video app.The deal ensures that TikTok customers will continue to be able to use songs from Sony Music’s record labels, which include Columbia Records and RCA, the companies said. The pact also calls for the app to collaborate with Sony Music’s labels on programs to market its artists and identify emerging talent.TikTok is paying Sony Music a significant increase over the previous deal for the rights, according to a person familiar with the pact who asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t public. The two companies declined to comment on the contract in any detail.“We believe that we should share value with the music industry,” said Ole Obermann, TikTok’s head of global music. “As we grow, the value of the industry should grow.”Sony Music and TikTok have been negotiating a contract renewal for months, a period marked by President Donald Trump’s threat to ban the app in the U.S., where it has more than 100 million users. But the threat has receded in recent weeks. On Friday, a federal judge in Pennsylvania blocked a broad set of government restrictions designed to curb the use of TikTok in the U.S. TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd, also forged a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc.The deal with Sony Music is a vote of confidence from the music industry that the app is a vital part of their business going forward.TikTok has attracted about 700 million users worldwide by offering an addictive loop of videos set to music, and the app lets record companies put their songs in front of a young, influential music listener. For Sony Music, TikTok has boosted both older songs, like Matthew Wilder’s “Break My Stride,” and newer ones, like Doja Cat’s “Say So” and 24kGoldn’s “Mood.”“If you think about the number of artists who’ve blown up on TikTok over the last 12 months for Sony, it’s a really big list,” Obermann said.“Our relationship with all of the majors, Sony included, is getting better and better.”Obermann joined TikTok last December after more than a decade working at major music companies. TikTok had already proven its ability to make a song go viral with “Old Town Road,” the earworm from a neophyte rapper named Lil Nas X that spent 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts.Yet many major powerbrokers in the music industry felt TikTok wasn’t compensating them enough for their rights. As the popularity of TikTok pushed the valuation of ByteDance north of $100 billion, it was paying musicians as if it were still a scrappy startup.Record labels were reluctant to take their music off of TikTok, which has become one of the most important promotional platforms for artists all over the world. “These guys now are a partner and platform that every creative unit is thinking about,” said Dennis Kooker, the president of Sony Music’s global digital business.Since joining TikTok, Obermann has built up the group that works directly with music companies and artists, and struck accords with Merlin, a large group of independent labels. Obermann and his team have offered case studies to their labels partners showing a direct link between a song going viral in videos on TikTok and its appearance on charts across Spotify and Apple Music, the two largest music-streaming services.The music industry has embraced TikTok as it has recognized its star-making potential. Sony Music’s labels create marketing campaigns built around TikTok for new releases. TikTok now sits alongside YouTube, Facebook, Spotify, Apple and Amazon as one of the music industry’s most important promotional platforms, said Kooker, who oversees his company’s deals with all major internet companies.A song being used on TikTok doesn’t suppress listenership on paying platforms. If anything, it increases it.“Our relationship with all of the majors, Sony included, is getting better and better,” Obermann said. “There’s a lot more emphasis on marketing and promoting and discovering songs and artists together.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Scores New Deal With Sony — Home of Beyonce and Travis Scott

2020-11-02,"(Bloomberg) -- SAP SE Chief Executive Officer Christian Klein sought to put a positive spin on his company’s slowing revenue growth, saying more clients are transitioning to cloud-computing products, after the German software giant lost a third of its value on a forecast that alarmed investors.“Covid-19 is an inflection point for our customers,” Klein said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “They had a big ask: they want to accelerate the move to the cloud. This is what we are now doing. We are following the needs of our customers.”SAP, like peers Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp., has spent years attempting to move away from legacy, or on-premise, software that resides in clients’ computer servers, to cloud-based software, which is delivered over the internet. SAP, which at 48 is older than the man who has led it for the last year, has seen uneven results in this modernization effort. Klein, 40, has focused on developing and selling cloud-based products to show gains by 2025 after his predecessors bought major cloud-based subsidiaries. But twice during the coronavirus, the Walldorf, Germany-based company has warned that the pandemic would stymie client deals.Last week, SAP cut its revenue forecast for the full year and said it expects a fresh wave of lockdowns to hurt demand through the first half of 2021. The stock has lost almost a third of its value since the announcement.Klein said Monday the pandemic has “absolutely” accelerated a shift away from legacy software.“We had a guidance out there that had foreseen higher growth in” on-premise software, he said. “And now I don’t want to trade the success of our customers by forcing them to buy more on-premise software while they want to move to the cloud.”Read More: SAP’s Failure to Adapt Just Cost It $38 BillionThe problem for SAP is that more than 50% of its revenue still comes from traditional software, compared with 30% from cloud-computing tools. Legacy software deals can also be more lucrative because clients have to pay in full upfront rather than subscribing to the cloud-based product over time. In addition to reducing its forecast, SAP reported that overall revenue in the period that ended Sept. 30 declined 4% to 6.54 billion euros, missing analysts’ average estimate.Klein sought to downplay the results, saying investors have told him privately that the company is setting itself up to be successful in the mid- and long-term. He also refuted criticism that the company’s cloud results were just as disappointing as traditional software performance.“When you look at our Q3 numbers, many said, ‘Why is cloud revenue only 14%?’” Klein said. “Actually our cloud revenue was up 26% and with that, surpassed the level of our competitors if you exclude our travel and expense solution Concur. So I’m confident we’re going to accelerate our growth in the cloud in the years to come.”Marc Benioff, CEO of SAP rival Salesforce.com Inc., said on Bloomberg Television last week that SAP’s weak results were not a harbinger of bad news for the rest of the software industry, and reflected the company’s challenges related to a CEO and cloud transition. Monday, Klein declined to discuss the competitive environment, saying he had a “friendly conversation” with Benioff in Davos and wishes “Marc all the best.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SAP’s CEO Says Sales Weakness Is Evidence of Cloud Transition

2020-11-06,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. is in discussions to raise $2 billion before listing some of its businesses in Hong Kong, people familiar with the matter said, even as it seeks to avoid a ban on its TikTok service in the U.S.The Chinese company is in talks with a group of investors including Sequoia over funding that would boost its valuation to $180 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private deal. ByteDance could then start preparing some of its biggest assets including Douyin and Toutiao for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, the people said. The company was last valued at $140 billion, according to CB Insights.The terms of the funding round may still change as negotiations are ongoing, the people said. A representative for ByteDance declined to comment, while a representative for Sequoia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.ByteDance, already the world’s most valuable startup, is in the throes of fighting a Trump administration ban on TikTok in the U.S. after the video service was labeled a national security threat. It’s now seeking U.S. and Chinese government approvals for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc., though negotiations have bogged down during the elections and legal battles over the implementation of the ban.TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTakeThat deal, which included a condition that TikTok go public within 12 months on a U.S. exchange, won Donald Trump’s initial nod as a way to keep alive a social media phenom that’s become the go-to repository of music videos for 100 million-plus Americans. ByteDance was seeking a valuation of $60 billion for the app, Bloomberg News reported in September.While the clash in the U.S. has drawn global attention, ByteDance’s services in China remain its most lucrative. Douyin, the domestic version of TikTok, surpassed 600 million daily active users in August, up from 400 million at the start of the year. The company said this week it plans to hire 10,000 more in the world’s second-biggest economy by the end of this year.Its largest local rival Kuaishou Technology filed for a Hong Kong initial public offering on Thursday, underscoring both the eye-popping growth of the Chinese short video arena as well as ByteDance’s dominance of that scene. Kuaishou, or “fast hand,” reported about 39 billion yuan of revenue in 2019, while ByteDance was said to have generated more than $17 billion revenue in the same year. While the pre-listing document didn’t provide a fundraising target, people familiar with the matter said in September that the potential share sale could raise as much as $5 billion.Toutiao, a news service driven by artificial intelligence recommendations, was the company’s first breakout hit and has surged in popularity in China.ByteDance’s billionaire founder Zhang Yiming is still fighting to hold onto some control over TikTok, an app he built into a genuine challenger to Google and Facebook Inc. Under the proposed deal with the Trump administration, TikTok would be spun out of ByteDance, set up a global headquarters in the U.S. and sell a 20% stake to Oracle and Walmart.ByteDance has said it intends to retain the other 80%, although its partners have said the shares in the new TikTok Global would have to be distributed to ByteDance’s current shareholders. Those include American venture firms, including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital.At the same time, ByteDance has sued the U.S. government to prevent a ban. In October, a federal judge in Pennsylvania blocked a broad set of government restrictions designed to curb the use of TikTok in the U.S.TikTok emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the U.S. elections.

2020-11-06,"Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN), which operates a digital marketing platform for advertisers and agencies, has been in the rally mode lately. Since late September, MRIN stock has gone from $1.25 to $2.15. Yet the market capitalization is still tiny, at $15 million.

The company has been publicly traded since March 2013. But unfortunately, the performance has been far from robust. If you take a look at the chart, it is mostly downward sloping.
Then might the recent bull move in MRIN stock may be a sign of a turnaround? Maybe we could see more gains? Well, before answering this question, let’s get a backgrounder on the company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
What Is Marin Software?
Back in 2006, Chri Lien (CEO) and Wister Walcott (executive vice president of product and technology) founded the company. They were both veterans of Silicon Valley. Lien had served as the chief operating officer at Adteractive, an online performance marketing company, and the co-founder and chairman of Sugar Media, which was sold to 2Wire.


					7 Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now For The Future				

As for Walcott, he developed the original technology architecture for Marin Software. Before this, he was the vice president of marketing at Composite Software and worked at companies like Siebel Systems and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).
Regarding Marin Software, the co-founders set out to build a cloud-based system to help with the measurement, management and optimization of digital marketing campaigns, such as on Internet platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Google search engine and YouTube, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The software is available for companies of any size. The company also has customers that span industries like education, financial services, retail and travel.

Impact of Marin Software
While Marin Software has continued to add features and modernize its software, it has not had much of an impact. The fact is that the online marketing category has many of tough competitors–including biggies like Google and Facebook. As a result, it is extremely difficult for a small company like Marin Software to get much attention or traction.
For example, in late October, the company announced its preliminary results for the third quarter. Revenues are expected to come in at only $6.8 million, down from $11.7 million and the net loss to be between $4.2 million to $4.5 million. The cash and restricted cash is a mere $9 million.
The sale of Marin Software’s Perfect Audience business unit to SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) helped to boost the cash position. The purchase price was $4.6 million.  Yet Marin Software continues to lose money.
In the most recent 10-Q filing, management placed much of the blame for the poor performance on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic: “Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our product which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and some of our customers have requested extended payment terms, reduced fees or fee waivers, early contract terminations and other forms of contract relief.”
No doubt, this is a common excuse for companies.  But the reality is that there is more to the challenges for Marin Software then the Covid-19 pandemic.
Bottom Line On MRIN Stock
The 10-Q also has some ominous comments regarding the company’s liquidity. First of all, management believes that the large net losses will continue for the “next several quarters.” The company is also looking at additional sources for funding, whether from an issuance of stock or debt. According to the 10-Q: “there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.”
In other words, there could be heavy dilution if there is a financing, which will put even further pressure on MRIN. So in light of this – and with the tough market conditions and heavy competition – it’s probably best to avoid the shares for now.

2020-11-11,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese owner of TikTok, asked the federal appeals court in Washington to intervene to prevent the U.S. government from requiring it to sell the popular video-sharing app or face a ban in America.The Beijing-based company is seeking to block an order forcing it to sell by Thursday its most important international business, a viral video service with upwards of 100 million users in the U.S. The Trump administration issued an executive order banning TikTok in the U.S. on national security grounds, and demanded the Chinese company cede control of TikTok to American investors.A deal was eventually struck to sell about 20% of a new TikTok entity to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc., but that agreement is now in limbo after Joe Biden won the U.S. presidential election and a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s ban. A U.S. security panel had previously set a Nov. 12 deadline for TikTok to finalize an accord, and TikTok has requested a 30-day extension to keep working toward a solution that would avert a full sale of TikTok as required in the order.That request went unanswered, though TikTok is hoping that regardless of the outcome of Tuesday’s petition, an extension could still be granted, a person familiar with the process said.Facing the Thursday deadline set by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., TikTok said, it had no choice but to turn to the appeals court “to defend our rights and those of our more than 1,500 employees in the U.S.” ByteDance said the divestment order violated its due process rights as well as rules of administrative procedure that require the government to explain its reasoning for regulatory decisions.“For a year, TikTok has actively engaged with Cfius in good faith to address its national security concerns, even as we disagree with its assessment,” TikTok said in a statement. “In the nearly two months since the president gave his preliminary approval to our proposal to satisfy those concerns, we have offered detailed solutions to finalize that agreement -- but have received no substantive feedback on our extensive data privacy and security framework.”The U.S. contends that TikTok is a national security threat, saying it could give China’s government access to the personal data of millions of Americans because it’s owned by a Chinese company. Tuesday’s court filing includes a letter written by Cfius explaining the government’s national security concerns with ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok, the first time those concerns have been made public in such detail.The July 30 letter from the Treasury Department is based on unclassified information, though Cfius said its determination was also based on classified information.Among its concerns, the Treasury Department cited the move by a ByteDance Chinese affiliate in 2017 to establish a Communist Party Committee in its governance structure led by the company vice president. The government said ByteDance also collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has detained Uighur minorities.Cfius also said ByteDance stores user data on servers hosted by China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and cited press reports that Alibaba actively supports the Chinese government’s intelligence and surveillance efforts.As it faced criticism earlier this year from U.S. President Donald Trump and the order to find a buyer for its American operations, TikTok had been in talks with a number of potential suitors, including Microsoft Corp., though eventually ByteDance selected the dual proposal from software maker Oracle and retail giant Walmart.In its petition Tuesday, ByteDance said that it submitted a new proposal on Nov. 6 that called for a restructuring of TikTok in the U.S. and the creation of a new entity that would be wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors. Trump has voiced support for such an arrangement. The new company would be responsible for handling data and content moderation for U.S. users, ByteDance said.ByteDance has already won court orders blocking a set of prohibitions on TikTok that Trump unveiled in August. The prohibitions that TikTok has successfully halted in court would have also gone into effect immediately on Nov. 12, preventing new users from downloading the app and forbidding companies from providing the underlying web services that make it accessible.But its petition on Tuesday targeted a separate process: an order by Cfius requiring it to divest TikTok by Nov. 12. The implications of the divestment order are less clear. The language of the order gives the attorney general authority to “take any steps necessary” to enforce the order. The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.(Updates with more details and context about TikTok’s potential deal.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Asks U.S. Court to Intervene in Forced TikTok Sale

2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. is butting up against a long-awaited deadline that would subject the Chinese internet giant to possible Trump administration penalties if it can’t clinch a deal for the U.S. operations of its widely used video-sharing app, TikTok.The Beijing-based company has asked the U.S. government to extend a Thursday deadline for ByteDance to divest its TikTok business in the U.S. President Donald Trump in August demanded the app be spun off, citing concerns about the security of American users’ personal information, and gave the company a 90-day timeline to complete a transaction.That window is now closing, and while TikTok has struck an agreement to sell part of its business to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc., the deal hasn’t been finalized. ByteDance filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday night, requesting the court step in to prevent the Treasury Department’s forced sale.What TikTok is really asking for is more time.“We remain committed to working with the administration -- as we have all along -- to resolve the issues it has raised, but our legal challenge today is a protection to ensure these discussions can take place,” a TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday. The petition also states that TikTok is committed to completing a deal, and confirmed that it most recently submitted a proposal for review on Nov. 6.Thursday’s deadline is the latest checkpoint in what has been a long, complicated sale process, which may get more confusing as President-elect Joe Biden comes into power.Trump has made the fight over TikTok a central front in a broader trade war with China, in particular an effort to crack down on the growing influence of China’s technology industry in the U.S. Trump first ordered a TikTok sale in August, and has threatened to ban the app if ByteDance couldn’t reach an agreement. That proposed ban has since been delayed twice -- most recently on Oct. 30, when a Pennsylvania judge issued a temporary injunction in response to a lawsuit filed by a group of TikTok users who make their living via the app.Read more: Why Trump Is Threatening Your Teen’s Favorite App: QuickTakeBut the Nov. 12 deadline to finalize a sale is still intact, and poses a significant threat to ByteDance, one of the world’s most valuable private companies. TikTok is one of the most popular apps in the world -- with more than 100 million U.S. users -- and is also ByteDance’s most important service outside of China. The company and its investors are desperate to finish a deal to avoid a ban in what has been a very valuable market for other social media apps, like Facebook Inc.’s Instagram and Snap Inc.’s Snapchat.Trump gave his blessing in mid-September to a preliminary plan in which ByteDance would sell part of TikTok to Oracle and Walmart, creating a new independent company called TikTok Global. But that deal has been stuck in limbo for weeks, and was quickly overshadowed by the U.S. election. ByteDance reiterated that its most recent proposal would put American investors in charge of data and content moderation for U.S. users, according to Tuesday’s petition.The way the original order was worded appears to require a divestment from ByteDance to be in place by the deadline -- not just an agreement. If the government does reach an accord with the company, it could exercise discretion around enforcement timing, said Aimen Mir, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and a former deputy assistant secretary for investment security at Treasury, where he ran reviews for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.“Usually when there is extended silence from Cfius, it suggests there’s no clear consensus within government on what the next step would be, but this has been an atypical case for awhile,” Mir said.It’s unclear what would happen if a deal isn’t finalized by Thursday. If the deadline comes and goes without an extension, court relief or an agreement between the company and the government, Mir said the Justice Department would have to go to court and seek enforcement of the divestiture order.Trump’s executive order from August doesn’t stipulate a clear punishment for failure to divest, but says that “the Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order.”“There could be fines, or it could be as draconian as a ban if the administration wanted to go that far,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “But the government still has until midnight on Nov. 12 to issue an extension, which is a plausible scenario.”This sale process was originally brought about because of national security concerns. The U.S. government is worried about ByteDance’s access to the personal data of U.S. citizens. Tuesday’s court filing included a detailed and previously undisclosed letter from U.S. officials that outlined those concerns.Cfius, which is led by the Treasury Department and reviews foreign acquisition of American businesses, said in a July 30 letter that its security concerns were based on both classified and unclassified information. The letter cited the move by a ByteDance Chinese affiliate in 2017 to establish a Communist Party Committee in its governance structure, and pointed out that ByteDance also collaborates with public security bureaus across China. Cfius generally doesn’t confirm, deny or comment on its reviews.“The Treasury Department remains focused on reaching a resolution of the national security risks arising from ByteDance’s acquisition of Musical.ly,” a Treasury spokeswoman said in a statement, referring to the 2017 purchase of an app that ByteDance merged with TikTok. “We have been clear with ByteDance regarding the steps necessary to achieve that resolution.” The Justice Department declined to comment.Trump’s order requiring the sale of TikTok underscored the aggressive stance his administration has taken toward Chinese investment in the U.S. Only seven foreign acquisitions of American companies have been blocked or unwound by U.S. presidents since 1990, and Trump is responsible for four of them.Now, the TikTok deal, once a priority for the administration, has in recent weeks taken on less urgency as Trump turned his focus to his bid for re-election and, since last week, challenging the outcome of the Nov. 3 vote.(Adds that DOJ declined to comment in 17th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Sale Deadline Hits With ByteDance Desperate for Time

2020-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration has given the owner of TikTok another 15 days to resolve national security concerns before it’s required to sell the viral video-sharing app.The app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., said in a court filing Friday that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. had granted it until Nov. 27 to reach an agreement, extending a deadline that was set to expire on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment on the filing.ByteDance challenged the Thursday deadline in court in Washington on Tuesday, saying the government hadn’t responded to its latest efforts to strike a compromise and prevent an enforced sale.The sale deadline was one element of an array of threats aimed at TikTok by the Trump administration. For months, the app faced the prospect of a U.S. ban that was also set to go into effect on Nov. 12. But federal judges in Washington and Pennsylvania have blocked those prohibitions. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that it would comply with those orders, even as the government appeals the decisions.‘Any Steps Necessary’The sale order was part of a separate process overseen by the Treasury Department.

2020-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration pulled back from its threat to ban the viral video-sharing app TikTok in the U.S., as the dispute winds its way through the court system and a proposed sale hangs in limbo.For months, the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., has faced the prospect of a U.S. ban starting Thursday. But judges have blocked those prohibitions from going into effect. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that it would comply with those court rulings for the time being, even as the government appeals.The TikTok prohibition “HAS BEEN ENJOINED, and WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT, pending further legal developments,” the Commerce Department said in a document published in the federal register.Separately, ByteDance has challenged an order from the Treasury Department to sell TikTok or face unspecified penalties. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Thursday gave ByteDance and the Trump administration Dec. 14 and Dec. 28 deadlines to file documents in the case.When it filed the petition Tuesday, TikTok said the government had not responded to its latest efforts to strike a compromise and prevent an enforced sale. It’s not clear if anything has developed since to extend the deadline, but the court order didn’t allude to any new arrangement.ByteDance had sought U.S. approval for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. before the Nov. 12 deadline. But the agreement appears to be in limbo. Before filing its petition in Washington this week, ByteDance requested a 30-day extension from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, that is overseen by the Treasury Department, to keep working toward a solution. That request went unanswered, according to court papers.As of midnight Thursday, the administration hadn’t issued a statement about whether it was granting the extension.Lawyers for TikTok and officials at the Treasury Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.President Donald Trump has made the battle over TikTok a central front in his broader efforts to crack down on the influence of China’s technology industry in the U.S. Trump first ordered a TikTok sale in August, and threatened to ban the app if ByteDance couldn’t reach an agreement with an American company.He hasn’t said anything about TikTok since last week’s presidential election, having focused on trying to discredit the results that show he lost. But on Thursday he issued an executive order prohibiting U.S. investments in Chinese firms determined to be owned or controlled by the country’s military.In September, a judge in Washington blocked a portion of the ban that would have prevented new downloads of the app. And on Oct. 30, a Pennsylvania judge issued a temporary injunction on rules that would have prevented third-party companies from providing online infrastructure that allows TikTok to function smoothly. The U.S. appealed the Washington ruling in October, and said on Thursday it would appeal the Pennsylvania ruling.In a filing late Thursday, the Justice Department urged the appeals court in Washington to throw out the injunction blocking the ban on new downloads, saying, at minimum, it’s overly broad.“The district court failed to defer to the national security determinations of the Executive Branch, and failed to consider the harms that the court’s injunction inflicts on the public,” the government said in the filing.Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Dec. 14.Read more: Why Trump Is Threatening Your Teen’s Favorite App: QuickTakeThe status of the Cfius process for a sale is less clear. If the government reaches an accord with the company, it could exercise discretion around enforcement timing, said Aimen Mir, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and a former deputy assistant secretary for investment security at the Treasury, where he ran reviews for Cfius.“Usually when there is extended silence from Cfius, it suggests there’s no clear consensus within government on what the next step would be, but this has been an atypical case for awhile,” Mir said.If an extension hasn’t already been granted, Mir said the Justice Department would have to go to court and seek enforcement of the divestiture order. Trump’s executive order from August doesn’t stipulate a clear punishment for failure to divest, but says that “the Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order.” The Justice Department declined to comment.TikTok is one of the most popular apps in the world -- with more than 100 million U.S. users -- and ByteDance’s most important service outside of China. The company and its investors are desperate to finish a deal to avoid a ban in what has been a valuable market for other social media apps, like Facebook Inc.’s Instagram and Snap Inc.’s Snapchat.Trump threatened to ban TikTok and order its sale to a U.S. company as a result of national security concerns. The U.S. is worried that the Chinese government could use the app to gain access to the personal data of American citizens.Cfius, the Treasury Department panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of American businesses, said in a July 30 letter included in ByteDance’s court filing in Washington this week that its security concerns were based on both classified and unclassified information. The letter cited the move by a Chinese affiliate of ByteDance in 2017 to establish a Communist Party Committee in its governance structure, and pointed out that ByteDance also collaborates with public security bureaus across China.(Updates with no statement from administration, in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Gets Reprieve on Trump’s Demand for a Ban on the App

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett is a living, breathing billionaire, but he’s also a leading economic indicator. So after his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. dumped almost $13 billion of stocks in the throes of the Covid-19 crisis, investors were beside themselves. They’ll now be quite relieved to see that his company is back in buying mode, making the biggest outlay for equity purchases in a year.And he’s not just making oddball bets, like Japanese trading houses and, yikes, gold. A filing late Monday showed that in the latest period Berkshire Hathaway bought a handful of U.S. pharmaceutical giants: AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. It also purchased a new stake in T-Mobile US Inc., the wireless carrier with the most enviable spectrum position heading into 5G, and Snowflake Inc., one of the hottest tech IPOs of the year. They’re part of the net $4.8 billion Berkshire spent buying equities during the period; it spent an additional $9 billion buying up its own shares.  The disclosure of Berkshire’s Pfizer holding — valued at $138 million as of Monday’s close — comes a week after the drugmaker announced that its Covid-19 vaccine has been more than 90% effective in preventing cases of the virus. Following up on the good news, Moderna Inc., another company in the Covid-19 vaccine race, said Monday that its formulation was 94.5% effective. Even so, my colleague Max Nisen tells me that Buffett’s pharma bets likely aren’t entirely vaccine-related, as that logic only really works for Pfizer. Instead, Buffett — or one of his investing deputies — probably sees broader value in the pharma space, which had been somewhat beaten down heading into the U.S. election on fears of a “blue wave” that would produce profit-crimping policies. Those fears aren’t quite so intense without Democrats taking control of the Senate, or at least not yet.Berkshire continued its banking purge — further reducing its stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. It also exited a $1.3 billion position in Costco Wholesale Corp., which I guess means Buffett didn’t take my suggestion to outright acquire the retailer for his next “elephant-sized” deal. But shares of Costco have risen 7% to an all-time high since the third quarter ended, and it just declared a whopping $10-a-share special dividend. Buffett is going to be hitting the See’s candies hard tonight!Read more: Buffett's Next Bulk Purchase Should Be Costco: Tara LachapelleBut it sure is good to see the investor, well, investing again. Right before the pandemic hit, Buffett said in a TV interview that he’s been a net buyer of stocks every year since he was 11 years old; he’s 90 now. It's incredible how a virus — and the mishandling thereof — rattled his optimism in a way that wars, terrorist attacks and other recessions didn’t. The U.S. isn’t out of the woods yet, but there are reasons to be hopeful, and that seems to be what Buffett’s latest moves are suggesting. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is planning new large-scale expenditures on cloud computing with Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services unit. The deal, slated for early 2021, could could reignite tensions within the companies, where groups of employees have objected to working with agencies that have presided over family separations and raids targeting undocumented immigrants. ICE officials are in the market for “cloud infrastructure hosting in AWS and Microsoft Azure environments,” according to a Homeland Security Department website listing upcoming contracting opportunities. The agency is looking for a third-party contractor to manage its existing systems stored in AWS and Microsoft cloud computing infrastructure, as well as to expand its access to new cloud services offered by both companies.The estimated price tag of the project is at least $100 million over five years. While Microsoft or Amazon wouldn’t pursue the contract on their own, each could see tens of millions of dollars in new revenue through the deal. Microsoft representatives declined to comment on the matter; representatives for Amazon and ICE didn’t respond to requests for comment. Immigrant rights groups have criticized Silicon Valley for working with the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. A 2018 report commissioned by three such group— the National Immigration Project, the Immigrant Defense Project, and Mijente—accused Microsoft and Amazon of supporting ICE operations by storing databases used to profile suspected undocumented immigrants. The groups also criticized Amazon for offering third-party cloud services to companies like Palantir Technologies Inc., which holds data-mining contracts with ICE.In July 2018 more than 100 Microsoft employees penned an open letter to chief executive officer Satya Nadella demanding that the company “cancel its contracts with ICE, and with other clients who directly enable ICE.” Last October, its employees circulated a letter calling on the company to withdraw from a contract between ICE and Microsoft subsidiary, GitHub.Some Amazon employees have also objected to their company’s relationship with ICE, which comes by way of its partnership with Palantir. In both 2018 and 2019 employees wrote open letters to executives demanding that the company sever ties with Palantir and other companies that enable ICE. Alphabet Inc.’s Google, another major cloud provider, has faced similar backlash, with employees organizing in opposition to contracts with President Trump’s Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. military.Google decided against renewing one contract with the Pentagon; other than that the companies haven’t given in to pressure. In October, Google Cloud head Thomas Kurian defended the company’s work with CBP after documents detailing a $200,000 contract became public, and all three companies have made it clear at various times that they will continue to work with U.S. government agencies. The internal dissent mostly emerged in response to Trump-era policies, and it’s unclear how they’ll fare once he leaves office. But the tension could well persist. Much of the federal government’s immigration enforcement and detention infrastructure pre-dated the Trump Administration, and Democrats have also shown enthusiasm for technological solutions to immigration enforcement, like digital surveillance in lieu of a physical border wall. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how much agencies like ICE spend on cloud services with Microsoft and Amazon. Although federal agencies are required to publicly report spending on many government contracts, Microsoft and Amazon receive most of their government revenue as subcontractors, where reporting tends to be inconsistent.ICE spent more than $20 million on Microsoft products and services during the federal government’s 2020 fiscal year alone, according to data from Bloomberg Government. About half of that spending, $9.9 million, represented transactions for Azure cloud services. AWS and its partner companies received more than $21 million from CBP in fiscal 2020 and about $850,000 from ICE since March 2018. Palantir earned more than $24 million in contracts with ICE during the 2020 government fiscal year. In late April 2020, CBP signaled its interest in its own multimillion-dollar cloud deal that would provide access to services from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as competitors International Business Machines Corp., Oracle Corp., Google and Salesforce.com Inc.ICE officials plan to release a pre-solicitation for the contract in mid-January and award the contract in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, according to the notice.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","ICE Seeks Large New Cloud Contract Involving Microsoft, Amazon"

2020-11-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Workday Inc. executives said the pandemic-fueled recession will likely crimp software demand next year, putting a damper on a positive earnings report and turning shares down in extended trading.The company said some customers of its human resources and accounting tools are struggling and new business is harder to find as the coronavirus continues to spread. Executives, speaking on a conference call, expressed optimism about their business, but said Covid-19 has created so much uncertainty that they couldn’t give a forecast for fiscal 2022, which begins in February. Shares, which had jumped as much as 6.3% in extended trading, lost all those gains during the call, declining about 3%.“While we have seen some recent stability in the underlying environment, headwinds due to Covid remain, particularly to net new bookings,” Chief Financial Officer Robynne Sisco said during the call. “Given our subscription model, these headwinds that have impacted us full-year will be more fully evident in next-year subscription revenue, weighing on our growth in the near term.”In its quarterly financial results released earlier Thursday, Workday raised its current fiscal-year forecast for software sold by subscription, suggesting that more businesses were buying the company’s accounting, financial-planning and human resources products despite the economic conditions.Subscription sales in the fiscal year ending in January will be about $3.77 billion, the Pleasanton, California-based company said in a statement. The company had previously projected as much as $3.74 billion, which is also the average estimate of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Co-Chief Executive Officers Aneel Bhusri and Luciano Fernandez are attempting to reverse Workday’s sales slowdown during the pandemic, which has caused corporate customers to rethink some major technology upgrades. While businesses have rushed to adopt videoconferencing and productivity tools to connect and help employees working from home, there hasn’t been as much demand for Workday’s lineup. Oracle Corp.’s Fusion applications also remain a competitive threat.Workday has signed partnerships with Salesforce.com Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. during the past few months to help customers return to the office and conduct Covid-19 tracing.“The best way to look at it is, the world is trying to get back to normal, but there are a couple of sectors that are having a hard time getting back to normal,” Bhusri said.Workday’s clients subscribe to use the company’s cloud applications rather than paying for them upfront. Subscription revenue indicates the strength of Workday’s recurring revenue stream.The company’s shares have gained 40% this year, closing at $230.80 in New York.Workday reported adjusted profit of 86 cents a share on sales of $1.11 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 31. Analysts projected profit of 67 cents a share and $1.09 billion in revenue.“We see significant longer-term opportunity ahead to support our growth aspirations,” Sisco said. The company will pick up the pace of hiring in the new fiscal year, including for sales, marketing and other roles that can boost Workday’s growth rate, she added.(Updates with comments from executives starting in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Workday Says Software Demand Likely Hurt by Pandemic in 2021
2020-11-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and other technology companies said confidential material they provided for the U.S. government’s antitrust probe of Alphabet Inc.’s Google should not be shared with the search giant’s in-house lawyers because the information is too sensitive.In a filing Friday in federal court in Washington, Apple said it gave the U.S. Justice Department “competitively sensitive” documents and that allowing lawyers inside Google to see the information would result in “material harm” to Apple. A similar joint filing was made by Amazon.com Inc., AT&T Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Comcast Corp., Sonos Inc., Duck Duck Go Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.Concerns about such disclosures have emerged since the government sued Google for allegedly abusing its power to thwart competition. The Justice Department and Google have clashed over the extent of access to information collected by the government before it sued. The judge overseeing the case, Amit Mehta, has yet to rule on the issue.The Justice Department has proposed allowing companies that provided information to designate their most sensitive documents as “highly confidential,” which would prevent access to Google’s in-house lawyers, according to court papers. The U.S. argues that allowing the search giant to see the proprietary information would give Google even more power in the market than it already has.Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year to make its search engine the default browser option on iPhones and other products, according to analyst estimates. In its court filing, the iPhone maker said the documents at issue relate to its negotiations with Google and other search engines and Apple’s internal deliberations about those discussions.“Disclosure of this information to Google would directly implicate future business dealings between Apple and Google, provide Google with a substantial advantage over Apple in negotiations, and potentially disadvantage competitor search engines that negotiate with Apple and other software providers,” it said.(Updates with filing by Amazon and other companies.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple to AT&T Wary of Full Disclosure in Google Antitrust Case

2020-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration has given TikTok’s Chinese owner another week to complete a sale of its popular video-sharing app in order to resolve U.S. national security concerns.The new deadline, which had already been extended by 15 days, is Dec. 4, TikTok’s parent ByteDance Ltd. said in a court filing Wednesday.The fate of TikTok, an app that’s been downloaded more than 100 million times in the U.S., has been caught up for months in U.S. President Donald Trump’s crackdown on Chinese technology companies. The administration has argued that American’s private data gathered through the app could be siphoned off to the authoritarian regime in China, something TikTok has said it would never do. Trump had ordered in August that the app be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the U.S.To assuage Trump’s concerns, ByteDance forged a deal in September to sell a stake of a spun out TikTok business to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. The deal was never finalized though, because the companies didn’t receive a sign-off from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as Cfius, a panel led by the Treasury Department.A Treasury spokesperson said it granted ByteDance a one-week extension to allow time to review a revised submission that Cfius recently received.TikTok has filed multiple challenges against the ban, which are winding their way through the court system, with deadlines in certain proceedings extending past January. Several judges have already blocked the ban from going into effect and the Commerce Department said it would comply with those court rulings as the government appeals.Those cases could lapse when President-Elect Joe Biden takes office in January, unless he decides to enforce the Trump ban and defend the previous administration’s orders in court.The penalties that ByteDance would face if it failed to sell TikTok to a U.S. company by the deadline were never clearly spelled out, though the order said the Justice Department could take “any steps necessary” to enforce the sale.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Granted One-Week Extension of Forced-Sale Deadline

What do these four companies have in common … besides absolutely massive gains?
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE)
They’re all well-known tech giants worth a ton of money, from Oracle’s $173 billion valuation to Microsoft’s $1.6 trillion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
But there’s another more important answer that’s key to understanding a new opportunity that could match or even exceed those gains …
The most important thing those four companies have in common is that they are software companies.
If you know anything about software, you know it’s one of the greatest wealth generators of the past 50 years.
Investing with Bill Gates’ Microsoft in 1986 — just before the world went wild for its productivity enhancing software — led to shares skyrocketing 210,900%.

That’s enough to turn every $10,000 invested into more than $21 million.
An early stake in software innovator Larry Ellison’s Oracle in 1990 — just before the business’ software was adopted by thousands of companies — led to shares skyrocketing 93,533%.
Salesforce has become one of the world’s leading business software companies, and its shares have returned more than 6,000% since its IPO in 2004.
And Adobe Systems, the hugely popular software company, has returned more than 270,000%+ since 1986. Extraordinary.
This software connection is critical because  investing right now in select “altcoins” — cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin — is like investing early in these software companies.
The single most expensive belief out there might be that altcoins are “fantasy internet money.”
They are not.
Altcoins are investments in blockchain projects that make our lives easier, more productive, and more efficient.
These companies are laying the groundwork for an entirely new world. Buying an altcoin is like buying an early stake in the software programs that made the internet so revolutionary!
In fact, John Bates, director of product management for Adobe, says blockchain is “on par with technology like personal computers and the internet.”
Thinking of cryptocurrencies as traditional currencies could be the costliest mistake investors make. So please, ignore much of what you hear about cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology they are built on.
Instead, focus on these two facts that matter most:
Fact #1: The blockchain is the next transformational technology platform.
Everything will soon use blockchain technology as it becomes the new internet. It will completely rewrite how business is done and personal fortunes are built in the modern age.
Fact #2: The only way you can have direct ownership in this groundbreaking technology is through altcoins.
Blockchain technology is going to destroy the middleman and revolutionize the way you bank, shop, travel, heat your home, and so much more.
Think of altcoins as revolutionary new software programs that will unleash tsunamis of productivity … and profits.
There are all kinds of amazing altcoins already making the world a better place. The best opportunities are in those harnessing blockchain technology to improve a massive issue.
Like MediBloc, a blockchain company that is shaking up the nearly $12 trillion global healthcare industry. It’s rewriting the way our personal information is stored and shared across numerous healthcare and insurance companies.
This will save you a lot of time and money. No more writing down your medical information every time you go to the hospital or a new doctor.
But it’s about so much more than convenience. It’s also about security. MediBloc allows you to completely control your own information. You choose who can see it and who can’t. That’s hugely important because it’s estimated that by 2024, everyone in the U.S. will have had their healthcare data compromised. Everyone!
Whether you realize it yet or not, MediBloc is on the frontlines fighting on behalf of you and your loved ones to keep your most sensitive data safe and secure.
Because of the incredible work it’s doing, the altcoin was up an amazing 754% at one point.

Blockchain technology will have a greater influence on our daily lives in ways you never would’ve guessed.
This technology will disrupt every single industry.
All this disruption and change is creating a once-in-a-lifetime financial opportunity for those who get in early.
The only way to join the blockchain revolution is to own altcoins.
When people wake up to the fact that altcoins aren’t fantasy internet money — or a wannabe version of bitcoin — there will be an enormous rush into this asset class.
Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem and I call this “The Awakening,” and it will lead to mainstream acceptance of altcoins as a serious investment vehicle.
This awakening is lighting a fuse under the altcoin market, one that I expect will set off a huge explosion of wealth.
We may be seeing the beginnings of that right now. Just this past week, altcoins perked up as investors started pouring money into these smaller cryptocurrencies.
To claim some of that wealth for yourself, you must first understand what altcoins really are — not what most people think they are. They are revolutionary software programs built on a transformational technology platform that will change our world.
And they can change your financial situation, too.

2020-12-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. gave a revenue forecast for the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates but suggested a slight decline in its explosive growth, touching off concerns among investors that the software maker’s pandemic boom may be coming to an end. Shares declined about 5% in extended trading.Revenue will be as much as $811 million in the period that ends in January, the San Jose, California-based company said Monday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $719 million. The company’s sales guidance, at the high end, estimates a 330% increase from a year earlier -- a slight decline in the year-over-year growth from the previous two quarters.Zoom’s projected slowing revenue expansion in the current period highlights investors’ concerns that 2021 won’t be as favorable for the software maker as this year, when the company gained customers forced to work and go to school remotely. Zoom’s stock has jumped sevenfold thus far in 2020, heightening questions about whether the company is overvalued. Wall Street has fawned over the company for its accelerating sales growth, but analysts have raised questions about how long it might last.Investors also may be disappointed by cost issues. The company reported adjusted gross margin of 68.2% in the fiscal third quarter, compared with 82.9% in the same period a year earlier and 72.3% in previous period. Analysts had expected 71.8%. Zoom said the margin decline was due to expenses associated with public cloud services and supporting non-paying users. Executives said investors should expect similar numbers into the next fiscal year before the gross margin starts to improve.Zoom said sales increased 367% to $777.2 million in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31. Profit, excluding some items, was 99 cents a share. Analysts projected revenue of $693.4 million and adjusted profit of 75 cents.Zoom’s stock has become a barometer of the pandemic economy, rising when Covid-19 lockdowns emerge and falling on good news about vaccines. Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan has tried to diversify Zoom’s capabilities for large enterprises, small- and mid-sized businesses and individuals so the company can grow after the coronavirus is controlled and greater numbers of workers return to their offices. The software maker in October announced OnZoom, a platform for hosting paid classes, lessons and charity events. It also debuted Zoom Apps, a way to more tightly integrate Zoom with other applications used during video conferences.Zoom named Amazon Web Services its preferred cloud provider, the Amazon.com Inc. unit said in a statement after Zoom’s results. The companies have been partners since 2011, but Zoom has recently begun using Oracle Corp.’s cloud as well. Separately, Zoom said that it would spend more on capital expenditures in the current period to boost its own data center capacity. Such a move could pare back the company’s reliance on cloud services.Zoom said it had 433,700 customers with more than 10 employees at the end of the quarter and 1,289 contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue. Both figures topped analysts’ average estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We remain focused on the communication needs of our customers and communities as they navigate the current environment and adapt to a new world of work from anywhere using Zoom,” Yuan said in the statement.(Updates with gross margin in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Zoom’s Revenue Forecast Tops Estimates Amid 2021 Concerns
2020-12-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc., a software maker that debuted with the year’s biggest U.S. initial public offering, gave a lackluster product sales forecast for the current quarter, signaling fierce competition in cloud computing. Shares declined about 5% in extended trading.Product revenue, which makes up more than 90% of sales, will be $162 million to $167 million in the period ending in January, the San Mateo, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $166 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Snowflake’s data-warehouse software is like a vacuum sucking up information strewn across different systems, so that businesses can analyze it all together. The company competes against the cloud-computing divisions of Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., as well as open-source vendor Cloudera Inc. and database stalwart Oracle Corp. Snowflake has chased major deals with banks, including an agreement with Capital One Financial Corp. valued around $100 million and a major deal with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bloomberg has reported.Snowflake listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September in a $3.36 billion IPO, the largest ever for a software maker. The stock has more than doubled since then on optimism it would produce extraordinary growth, closing at $292.69 Wednesday in New York, and pushing the company’s market value to more than $82 billion.In the fiscal third quarter, total revenue more than doubled to $159.6 million. Analysts projected $147.1 million. The company reported its net loss widened to $168.9 million, or $1.01 a share, from $88.1 million, or $1.92 a share, in the period a year earlier.“We are pleased with our performance this first quarter as a public company,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman said in the statement. “Our vision of the Snowflake Data Cloud mobilizing the world’s data is clearly resonating across our customer base.”The software maker projected product revenue of as much as $543 million this fiscal year, beating analysts’ estimates of $530 million.The eight-year-old business has substantial supporters. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Salesforce Ventures, an arm of Salesforce.com Inc., each committed to buy $250 million of the company’s Class A common stock in a private placement. Berkshire reported in a filing last month that it had purchased 6.13 million shares of Snowflake valued at $1.54 billion, representing 15% of shares outstanding.(Updates with comments from CEO in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Snowflake Drops on Disappointing Product Sales Forecast

2020-12-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. released one product and unveiled another designed to warehouse, analyze and keep track of data, taking on Amazon.com Inc. and Snowflake Inc. in a growing market for cloud-based tools that help companies do more with reams of information. Microsoft widely released its Azure Synapse Analytics tool and announced a preview of a new product called Purview, which is meant to help companies keep up with data security and compliance needs. ABN Amro Bank NV is using Synapse to figure out what financial services products are best targeted at which customers, and Wolters Kluwer NV, which helps develop medical software, built an artificial intelligence system that better predicts which patients will get a rapidly spread hospital-borne infection. Companies like FedEx Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are also using the new software, Jason Zander, Azure executive vice president, said in an interview. Too many customers aren’t able to effectively use the data generated from a variety of different programs and devices, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella will tell customers Thursday at a virtual event. “Today, we are generating data faster than we are able to understand it,” Nadella will say, according to prepared remarks provided by Microsoft. “It’s relegated to internal and external silos or simply ignored.” Half of Fortune 1,000 executives say they don’t treat their data as a “business asset. It’s not because they don’t think it matters. They just don’t have the process or capability to get there.”Azure Purview adds data governance, security and compliance features. The service lets users find confidential data and allows executives responsible for securing it to get a high level view of all the information in various programs, including those from rivals like Amazon and SAP SE, Zander said. Microsoft’s new products come as the market for such tools is heating up, part of why Snowflake’s September initial public offering hit a record for a software company and was the biggest in the U.S. this year. Amazon’s AWS cloud unit has been improving its Redshift data warehouse. The market for cloud data management services will be worth $13 billion next year, according to estimates from Forrester, as customers try to make sense of information that’s stored in the cloud, corporate data centers and devices disbursed around offices, factories and other sites. “There's been this no-man’s land between where the data sits and how you are using the data,” said Michele Goetz, an analyst at Forrester. “There’s a lot that needs to be done to transform the data into something that’s usable and contextual.”Microsoft’s own finance department saw the need for these tools. When staffers had to locate some sort of information or insight, 70% of time they had to manually collect data— before the company introduced its new tools.“It was pretty demoralizing,” said Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood in a video that will be shown at the event. “You have great talent and you want to make a difference and instead they’re spending time explaining to me how much time they spent in cut, copy and paste.”Now the finance team has combined 120 different data sources in Azure, which also cut costs. The ability to better see all the information let Hood’s team improve financial forecasting. “We were OK at it — we weren’t great at it,” she said about their work before using the new products. After, her team cut the variance of forecasts in half. “People may say, gosh is that lot? Well going from 3% to 1.5% is the difference frankly between being right and being wrong and saving hundreds of millions of dollars,” she said.Some of the technology also came from the work Microsoft did to comply with European data privacy regulations, Zander said.“We built out all of these custom tools and work in order to handle exabytes of data,” Zander said. “We're taking all that technology that we use ourselves and making it available to our customers.”The new products and the focus on data management will also intensify competition with companies like SAP, Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp., Goetz said. It remains to be seen how Microsoft navigates the partnerships and rivalries it has with those companies, including, for example, using SAP’s software for Hood’s finance department. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Takes on Amazon, Snowflake in Cloud Data Services"

2020-12-05,"(Bloomberg) -- A deadline set by the Trump administration for the forced sale of TikTok’s U.S. assets will come and go Friday without a final deal, according to people familiar with the discussions.While the deadline has been extended multiple times, TikTok isn’t expected to receive a new one, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision isn’t yet public. TikTok is still in talks with the U.S. government about a sale that satisfies the administration’s national security concerns, but Friday’s deadline will be allowed to lapse while the discussions continue.The U.S. Treasury Department told TikTok and Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. that they won’t face a fine or other punishment for missing the deadline because the sides are still negotiating. The deal, which has been in the works for months, is close to being finished, and the administration is eager to complete it before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20, according to one of the people.The fate of TikTok, which has been downloaded more than 100 million times in the U.S., has been caught up for months in President Donald Trump’s crackdown on Chinese technology companies and their influence in the U.S. The administration has argued that Americans’ private data gathered through the app could be handed over to the authoritarian regime in China, something TikTok has said it would never do.Trump had ordered in August that the app be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the U.S. But as the presidential election loomed in November and now with a new president-elect, TikTok seems to have slipped off the top of Trump’s agenda.Trump gave his blessing in mid-September to a preliminary plan in which ByteDance would sell part of TikTok to Oracle Corp., Walmart Inc. and U.S. investors Sequoia Capital, KKR & Co. and General Atlantic, creating a new independent company called TikTok Global. But that deal has been stuck in limbo for months, and was quickly overshadowed by the U.S. election and rising Covid-19 cases.ByteDance has said its proposal would put American companies and investors in charge of data and content moderation for U.S. users, a key demand of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a panel led by the Treasury Department. The Treasury granted ByteDance its last extension a week ago because the department said it needed time to review a revised submission.The White House declined to comment. A Treasury spokesperson said Friday night that Cfius was working with ByteDance to finish the divestment to resolve national security concerns.China also will eventually need to give its blessing to the deal. State media has spoken out against Trump’s order, and a foreign ministry spokesman called it “bullying.”TikTok has filed multiple challenges against the ban, which are winding their way through the courts, with deadlines in certain proceedings extending past January. Several judges have already blocked the ban from going into effect and the Commerce Department said it would comply with those court rulings as the government appeals.Those cases could lapse when Biden takes office in January, unless he decides to enforce the Trump ban and defend the previous administration’s orders in court.(Updates with Treasury comment, in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Sale Deadline on Hold as Talks With U.S. Continue
2020-12-06,"Investing.com - Our markets analyst Jesse Cohen gives us his top five things to know this week on Wall Street, including:",Watch Now: Here's What Will Move Markets This Week - December 6 (Video)
2020-12-06,"(Bloomberg) -- About a week before the coronavirus was declared a pandemic, one of the world’s leading venture capital firms issued a dire prophecy. Sequoia Capital advised its companies to rein in spending, cut jobs and adapt to a new economic reality. Containing the virus, the investors wrote in a widely circulated memo known as “The Black Swan,” could take several quarters. “It will take even longer for the global economy to recover its footing.”Barely three months later, they realized that while the virus was killing thousands, leaving countless others jobless and decimating small businesses, it might actually help certain types of companies. The stock market roared back, and businesses lined up to go public, including several of Sequoia’s own. Two of the most valuable companies in the firm’s portfolio, Airbnb Inc. and DoorDash Inc., will hold initial public offerings this week. They’ll cap what will be among the best years in the nearly half-century since Sequoia laid roots.Investors in at least two mature yet active Sequoia funds will see 11-fold returns on paper, after fees, according to performance data reviewed by Bloomberg, which haven’t been previously reported. A third fund reports eight-fold returns, the data shows. A spokeswoman for Sequoia declined to comment on the numbers.The initial economic shock in the spring has given way to a very comfortable year for venture capitalists. Venture-backed IPOs have raised more so far this year than at the height of the dot-com boom, market data from Dealogic shows. And VC firms are on track to invest more than $140 billion in U.S. startups, exceeding last year’s total, according to research firm PitchBook. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund had two big listings in September and is looking forward to at least three more expected this month: Airbnb, Affirm Inc. and Wish. Andreessen Horowitz is counting on the first two of those, plus the video game maker Roblox Corp. And GGV Capital, also an Airbnb backer, will see eight of its companies go public in the U.S. this year.When Sequoia investors made their prediction in early March, they didn’t fully account for the ways a world of isolation would benefit technology companies or the impact of government stimulus programs, said Roelof Botha, a partner at the firm. People ordered more food on DoorDash and groceries on Instacart Inc., another IPO-bound Sequoia company. They played a lot of games made with development tools from Unity Software Inc. And they rented pandemic pads on Airbnb. “It’s a positive surprise,” Botha said, acknowledging the overall devastation. “Technology has helped us cope with this pandemic.”Any investor wants to be perceived as having an innate ability to see the future. Sequoia had cultivated this reputation in venture capital through decades of lucrative bets that include Apple Inc., Google, PayPal, Oracle Corp., WhatsApp and YouTube. And it became seen as a sort of Silicon Valley Nostradamus after a 2008 PowerPoint presentation titled “R.I.P. Good Times” that accurately foretold the coming economic winter.Sequoia secured some of its biggest hits of the current generation alongside formal and informal relationships forged within Y Combinator. At the urging of former partner Greg McAdoo, Sequoia invested directly in the business incubator in 2009, effectively taking a stake in all of its companies. Meanwhile, Sequoia spent time getting to know founders of Y Combinator companies, including Airbnb and Instacart. The investment in the incubator quietly ended several years ago.For three recent Sequoia funds, each one is doing better than the last. Sequoia Capital XI, the 2003 fund led by LinkedIn and YouTube, posted eight-fold returns over its lifetime, after fees. The 2006 fund XII, which contained the first investments in Airbnb and Unity, reported 10.9-fold returns, the data seen by Bloomberg show. The 13th fund, called Sequoia Capital 2010 with stakes in Square Inc., Stripe Inc. and WhatsApp, was 11.1-fold. The performance of more recent funds, including one that holds DoorDash and Instacart couldn’t be learned.Not every investment dazzles. Bird Rides Inc., which rents scooters, has had to halt operations in several cities and cut staff this year. Evernote Corp., which makes note-taking software, has lost much of its momentum.The Ford Foundation, created by the late automotive titan, is a longtime investor in Sequoia, alongside several other venture funds. Sequoia reliably delivers among the best performance in the industry, whereas a typical firm has good years and mediocre ones, said Eric Doppstadt, vice president and chief investment officer at the foundation. Yet, Sequoia partners don’t seem self-congratulatory. “Despite the successes they’ve had this year, they are not pouring Champagne in their partners’ meetings,” Doppstadt said. (He declined to comment on the returns data.)Alfred Lin, a Sequoia partner who sits on the board of Airbnb and DoorDash, has described the VC partnership by comparing it to Mötley Crüe. His point was the musicians each contribute different talents. (The band draws parallels in another way to Sequoia’s leadership, which was composed entirely of men until 2016, when it hired the first female investment partner in the U.S., Jess Lee.)Lin demonstrated his commitment to Airbnb during its early days by working at the startup’s office one day a week, something Botha and other partners have done with their companies. When Airbnb sought to evolve the service into one designed as much around feeling like a local while traveling as it was about finding a place to crash, Sequoia partners pledged their support, said Julie Supan, a brand positioning expert who has worked with the company and with Sequoia partners. “They know when there is emotion under the product,” Supan said. “They have a good sense of that.”Perhaps most importantly, Sequoia prides itself on a willingness to admit when it’s wrong and adapt when required. Not long after the Black Swan memo, Sequoia employees in China, who oversee a large number of local investments including in the parent company of TikTok, began to notice early signs of recovery there, said a person familiar with the firm’s thinking. The partners realized the same may soon happen in the U.S., said the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.The tolls the virus took on lives and on people’s livelihoods grew, but by the summer, stock markets were primed for listings. Sequoia advised several of its more mature startups to dust off their IPO plans, according to venture capitalists who sit on boards with Sequoia partners and asked not to be identified. In September alone, Sequoia had three successful offerings: data company Snowflake Inc., cloud-management provider Sumo Logic Inc. and Unity. Sequoia’s stakes in Airbnb and DoorDash will be worth a combined $9 billion this week if each prices shares at the high end of their estimates.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Sequoia Capital Warned of a ‘Black Swan.’ Instead, 2020 Is One of Its Best Years Ever"

2020-12-07,"For the first time in five weeks, investors face a Monday lacking any fresh vaccine developments. Without that--at least not yet--the market may have to find other reasons to justify rallying. So far it hasn't. Stocks are in the red thanks in part to another rough weekend of rising virus caseloads across much of the country. Risk aversion appears to be back for the moment as bonds and volatility climb (see more below). Aside from the sad news about COVID-19 and growing fears of shutdowns hurting the economy, it feels kind of like old home week. China trade was recently back in the news, and now Brexit and a possible U.S. government shutdown are potentially on the agenda. If you didn't know any better, you might think it was 2019 all over again. Brexit talks are apparently making some progress, Bloomberg reported Sunday. The U.K. will leave the European Union on Dec. 31--with or without an agreement. The latest debate is over fishing rights, of all things. Both the European and U.K. parliaments need to ratify any accord, and a ""no-agreement"" Brexit wouldn't necessarily be the most bullish way to start the new year. Neither would a U.S. government shutdown. Congress has until Dec. 11 to try and avert that, so just four days. That's getting wrapped together now with stimulus talks, which are likely to be a big focus this week.With so much on edge, volatility began a comeback overnight. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) popped above 22 after flirting with 20 last week. Risk-off also looked evident in the bond market where the 10-year yield edged down a couple of basis points. Late-Season Earnings You might assume mid-December is a slow time for earnings, but that doesn't mean there's nothing worth checking this week. Companies reporting include homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc (NYSE: TOL) expected later today, and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ: LULU), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) over the next few days. That's actually a pretty decent list, though things get really slow the last two weeks of the year. ORCL, in particular, may be worth a close look. It's not a sexy company, just reliable. How they perform can provide clues into cloud business demand, even if ORCL's business isn't quite up there with some of the more high-flying companies they compete against. The other thing to remember about ORCL is that they're one of those well-established multinational companies that can give a great indication not just about what's going on in the U.S. but worldwide. So consider listening to their call. Dollar, 10-Year Yield Flirting With Lows And Highs Two other things to monitor this week are closely related: The U.S. dollar and interest rates. The dollar index is at its lowest point since the spring of 2018, while the 10-year yield approached 1% on Friday. Both tell the story of economies gaining steam. The soft dollar (see chart below) partly reflects hope for strength in overseas economies (the euro is now at 31-month highs vs. the dollar), while higher rates suggest that hope is growing for Congress to provide stimulus. Of course, the dollar softness also could reflect stimulus hopes, too, because if Congress acts it means more currency being thrown at the economy. The question is whether that psychological 1% level for the 10-year yield spooks anyone trading stocks. It might for a day or two, but that's not necessarily something to worry about. Remember, the 10-year yield was trading near 2% when everything went haywire last winter, and the economy had been rolling along pretty nicely.As longer-term rates rise, the spread between the longer end and shorter end of the yield curve continues to stretch. By the end of the day Friday, the 2-year/10-year spread hit a 2020 high of 83 basis points. You might expect Financials to get a nice lift out of that news, and they did rise more than 1% Friday. That put them near the top of the sector leaderboard, but way behind Energy's 5% gains. Another tracker to follow is VIX, which keeps nearing 20 but also keeps having trouble dipping below it. Maybe this is finally going to be the week when it finds a way to get down below 20 and stay there for a while, something that hasn't happened in 10 months. We've come a long way from those 80 readings back in March, so the market feels like a much less turbulent place.CHART OF THE DAY: SHADES OF 2018. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) continues to weaken to levels last seen in April 2018. It's trading below its 10-day simple moving average (blue line) which is trending lower. If you look back to 2018, $DXY went as low as 89, which could potentially be the next support level. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.A Stocking Full of Fresh IPOs: All the focus on stimulus and vaccines has overshadowed what an amazing year we've had for initial public offerings (IPOs). The number of U.S. IPOs spiked from last year despite COVID-19, Barron's said. The total may approach 200, which would even top the tally from 2018--an incredibly strong IPO year. This year has seen the most money raised for U.S. IPOs since 2014. Potentially adding to that list as soon as later this week are anticipated IPOs of DoorDash (DASH) and Airbnb (ABNB). Airbnb plans to target a range of around $39 billion to $42 billion, while DoorDash will seek a valuation of around $25 billion to $28 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported recently. It also looks like 2021 could shape up as a big year for new offerings, so stay on your toes and remember that it helps to keep a cautious outlook on IPOs in general. Their stock prices don't always live up to the pre-IPO hype, so know what you're getting into, and don't buy a stock just because you love the company's product. Jobs Report Redux: Taking a look back at Friday's jobs report, there's no escaping that disappointing headline number of 245,000, down from a revised 610,000 the previous month. However, a closer check reveals it wasn't necessarily as bad as it seemed, in part because a chunk of the lost jobs came from the U.S. government as the 2020 Census count wrapped up. One piece of good news that got a bit lost in the shuffle was the Labor Department reporting hourly wages up 0.3% in November and 4.4% year-over-year. That's solid growth and could imply that the people still working aren't all doing it for less pay. Even in normal times, a 4.4% annual pay raise would look pretty darn good for most people. Why did stocks get a lift from disappointing job creation? It goes back to the same thing we used to see when the Fed didn't have rates at zero. If we were in a normal rate situation and jobs data dipped, the market would tend to jump on hopes the Fed would be more dovish. Now the Fed is already as dovish as it can get, so the market jumped Friday on hopes that the bad jobs number would light a fire under Congress on fiscal stimulus. A package before the holidays looks a bit more in the realm of possibility today than it did before the jobs report. Next Steps for Tech Darlings: Even if Tech doesn't dominate the way it's been, there's little doubt that some of the habits people picked up during the pandemic aren't going away. That's arguably good news for some of the smaller Tech companies whose stocks really shot the moon this year like Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) and Docusign Inc (NASDAQ: DOCU). A lot of companies no one had heard of a year ago are part of everyone's daily life. This doesn't mean you'll never take a flight again, or get a home loan. But people are much more comfortable working remotely, so it's not like ZM will lose all its users once we reopen the economy. The question could end up being how do companies like ZM monetize and create efficiencies and leverage multiple platforms into one offering? A lot of these small companies thought they had a few years to get that done, but they've had everything pulled forward due to the pandemic and now investors don't seem happy just to hear about more monthly users. The ones who have trouble monetizing might be the ones who get swept up in future consolidation, as we just saw with salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM) scooping up Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK). Look out for more of that, possibly, in 2021.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

However, over the past month, the stock increased by 4.78%, and in the past year, by 8.51%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 5.51%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

2020-12-10,"Shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) decreased by 1.79% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Oracle has.Oracle's Debt Based on Oracle's balance sheet as of September 15, 2020, long-term debt is at $67.77 billion and current debt is at $3.00 billion, amounting to $70.77 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $27.28 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $43.49 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Oracle's $113.55 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.62. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-12-11,"The company has moved its headquarters to Austin from Redwood City, Calif., it said in a securities filing.",Texas Scores Again as Oracle Shifts Corporate Headquarters
2020-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp., a Silicon Valley stalwart, has moved its headquarters to Texas, becoming the latest technology company to leave its home state in the face of California’s higher taxes, steeper cost of living and a broader shift to remote work.The move to Austin from Redwood City “means that many of our employees can choose their office location as well as continue to work from home part time or all of the time,” Oracle said Friday in a regulatory filing. The company will continue to support its former headquarters and other U.S. offices in Santa Monica, California; Seattle; Denver; Orlando, Florida; and Burlington, Massachusetts, according to the filing.The software maker said it had 135,000 employees as of the end of May. Like many other companies, the spread of coronavirus has prompted Oracle to offer staffers more flexible arrangements, including the ability to work from home. It’s just one of a number of companies, executives and employees that are ditching California because of concerns over the state’s tax rates and high costs, as well as arduous commutes in some locales.Oracle’s shift of resources away from California dates at least to 2018, led by Executive Chairman Larry Ellison and the late co-Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd. That year, Oracle opened a campus in Austin, featuring an on-site apartment building for employees, in an effort to recruit a younger and less costly workforce. The campus could eventually host 10,000 staffers, Oracle said at the time. The company also said last year that its largest annual conference, OpenWorld, would depart its traditional home, San Francisco, in favor of Las Vegas.The world’s second-largest software maker had grown increasingly out of step with its home state. Ellison, the 11th wealthiest person in the world, and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz have been major supporters of outgoing Republican President Donald Trump, who lost reliably Democratic California in his re-election bid this year. The company has also become a sharp critic of the internet companies that now define the modern Silicon Valley, particularly its longtime foe Google, owned by Alphabet Inc. Texas Governor Greg Abbott welcomed Oracle in a tweet reacting to the news.The move comes amid Oracle’s drive to shed costs during a transition from traditional software to cloud computing, which has resulted in declining revenue for two fiscal years. The company said Thursday it expects sales to grow 2% to 4% in the period that ends in February, which puts Oracle on track to snap that downward streak and increase revenue in the current fiscal year.The software giant, which provides databases, business applications and cloud services, has spent more than a decade trying to revamp its product line and business model to keep up with much younger rivals born in the internet age, including Google and Amazon.com Inc.Started in 1977, Oracle has been a foundational company in Silicon Valley and its silver-blue cylindrical buildings in Redwood City, visible from U.S. Highway 101, are the rare landmark in the otherwise sprawling region. It follows other tech innovators in de-emphasizing their California roots. Server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said Dec. 1 that it would move headquarters to a Houston suburb, where it is building a new campus. Palantir Technologies Inc. has relocated to Denver this year, from Palo Alto, California.Tesla Inc. co-founder Elon Musk said this week that he’s moved to Texas to focus on big projects under way for Tesla as well as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which he also runs. He previously moved his private foundation, which was based in California, to Austin. Moving carries enormous tax implications for high net worth individuals. Texas has no personal income tax, while California imposes the highest personal income levies in the nation on its richest residents.“Wow,” said Erik Hallgrimson, vice chairman with brokerage Cushman & Wakefield in Silicon Valley, upon learning of Oracle’s action. “You’re really seeing a lot of corporate movement out of the state.”Oracle’s decision just goes to show how much taxes and public policy can have an impact on corporate decision making, Hallgrimson added.Even as companies look to leave California, it’s still a place that fosters innovative companies, said Phil Mahoney, executive vice chairman at commercial real estate brokerage Newmark, who has worked in Silicon Valley for more than three decades. Many firms that decamp still maintain a presence in the state, he said, and some of the qualities that make it a good place to start and grow a business -- from world class universities to great weather --haven’t changed.“There’s no birthright that says Silicon Valley has to get all the great tech companies,” Mahoney said in an interview before Oracle’s announcement. “But it does have a special sauce that no other place has been able to replicate.”(Updates with more details beginning in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Oracle Moves Headquarters to Texas, Joining Valley Exodus"

2020-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. gave a better-than-expected forecast for quarterly revenue, in a sign of improving demand for the software giant’s cloud computing technology after years of stagnant sales.Revenue will climb 2% to 4%, an estimated $10 billion to $10.4 billion, in the period that ends in February, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said Thursday in a conference call. Analysts, on average, projected $9.94 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Such gains would keep Oracle on track to post three consecutive quarters of sales growth after two fiscal years of declining revenue.Profit, excluding some items, will be $1.09 to $1.13 a share in the current quarter, Catz said. Analysts projected $1.04.Catz and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison have tried to focus on cloud computing services in an effort to revive languid revenue growth at the world’s second-largest software maker. Customer interest in the firm’s internet-based applications has finally offset declining demand for its legacy tools. Oracle said sales of its Fusion application for managing corporate finances jumped 33% in the quarter, while revenue from NetSuite’s financial software, targeted to small and mid-sized businesses, increased 21%.Ellison said demand from large clients for Oracle’s infrastructure cloud services outstripped supply in the last quarter, so the company is scurrying to expand data centers.Sales climbed 1.9% to $9.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended Nov. 30, the Redwood Shores, California-based company said earlier in a statement, in line with analysts’ expectations of $9.79 billion. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.06 a share, beating estimates by 6 cents.Shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $59.48 in New York. The stock has gained 12% this year.Ellison sought to reassure investors that Oracle will continue to lead the market for databases, the company’s signature product, and asserted that Oracle’s tool is “much faster” than the one sold by Snowflake Inc., a company that has seen its market value more than triple to almost $106 billion since its mid-September initial public offering.“Snowflake is a decent product, a good product, I think, and it’s just killing RedShift over at Amazon,” he said. “So it’s doing extremely well. But it doesn’t remotely compare to Oracle Autonomous Database.”Oracle reported that cloud license and on-premise license sales decreased 3% to $1.09 billion in fiscal second quarter, suggesting the company is signing fewer new software deals. Analysts had expected $1.15 billion.Revenue from cloud services and license support climbed 4% to $7.1 billion. That metric includes sales from hosting customers’ data in the cloud, but a large portion is generated by maintenance fees for traditional software kept on clients’ corporate servers.Oracle is trying to become a technology partner and cloud computing services provider to ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok in its bid to land major customers for its public cloud, but the deal remains mired in U.S. regulatory review.

2020-12-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison said he has moved his primary residence to Hawaii, becoming the latest Silicon Valley executive to depart the state where they built their fortunes.Ellison, the world’s 11th-wealthiest person, notified his staff Monday of the move. Recode first reported the executive’s decision, which followed Oracle’s announcement Friday that it had shifted the company’s headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Redwood City, California.“I’ve received a number of inquiries about whether or not I will be moving to Texas,” Ellison wrote in a memo to Oracle’s employees. “The answer is no. I’ve moved to the State of Hawaii and I’ll be using the power of Zoom to work from the island of Lanai. Mahalo, Larry.”Ellison, 76, who has a net worth of about $75 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, owns 98% of Lanai, Hawaii’s sixth largest island that’s mostly made up of Ellison’s luxury hotels and resorts. Ellison is the main employer of Lanai’s 3,000 residents. In addition to his three hotels, he also owns a significant chunk of the housing stock as well as the main grocery store and the monthly newspaper there.The Oracle chairman joins other tech leaders and ultra-wealthy in leaving California, with some pointing to the state’s high taxes. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, a friend of Ellison’s, said last week that he had left California for Texas. Splunk Inc. CEO Doug Merritt also reportedly moved to the Austin area. Oracle, the world’s second-largest software maker, had called Silicon Valley home since the company’s 1977 founding.Despite Lanai being such a small island -- with only one school and no stoplights -- residents rarely see Ellison around town, though that may change now that he’s officially moved there.“Nobody knows what his schedule is,” said Alberta de Jetley, a longtime resident of the island and founder of Lanai Today, the island’s monthly newspaper, which she sold to Ellison in 2019. “He comes in on his private plane and he’s here and then he’s gone. Nobody, except for the people who actually work at the airport, know when he’s coming and going.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Oracle’s Larry Ellison Says He Has Moved to Hawaii, Fleeing California"

2020-12-14,"(Bloomberg) -- A panel of judges on the U.S. appeals court in Washington signaled skepticism of the Trump administration’s continuing efforts to ban new downloads of the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok.At a hearing Monday, two of the three judges suggested they disagreed with the government’s legal rationale for a ban on TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance Ltd. The U.S. is arguing to reinstate an order removing of TikTok from app stores run by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which a lower court blocked in September as an “indirect regulation” of communications prohibited by federal law.The government is relying on “a fairly narrow definition of indirect regulation,” U.S. Circuit Judge Patricia Millett said at Monday’s hearing.U.S. Circuit Judge Judith Rogers was more blunt. “Congress wrote this language,” Rogers said, and the government’s justification for the ban “seems to fly in the face of that.”The third judge on the panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Robert L. Wilkins, did not speak during the panel’s questioning of the Justice Department lawyer who was defending the TikTok ban.The chances that any TikTok ban will go into effect are slim. Federal judges in Washington and Pennsylvania have blocked a wide array of prohibitions designed to erode the app’s underlying web infrastructure. And the deadlines for a separate Treasury Department order to sell the app to an American buyer or face unspecified penalties have lapsed without any sign that the U.S. will force a sale.TikTok is one of the most popular apps in the world, with more than 100 million U.S. users. The Trump administration has argued that the app’s Chinese ownership makes it a national security threat. In theory, the U.S. argues, the Chinese government could use the app to gain access to the personal data of millions of American citizens.President Donald Trump gave his blessing in mid-September to a preliminary plan in which ByteDance would sell part of TikTok to Oracle Corp., Walmart Inc. and U.S. investors Sequoia Capital, KKR & Co. and General Atlantic, creating a new independent company called TikTok Global.

2020-12-14,"(Bloomberg) -- This year, the partners at Founders Fund—a prominent San Francisco venture capital firm that has backed Airbnb Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and other leading companies—took an informal internal poll: If the fund could open a major new office outside the Bay Area, where would it go? It’s a question many venture capitalists and startups have considered this year in some form or another, spurred into action by the coronavirus pandemic that has so many people working from home anyway. Tech workers are leaving California in droves, sending San Francisco rents tumbling by as much as 35%. Large companies have made the leap, too. Oracle Corp. announced plans on Friday to leave the Bay Area for Austin, Texas, e-cigarette maker Juul said it would move to Washington, D.C., and cybersecurity firm Tanium is moving to a suburb of Seattle. Even Elon Musk has said he’s now a Texan. But the venture capital industry could prove particularly difficult to dislodge from Silicon Valley. Data from PitchBook shows that year after year, the Bay Area accounts for easily the largest proportion of venture investments in the U.S.—around one-fifth of all deals. Measured by funding amount, the Bay’s dominance looks even more formidable. Last year, 38% of all venture dollars deployed went to startups in Silicon Valley. So far this year, despite the pandemic, that number ticked up to 40%. And according to startup accelerator Y Combinator, the percentage of founders listing their addresses as within the Bay Area has held steady this year.The numbers underscore the fundamental conundrum: Although many places around the U.S. are attracting more startups, no clear rival is emerging to Silicon Valley. So where can a venture firm go that would provide a decent alternative?  “If it were obvious, you would have seen more of an exodus to a single place,” said Lauren Gross, Founders Fund partner and chief operating officer.Founders Fund, the firm that conducted the internal poll, is currently housed in a low-slung brick complex in San Francisco fronted by Yoda from Star Wars and known for housing George Lucas’s film production company. This year, the firm spent months considering locations for a major new office. The question of where else Founders Fund could build a presence had come up before—its backer, Peter Thiel, left San Francisco years ago—but the idea took on new urgency during the pandemic.Partners passed around a spreadsheet where they could nominate and vote on cities, according to people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. In weekly Zoom meetings, dozens of names came up. The firm seriously considered about a half-dozen cities, among them Los Angeles, Miami and Denver, which is now home to portfolio company Palantir.The Founders Fund team also listed all the cities outside the Bay Area where it had invested in startups or had close ties to founders. It factored in tax rates, local regulations and proximity to a major hub airport, the people said. New Orleans, the pick of Michael Solana, a Founders Fund vice president, got eliminated due to what some considered a subpar flight schedule. Ditto Nashville.In the end, no city could foster enough momentum among the Founders Fund staff. The firm will mostly stay put, and has scrapped plans to pursue a major new office for the time being. Instead, it will open a smaller office in Miami. But even though the firm isn’t going anywhere, several individual partners at Founder Fund have moved out of town. In addition to Thiel, a vocal San Francisco critic who has lived in Los Angeles for years, partner Keith Rabois recently said he would move to Miami. And partner Scott Nolan splits his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The news of more tech industry departures comes as the Bay Area grapples with unpleasant realities. Many VCs complain that given its large city budget, $13.6 billion for the 2020 to 2021 fiscal year, San Francisco seems unable to effectively solve problems such as homelessness. The region also faces high rents and intense competition for hiring, along with what some regard as overreaching state regulation. One example: a measure signed into law in September aimed at increasing minority representation on boards. Opponents objected to what they saw as political meddling in business. Venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, another investor in Thiel’s circle, said earlier this year he was moving his firm, 8VC, to Austin from San Francisco. Lonsdale cited San Francisco’s checkered record on public safety, the area’s strained electricity grid and municipal government dysfunction among the reasons for his move. In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled “California, Love It and Leave It,” he also criticized the state’s “intolerant far left.” In a similar conversation with Fortune, Rabois called San Francisco “massively improperly run.” And he brought up another factor that often goes unmentioned in such articles: California’s high state income tax. Many investors fleeing Silicon Valley are moving to states that don’t tax personal income, including Florida, Texas and Washington. Taxes may provide some VCs with a new, urgent reason to leave California, particularly if they’re due for big potential gains from a record year of initial public offerings, including the stock market listings of Airbnb and DoorDash Inc. California has the highest top marginal income tax rate for individuals in the country, at 13.3%, which some lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to raise still higher this year. Counterintuitively, some of the Bay Area’s biggest businesses may be more likely to relocate than their nimbler startup counterparts. Charles Schwab Corp. and McKesson Corp. have left San Francisco for Texas, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said this month that it would also make the move. Large players typically already run substantial offices in other cities, and have more to gain from lower tax rates and less regulation. “It’ll not be difficult for these companies to move,” said Michael Marks, a founding managing partner at venture firm WRVI Capital and former chief executive officer of construction startup Katerra Inc.Startups, however, may have more trouble uprooting. Marks said several of his portfolio companies considered moving and then rejected the idea as too challenging. That’s largely because they tend to be small, and have the entirety of their operations based in the Bay Area. Many VCs are likely to follow their startups’ lead. The rise of work-from-home culture and Zoom pitch decks has made it easier for individual investors to do their jobs from exotic locales, but the heavily networked nature of the industry could wind up keeping most venture offices bound to the Bay Area. “VC is not a contactless sport,” said Brandy Aven, a professor of entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University’s business school. “The growth in venture investments in other regions has been due to spillover, and there is little reason to think that these other regions will supplant Silicon Valley.”Despite the rolling power outages, snarling traffic and persistently high housing costs, for most VCs, living in California’s Marin County still looks a lot easier than flying in from Nashville. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Silicon Valley VCs Contemplate a Pandemic Move, but Where?"

2020-12-24,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok’s U.K. business recorded a $119.5 million loss over 2019, driven by advertising and marketing expenses, giving a rare insight into how rapidly the video-sharing app is expanding.ByteDance Ltd., its Chinese parent company, has not disclosed global revenue figures, but U.K. sales amounted to $20 million over 2019, according to the latest company filings made this week. Sales and marketing expenses came to $109 million over the year. The unit hadn’t begun posting revenue in 2018.By comparison, ByteDance is said to have generated over $3 billion of profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019, Bloomberg News has reported. It’s already worth $140 billion, according to startup tracker CB Insights.Over the space of a few years, TikTok has become one of the most popular apps in the world, especially among teens. Its influence has attracted the ire of the Trump administration, which argues that the app’s Chinese ownership makes it a national security threat.Read More: Luxury TikTok Houses Begin Opening In U.K. After U.S. SuccessAt the end of 2018, TikTok had just a handful of staff in the U.K. The app has since been rapidly expanding, hiring hundreds of employees from social media rivals, and has considered making London its international headquarters. No decision has been made by the company, according to a person familiar with the planning.“As of today, the TikTok community numbers over 100 million people across the U.K. and Europe and we’re excited about our future growth potential,” said a TikTok spokesman. “These results reflect an early period of development and investment for TikTok in the U.K., and should be taken in that context.”The future of TikTok global business remains uncertain. U.S. President Donald Trump gave his blessing in mid-September to a preliminary plan in which ByteDance would sell part of TikTok to Oracle Corp., Walmart Inc. and U.S. investment firms Sequoia Capital, KKR & Co. and General Atlantic, creating a new independent company called TikTok Global. That deal has been stuck in limbo for months.The U.K. filing said “a number of strategic options are being considered in connection with the future operational structure of TikTok global business,” but added that any changes would not have a direct impact on the U.K. business.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok Gives Rare Look Into U.K. Business With $119 Million Loss

2020-12-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. lost its copyright claims against a Florida company that makes “virtual iPhones” used by security researchers to test for vulnerabilities to its system.Apple contended Corellium LLC copied the operating system, graphical user interface and other aspects of the devices without permission. It accused Corellium of acting under the guise of helping discover bugs in the iPhone’s operating system but then selling the information “on the open market to the highest bidder.”Corellium’s actions fell under an exception to copyright law because it “creates a new, virtual platform for iOS and adds capabilities not available on Apple’s iOS devices,” District Court Judge Rodney Smith in West Palm Beach ruled Tuesday. That Corellium sells its product “does not undermine its fair use defense, particularly considering the public benefit of the product.”Apple has a “bounty program” where it rewards so-called white hat hackers who discover flaws in its system. The Cupertino, California-based company argued that the Corellium product went far beyond that, though Corellium said it evaluates potential customers and rejects some.Corellium has said its customers are government agencies, financial institutions and security researchers and accused Apple of trying to control security research to limit what the public learns about vulnerabilities. Apple had been in talks to buy the company but the two sides couldn’t agree on a price, Smith said. Apple sued a year later.Corellium’s virtual product is used on a desktop computer and can’t make phone calls, send text messages, access iTunes or do any of the other things an iPhone can.“There is evidence in the record to support Corellium’s position that its product is intended for security research and, as Apple concedes, can be used for security research,” the judge said. “Further, Apple itself would have used the product for internal testing had it successfully acquired the company.”Officials with the two companies didn’t immediately respond to queries seeking comment.Apple argued that the case is similar to the billion-dollar dispute between Oracle Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, in which an appeals court rejected Google’s arguments that it had the right to copy Oracle code for inclusion into the Android operating system. The Supreme Court is considering the issue.Smith said they aren’t comparable -- Corellium transforms iOS and adds new content, and it isn’t a direct competitor. He said it was instead more like the case in which an appeals court ruled that Google’s creation of digital copies of books and display of snippets in search results was a fair use of copyrighted works.The judge said that Corellium may still be in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits tools to circumvent security measures, so he declined to dismiss that aspect of the case at this stage. He ordered the two sides to submit a status report by Jan. 11 to determine how the case proceeds.The ruling was reported earlier by the Washington Post.The case is Apple Inc. v.

2020-12-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amid raging wildfires, rolling blackouts and a worsening coronavirus outbreak, it has not been a great year for California. Unfortunately, the state is also reeling from a manmade disaster: an exodus of thriving companies to other states.In just the past few months, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said it was leaving for Houston. Oracle Corp. said it would decamp for Austin. Palantir Technologies Inc., Charles Schwab Corp. and McKesson Corp. are all bound for greener pastures. No less an information-age avatar than Elon Musk has had enough. He thinks regulators have grown “complacent” and “entitled” about the state’s world-class tech companies.No doubt, he has a point. Silicon Valley’s high-tech cluster has been the envy of the world for decades, but there’s nothing inevitable about its success. As many cities have found in recent years, building such agglomerations is exceedingly hard, as much art as science. Low taxes, modest regulation, sound infrastructure and good education systems all help, but aren’t always sufficient. Once squandered, moreover, such dynamism can’t easily be revived. With competition rising across the U.S., the area’s policy makers need to recognize the dangers ahead.In recent years, San Francisco has seemed to be begging for companies to leave. In addition to familiar failures of governance — widespread homelessness, inadequate transit, soaring property crime — it has also imposed more idiosyncratic hindrances. Far from welcoming experimentation, it has sought to undermine or stamp out home-rental services, food-delivery apps, ride-hailing firms, electric-scooter companies, facial-recognition technology, delivery robots and more, even as the pioneers in each of those fields attempted to set up shop in the city. It tried to ban corporate cafeterias — a major tech-industry perk — on the not-so-sound theory that this would protect local restaurants. It created an “Office of Emerging Technology” that will only grant permission to test new products if they’re deemed, in a city bureaucrat’s view, to provide a “net common good.” Whatever the merits of such meddling, it’s hardly a formula for unbounded inventiveness.These two traits — poor governance and animosity toward business — have collided calamitously with respect to the city’s housing market. Even as officials offered tax breaks for tech companies to headquarter themselves downtown, they mostly refused to lift residential height limits, modify zoning rules or allow significant new construction to accommodate the influx of new workers. They then expressed shock that rents and home prices were soaring — and blamed the tech companies.California’s legislature has only made matters worse. A bill it enacted in 2019, ostensibly intended to protect gig workers, threatened to undo the business models of some of the state’s biggest tech companies until voters granted them a reprieve in a November referendum. A new privacy law has imposed immense compliance burdens — amounting to as much as 1.8% of state output in 2018 — while conferring almost no consumer benefits. An 8.8% state corporate tax rate and 13.3% top income-tax rate (the nation’s highest) haven’t helped.Of course, California isn’t alone in squandering such advantages. New York City has been the world’s top finance hub for many years, and increasingly had become home to a thriving tech community as well. But a similar blend of poor policy choices, high taxes, needless red tape, rising crime, and occasional outright hostility — as with the senseless opposition to Amazon.com Inc.’s proposed headquarters — has been pushing both industries to friendlier climes in recent years.Such carelessness is all the more damaging because a tech hub is more than the sum of its parts. Such clusters accelerate the flow of ideas, concentrate skilled workers and create productive new networks. They’re likely to boost investment, business formation, innovation, wages and growth. And their benefits are widely shared: By one estimate, each new tech job creates five additional jobs in other industries, a multiplier effect about three times larger than that for manufacturing. That’s not to mention the immensely popular products that result.For now, the Bay Area is unlikely to be displaced as the nation’s top tech hub. After all, it’s still home to some of the world’s most valuable companies, draws an outsized share of venture-capital investment, and remains an unrivaled incubator for startups. And predictions of Silicon Valley’s demise have proved reliably wrong for decades.Even so, no state can antagonize its companies so extravagantly and expect them to stay put forever. As every Californian knows, the open road is all too inviting.Editorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.

Blame Bad Government.
2020-12-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Texas is making another bid to become America’s technology hub. It will be an uphill battle, to put it mildly. But one seemingly small policy tweak could give the state a big boost in its quest to lure the tech industry: banning the enforcement of noncompete agreements. In the 1970s, Austin established itself as a technology cluster but never attained the heights of Silicon Valley or Seattle. To do that, a city needs a critical mass of talented engineers, big employers and venture capital. Now, the urban dysfunction of the San Francisco Bay Area and a desire for lower taxes have prompted some tech companies and investors to move from the Bay to Austin. Elon Musk’s companies, Tesla and SpaceX, are probably the most notable big companies making new investments in the area, and Musk himself has moved to Texas. Oracle and a smattering of venture capitalists, are also making the move.This is good news for Austin, but so far it’s a trickle, not a flood. Tesla factories are nice, but if Austin is going to become a software and startup hub on the level of Seattle or San Francisco, it’s going to need a lot more than that. As my colleague Justin Fox has written, the entire state of Texas has lagged badly in both areas.So the Texas state government needs to pull out all the stops in order to make sure the current trend accelerates. And one of the easiest things it could do would be to ban the enforcement of noncompete agreements.Noncompete agreements restrain the ability of workers to move between companies in an industry (or starting their own new venture). All else equal, companies would like to be able to block their workers from moving to competitors. Ideas will inevitably leak between companies when employees move, even if proprietary technologies are formally protected by intellectual property law and nondisclosure agreements.But by preventing these ideas from spreading around, a company does a little bit of damage to the entire industrial ecosystem around it. Ideas are synergistic — they can be rearranged into different combinations and produce new technologies, products and management techniques. Sometimes simply having the same employee in a different working environment or role will allow them to do great things. Fairchild Semiconductor, for example, famously gave rise to a huge number of spinoff companies that formed the backbone of the original Silicon Valley.That might not have been possible if California had allowed the enforcement of noncompete agreements. Scholars have cited California’s refusal to honor these clauses as a reason Silicon Valley became so dominant among U.S. tech clusters. In her book “Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128,” researcher AnnaLee Saxenian cites it as one big reason California was able to overtake Massachusetts, which had a big head start in terms of the technology industry.Empirical studies back this up. A 2017 paper by economists Evan Starr, Justin Frake and Rajshree Agarwal finds that in states that enforce noncompetes, industries with more of these agreements “receive relatively fewer job offers, have reduced mobility and experience lower wages.” Another 2017 paper by economist Jessica Jeffers finds that the reduced labor mobility caused by noncompetes reduces the number of new startups, especially in knowledge industries.And that gums up a whole tech cluster. Places like Silicon Valley exist precisely because tech companies and venture capitalists want to take advantage of the deep pool of engineering and managerial talent that exists in the area. Noncompetes lock that pool away; if all your potentially best hires are legally prevented from working for you, you might as well move your company out to the middle of Wyoming or the Philippines, where at least the rent is cheap!This is why Texas needs to change its law to make noncompetes unenforceable, like in California. Big businesses will probably lobby against this move — from their own narrow vantage point, noncompetes seem like a good deal. But the small benefit they derive comes at the expense of the entire tech ecosystem. Each Texas company that makes its workers sign noncompetes is helping itself at the expense of the state itself. So the state needs to step in. While Texas law discourages the agreements, they're still enforceable when deemed ""reasonable.""  That's not good enough.Banning noncompetes would be inconsistent with Texas’ principles and reputation as a defender of free markets. Noncompete agreements are restrictions on the free movement of labor; they gum up markets. Ultimately, the market is more important than the prerogatives of any particular company.In fact, Texas isn’t the only state that needs to ban noncompetes; every other state should do the same. Many — including Massachusetts — are acting to limit the practice. Incoming President Joe Biden has even proposed a federal ban on noncompetes. If it could pass Congress, such a ban would put all the states on a more level playing field when it comes to luring tech away from Silicon Valley.But Texas shouldn’t wait for Biden -- it should act now.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Unions in the technology industry are rare. A big reason for this is the lucrative salaries. Companies like Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) routinely engage in aggressive recruiting and even poaching of employees. The compensation packages not only often include large salaries but equity option packages. It’s not uncommon for top technical people to be worth millions.
So what does this unionization at Google mean? And why did this happen? Well, interestingly enough, the reasons are not the typical ones. It does appear that the union will be more about giving employees a voice in the actions of the company’s senior management decisions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
So let’s take a look.
Society and Technology
Until 20 years ago or so, the technology industry was mostly about helping to improve the efficiency of companies and government organizations. The systems allowed for automation of core functions like payroll, human resources, sales, logistics and so on.
10 of 2020’s Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks
But with the growth of the internet, social media and smartphones, the technology industry has increasingly become an important part of the daily lives of consumers. This trend certainly provided many benefits like lower costs, convenience and better services. Just look at how we hail rides with Uber (NYSE:UBER), easily purchase airline tickets on Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), get food delivery from DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) or rent someone’s home via Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB).
Then again, the technology has its downsides as well. The hacks of our personal data have become commonplace.
But there are even potential threats to our liberty. A prime example is the use of artificial intelligence for facial recognition. What if it is used to identify a crime but the data is somehow biased? The consequences can be devastating.
No doubt, a company like Google is at the vortex of all this. The company makes much of its money based on leveraging people’s data, such as with the viewing of videos, sending email and checking out maps.
But for Google employees working on this technology, there can be anxiety. Might the innovations be used for bad outcomes? Could there be abuse? And who makes the ethical decisions?
It’s extremely complicated and the answers are not clear cut. So it should be no surprise that Google has made its share of missteps. For example, there was the recent departure of Timnit Gebru, who is one of the world’s top ethics researchers for AI. She alleged that she was fired because of one of her papers and the complaints she had about the lack of diversity within Google.
Now it’s important to note that the company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, has apologized and will investigate the matter.

Bottom Line on Google Stock
There have been other unions at Google. One was for security guards and another was for employees at for the company’s cafeteria’s (yes, there are many on the main campus!) But the union with the Communications Workers of America Local 1400 is different because it covers most of the employees. This is even the case for non-Google operations like Waymo.
Of course, when it comes to unions, they are often a negative for companies. But in the case of Google stock, I actually think the move is a positive. Again, the company is already very competitive with its compensation and benefits. But more importantly, as technology becomes more essential and pervasive across society, there needs to be more responsibility. And this is why it is critical to have more people involved in this process.

2021-01-08,"A month ago, I wrote that Switchback Energy (NYSE:SBE) stock, while expensive, had a shot to provide solid long-term returns. Since then, Switchback Energy rallied more than 11%.

And at this point, the valuation is getting close to ridiculous. Electric vehicle charging station provider ChargePoint, with which SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) Switchback is merging, now has a pro forma market capitalization over $13 billion. (Switchback has estimated that once the merger closes, there will be 305 million shares outstanding.)
It is exceedingly difficult to justify that kind of valuation. The question is if, and when, that will matter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A 200%-Plus Rally
On Oct. 30, Switchback Energy stock closed at $13.23. The stock had seen a reasonably swift pullback, dropping 18% in seven sessions, but that aside the price didn’t see notably out of line. After all, ChargePoint had agreed to merge with Switchback in September at a price of $10 per share.
10 of 2020’s Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks
Since then, in less than three months, SBE has gained 210%. The question is why.
It’s hard to pin down, truthfully. ChargePoint hasn’t disclosed any news that’s particularly noteworthy. Switchback itself is just a shell company.
An SBE bull could point to the elections in early November as a catalyst. The win by Democrat Joe Biden ostensibly is bullish for EVs in the U.S. But that case seems thin.
A Biden win was widely expected (by the betting markets as well as the again-unreliable polls). In fact, it was believed that Democrats were likely to sweep all three branches of government. After the run-offs in Georgia, the more pro-environment party will have narrow control of the U.S. Senate, with a single defection able to block any major legislation.
The answer seems to be that the rest of the market has gone nuts. EV stocks of all kinds, and particularly EV-related SPACs like SBE, have soared. Small-cap stocks have been on a tear. Anything with growth potential seemingly has gone parabolic or close, no matter the valuation. Switchback Energy stock has not been an exception.

Another Bubble?
As I’ve written before, I saw the peak of the dot-com bubble first-hand through 1999 and early 2000. And since then, I’ve bristled at comparisons to that time.
Honestly, I’m not bristling anymore, and Switchback Energy stock is an example why. A 200% rally in three months on no news (at least, no unexpected news) is not normal. It’s not healthy. And it’s not sustainable.
To be clear, this is not to say that ChargePoint is a fad, or akin to Pets.com and the other dot-com names of the late 1990s. But the late 1990s bubble wasn’t built solely, or even mostly, on weak companies.
Indeed, the telecom bubble was broader and larger. Meanwhile, at the peak, the most expensive and most valuable names in the market included Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and EMC, which is now part of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL). Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was the 30th-most valuable company in the world.
Those are some of the best tech companies of the past two decades. Cisco and Oracle still have market capitalizations well below their March 2000 levels. As recently as April, Qualcomm sat below its peak.
Simply put, those companies delivered on their potential. Their stocks did not, because the valuations had run too far.

Switchback Energy Stock Goes Parabolic
At $40, SBE stock is running into a similar problem. This is a company that, in its merger presentation, estimated revenue of $1 billion once EV penetration reaches 3% of cars on the road. The industry is a long way from that goal, given that EVs represented less than 3% of new car sales last year, leaving tens of millions of ICE (internal combustion engines)
That estimate is precisely that: an estimate. And since ChargePoint is going public via the SPAC route instead of via a traditional initial public offering, it can make such a claim with less verification and lighter disclosure. EV investors should have learned from Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) the dangers posed by such thin disclosures.
Even assuming the estimate is correct, SBE stock is trading at more than 13x a revenue level that’s likely five to seven years in the future. Given gross margin targets in the range of 40% to 45%, it’s valued at something like 30x gross profit on the same basis.
Those are massive multiples, even in a market that’s soared to new highs this year.
And they’re even more massive than they were two months ago, due to a rally that seems to have little justification beyond widespread investor optimism. In that context, the rally looks questionable at best. ChargePoint might succeed, but that no longer makes SBE stock a buy.

2021-01-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Doug Leone, a billionaire venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, said he’s dropping support of Donald Trump, joining a growing list of business leaders condemning the president for stoking deadly riots at the U.S. Capitol.“After last week’s horrific events, President Trump lost many of his supporters, including me,” Leone wrote in an email seen by Bloomberg. “The actions of the president and other rally speakers were responsible for inciting the rioters.”The venture capitalist and his wife donated to Trump’s reelection campaign and stood as rare prominent backers in left-leaning Silicon Valley. Leone’s White House ties came in handy last fall when Trump ordered a ban of TikTok, owned by the Sequoia-backed company ByteDance Ltd. Leone helped with negotiations.Dozens of corporate leaders have denounced Trump’s actions since last week, including the heads of Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. Most of the president’s strongest allies in the corporate world have remained mum, even as Trump’s days in office run low and as he faces imminent impeachment proceedings.Venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who backed Trump’s nomination in 2016, has not made any public statements. Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison and Chief Executive Safra Catz haven’t commented, either. Representatives for all three didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.In Leone’s email, which was reported earlier Wednesday by technology website Recode, the investor urged unity behind President-elect Joe Biden: “We need to find the best way to move forward as a country, get behind our newly-elected president and start working on the many difficult issues facing America.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Sequoia Capital’s Doug Leone Renounces Trump After Backing Campaign

2021-01-22,"The market opened with a dip on Friday, but bulls were quick to bid it back up. That said, let’s have a look at a few top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider You remember our good friend Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), right? This one has been flagged multiple times, in a newsletter and even selected as a stock of the year candidate. Well, BBBY stock just keeps on going, as its short interest has fueled a strong move to the upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Earlier this year, shares shook off a disappointing earnings reaction after breaking out over resistance. The rise has been impressive since, as shares powered through the prior 2020 highs near $26. 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day Now hitting the 161.8% extension of the recent range (within a penny!), BBBY stock is backing off a bit. From here, I want to see $25 to $26 act as support. Over Friday’s high, and a run toward $40 is possible. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Palantir (PLTR) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) has been flirting with a move to the upside for more than a week, tantalizing traders in the process with its false moves higher. First $27.50 rejected a big rally. Then $28. Finally, shares powered up on Friday, bursting through the weekly-up trigger (at the previously mentioned $28 mark), and pushed through clear resistance at $29. Now it’s contending with the December high near $31.25. A close above it puts the highs in play at $33.50. Above that, and we could see an extension up toward $40. On the downside, though, I now want to see $29 to $30 act as support. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: FuboTV (FUBO) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider FuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) gave us exactly what we were looking for this week. On Thursday, the stock cleared the two-day high at $32.50 after a low-volume pullback, ripping to the 20-day moving average in the process. Now pushing over that mark, the stock is potentially setting up for a strong inside-and-up week next week. In plain English, this week’s range is within the prior week’s range — that’s the “inside” part — while the “and up” part requires a move over this week’s high (which will be set on Friday). Over the prior week’s high at $40.40 puts the gap-fill in play at $42.82. Above that could put the squeeze on, potentially putting $50-plus on the table. I don’t want to be too aggressive, though. 10 E-Commerce Stocks That Are Leading the Charge Into Digital On the downside, however, look for the 10-week and 50-day moving averages to continue holding as support. That support level earlier this week combined with the tight two-day range gave traders something to work with and it paid off big time. Now let’s see if it can continue. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Oracle (ORCL) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) caught a nice rally off the lows on Friday, bouncing from the 100-day moving average. Still, it ended lower on Friday after a downgrade from Goldman Sachs. Next week, I want to see Oracle regain the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, as well as that key $61.86 mark. If these levels are resistance, the 100-day moving average may be back on the table, as well as the potential for more downside. Above them will put the 21-day moving average in play, followed by a possible push to the $65 area — although that’s some high expectations for the moment. On the downside, though, a full-on break could put the $56.50 area on deck. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in BBBY.

2021-01-25,"(Bloomberg) -- In Christian Klein’s first year as sole chief executive officer at SAP SE, the company’s shares had their worst performance in 12 years. The pandemic damaged sales. And he lost his co-CEO in a high-profile ouster that eliminated the only woman running a large, publicly traded German company.Klein has a bold plan to turn things around. It hinges on getting customers to adopt a suite of new cloud-based products that work faster and cost less to distribute and maintain. The aim is to put Europe’s largest software company on par with a generation of nimbler upstarts, such as Salesforce.com Inc. He’ll also need to find investor support for the expensive program in the middle of an economic slump.“If I had one wish for 2021, it would be that we can see a year where we can consistently execute our strategy and prove that it is the right one,” Klein said in an interview.Weaning users off older products carries risks. SAP works with large enterprises with a low tolerance for disruptions. And the switchover is cutting into profit, trading big upfront payments for smaller subscription installments. Though Klein knew the decision wouldn’t necessarily win applause from investors, they were initially supportive, he said.But as the company put the strategy into motion, customers radically scaled back their software purchases as they grappled with fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. In an unscheduled announcement late on a Sunday night in October, SAP slashed its sales outlook and said growth and margin improvement would be limited for the next two years.Shares collapsed 22% the next day, wiping more than 30 billion euros ($37 billion) from the company’s market value. A January update showed signs of success in moving customers to the cloud, though the company warned the pandemic will continue hurting sales.Klein – a 40-year-old who’s spent his entire adult life at the Walldorf, Germany-based company after joining as a student in 1999 – has pushed forward during the first month of the new year. The company’s announced high-profile management changes, chief among them naming Julia White, a nearly 20-year Microsoft Corp. veteran, head of marketing.The company also expanded its partnership with Microsoft and will integrate some of their products, including adding Teams to SAP’s software. And SAP is moving ahead with plans to raise as much as $1.28 billion from listing a stake in its Qualtrics International Inc. unit.Still, Klein will have to convince investors to go along for the ride in a transition that could ultimately take years, in the middle of a pandemic that’s continuing to hammer customers.AXA Investment Managers, which has held a stake in SAP for 20 years, cut its European funds’ holding in the company by a third in November “to acknowledge the fact that on a short-term basis we have lost some momentum,” said Gilles Guibout, a portfolio manager. Though Guibout agrees a faster move to the cloud is necessary, SAP’s course correction is likely to mean the company has to “over invest” for the next three years, he said.With a market value of more than 128 billion euros, SAP is Europe’s sole contender to rival U.S. enterprise software giants such as Salesforce and Oracle Corp. Its founders, Hasso Plattner and Dietmar Hopp, are Europe’s two richest tech billionaires with a combined net worth of just over $24 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Plattner, who remains at the company as its chairman and largest shareholder, backed Klein after the shares dropped in October, buying an additional 249 million euros in stock in a show of support.“When one of the largest shareholders buys more shares it gives me confidence,” Klein said. “I got that feedback from the whole supervisory board.”Read More: SAP’s Biggest Rout in 24 Years Has Its Leaders Buying the StockIt wasn’t the first time Plattner had taken Klein’s side. Klein had initially shared the CEO role with Jennifer Morgan in the U.S. She was an outgoing, American marketing guru with experience running the company’s most crucial business, the cloud division. He was the workhorse and former chief operating officer, more comfortable behind the scenes. The two were initially seen as complements.But the pandemic frayed the relationship as different time zones and outlooks slowed decision making and caused clashes.Klein got the news that the supervisory board had voted Morgan out on April 20, the same day his second child was born. Plattner told employees in a memo at the time that it was “crucial to have one sole CEO navigate us through this unprecedented change.” Klein has said the pair disagreed on several decisions, and his last few conversations with Morgan were “pretty emotional,” but declined to say more. Morgan has since taken a job at Blackstone Group Inc. and declined to comment for this story.Read More: SAP Drops Co-CEO Role After Six Months as Virus Upends Plans Now on his own, Klein also had to confront the legacy of his predecessor Bill McDermott.For Klein’s plan to work, SAP has to be able to offer customers a suite of products that work together seamlessly. But McDermott liked to buy his way into new technologies, spending more than $30 billion on acquisitions during his approximately 10-year tenure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shopping spree put together a collection of businesses that may have helped modernize SAP’s offerings, but weren’t necessarily well integrated.Read More: SAP’s Failure to Adapt Just Cost It $38 Billion: Alex WebbMcDermott’s strategy showed mixed results, and SAP attracted the attention of notorious activist Elliott Management Corp., which built up a stake and demanded the company focus on its profit and share price. The company announced changes in 2019 that appeased the group, though McDermott resigned months later saying that a decade was “a long time” to be CEO.The Qualtrics IPO later this year will represent a high profile break with the past as the company sells a stake in McDermott’s biggest deal. The U.S. business, which makes software for conducting customer surveys, cost SAP $8 billion about two years ago.Read More: SAP Spinoff Qualtrics Boosts Price Range for $1.3 Billion IPOThis year is set to be crucial for SAP, when the nearly half-century old German software giant must prove to investors and customers that it can put past missteps behind it keep up with its larger U.S. rivals.“SAP is really at a turning point right now because we think there’s this once-in-a-lifetime vulnerability happening,” said Julie Bhusal Sharma, an analyst for Morningstar Inc. “What he’ll have to deal with is making this migration a much smoother process for its existing customer base, I think that thus far it’s been ruffling a lot of feathers.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",SAP CEO’s Comeback Plan Rankles Investors of European Tech Giant

2021-01-27,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd.’s revenue more than doubled to about $35 billion last year, defying heightened global competition and Trump’s attempt to ban its signature video service TikTok in the U.S.The Chinese company managed to grow operating profit to roughly $7 billion in 2020 from less than $4 billion the prior year, a person familiar with the matter said. That’s in a year when former U.S. president Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and force its sale to American investors led by Oracle Corp. With Joe Biden in office, the company is moving closer toward listing part of its social media empire in Hong Kong. The Information first reported on ByteDance’s 2020 financials.ByteDance’s phenomenal growth stems from the global success of teen phenom TikTok and its Chinese twin Douyin, which helped pioneer a new form of social video and undercut rivals from Facebook Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. Last valued at about $180 billion, the company is said to be exploring an initial public offering for some of its businesses in Hong Kong, including Douyin. A ByteDance spokesperson declined to comment.An eventual IPO would follow smaller competitor Kuaishou Technology’s impending $5.4 billion debut. Kuaishou, which operates China’s most popular video service after Douyin, is slated to list Feb. 5 in the world’s biggest internet IPO since Uber Technologies Inc.Read more: ByteDance Seeks Funds at $180 Billion Value Before IPO of AssetsBut one major uncertainty remains for ByteDance: whether the Biden administration will follow through on its predecessors’ actions.Founded by Zhang Yiming in 2012, ByteDance built TikTok into one of the most popular apps around the world, with more than 100 million users in the U.S. alone. The startup has more than quadrupled revenue from just $8 billion in 2018 and now posts sales on par with the likes of Nike Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.But the Trump administration labeled the app a security threat and banned the service last year, contending the Chinese government could compel ByteDance to turn over the data of millions of young American users. Oracle and Walmart Inc. then agreed to buy 20% of TikTok in a complex deal blessed by the former president.Biden’s immediate priorities are curbing the pandemic and resuscitating the economy, and he has had little to say so far about TikTok. It’s possible ByteDance could work out a compromise with the new president that allows it to retain full or majority ownership -- provided it can demonstrate American user data is secure.Read more: India TikTok Ban Threatens China’s Rise as Global Tech PowerBeyond the U.S., ByteDance has been stymied in India, where the government has banned scores of Chinese apps since June in the wake of deadly Himalayan border clashes. TikTok was among a clutch of services permanently banned after the latest skirmish, forcing its Chinese owner to scale back in the country, once its largest market globally.“We have steadfastly worked to comply with the Indian order from June, even as we disagreed with it,” TikTok said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “Given the lack of feedback from the government about how to resolve this issue in the subsequent seven months, it is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India.”As the TikTok and Indian sagas raged, Zhang has put more effort into nascent Chinese-focused businesses from gaming and education to e-commerce, while fine-tuning ByteDance’s management structure, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing internal matters.During a December town hall meeting attended by ByteDance’s 100,000-plus employees, Zhang said TikTok’s user growth slowed in 2020’s second half because of new competition from Youtube and Snap Inc., according to attendees who asked not be identified discussing private events. But he emphasized that its growth potential still outstripped Douyin’s, they said.Read more: TikTok Tug-of-War Ensnares App’s Affable Billionaire Founder(Updates with Indian scale-back from the ninth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok’s Owner Doubles Sales to $35 Billion Despite U.S. Ban

2021-01-30,"Nowadays it’s not really popular to focus stocks selling at a discount — that is, the so-called value investing approach. Instead, the interest is mostly on momentum. For the most part, this approach has gotten… well… crazy! The phenomenon of Reddit investors has taken Wall Street by storm — and has even threatened the stability of billion-dollar hedge funds. These investors have targeted heavily shorted stocks to gin up epic squeezes. The result is that there have been huge surges with companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But whenever there is this level of speculation, the markets are likely close to reaching a peak. And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

2021-02-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will step down from his post in the third quarter of 2021 and be replaced by Andy Jassy, the head of the company’s cloud computing unit.Jassy, 53, for years has been seen as a potential successor to Bezos, who founded the company as an online bookstore from his Seattle garage more than 25 years ago and became one of the world’s wealthiest men. Jassy’s likelihood as successor seemed inevitable last year when Jeff Wilke, who was the consumer business chief and was also seen as a CEO candidate, announced he’d be leaving this year.Bezos, 57, the company’s driving force since its founding, will become executive chairman, Amazon said Tuesday in a statement.The transition arrives at time when Amazon seems unstoppable, fueled by record sales amid the pandemic and generating massive cash and profits from Amazon Web Services, which Jassy helped create and manage. The incoming CEO, who has been at Amazon since 1997, is likely to keep the company on its current path. And Bezos isn’t going far, much the way Bill Gates remained chairman of Microsoft Corp. after ceding the CEO role.“When you look at our financial results, what you’re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention,” Bezos said in a statement. “Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.”Bezos’s new role will let him focus on innovation, which he is passionate about, without getting encumbered by the day-to-day of a global empire that is the target of regulatory scrutiny on multiple continents and criticisms about its treatment of low-wage workers. Bezos can turn more of his attention to the most promising ideas that deserve Amazon’s deep pockets, as well as his other interests, including ownership of the space exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post, and causes such as climate change. Bezos has a net worth of nearly $200 billion, making him the second-wealthiest man in the world behind Elon Musk, who last month supplanted Bezos in the top spot.The reaction on Wall Street was mostly positive, even as Amazon turned in another blockbuster quarter and solid guidance.Revenue will be $100 billion to $106 billion in the quarter ending in March, the Seattle-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Amazon projected operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated profit of $6.07 billion on sales of $95.72 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The online retailer reported fourth-quarter sales jumped 44% to $125.6 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $119.7 billion. Earnings were $14.09 per share, compared with analyst projections of $7.34. The shares were little changed in post-market trading.Read more: Amazon Projects Revenue Signaling Strong E-Commerce DemandStill, investors remain mindful of Amazon’s rising expenses. Costs related to Covid-19, which include lost productivity due to social distancing as well as stepped up cleaning throughout its warehouses and shipping centers, will add $2 billion to expenses in the current quarter, Amazon said.Jassy, who served as a technical adviser to Bezos earlier in his career, is cut from the same cloth as his boss, current and former colleagues say. He prefers data-driven decision-making and puts customers at the center of the company’s thinking. Jassy is also known as an occasional micromanager on projects close to his heart, another trait he has in common with Bezos. Colleagues are impressed with his ability to recall small details about projects from long-ago meetings.Jassy’s rise to CEO is probably bad news for companies like Oracle Corp., Microsoft and Google that compete with Amazon in cloud computing, said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester.“Andy Jassy for almost two decades now has focused on the AWS side of Amazon,” she said. “CEOs focus on their babies.

2021-02-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Incoming Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy cuts a low profile outside of the wonky world of cloud computing. But for much of the last decade he’s been arguably the most important person in the tech industry.The unit he leads, Amazon Web Services, has reshaped how companies buy technology, by simplifying computing services into their component pieces and offering them essentially for rent over the internet. The business was initially dismissed by enterprise software giants like Oracle Inc. before that company and others quickly sought to emulate elements of AWS’s strategy.In the same earnings report in which Amazon said Jassy, 53, would succeed Jeff Bezos later this year, the company reported that AWS pulled in $12.7 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, making the unit a $50 billion business on an annual basis.“Andy brings the first principles thinking that has always been a part of what’s made Amazon successful -- deeply trying to understand the end customer, creating building blocks by which other people can build and than being good at rapidly iterating,” said Matt McIlwain, a managing director with Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, who has closely tracked Amazon’s rise. “He watched how Jeff approached problems. That’s very important because there a lot of things that are deeply embedded in the culture of Amazon.”Amazon shares were largely unchanged in New York on Wednesday.Jassy has led AWS since before the launch of its first major services in 2006. Cloud computing was not a natural area for Amazon, then almost exclusively an online retail company. But Amazon’s expertise in creating digital systems and running its own sometimes-cumbersome technology, gave Bezos, Jassy and other executives confidence that they could come up with an answer to problems confounding other big corporate technology buyers.AWS’s early customers were primarily startups, and Amazon built the business through trial and error quietly, tucking the unit into a catchall category in financial results. By the time Amazon disclosed the unit’s revenue in 2015, AWS was already on its way toward unseating business technology incumbents. Researcher Gartner Inc. estimates Amazon had a 45% market share in infrastructure as a service as of 2019, its most recent data.Jassy was named CEO of AWS in a reorganization that gave longtime logistics and retail executive Jeff Wilke oversight of Amazon’s retail unit. When Wilke announced his retirement last year, Jassy became Bezos’s obvious successor.Jassy joined Amazon in 1997, after attending Harvard Business School. Early in his career, he served as the first technical adviser to Bezos, a sort of chief of staff role that had him sitting in on all of the top executive’s meetings and providing counsel on a wide range of issues.Whether by nature or that experience as Bezos’s “shadow,” Jassy is uncannily similar to his boss, current and former colleagues say. He has instituted Amazon’s preference for rigorous data-driven decision-making throughout AWS and has been known to intervene in meetings when executives go on tangents unrelated to pleasing the customer. Colleagues say he’s precise and can recall small details from long-ago meetings.Jassy is also known as an occasional micromanager on projects close to his heart, another trait he has in common with Bezos. His challenge as CEO will be to understand the consumer and logistics parts of the business as well as he knows AWS.Jassy over the years has shown a passion for social and philanthropic issues not often associated with Amazon’s sometimes single-minded founding CEO. He has long devoted time to a Seattle nonprofit that helps low-income students get into top schools. As homelessness became an all-consuming issue in Amazon’s hometown, Jassy quietly joined the company’s local city council member in walking the city during the one-night count designed to tally the scale of the crisis.Raised in the New York City area, he remains an avid New York sports fan, and holds a minority stake in the Seattle Kraken expansion National Hockey League team.(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon’s Incoming CEO Jassy Ushered in Cloud Computing Boom

2021-02-10,"(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration signaled it would slow down an effort to force TikTok to unwind its U.S. operations, asking a federal judge on Wednesday to pause a lawsuit over former President Donald Trump’s ban of the popular video app while the new White House reviews its predecessor’s policies.The White House said TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., is part of a wide-ranging examination of the government’s posture toward Beijing, including how to guard against risks to Americans’ online data.Those risks, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, will be addressed “in a decisive and effective fashion,” though no action is imminent. “It’s a broad review that’s expanded beyond TikTok,” Psaki told reporters in a briefing at the White House.The developments show that the forced sale of TikTok -- a drama that unfolded through Trump’s final year in office -- is far down President Joe Biden’s list of priorities, even as the company remains in discussion with regulators. The new president has dedicated much of his time to domestic issues, including passing another round of virus relief and a separate package to boost the pandemic-battered U.S. economy.In addition to TikTok, The Biden administration has put a number of Trump’s other national security priorities related to China under review, including trade tariffs and the delisting of some Chinese companies from U.S. stock markets. The administration is in the process of determining which China matters need to be addressed immediately, according to people familiar with the matter.The TikTok sale also doesn’t appear to be a priority for the group of U.S. companies involved in the Trump-era deal to purchase Bytedance’s American operations, which include Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. The issue didn’t come up during a more than 90-minute meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday between Biden, Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon and other business leaders, according to three people familiar with the conversation.Talks between ByteDance and the U.S. government, however, have continued behind the scenes.ByteDance representatives are speaking with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, over security guarantees surrounding the company’s data, concerns about its source code and other matters related to TikTok’s operations in the U.S, according to the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. A ByteDance spokesman declined to comment.The effort is aimed at ensuring that TikTok never again has to weather the scenario last fall when Trump sought to ban the app. Trump’s action was widely seen as politically motivated, linked to his hard-line approach to China.Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin oversaw an agreement under which ByteDance would sell its American assets to the Oracle-led group, but the sale has been delayed after the Chinese company scored a series of legal victories.As those discussions continue, the Biden administration asked a federal judge in Washington on Wednesday to put on hold the litigation over a ban on TikTok that began during the Trump administration.The government “plans to conduct an evaluation of the underlying record justifying those prohibitions,” the Biden administration said in a court filing. “A review of the prohibitions at issue here may narrow the issues presented or eliminate the need for this Court’s review entirely.”Citing U.S. national security concerns, the Trump administration ordered in August that the popular video-sharing app be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the U.S.The Trump administration argued that Americans’ private data gathered through the app -- which has been downloaded more than 100 million times in the U.S. -- could be siphoned off to the authoritarian regime in China, something TikTok has said it would never do.TikTok has filed multiple legal challenges against the government’s effort to ban its app, and several judges blocked the ban from taking effect.Trump gave his blessing in mid-September to a preliminary plan in which ByteDance would sell part of TikTok to Oracle, Walmart and U.S. investors Sequoia Capital, KKR & Co. and General Atlantic, creating a new independent company called TikTok Global.But that deal, quickly overshadowed by the U.S. election and rising Covid-19 cases, was never finalized.

2021-02-10,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. is in talks with U.S. regulators to address potential security concerns over data sharing as the company looks to avoid a repeat of the political firestorm last summer when it became a target of former President Donald Trump.President Joe Biden’s administration is “comprehensively evaluating” risks to U.S. data from companies such as TikTok “and will address them in a decisive and effective fashion,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday during a briefing at the White House.As discussions continue, the Biden administration asked a federal judge in Washington on Wednesday to put on hold the litigation over a ban on TikTok that was pursued by Trump.The government “plans to conduct an evaluation of the underlying record justifying those prohibitions,” the Biden administration said in a court filing. “A review of the prohibitions at issue here may narrow the issues presented or eliminate the need for this Court’s review entirely.”ByteDance representatives are speaking with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, over security guarantees surrounding the company’s data, concerns about its source code and other matters related to TikTok’s operations in the U.S, according to the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

But that deal, quickly overshadowed by the U.S. election and rising Covid-19 cases, was never finalized.The people said the Biden administration is taking its time reviewing the Trump administration’s China moves and deciding which need to be addressed immediately, and hasn’t ruled out any steps. Dow Jones reported earlier Wednesday that the Biden administration had shelved the deal indefinitely.TikTok has filed multiple legal challenges against the government’s effort to ban its app, and several judges blocked the ban from taking effect.

Also, the prospects for a private-equity giant, an engineering company, bank stocks, business development companies and more. Cover story ""Oracle Is Turning Into a Cloud Giant. Why Its Stock Is a Buy"" by Eric J. Savitz discusses how a new giant is starting to flex its muscles in cloud computing, and it isn't some upstart. See why Barron's claims that enterprise software company Oracle Corporation (NYSE: VZ) has been undergoing a Microsoft-like reinvention, and why that makes the stock a buy. Avi Salzman's ""Texas Looks to Rebuild.

2021-02-26,"Although I am not an expert in artificial intelligence, I know enough about technology to like C3.ai (NYSE:AI). It’s in the right sector and it serves a wide addressable market. It is not industry-specific, meaning they could expand into where ever demand takes them. The only requisite is that they continue executing well to grow. AI stock should have better days ahead, and is worth some risk. Source: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com Before we go all in on a speculative stock like this, we should set the stage. It was a bloodbath on Wall Street Thursday so it’s not ideal to take risky bets. AI is still in its early stages, therefore still needs to prove itself. If great companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) are falling off cliffs, I should be leery of spec bets. I don’t mean to insult the company by labeling it as such. It’s a stage that most new stocks have to go through. Investors usually require proof or time to develop courage. Unfortunately, often they get too enthusiastic, like taking AI stock to $184 per share. That was a 3.5 time increase from its IPO price in 10 days. Easy come, easy go, as they say, so those who chased late have suffered heavy losses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AI Stock Is Down But Not Out Source: Charts by TradingView AI stock has fallen more than 30% since earlier this month. The temptation is to want to call a bottom but we shouldn’t. The proper frame for a new investor now would be to first admit it’s a bet. Bets are fine as long as we acknowledge they carry higher levels of risk. If the assumption is that it’s near a bottom, then we take a small bite. It is important that investors set the maximum size of the risk in advance. It’s even more important to stick to it. For example, if I decide that I am comfortable risking $1,000 (random value for illustrative purposes), I should not add to that later. This is to say that I do not average down in a young stock. AI is not a child company and it has great pedigree. Tom Siebel founded it more than a decade ago. We know what he can do from his days at Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Siebel Systems. Odds are that he will do well with AI, too. The bottom line is simple. AI stock is too young to buy with high conviction. But it is in the right industry and has great leadership so it is worth a risk. Trends Suggest Exponential Growth in the Industry The pandemic put the digital revolution into ultra-high gear. Corporations everywhere are rushing to get as high tech as they can. Humans can manage the systems but they will need to use AI to do it efficiently. Speed is of the essence and our brains cannot compete with computers. So not only is AI industry-agnostic, but within companies there will be demand from almost every department. From maintenance to risk management and to client relationship. Companies will need the help of computer decision making on the fly. Eventually it comes to valuation, and this is where it gets tricky. So far we’ve made the slam-dunk argument for the market viability. We’ve also established that this team is up to the task. Next comes the question of worth. The experts on Wall Street have split opinions about it. Their price targets range from $84 to $200 and the average is $140 per share. Their ratings are also as bifurcated. Therefore, I would ignore all of their opinions and form my own. Source: Charts By Yahoo Finance In a bullish market I like taking a little risk on such a young stock opportunity. The traditional fundamental metrics are too messy to judge now, so there will be a leap of faith. Whatever my total risk intent is for this, I would only take one third now. This leaves room to add on dips. This is different than averaging down because I would have held back on my risk size. It is important to not increase the risk size without new evidence from the company. The stock market as a whole is too high and on shaky fundamentals. If that corrects, it will drag AI stock with it. On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2021-02-27,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will consider whether to declare unconstitutional a system that technology companies, including Apple Inc. and Google Inc., have used to invalidate hundreds of patents and head off litigation.In an argument at the intersection of intellectual property and the separation of powers, the justices on Monday will consider a challenge to a congressionally-created board that critics have dubbed a “death squad” because of its tendency to toss out patents.The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has invalidated more than 2,000 patents since it began work in 2012. Apple says it alone has used the board to successfully attack almost 200 patents, many held by entities interested only in filing lawsuits and extracting royalties. Congress set up the board, known as PTAB, in 2011 as a faster and cheaper alternative to litigation.But some smaller inventors see a chance to undercut the board, saying it’s become an anticompetitive tool for large companies.The case “has the potential to shut down the PTAB, if only for a moment until Congress can do something to get it back on course,” said Jim Carmichael, a former PTAB judge and now managing director of Carmichael IP. “For many inventors and patent owners, that’s a very exciting prospect.”At issue is whether more than 250 PTAB judges are serving in violation of the Constitution. The federal appeals court that handles most patent disputes said the judges have important enough powers that they need to be appointed directly by the president.Should the Supreme Court agree, it could go as far as barring the board from continuing to review and invalidate patents. The justices could also issue a more limited ruling that would strip the judges of their job protections but leave the board’s powers intact. Either way, a decision against the board could mean that hundreds of cases would have to be reconsidered.Constitutional FightThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the judges are “principal officers,” a constitutional category that requires presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. The court said it reached that conclusion in part because patent judges’ decisions, typically issued by three-person panels, aren’t subject to review by a presidentially appointed official at the agency.The Justice Department is urging the Supreme Court to leave the system in place, saying patent judges are “inferior officers,” who the Constitution says don’t have be presidential appointees. In a brief filed before leaving office, President Donald Trump’s administration said the Patent & Trademark Office director and the Commerce secretary together have broad control over the work of the judges. Among other tools, the patent office director can decide which judges sit on a review panel.The Supreme Court said in a 1997 case involving Coast Guard judges that inferior officers are people “whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.”The case before the justices involves an Arthrex Inc. surgical device patent invalidated by PTAB after a challenge by Smith & Nephew Plc. The court has deferred action in dozens of other cases likely to be affected by its ruling.Technology CompaniesApple, the single biggest user of the review boards, filed a brief backing Arthrex. The iPhone maker said it relies “on Congress’s promise of a fair and efficient forum to challenge what often prove to be woefully weak patents that should not have issued in the first instance.”Other companies backing PTAB include Intel Corp. and an alliance whose members include Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.A group describing itself as “39 aggrieved inventors” said intellectual property rights are “under attack by large corporations that are motivated to devalue patents and quell competition.”“There is no place for overlooking constitutional violations and contrived, convoluted administrative shortcuts when the future of small businesses and their owners’ livelihoods hang in the balance,” the group said.The drug industry is largely staying out of the fight, though a trade group for the generic-drug industry urged the court to preserve the PTAB.So many patents have been invalidated that it’s been called a “death squad,” a term coined by Randall Rader, the former chief judge of the Federal Circuit, which oversees all patent disputes in the country. The patent office has since altered its rules, giving patent owners a better shot at surviving the challenges.PTAB already survived one challenge at the Supreme Court. In 2018, justices found the panel wasn’t unconstitutionally wielding powers that belong to the courts.The court is scheduled to rule by late June. The lead case is U.S. v. Arthrex, 19-1434.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","‘Death Squad’ That Tossed 2,000 Patents Challenged at High Court"

2021-03-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc. dropped in extended trading after projecting its product revenue growth will slow in the current quarter and fiscal year.Product sales, which make up more than 90% of Snowflake’s revenue, will be $195 million to $200 million in the period ending in April, the San Mateo, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That would be a growth rate of as much as 96% over the period a year earlier, the company said, slowing from a pace of 116% in the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, estimated $194.8 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Snowflake projected annual product sales of as much as $1.02 billion, a growth rate of 84%, in line with analysts’ estimates. Shares dropped about 3% in extended trading.Investors have soured on the company that debuted in September with the biggest U.S. IPO of 2020, fearing the maker of data-warehouse software for the cloud is overvalued. The stock jumped 134% through the end of 2020, but has declined 12% so far this year.Snowflake’s software pulls information from multiple systems so clients can analyze it together in one place. The company competes against the cloud-computing divisions of Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., as well as open-source vendor Cloudera Inc. and database stalwart Oracle Corp. Snowflake has secured major deals with banks, including Capital One Financial Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.“While competition has so far had minimal impact on Snowflake’s growth, we believe that may change as smaller peers such as Databricks and hyperscale vendors launch new offerings,” Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note before the results were released.In the fiscal fourth quarter, total revenue increased 117% to $190.5 million, compared with analysts’ estimates of $178.6 million. The company reported its net loss widened to $199 million, or 70 cents a share, from $83.3 million, or $1.67, a year earlier.

2021-03-03,"(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has taken a nasty dip in recent weeks but some tech stocks are rallying -- just not the ones that have ridden on the waves of investor euphoria in recent years.Older technology companies peddling legacy products have rallied in the past two weeks as rising bond yields and an improving economy have prompted investors to sell shares of faster-growing companies like Salesforce.com and buy more profitable ones like HP Inc.HP, Xerox Holdings Corp. and Oracle Corp. have all advanced more than 8% since Feb. 19, making them the best performers in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. Salesforce, on the other hand, is the second-worst performer in the group with a decline of 16%. That trade was on display again Wednesday with the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index tumbling 2.9% while International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle advanced. The benchmark index is now trading at the lowest since Jan. 6.The rotation that’s taking place within the technology sector is a microcosm of what’s been playing out in the broader market for months as investors have poured money into smaller and cheaper companies that tend to outperform during economic recoveries.At the same time, higher Treasury yields make it harder to stomach paying up for companies whose abilities to generate comparable levels of profitability are uncertain or years in the future.“You don’t have to imagine everything going right for the Oracles of the world to make money,” said Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. “They are making money now.”Morgan Stanley said earlier this week that investors should look for bargains within less-loved sectors like technology hardware rather than bet on a broad advance for U.S. stocks, which have already priced in much of the expectations for earnings expansion and economic growth in 2021.“With index level upside limited, we think stock selection offers better return prospects,” strategists led by Mike Wilson wrote in a research note. The bank’s top picks for hardware include ATM maker NCR Corp. and data-storage company NetApp Inc.With the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries flirting with 1.5% on Wednesday, software makers Twilio Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. were among the biggest decliners, falling 7.6% and 8.4%, respectively. Twilio is priced at 26 times 2021 revenue projections, while Zoom trades at 26. Oracle, which rose 0.4% to a record of $66.91 on Wednesday, has a price to projected sales ratio of less than five times.Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Co., is a fan of value stocks but warned of pitfalls if companies like HP aren’t able to maintain profitability.“The worry of course is that those legacy companies maybe don’t have as bright of a future,” he said. “It’s really a cash-flow play and you hope that they can keep the cash flow in the future.”(Updates shares beginning in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Tech Wreck in Stocks Spares the Old Guard Like Oracle, HP"

2021-03-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. shares fell the most in almost a year Thursday after the company reported sales growth and gave an outlook for the current period that fell short of some projections.The world’s second-largest software maker said revenue increased 3% in the fiscal third quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales were flat, missing the company’s projections. The revenue forecast for the current period indicates a faster pace of growth isn’t on the way, said Anurag Rana, an analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.“I think investors may be disappointed by guidance of 1%-3% sales growth in constant currency next quarter, which is a slight improvement to the current quarter, but not substantial,” he said. “While cloud wins from SAP were impressive, total revenue is not accelerating at a material pace.”Executive Chairman Larry Ellison and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz have been trying to boost sales by turning to cloud-based software for services. Oracle said sales of its Fusion application for managing corporate finances climbed 30% in the period -- a slower growth rate than the 33% reported in the fiscal second quarter. Revenue from NetSuite’s financial software, targeted to small- and mid-sized businesses, rose 24%, after a 21% gain in the previous period.The shares fell as much as 9.3% to $65.43 in New York, bringing gains for this year to 2.7%.Ellison devoted much of a conference call after the results were announced to an attack on rival SAP SE, listing companies that have totally or partly switched to Oracle from the German software company’s products. He tallied more than 100 SAP customers who’ve made the move and said there are more. Oracle’s emphasis on new software and cloud services hasn’t yet spurred the kind of revenue increase anticipated by investors, who sent shares up 30% over the past month to a near record of $72.12 at Wednesday’s close.Small and medium-sized businesses and companies in industries most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic have restarted spending, according to a note from analysts at Cowen & Co., citing interviews with corporate sources. Still, Oracle was late to cloud computing and its services that compete with Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. lag behind in market share.“The enterprise software market is doing well,” Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., which owns Oracle shares, said before the results were released. “But it’s all about the cloud for Oracle. It’s about making that migration and Larry was really late doing that.”In the period ending in May, Oracle said profit, excluding some items, would be $1.28 to $1.32 a share. Analysts, on average, estimated $1.28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue will increase 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars, which would top analysts’ projections for 4% growth. Minus help from currency fluctuations, the sales increase will be 1% to 3%, Oracle said.In the fiscal third quarter, which ended Feb. 28, sales climbed to $10.1 billion, the Redwood Shores, California-based company said in a statement.

2021-03-11,"Over the past three months, shares of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) rose by 10.25%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Oracle has. Oracle's Debt According to the Oracle's most recent financial statement as reported on December 11, 2020, total debt is at $70.78 billion, with $63.53 billion in long-term debt and $7.25 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $28.00 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $42.78 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Oracle's $110.01 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.64. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-03-11,"Oracle announced better-than-expected 3Q results on Wednesday. However, shares of the cloud applications and platform services provider fell 5.3% in the extended trading session as 3Q revenue growth at constant currency fell short of management’s guidance range. Oracle (ORCL) posted revenues of $10.09 billion for 3Q, which came in ahead of the Street’s estimates of $10.07 billion. However, sales were flat on a constant currency basis and missed the company’s growth projection of 1%-3%. The company's adjusted EPS surged 20% to $1.16 year-over-year and topped the consensus estimates of $1.11. Additionally, Oracle announced that it has increased the share repurchase authorization by $20 billion. (See Oracle stock analysis on TipRanks) Furthermore, Oracle hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.32 per share, reflecting an annualized yield of approximately 1.8%. The newly declared dividend will be payable on Apr. 22 to shareholders of record as of Apr. 8. Ahead of the earnings release, Monness analyst Brian White reiterated his Buy rating and price target of $82 (13.7% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, White wrote, “We believe Oracle offers investors a high-quality, value play with the opportunity to capitalize on the company’s cloud transformation and increasingly attractive model.” Overall, the rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys, 7 Holds and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $72 implies downside potential of 0.2% to current levels. ORCL has gained about 48.5% over the past year.

2021-03-15,"The enterprise-software company announced lower-than-expected quarterly earnings guidance that managed to offset its strong results. Over four decades old Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) is generating anemic sales growth compared to cloud leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company is also often criticized for aggressive buybacks and not growing its core business instead. However, it has remained much more resilient than other aging tech giants like IBM (NYSE: IBM). Q3 figures Revenue for the fiscal third quarter that ended on February 28th was $10.09 billion. This is an increase of 3% from last year's quarter which is in line with the company's forecast of 2% to 4% growth. It also exceeded Street forecasts that averaged $10.07 billion. Adjusted profits increased 20% as they amounted to $1.16 a share. Slow and steady didn't win the cloud race Like its peers, Oracle saturated its core market over the past few decades and then that same market was disrupted by cloud-based services which were easier to scale than on-premise software. Microsoft managed to adapt to this new environment but even though Oracle's turnaround efforts were more successful than IBM's, its results are far less impressive than Microsoft's. Oracle's turnaround included two main strategies: it shifted its on-site database and enterprise software toward cloud-based services while aggressively acquiring other cloud-based companies to expand its ecosystem. Those efforts gradually paid off, and Oracle's revenue rose 2% YoY in the first half of fiscal 2021 which started last May as the growth of its cloud services offset the sluggishness of its on-premise business. Analysts expect its revenue to rise about 3% in both fiscal 2021 and 2022 as they are focusing on Oracle's core strengths. Stable operating margins Oracle's non-GAAP operating margin for 2020 was 44%, just as it was in 2019. During the first half of fiscal 2021, operating margin expanded from 42% to 46% YoY as operating expenses shrank 5%. Rising margins indicate both that Oracle isn't spending too much cash on its cloud-based transformation, and that it still enjoys plenty of pricing power in its competitive environment. Its buybacks were beneficial Oracle has been severely criticized for its aggressive buybacks that used up all of its free cash flow over the past year. But, this strategy was deployed to squeeze out EPS growth from its stagnant revenue. If we put the criticism aside, these well-timed buybacks are a refreshingly honest and effective strategy compared to what tech companies usually do which is use buybacks to offset dilution from stock-based bonuses. What Oracle managed to do through these buybacks is reduce its outstanding share count by nearly 42% over the past ten years. By contrast, IBM significantly reduced its buybacks over the past two years and it is still struggling with sliding revenue and profits. A comfortable cash cushion Oracle still has plenty of cash to deploy on investments, acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. Therefore, it is well-positioned to withstand the next economic downturn, as younger tech companies with more fragile balance sheets resort to secondary offerings and other tactics to stay afloat. In these uncertain times, this is a major strength. Outlook Oracle's stock price rallied 75% over the past half of a decade, and it did deliver a total return of about 90% after including reinvested dividends. Although these wins are pale when compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) triple-digit percentages during the same period, it may be a case of the tortoise versus the hare. So, just because Oracle isn't an ideal investment for growth-oriented investors does not mean it should be ignored. This article is not a press release and is contributed by IAMNewswire.

2021-03-22,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s largest travel app Yanolja Co. is in talks with banks to go public through a dual listing in Seoul and overseas, people with knowledge of the matter said, joining a growing cohort of startups seeking higher valuations abroad.The company is aiming for a value of more than $4 billion, one of the people said, confirming previous reports in Korean media.

The move comes after e-commerce champion Coupang Inc.’s successful debut on the New York Stock Exchange this month. Its valuation briefly pushed past $100 billion, affirming a belief at home that going public on bigger markets like the U.S. may produce higher valuations.“It is true that we are receiving various requests and offers related to an overseas listing,” Yanolja told Bloomberg News in a statement. “As it could be an opportunity to be recognized as a leading company that has capabilities to manage global business operations and solution technologies, we are open to reviewing an overseas listing along with a domestic IPO.”Recent high-profile startup exits, such as Woowa Brothers Corp.’s $4 billion sale to Delivery Hero SE and Match Group Inc.’s $1.7 billion takeover of Hyperconnect Inc., signaled growing interest among foreign investors in Korea’s tech sector.

2021-03-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s latest takeover targets have baffled some analysts and investors who are well aware of the company's spotty track record in consumer businesses and social media. What's the appeal, they wonder, in digital properties such as TikTok, Pinterest Inc. or now Discord Inc., a chat app that’s popular with gamers?The answer in Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella’s mind is clear. “Creation, creation, creation—the next 10 years is going to be as much about creation as it is about consumption and about the community around it, so it's not creating alone,” Nadella said in an interview last month. “If the last 10 years has been about consumption—we're shopping more, we're browsing more, we're binge watching more—there is creation behind every one of those. But I see that phenomenon being much more democratized.”For Nadella, the next decade of growth in cloud computing and internet use will be defined not by people watching and buying, but by those who are generating and exchanging their own content in different, thriving groups. Though he wasn’t referring specifically to acquisition strategy, his past purchases and current wish list illustrate that Nadella is eager to control some of the means of production.Seen in the context of Nadella’s philosophy about the next phase of cloud innovation, Microsoft’s talks with Discord and its other recent potential targets don’t seem out of band. Looking back to his first major deals when he took over at the software giant in 2014, there’s a clear through-line—from the gaming community building worlds and servers on Minecraft to the professional social network and corporate think-posts of LinkedIn to the open-source projects hosted and collaborated on software code-sharing platform GitHub. In the interview, Nadella cited GitHub and LinkedIn as prime examples of those content-creation communities he expects to feature more heavily in the future of the cloud.Discord, launched in 2015, has attracted more than 100 million monthly users with a free service that offers voice, video and text communications as well as gamer-friendly features, including the ability for users to broadcast the name of the game they are playing. The app became popular a few years ago, rising alongside smash multiplayer hits such as Epic Games Inc.’s Fortnite, and has long been a draw for celebrity gamers and social media influencers. Discord’s valuation soared to $7 billion last year, and people familiar with the talks said Microsoft was discussing a deal of more than $10 billion. Microsoft and Discord declined to comment.Social media, meanwhile, has become the virtual way to start a small business or become an entrepreneur from anywhere in the world. Social networks are also realizing the value of their biggest creators and their key role in fueling the parent company’s financial success, with companies from Snap Inc. to TikTok to Facebook Inc.’s Instagram pouring funds into promoting their stars and helping them make more money.For Microsoft, owning more creative communities is a chance to sell more cloud software and tools to the platform and its users. Discord specifically can also bolster Microsoft’s Xbox business, where the software maker is focusing more on getting gamers on subscriptions like Game Pass that they can use across consoles, PCs and mobile devices to access a library of titles. And as more young people grow up with operating systems, email, chat apps and productivity software from companies like Apple and Google, owning a community popular with that age group could acquaint them with Microsoft in a way their elders have been in the past because of Windows and Office.Still, adding Discord would go a step beyond the programmer and office-worker communities where Microsoft has played for decades. Discord may be a clearer fit in the same way the purchase of Minecraft was, leveraging Microsoft’s 20 years in console gaming and even longer tenure in personal computer games. There’s evidence that Nadella wants to take that step—last year, he was prepared to spend tens of billions of dollars to acquire the U.S. assets of ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, the viral video-sharing app heavily used by teenagers, also far outside Microsoft’s core software demographic. The company also approached social media platform Pinterest about a purchase. ByteDance chose to pursue a rival TikTok bid from a group led by Oracle Corp., and any talks with Pinterest, which has a market value of more than $44 billion, didn’t result in a deal.“Microsoft buying Discord would be a really strategic move—it shows that Microsoft understands the power of community in the context of the pandemic,” said Christophe Jammet, a managing director at Gather, an innovation consultancy. “While Discord has always been a persistent black sheep in the team/productivity comms space, it’s ubiquitous as a community platform for gamers and myriad sub-cultures.”Nadella’s focus on bringing new creator communities into the Microsoft fold brings with it twin regulatory risks, around antitrust and content moderation. As U.S. and EU regulators look more closely at the power and influence of big tech, none of the large companies could reasonably expect deals, particularly acquisitions of large content platforms, to pass without considerable scrutiny.There, at least, Microsoft has some experience, though less so on the content moderation side. Microsoft has had to keep offensive speech and harassment off platforms like Xbox Live and the Mixer game-streaming service it cancelled last year, but it hasn’t really been tested with the speed and volume of a large real-time social platform, where certain kinds of speech and programming could land Microsoft in hot water legally or with regulators. Mixer’s lackluster user numbers were part of why it shut down.Discord has already been required to confront the kind of content questions being reckoned with by bigger services, like Facebook, Google’s YouTube and Twitter Inc. Discord had to take action to ban Nazi content after white supremacists used the service to plan the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, riot where a counter-protestor was killed. Earlier this year, it banned WallStreetBets, the investment group famous for fueling stock rallies for GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., over hate speech. Discord restored the group after insisting it improve moderation practices.If Microsoft succeeds in buying the service, Nadella’s community strategy would get a big boost. To make it work, Microsoft will have to take on the difficult role of building up the communities it wants and shutting down the ones it doesn’t.

2021-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Uniphore Software Systems Pvt, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and improve customer support provided over the phone, raised $140 million to expand its services to areas such as video calls.The Series D round was led by Sorenson Capital Partners, with new investors including Cisco Investments and earlier backers such as March Capital Partners and Chiratae Ventures participating, the startup said in a statement. Uniphore, with its main offices in Chennai, India, and Palo Alto, California, has now raised a total $210 million.The company is targeting a niche in a cloud-based enterprise software industry led by Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. The coronavirus pandemic has been a boon for video and voice calls, and Uniphore’s software helps companies improve their service by, for example, detecting and predicting customers’ intent.“Because of the pandemic, people can’t get to their bank, shopping mall or doctor so customers reaching out online or via call centers quadrupled,” said Umesh Sachdev, co-founder and chief executive officer. “Labor-intensive contact centers couldn’t handle the deluge so AI and automation products like ours stepped in to fill the gap.”Sales tripled in the fiscal year ending March 2021 and the company is set to reach $100 million in annual subscription revenue, Sachdev said, speaking via video conference from Silicon Valley. The startup plans to double its headcount to about 600 in the fiscal year ending March 2022.Uniphore’s software listens in to customer-support conversations, helps detect what the caller wants and provides coaching to agents. Its applications help as many as 75,000 customer-service agents to handle about 160 million engagements every month. Customers such as NTT Data Corp. and WNS Holdings Ltd. typically pay an annual fee for its software.The company is conducting trials for AI technology that analyzes real-time video interactions. On a Zoom or WebEx video call with potential customers, a salesperson can use the software to detect which participant is disinterested or distracted. A human-resources executive can use the technology to analyze a candidate’s facial expressions during a job interview -- a controversial area that has faced criticism for potential flaws or bias.By 2023, 75% of companies providing customer-support outsourcing will adopt AI and analytics because such technologies reduce costs and provide competitive advantage, Tervinderjit Singh, an analyst at Gartner in Auckland, said in a January report.Sachdev, 35, founded Uniphore in 2008 with his engineering classmate Ravi Saraogi. Its existing backers include former Cisco CEO John Chambers, Analog Devices Inc. founder Ray Stata and Kris Gopalakrishnan, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Ltd.Uniphore is in early conversations about going public either via a direct listing or special purpose acquisition company. “Going public is a natural outcome and we are starting to look at doing it in the next couple of years,” Sachdev said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Uniphore Raises $140 Million to Expand AI to Video-Call Analysis
2021-04-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. co-founder Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital Group is moving into China, hiring former SoftBank Vision Fund partner Daisy Cai to help it hunt down promising startups.Cai will run a team of about 10 investment professionals initially from Hong Kong and focus on Chinese tech startups serving businesses in health care, financial services and transportation, among others. As general partner at B Capital, which Saverin founded with former Bain Capital executive Raj Ganguly in 2015, she’s tasked with helping expand the young venture house’s global footprint.As China cracks down on its consumer-internet giants, Cai -- one of the few women holding influential positions in a male-dominated venture capital industry -- will help deploy some of B Capital’s $1.9 billion of assets under management toward the country’s fast-emerging enterprise technology segment.“I see a tremendous opportunity for technology companies servicing enterprises as the digitalization theme is going to play out in large industries,” Cai said in an interview. “It’s very similar to what the U.S. has gone through in the past 20 years.”While Beijing’s clampdown is clouding the prospects for internet behemoths such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., U.S. regulators are reviving threats to toss China’s largest corporations off U.S. bourses. That’s compounding investor concerns over the future of China’s technology industry. At the same time, valuations for the largest startups such as ByteDance Ltd. are climbing as investors bet on a raft of impending mega-debuts.Yet B Capital’s founders, who also include American venture capitalist Howard Morgan, believe there is no better time to scout for upstarts that could become the Salesforce.com Inc. or Oracle Corp. of China. Of the 10 largest companies in the country, only Huawei Technologies Co. truly provides enterprise technology solutions, Ganguly said.“If the last two decades in China were about the rise of the consumer internet, the next two decades will be about digital transformation in traditional businesses,” he said. “We definitely take a long-term view on how technology is transforming these industries, regardless of geopolitics.”Born in Beijing, Cai held senior positions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Baidu Inc.’s investment arms before joining the SoftBank Vision Fund in 2020. A graduate of Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University, she got her first big break in investing when, as a design engineer at Advanced Micro Devices Inc., she found herself seated across from the U.S. chip giant’s chief technology officer at a company dinner. After listening to her views on a particular type of flash memory storage AMD wasn’t delving into at the the time, the CTO appointed Cai to help AMD on startup investing.“If we didn’t have that dinner or if I didn’t sit across him or didn’t have that conversation, I would probably still be very happy doing circuit design,” she said.Cai’s approach to China investing mirrors B Capital’s broad approach of shunning cash-guzzling consumer internet companies and betting on software startups serving companies in large, antiquated industries. The U.S. accounts for slightly more than half of B Capital’s global investment, while South and Southeast Asia, Latin America and Europe make up the rest.Besides entering China, the firm plans to continue investing in India and Indonesia, two of the fastest-growing technology hubs in Asia. In Indonesia, the company recently led a $20 million Series A round for e-commerce platform Ula and a $53 million Series B funding for personal finance platform Payfazz. It has also backed Khatabook and logistics startup BlackBuck, scooter and bike-sharing venture Bounce, delivery company Ninja Van and Bizongo, a B2B marketplace for packaging materials.Ninja Van’s Big-Ticket Funding Signals Startup Deal ResilienceThe firm said it closed a new $415 million fund to provide follow-on capital to late-stage companies in its portfolio.“What we’ve seen so far is just the beginning for an era of innovation in the region,” Saverin said. “What’s important to remember is not the venture capitalist like myself but the entrepreneurs and their teams who work tirelessly to solve very big problems.”(Updates with Cai’s comments from the eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Saverin’s Venture Firm Enters China With Ex-SoftBank Partner

Oracle accused Google of stealing Java and spending a decade over a lawsuit concerning the same that only a monopolist can afford. According to the company, such practices have triggered global regulatory investigations on Google’s business practices. The U.S. DOJ had filed antitrust litigation against Google in 2020 for alleged anticompetitive practices leading to search and advertising monopoly. A second case shortly followed the lawsuit. Google was slapped with similar charges in E.U. and India. Google’s advertising business recently attracted the U.S.’s attention, further stretching the previous probe. Google also recently faced an antitrust investigation for the cookie blocking feature of its Chrome browser.

Oracle inherited the technology from the $5.6 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems. Google sought the dismissal of the case.

Oracle had sought damages of almost $9bn (£6.5bn), with both sides framing the other as a powerful incumbent and themselves as fighting for underdog challengers. The database giant, which owns some components of Java through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009, sued Google the following year for patent and copyright infringement. However, Google argued that they had simply copied a ""method of operation"", similar to a Qwerty keyboard or a gear stick in a car, in order to let Android interface with Java, representing about 0.4pc of the code in the specific system at issue. Programming luminaries and open source software advocates hailed the decision as a victory for the ability of smaller competitors to build on widely-used code instead of starting from nothing.

2021-04-05,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Alphabet Inc.’s Google didn’t commit copyright infringement when it used Oracle Corp.’s programming code in the Android operating system, sparing Google from what could have been a multibillion-dollar award.The 6-2 ruling, which overturns a victory for Oracle, marks a climax to a decade-old case that divided Silicon Valley and promised to reshape the rules for the software industry. Oracle was seeking as much as $9 billion.Alphabet rose 4.2% as of 12:42 p.m. in New York. Oracle was up 4.0%.The court said Google engaged in legitimate “fair use” when it put key aspects of Oracle’s Java programming language in the Android operating system. Writing for the court, Justice Stephen Breyer said Google used “only what was needed to allow users to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program.”Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Justice Amy Coney Barrett didn’t take part in the case, which was argued before she joined the court.Each side contended the other’s position would undercut innovation. Oracle said that without strong copyright protection, companies would have less incentive to invest the large sums needed to create groundbreaking products.“The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater -- the barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower,” Oracle said after the ruling. “They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can. This behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google’s business practices.”Programming Short CutsGoogle called the decision “a victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science.”“The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,” Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker said in a statement.At issue were pre-written directions known as application program interfaces, or APIs, which provide instructions for such functions as connecting to the internet or accessing certain types of files. By using those shortcuts, programmers don’t have to write code from scratch for every function in their software, or change it for every type of device.Oracle said the Java APIs were freely available to those who wanted to build applications that run on computers and mobile devices. But Oracle said it required companies to get a license if they wanted to use the shortcuts for a competing platform or to embed them in an electronic device.The Supreme Court didn’t address whether the code was eligible for copyright protection, an early point of contention. Instead, Breyer said that for this case the court would “assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable.”That approach drew criticism from Thomas, who said in his dissenting opinion that the majority opinion is “wholly inconsistent with the substantial protection Congress gave to computer code.”Existential ThreatOracle said Google was facing an existential threat because its search engine -- the source of its advertising revenue -- wasn’t being used on smartphones. Google bought the Android mobile operating system in 2005 and copied Java code to attract developers but refused to take a license, Oracle contended.Thomas said that Google’s actions had a “disastrous effect on Oracle’s potential market” in the smartphone and wireless industry. Before Android, Amazon.com Inc. paid Oracle to embed the Java platform in its Kindle devices but later demanded a 97.5% discount on its license fee with Oracle after Android came out. Samsung Electronics Co.’s contract with Oracle dropped from $40 million to about $1 million, and Oracle wasn’t able to sign other contracts, he said.Google “made tens of billions of dollars, and established its position as the owner of the largest mobile operating system in the world,” Thomas wrote. “Despite this, the majority holds that this copying was fair use.”Breyer said that, though Google copied 11,500 lines of code, Google engineers wrote millions more.“Google, through Android, provided a new collection of tasks operating in a distinct and different computing environment,” Breyer wrote. “Those tasks were carried out through the use of new implementing code (that Google wrote) designed to operate within that new environment.”Divided CompaniesThe ruling is “the biggest copyright decision in a generation,” said copyright lawyer J. Michael Keyes of Dorsey & Whitney, who wasn’t involved in the case. The decision could lead to more disputes over software, and “we will see more copying, more cases, and more claims of fair use.”Tech companies including Mozilla Corp., Microsoft Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. supported Google. Media and entertainment businesses, which rely on strong copyright standards, backed Oracle, as did the Trump administration when the case was argued in October.The Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Google, called the ruling “a win for interoperability, copyright principles and the future of innovation.”“The high court’s decision that fair use extends to the functional principles of computer code means companies can offer competing, interoperable products,” CCIA President Matt Schruers said in a statement.Oracle initially sued Google for copyright infringement in 2010. Since then, the case has worked its way up and down the legal system, spurring two jury trials and numerous appeals. The now-overturned appeals court decision had reversed a jury finding that Google’s copying was a legitimate fair use.The case is Google v.

2021-04-06,"(Bloomberg) -- KKR-backed OneStream Software, a maker of programs for chief financial officers, raised $200 million in a funding round that values the company at $6 billion.The round was led by D1 Capital Partners and included investments by Tiger Global and Investment Group of Santa Barbara. OneStream plans to be ready for a public share sale next year, although actual timing may vary based on market conditions, Chief Financial Officer Bill Koefoed said in an interview. The Rochester, Michigan-based software maker had sales of $130 million in 2019 and hasn’t disclosed more recent revenue. It has been shifting customers to subscriptions that generate a regular sales stream — annual recurring revenue has doubled in the quarter that just ended and totals about $150 million, Koefoed said. The company sells software that helps a CFO’s office report financial information to regulators and investors, as well as manage financial and operational planning. Customers include United Parcel Service Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Capital One Financial Corp. It competes with Oracle Corp., SAP SE, Anaplan Inc. and Blackline Inc.The company, which was founded in 2010, is trying to help CFOs have a more up-to-date view of their numbers, moving from an earlier world where figures got tallied once a month to today’s goal of real-time information. The pandemic has made companies realize they can’t rely on planning that’s rapidly obsolete, OneStream Chief Executive Officer Tom Shea said. In the most recent quarter, bookings rose 200%, the company said. “What happened when the pandemic hit is anybody that was running a business realized their plans were pretty much garbage,” Shea said. “You had no idea what demand looked like, you didn't know if someone was going to pay you. The first thing that happened on, let’s call it March 9 of last year, is everybody started to realize that those that had invested in tools and had the information they needed to understand where they were at that moment — they were OK, and those that didn’t realized that they needed to invest.”The company, which KKR took a majority stake in two years ago, plans to use the funds to fuel research and development in the product and its expansion into the Asia Pacific region, Shea said.

2021-04-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. Executive Chairman Larry Ellison has spent the better part of a decade waging battle in U.S. courts and forging political alliances in Washington to win lucrative business and thwart adversaries.It’s all part of a high-stakes gamble to revive Oracle’s anemic revenue growth, which has averaged about 1% a year since 2012, and regain relevance in the face of a widening phalanx of upstarts eroding the company’s dominance in the business software market.Ellison’s effort suffered a stinging setback last week when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found Alphabet Inc.’s Google legitimately used Oracle-owned Java software to develop the Android mobile operating system. The ruling capped a 10-year lawsuit and blocked a $9 billion windfall to Oracle. It followed earlier stalled efforts to secure a military contract worth $10 billion and a potentially lucrative cloud deal with social media marvel TikTok.The trio of defeats underscore the limits of a strategy that relied on Oracle’s ties to the Trump White House and other politicians and ratchet up the pressure on Ellison and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz to find ways to keep the existing product lineup vital.“They’re just throwing everything against the wall at this point to see what sticks,” said Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. But to improve its fortunes, Oracle will have to focus on the fundamentals of its software business. “The big issue for them is how to revive growth and it does not look like much is happening on that front,” he added.Despite its sprawling product lineup of software, services and data-center hardware, Oracle is simple to understand. At the end of the 1970s, Ellison pioneered a new way of storing and processing information – the Oracle relational database. The program vaulted the company to the forefront of the technology industry. Ever since, he has sought to protect and expand the lucrative business that counts spy agencies, government departments and some of the world’s largest corporations as clients.Database is KingThis emphasis on his foundational product, the database, blinded Ellison to the full implications of the shift to cloud computing that has been under way for two decades. Database customers traditionally kept and managed the product on their corporate computer servers, and paid customer-support fees to Oracle each year. Those maintenance costs sometimes had a profit margin of more than 90% for the software maker, a former executive said. A shift to the cloud -- where companies rent space in powerful servers to store and process information over the internet -- meant sacrificing a good chunk of existing revenue and profit, at least in the short-term.Two of the deals Oracle sought -- with the Pentagon and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok -- would have generated billions in revenue and made the company, almost overnight, a viable competitor in providing those cloud services with market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.Still, investors appear sanguine as the company cranks out profits and dividends. Oracle shares gained 22% in 2020 and increased another 17% this year to a record $75.58 at Friday’s close.For years Ellison, who is now worth about $89 billion, stayed away from politics, describing himself as politically “dispassionate” and a “centrist.” He supported Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1990s. One of the issues he cares most about is economic growth, which is good for his business.Like many government contractors, Oracle has regularly lobbied for intellectual property protections and a strong national defense. But as the company faced growing business challenges in the past decade, it began using political levers to undercut competitors.In 2008, Charles Phillips, then one of Oracle’s presidents and its most senior Black executive, supported Democratic U.S. Senator Barack Obama in his presidential campaign against Republican Senator John McCain. Phillips held a fund-raiser for Obama at a hotel, and while some Oracle employees attended, Ellison and Catz weren’t among them, a person familiar with the situation said. Catz had long been politically conservative, two people said.Obama’s election coincided with a changing technology landscape. Companies that had become centers of power from selling complex tech systems -- Oracle, International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. -- were displaced in prominence by internet companies such as Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon. Oracle wasn’t close to the Obama administration like those at Google, for example, who had 363 meetings at the White House from Obama’s inauguration to October 2015, according to administration records.Back into the ActionAfter years on the sidelines in Obama’s Washington, Ellison and Catz took a keen interest in the 2016 presidential race. Both supported Republican Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, whom Ellison later described in a Fox Business interview as a “centrist.” Ellison gave $4 million to a political action committee backing Rubio. But when Donald Trump won the Republican nomination, the executives quickly got on board.Catz led the effort to build a closer relationship with Trump. The month after the presidential election, Catz made a pilgrimage to Trump Tower with Oracle executives including Ed Screven, the company’s chief technology architect, and her deputies Douglas Kehring and Ken Glueck, the lobbying head. Catz then joined the president-elect’s transition committee.During the former president’s tenure, Catz visited the White House to attend meetings and privately dined with the president alongside Peter Thiel, the billionaire Palantir Technologies Inc. co-founder who was Trump’s most prominent Silicon Valley backer in 2016. At that dinner, Catz criticized the selection process for a pending Pentagon cloud contract worth $10 billion, which Oracle wanted.The contract, called Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, was a decade-long opportunity to provide public cloud services for the U.S. military. For Oracle, whose cloud service has been so unpopular that it was called “niche” by industry analyst Gartner Inc., the deal could have helped it begin to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft. The two cloud leaders were also vying for the contract as was Google, which later dropped out of the bidding after employees protested the company doing military work.Catz found the opportunity so tantalizing that she told her staff they would need to take an all-hands-on-deck approach to winning the procurement process, people familiar with the situation said.The problem was that Oracle didn’t have the technology requirements to be eligible for the deal. It was eliminated from consideration in 2019. The company later sued and appealed, but to no avail. It lost its last appeal in September.The only victory was schadenfreude. Oracle waged a campaign to cast aspersions on the fairness of the process, and alleged that some Pentagon officials were biased in Amazon’s favor because they previously worked there. In the end, Amazon Web Services, which was widely seen as the front-runner for the deal, lost out to Microsoft. But even that result isn’t final. The Pentagon said last month it may decide to drop the contract if litigation pursued by Amazon -- alleging it lost the deal because of Trump’s opposition -- proceeds.While Oracle’s links to Trump didn’t secure the JEDI contract, Amazon became a mutual enemy for both for the duration of his presidency. Amazon has moved into Oracle’s territory in databases, transitioned from using Oracle’s products and has been targeted for criticism by Ellison in public appearances. He has slammed the cloud leader’s technology, saying it’s unsophisticated and overpriced.To further burnish his ties to Trump, Ellison let the then-president host a re-election fundraiser just before the coronavirus hit at Ellison’s estate in Rancho Mirage, California, which features a golf course. Trump called Ellison “a tremendous guy” and Oracle a “great company,” while Ellison praised Trump’s handling of the economy.Making a SplashThen, TikTok -- a video-streaming company with huge computer processing needs -- came into play.Trump went after TikTok last August, saying the Chinese-owned app known for dance crazes and lip-syncs posed a national security threat and must be sold. Microsoft publicly made a purchase offer, but General Atlantic, a TikTok investor, reached out to Ellison, a person familiar with the situation said, knowing he had cultivated close ties with Trump and hoping he had the standing to pull off a deal.Ellison recognized that ByteDance, TikTok’s owner, wanted to keep a piece of its crown jewel, and unlike Microsoft, he didn’t want full ownership of the video app. ByteDance had been considering some form of a corporate reconfiguration for its U.S. assets to allay American government concerns and Oracle convinced ByteDance it could get Trump to back that type of arrangement.Through personal conversations with ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming and Trump, Ellison persuaded TikTok to agree to a shotgun wedding under threat of being banned from the U.S. A preliminary deal announced in September and blessed by Trump named Oracle as TikTok’s technology partner. The software company planned to provide cloud services to the video-sharing app and protect the data of its U.S. users. Oracle also was set to take a 12.5% stake in a new U.S. entity formed by China-based ByteDance, but would have had no role running the new company.Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said at the time that it could have been “quite valuable to Oracle,” providing “revenue at a nice profit margin, plus all of the credibility of being not only a core cloud provider for Zoom, but also for TikTok.”But Oracle’s ally Trump lost his re-election bid against former Vice President Joe Biden. In the waning days of the administration, Trump lost interest in his battle against TikTok, instead focusing his attention on his doomed effort to overturn the election results.TikTok never signed a final agreement and the deal remains stuck in limbo while the Biden administration conducts a review. There is no indication TikTok’s Chinese owner will be forced to go through with the sale.In the time since, Oracle’s effort to restore its relevance has seen another setback. The company announced tepid financial results in March, highlighting its inability to break out of its sales-growth rut.Ellison spent much of the earnings call tearing into fellow enterprise technology titan SAP SE, listing companies that have switched to Oracle from the German company.One name he didn’t mention was Google, which said April 5, the day the Supreme Court rendered its verdict, that it would abandon Oracle’s financial software and move to SAP.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle’s Years-Long Washington Offense Ends in Trio of Defeats

2021-04-25,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd.’s plans for an initial public offering have been put on hold as it seeks to comply with regulatory demands from both China and the U.S., the South China Morning Post reported, citing unidentified sources.The owner of China’s most popular video app Douyin faces difficulties in finding a business structure that can please both Beijing and Washington, the SCMP report said. One major challenge lies in separating Douyin’s China-based operations from TikTok’s global ones given both apps share the same algorithm, according to one of the sources in the report.An unnamed Beijing-based government official involved in regulating ByteDance said the IPO had to be postponed because of tensions between the U.S. and China, the newspaper said. ByteDance and TikTok declined to comment to the SCMP.Following weeks of speculation that a public offering was getting closer, the world’s most valuable startup said on Friday it currently has no plans to seek an IPO, adding that it had made a careful study and concluded it doesn’t meet listing conditions for the time being. Beijing-based ByteDance had been working with advisers on a float of some of its flagship domestic assets such as Douyin, news aggregator Toutiao and video platform Xigua that could raise billions, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.The company last month hired its first chief financial officer -- Chew Shou Zi, who oversaw Xiaomi Corp.’s IPO as finance chief more than two years ago. The appointment fueled speculation over the social media giant’s plans to go public. Its value has soared in recent weeks, with shares changing hands in the secondary market at a valuation of more than $250 billion.Video-sharing app TikTok, which is hugely popular in the U.S., has been a source of tension between the world’s two biggest economies, with Washington claiming it’s a potential security threat if the app is used for propaganda or if the Chinese government uses collected data to create profiles of Americans.Former U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to ban U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok but that effort foundered in the courts. ByteDance was also under pressure to sell its U.S. operations and it struck a deal with American companies including Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. last year.

2021-04-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said it will open an engineering hub in North Carolina, marking its first major campus on the U.S. East Coast as part of an increased commitment to investing domestically.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant said Monday it will spend $1 billion in the area around Raleigh Durham and Chapel Hill, known as the Research Triangle and home to other big companies that have a significant presence there including IBM, Cisco Systems Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Apple said it will create 3,000 jobs at the new site in machine learning, artificial intelligence and software engineering.Apple joins other tech peers in expanding beyond West Coast headquarters to take advantage of more diverse work forces and investment incentives. In 2019 Apple broke ground on a second, $1 billion-campus in Austin that could eventually house 15,000 employees. Apple said staff could start moving in next year. Facebook Inc., Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc. and Oracle Corp., have also been drawn to the Texas city, while Amazon.com Inc. is building a second headquarters in Northern Virginia and has also been expanding in New York.Apple’s announcement comes as part of the iPhone maker’s planned 20% increase in U.S. investments over the next five years, allocating $430 billion in direct spending on U.S.-based suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the U.S., and other projects, including dozens of Apple TV+ productions and research and development on technologies like custom silicon and 5G. The effort will result in 20,000 new jobs, including in San Diego, Los Angeles, Boulder, Colorado, and Boston by 2026, the company said in a statement Monday.“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to U.S. innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.Apple’s rapid expansion comes as the pandemic and other forces such as lower cost of living elsewhere make Silicon Valley less appealing for engineering talent. Apple’s main campuses are The Apple Park and the Infinite Loop, about 40 miles south of San Francisco.The moves show that Apple is willing to go to where the talent lives and where the cost of doing business is cheaper. Los Angeles is a hub for entertainment, San Diego is home to many chip and wireless networking experts, while the Raleigh-Durham area has established itself as a major U.S. technology research hub. Before Apple settled on Austin for its 2019 expansion, North Carolina pushed hard for an Apple campus by offering tax breaks.Over the past three years, Apple’s investments have outpaced its original five-year goal of $350 billion set in 2018, the company said. But Apple has also been growing. Its shares have gained about 200% since the last investment plan was announced in January 2018, and the company is now worth more than $2 trillion. Apple said it’s also the U.S.’s biggest taxpayer, having shelled out $45 billion in domestic corporate income taxes in the past five years.Increasing investment in the U.S. also comes as President Joe Biden has announced new plans to boost taxes on overseas profits to help foot the bill for domestic infrastructure projects. Apple and other big tech companies disclosed more than $100 billion in profit outside the U.S. in their last fiscal years, making them prime targets of the president’s proposal.Apple is on track to meet its 2018 goal of creating 20,000 new jobs in the U.S. by 2023, the company said. The new commitment will include growing its San Diego team to more than 5,000 employees by 2026, a 500% increase from its 2018 goal. Apple is also boosting its engineering team in Boulder, Colorado, by 700 people and adding hundreds of jobs in Massachusetts, Washington, Iowa and Colorado. As it grows, Apple said it’s committed to doing so in an environmentally sustainable way. Almost 60 of Apple’s U.S. sites are LEED certified, the company said. Apple said it’s carbon neutral for all of its operations in the U.S. and around the world, and last year committed to be 100% carbon neutral for its entire supply chain and products by 2030.Apple’s shares were little changed at $134.94 at 3:14 p.m. in New York.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Pledges $1 Billion for New North Carolina Engineering Hub

2021-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. temporarily suspended an Oracle Corp. executive from posting after he used the social network to publicize the email and Signal phone number of a journalist whose reporting he found objectionable.Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck posted the information about the Intercept’s Mara Hvistendahl as part of a debate over her story claiming Chinese resellers are distributing Oracle technology to government entities building China’s surveillance systems. Glueck posted a lengthy rebuttal to the piece, in which he asked anyone with information about the reporter to contact him via email.When Hvistendahl tweeted Glueck’s request for information about her and the email account he provided in it, he responded with a Tweet sharing her email and a Signal phone number for her, according to a report by Gizmodo. Twitter has since blocked the tweet, saying the post broke its rules against sharing personal information, a practice called doxxing that is often used to encourage harassment.“Mara published my email address first thing this morning. I responded with her tip-line Signal and Protonmail (the same one she tweets regularly),” Glueck wrote Wednesday in an emailed response. “She reported it as a violation, I didn’t really care enough to report her back. The facts speak for themselves.”Twitter said Glueck’s account is banned from posting until he deletes the offending tweet, then is subject to a 12-hour time-out period.Hvistendahl said she didn’t report Glueck’s tweet.“Ken Glueck has published two lengthy blog posts that attack me, but Oracle has not refuted my central finding, which is that the company marketed its analytics software for use by police in China,” Hvistendahl said via email. “With both of my stories, The Intercept published a contact box seeking tips from people with knowledge of Oracle’s work in China and elsewhere.

2021-05-04,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok, the popular short-video app, named ByteDance Ltd. Chief Financial Officer Shouzi Chew as chief executive officer, filling the top leadership position after the departure of Kevin Mayer last year. Vanessa Pappas, who has served as interim head, was named chief operating officer.Chew, who joined TikTok parent ByteDance last month, will remain in his post at the Chinese company, according to a statement Friday. Previously, Chew spent several years as CFO and international business president of Xiaomi Corp., where he took the gadget maker public in one of the largest-ever Chinese tech listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.Chew, who hails from Singapore, is fluent in English and Chinese. He’s experienced in navigating the halls of Chinese tech companies and the boardrooms of banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he spent time in its investment banking unit. He also previously worked for Yuri Milner’s DST Global. The move to hire Chew is a sign ByteDance is moving toward an initial public offering of some of its businesses.TikTok is still enjoying explosive popularity, but Chew will have to navigate the political tensions between the U.S. and China as well as increasing concerns about data privacy, especially involving children who populate the app.“The leadership team of Shou and Vanessa sets the stage for sustained growth,” ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming said in the statement. “Shou brings deep knowledge of the company and industry, having led a team that was among our earliest investors, and having worked in the technology sector for a decade. He will add depth to the team, focusing on areas including corporate governance and long-term business initiatives.”Pappas will maintain her current responsibilities, including managing TikTok’s key operations, the company said.To listen to the Foundering podast season about TikTok on Spotify click here:Mayer had left one of the top jobs at Walt Disney Co. last year to lead TikTok, which has become one of the world’s hottest apps with more than 100 million users in the U.S. alone. He departed only a few months later after former U.S. President Donald Trump ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok in the U.S. or face a ban, citing national security concerns over its Chinese ownership.Zhang had discussed deals with a number of U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. but ultimately decided to wait out the crisis, anticipating less hostility after the presidential election. TikTok never signed a final agreement, and the deal remains stuck in limbo while the Biden administration conducts a review. There is no indication ByteDance will be forced to go through with the sale.Read more about TikTok’s algorithm: TikTok’s Hit Machine Is Crafted to Make Select Songs Go ViralTikTok’s success is driven by a powerful algorithm that predicts what people want to see next. The app goes beyond even the systems used by Facebook Inc. or Snapchat. TikTok studies usage closely and considers hundreds of data points including what websites people browse and how they type, down to keystroke rhythms and patterns.It’s this mountain of data, collected from a largely young user base, that underpinned the Trump administration’s concerns over what might happen if the information fell into the hands of the Chinese government, something TikTok has said it would never hand over.In 2019, ByteDance was fined $5.7 million by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that Musical.ly, which ByteDance bought and folded into TikTok, illegally collected information from minors. It was the largest FTC penalty in a children’s privacy case at the time.

2021-05-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Ampere Computing, a startup aiming to make a dent in Intel Corp.’s dominance of the lucrative server chip market, said it has signed up big customers including Microsoft Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. and has a new design on the way.Microsoft Azure, Tencent Cloud, and TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd. are among those using Ampere’s Altra processors, according to founder and Chief Executive Officer Renee James. The former Intel executive says she has other large customers too.Beginning next year, Ampere will offer a new chip that features processor cores designed in house, James said. That’ll help the company tailor its products to the needs of hyperscalers, providers of computing over the internet, who build giant data centers to meet the growing need for cloud services. Ampere’s current products use cores licensed from SoftBank Group Corp.’s Arm Ltd. The new chips will retain software compatibility with that technology, she said.Ampere’s announcement raises its prominence in the race to provide the backbone of new systems being built to run artificial intelligence software that can make sense of the increasing flood of data created by smartphone and internet traffic. The Santa Clara, California-based company, backed by an investment from Oracle Corp., is one of a group of companies trying to shake Intel’s hold on a market where individual chips can sell for as much as the price of a compact car.To read more about Ampere: Startup Ampere Offers Server Processor With Huge Core CountSo far, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., run by the only other female leader of a chip company, Lisa Su, is the only one to show significant gains against Intel, which until recently had a market share of more than 99%. Ampere and internal efforts by Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS are leading the push to bring Arm technology, which is pervasive in smartphone silicon, to more powerful computer systems.Proponents of that approach argue that scaling up mobile chips results in much more efficient solutions. The amount of computing that can be crammed into an individual data center is increasingly running up against the limits of electricity available to power and cool servers, with processors being one of the major sources of demand for energy.Ampere claimed its current products beat the best offerings from Intel and AMD in performance and efficiency, in an online presentation given early Wednesday. Those companies design chips for a broad range of uses, which makes them less effective in cloud computing James said.“We can do things faster and move forward better than the broad-based approach,” she said. “Customers wait for no man. You have to move forward on a pretty specific cadence.”Ampere is using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to outsource its production and the chips coming next year will be made with 5-nanometer technology. Ampere is generating revenue from its products now and has secured enough financial backing to be able to self-fund development of future generations of chips, James said.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Ampere Says Microsoft, Tencent Are Customers, Unveils New Design"
2021-05-19,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s technology sector has had breakout successes in e-commerce, social media and smartphones. Venture capitalist Peter Cheng is betting the next big opportunity will be in enterprise software, with local alternatives to the likes of Oracle Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc.His Eminence Ventures has raised $120 million for its second fund, with backing from Silicon Valley’s Emergence Capital and Hong Kong’s Unicorn Capital Partners. Eminence, founded in 2017, has fully invested its first fund -- $37 million raised from dozens of individual investors.Cheng’s experience in the corporate software sector dates back 25 years to a stint at Oracle, followed by jobs at eBay Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. That helped convince him the sole focus for his venture firm should be startups aspiring to be the next Salesforce or Zoom Video Communications Inc. for China, a nascent $12 billion arena. Some of his startups have already seen their valuations balloon after receiving money from larger venture firms like Sequoia and Temasek, as well as Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co.“If you keep looking at a sector again and again, when the right deal comes along, you know it’s the right one,” the 51-year-old Cheng said in a video interview from his offices in Shanghai.Jason Green, founding partner of Emergence Capital, said Cheng is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the startup opportunities in China. Emergence has also seen the potential in corporate software, hitting the jackpot with an investment in Zoom as its business exploded during the Covid-19 lockdowns.“In China, like in the U.S. over the last 15 years, we’re going to see massive shifts into the cloud for enterprises,” said Green. “Like me, Peter is very much focused on wanting to be the world’s best in early-stage enterprise.”Green said his firm will seek to co-invest in Chinese cloud services startups with Eminence Ventures.China’s enterprise software-as-a-service market is expected to grow around 40% annually over the next five years and reach $40 billion in revenue in 2025, according to estimates by JPMorgan. Cloud services are among the fastest-growing businesses for giants like Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., while up-and-comers like Tuya Inc. and Agora Inc. have in recent years raised billions in U.S. listings.But the world’s largest internet market has yet to create its own Zoom, which in less than a decade has grown into a $2.7 billion business that supplies the go-to communication software for nearly half a million businesses around the world.Cheng aims to change that. Eminence Ventures invested its first fund in 17 startups focused on a wide range of enterprise software. None of these outfits has been written down, and his biggest hit is eSign, which provides electronic signature services to business and government clients. The Hangzhou startup has reached unicorn status with pre-money valuation surging 12 times since Cheng made his first bet in early 2018, he said. Deeper-pocketed backers including Ant and the state-run Shenzhen Capital Group invested in later rounds.“Give it ten years and you’ll likely see a $100 billion cloud company in China,” Cheng said. “The competition is heating up. But we are the most focused, and focus builds expertise.”Born and bred in Taiwan, Cheng moved to the U.S. in the 1990s to pursue an MBA degree after studying computer science in college. His first foray in Silicon Valley was as a product manager with Oracle. He later got a job with eBay in 2002, first building the site’s digital marketing products in San Jose, and then relocating to Shanghai for a six-month stint, during which he failed to help the American retailer turn the tide in a losing battle against Alibaba’s Taobao. “You can never conquer the Chinese market with Western mindsets,” he said.In 2007, Cheng co-founded online marketing platform AdChina, which was later acquired by Alibaba. In 2013, Tencent hired him to take charge of the company’s media advertising assets including video and news portals. At that time, China’s largest tech company had barely started expanding beyond its core business of video gaming. Its ad revenue -- also generated by apps like QQ -- surged 146% during Cheng’s two-year spell.As a venture capitalist, Cheng is now orchestrating his bets using the same strategy pioneered by the likes of Alibaba and Tencent: by adopting and improving in China business models that had worked in Silicon Valley. eSign’s larger U.S. counterpart, DocuSign Inc., is a $36 billion company. Cheng says two-thirds of Eminence’s portfolio fits this profile: Beijing-based Recurrent.ai, which provides artificial intelligence-powered voice tools to boost sales, is similar to Chorus.ai; and Shanghai outfit Duckbill runs a platform matching truck drivers with businesses, not unlike Next Trucking.That’s true for Cheng too, who first met Emergence’s Green when he made a personal investment in AdChina. Even the name of his firm was inspired by his American partner and mentor -- both Eminence and Emergence are shortened as “em” in their web addresses.“It’s easy to bet on someone with a track record. It’s much harder to bet on someone early in their journey,” said Unicorn Capital founder Tommy Yip. “We bet on Peter early because we think he’s got the potential one day to become the Emergence for China.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Ex-Tencent Veteran Raises $120 Million Fund to Bet on Next Zoom
