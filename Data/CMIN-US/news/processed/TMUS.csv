2018-11-09,"Leading cryptocurrency investor law firm Silver Miller Law has filed suit against cell phone giants AT&T and T-Mobile on behalf of several digital asset investors who were victims of the identity-theft tactic known as “SIM swapping.” The suit alleges that both companies possessed flaws in their security systems and failed to properly train their employees to work against hackers seeking to gain access to users’ smartphones.SIM swapping occurs when a hacker gathers information on a potential victim, such as their phone password, answers to their security questions and their financial holdings. Once they have the data they need, the hacker will contact the person’s cell phone provider and claim that their SIM card has been lost or damaged and request that a new one be activated, with the end goal of accessing the victim’s finances — in this case, cryptocurrency. The lawyers at Silver Miller Law claim that many of their clients had their crypto wallets drained via SIM swapping techniques, including one individual — an AT&T holder — who had roughly $621,000 stolen despite the phone company’s assurances that security had been beefed up following an earlier hack attempt on his account. Two other instances involved T-Mobile clients, who were ultimately robbed of $400,000 and $250,000 respectively. This is not the only SIM jacking case brought against AT&T; the mobile carrier is also the subject of a separate $224 million lawsuit brought on by Michael Terpin, the founder of angel investment group BitAngels. Terpin claims that the company’s weak security protocols led to his loss of roughly $24 million in crypto funds through two separate SIM swap attacks. In a deposition filed in August, Terpin claims that the hackers obtained access to his phone number with the help of an AT&T customer service representative. The hackers were then able to access his cryptocurrency wallet and steal funds.Terpin states, “What AT&T did was like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner.” He is now seeking roughly $200 million in damages. Silver Miller Law has developed a reputation in the space for bringing investor-led lawsuits to court. Notable judgments and settlements in the firm’s history include Liu v. the Florida-based cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy, in which roughly $50 million (approximately 11,300 BTC) was ordered returned to the company’s many traders and investors. It has also filed suits against Coinbase for its alleged mishandling of December 2017’s bitcoin cash listing.

In the previous part of this series, we discussed Wall Street analyst expectations for AT&T’s (T) fourth-quarter earnings. Now let’s look at the expected total revenue growth of the telecom company. Wall Street analysts expect AT&T’s total revenue to increase by ~15.9% YoY to reach $48.5 billion in the fourth quarter.

Earlier in the third quarter, AT&T reported total revenues of $45.7 billion, which was above the Wall Street analyst consensus estimate of $45.6 billion. Its third-quarter revenues rose ~15.3% YoY from $39.7 billion in the third quarter of 2017. However, it’s important to note that the significant revenue growth YoY was a result of its Time Warner acquisition, which was partially offset by the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.

## Peer comparison

In comparison, T-Mobile’s (TMUS) total revenue is expected to rise ~5.6% YoY to $11.4 billion in the fourth quarter, while Verizon’s (VZ) total revenue is expected to increase ~1.2% YoY to $34.4 billion.

## AT&T’s earnings in Q4 2018

AT&T (T) is expected to report its results for the fourth quarter on January 30. In this series, we’ll take a look at the expectations for AT&T’s performance in the quarter. Wall Street analysts expect the company’s earnings to increase in the fourth quarter. Analysts expect AT&T to post adjusted EPS of $0.85 in the fourth quarter as compared with $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2017.

In the third quarter, AT&T added 3.4 million net wireless subscribers in the US, with gains in prepaid and connected devices. This might be significant given that smaller competitors T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) have made much of their ability to attract subscribers from other wireless carriers. In addition, AT&T gained 69,000 postpaid phone net subscribers in the third quarter.

## Peer comparison

By comparison, T-Mobile’s EPS is expected to increase ~14.8% YoY to $0.70 in the fourth quarter, while Verizon’s (VZ) adjusted EPS is expected to rise ~26.7% YoY to $1.09. Sprint is expected to report EPS of -$0.02 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended in December.

## Verizon’s wireless service revenue

In this article, let’s take a look at the two most significant components of Verizon’s (VZ) wireless revenue. The larger part is the company’s wireless service revenue, while the smaller part is its wireless equipment revenue. Wall Street analysts predict Verizon’s wireless service revenue to rise ~1.3% YoY to reach $16.1 billion in the fourth quarter.

In the third quarter, Verizon generated wireless service revenue of $16 billion, which was up ~0.8% YoY. However, excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, the company reported wireless service revenue of $16.2 billion in the third quarter, which was up ~2.6% YoY.

As of September 30, nearly 83% of Verizon’s postpaid phone customers were on unsubsidized pricing plans compared to 78% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in penetration of unsubsidized plans has helped the wireless carrier return to service revenue growth.

## Peer comparison

In comparison, AT&T’s (T) combined domestic wireless operations service revenue is expected to decline ~1.9% YoY to $14 billion in the quarter ended December 31, while T-Mobile’s (TMUS) wireless service revenue is expected to rise ~5.7% YoY to $8.2 billion. Sprint’s (S) service revenue from its wireless component is expected to decline ~2.2% YoY to reach $5.5 billion in the same period.

## Samsung to distribute iTunes movies and shows

Selling media content is part of Apple’s (AAPL) Services business, which includes brands such as Apple Music and iTunes. As Reuters reported, Apple has partnered with Samsung (SSNLF) to distribute its iTunes movies and television shows. The Samsung deal marked the second time in recent months that Apple has cut a deal to distribute its media content on devices made by its major rivals. In November, Apple struck a deal to bring its Apple Music service to Amazon’s (AMZN) Echo devices. Echo is the brand of Amazon’s smart speakers that compete with Apple’s HomePod.

## Leveraging partnerships to drive growth

The media distribution pacts with Samsung and Amazon come at a time when Apple is believed to be working on a Netflix-like video service, which could help it add to the disruption of the traditional media industry. With Samsung being the largest manufacturer of television sets and Amazon dominating the smart speaker market, partnering with them could help Apple rapidly extend the reach of its media content as it increasingly bets on its Services business to drive growth.

But Apple is not alone in leveraging partnerships to try to broaden media content distribution. Spotify (SPOT) has a pact that makes it the default music app on Samsung devices including television sets. Pandora (P) is working closely with Snapchat (SNAP) and T-Mobile (TMUS) to extend the reach of its music streaming service.

## Doubling Services revenue

Apple generated $24.3 billion in services revenue in 2016 and is aiming to double that by the end of 2020.

Meanwhile, Verizon’s (VZ), T-Mobile’s (TMUS), and Sprint’s (S) market caps were $234.4 billion, $58.1 billion, and $25.8 billion, respectively. Market capitalization represents a company’s market value at a particular time, which is its shares outstanding multiplied by its stock price.

## AT&T’s forward PE ratio

AT&T’s stock price has declined significantly in 2018. This trend has made AT&T stock cheaper. As of January 7, AT&T has a forward PE ratio of 8.64x for fiscal 2019, and its estimated PE ratio for fiscal 2020 is 8.49x. The forward PE ratios for Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint are 12.03x, 17.07x, and 113.24x, respectively, in fiscal 2019. On this multiple basis, AT&T stock is trading at a discount to its competitors.

## AT&T’s forward EV-to-EBITDA ratio

As of January 7, AT&T has estimated EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) ratios of 6.58x and 6.59x, respectively, for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020.

## AT&T’s wireless service revenue

In the previous part of this series, we learned about AT&T’s (T) expected combined domestic wireless operations’ adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter. Now let’s look at the expected service revenue growth for its combined domestic wireless operations (or AT&T Mobility). Wall Street analysts expect AT&T’s wireless service revenue from its combined domestic operations to decline ~1.9% YoY to reach $14.0 billion in the fourth quarter.

In the third quarter, AT&T reported combined domestic wireless operations service revenue of $14.0 billion, which was down ~3.4% YoY. However, it’s important to note that AT&T Mobility’s service revenue reduction was a result of its adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard.

## Charter’s scale

As shown in the chart below, Verizon (VZ) was the largest US telecom company as of January 9, with a market capitalization of $235.7 billion. It was followed by AT&T (T) at $219.1 billion. Meanwhile, Charter Communications’ (CHTR) market capitalization was $68.1 billion.

## Charter’s valuation metrics

Valuation is represented by price- and earnings-based multiples. On January 9, Charter’s TTM ( trailing-12-month) EV1-to-EBITDA multiple was ~9.49x, while AT&T’s, Verizon’s, Sprint’s (S), and T-Mobile’s (TMUS) TTM EV-to-EBITDA multiples were ~7.41x, ~7.44x, ~4.74x, and ~7.60x, respectively.

Charter expects its EV-to-EBITDA multiple to be ~8.86x in 2019 and ~8.24x in 2020. Its PE multiple is ~52.64x, and Charter expects it to be ~39.15x in 2019 and ~22.21x in 2020.

## Short interest ratio

As of January 9, Charter stock’s short interest as a percentage of float (or short interest ratio) was ~5.8%. A stock having a short interest ratio above 40% suggests investors and traders foresee a fall in its price.

### Verizon Expands AAPL Partnership, Offers Free Apple Music for Premium Unlimited Plans

On Jan. 15, Verizon announced that it was expanding its partnership with Apple. Starting January 17, customers who subscribe to Verizon's Beyond Unlimited and Above Unlimited cellular plans will get Apple Music bundled with their plan for free. That saves the customer $9.99 monthly compared to paying for the streaming music service from Apple.

Customers who subscribe to the less expensive Go Unlimited plan will get a free six month trial of Apple Music -a continuation of a program Verizon launched last August. 

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### What's In It for Verizon?

The appeal for Verizon is a perk that has mass appeal. The company is the largest wireless provider in the U.S., with a narrow lead over AT&T (NYSE:T) -- in Q3, VZ had 153.97 million subscribers compared to the 150.25 million signed up with AT&T. With unlimited data plans sounding largely the same to consumers, bundling a service like Apple Music is a way to stand out from the pack.

It also helps Verizon to sell iPhones. Having the AAPL smartphones in its showroom and being able to offer free Apple Music as a bonus could help to move more iPhones off the shelves.

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) offers free Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) with some plans. From the perspective of the network provider, streaming music uses considerably less bandwidth than streaming video. That means less strain on its infrastructure should eligible customers take advantage of their free streaming ability.

### What's In It for Apple?

For AAPL, there are three wins here. 

The first is the potential to sell more iPhones, at least through Verizon. As everyone knows by now, the company is struggling to keep up the pace of iPhone sales that briefly made it the world's first trillion dollar company last year. 

The second is the prospect of adding more Apple Music subscribers. Since launching in 2015, Apple Music has grown rapidly, but has failed to gain ground on market leader Spotify. Verizon doesn't spike out how many of its customers subscribe to the Beyond Unlimited and Above Unlimited plans, but with nearly 154 million total subscribers there is potential there for Apple Music to snag some significant additional growth. With increased emphasis on Services revenue to take the heat of iPhone sales, that's more important than ever.

Of course there's also the risk that some existing Apple Music subscribers will end up being converted to free Verizon users, diluting the overall subscriber base growth potential.

Finally, Apple's streaming video service is expected this year. The more subscribers AAPL can hook on Apple Music, the better the odds it can convert them to customers for that video offering as well.

### Who Pays for This?

Good question. Neither Apple nor Verizon has come out and said who is actually paying for the &quot;free&quot; Apple Music subscriptions. The most likely arrangement is that AAPL is subsidizing Verizon, offering a discounted rate. However, nothing has been confirmed. The only thing we know for sure is that Beyond Unlimited and Above Unlimited customers won't be footing the bill -- Verizon has not announced any price increases to go along with the perk (although the fine print does note customer are responsible for paying any related taxes).

5G service is beginning to roll out, with the potential to cause churn among wireless carriers as they fight over bragging rights about their next generation coverage. At the same time, companies like Apple are struggling to keep smartphone sales humming. And competition is heating up in the streaming video business, with big new players set to enter the market this year. With so much disruption, look for more of these partnerships in coming months as the various players maneuver for position and look for advantages to lock in customers.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-18,"Diving into a discussion about the U.S.-China trade war is a tough business, so allow me this caveat: anything can happen, especially with our current administration. Nevertheless, those who are seeking to capitalize on the best stocks to invest in may be onto something.

First, the obvious statement: neither side wants to budge an inch. On the one hand, decades of superior economic growth emboldened Chinese pride and nationalism. Naturally, this sentiment has translated into a significant military buildup. Backing down means losing credibility, something the Chinese leadership cannot afford.

On the other hand, the U.S. must protect its intellectual property and its national-security interests. According to author and noted China critic Gordan Chang, controversial tech company Huawei stole technology from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Furthermore, Chang claims that the Chinese government and military supported Huawei's thievery.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Under normal circumstances, we should not expect an imminent resolution, confusing matters about what to invest in now. However, we don't live under any sense of normalcy. Plus, headwinds on both sides suggest the best course of action is a workable truce.

Despite their recent fiery rhetoric, the Chinese government harbors serious fears. The latest economic data indicates declining growth, job losses in U.S.-tariff targeted industries and deteriorating consumer sentiment. Moreover, the ultra-rich are getting increasingly tense about future economic prospects.

For Americans, we're on the verge of unprecedented instability unless the government shutdown ceases. Additionally, President Trump and the Republicans have a political incentive to negotiate a truce with China. Scoring a victory here means assuaging the electorate, many of whom have turned their backs.

  * Top 10 Global Stock Ideas for 2019 From RBC Capital 



Therefore, the pieces for a negotiation to occur are present. If so, here are the best stocks to invest in:

### Alibaba (BABA)

Among Chinese stocks, none get more attention than dominant tech giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). After a series of bumpy trading following its initial public offering, BABA stock skyrocketed in 2017. Around the middle of last year, Alibaba appeared on track to make a repeat performance.

Unfortunately, the escalating U.S.-China trade war derailed the company, knocking it off its perch as one of the best stocks to invest in. That said, BABA is enjoying a strong start to the new year, gaining over 16%. Of course, Alibaba also posted strong numbers in January 2018.

But for those seeking what to invest in now, the tech giant's troubles offer an enticing entry point. As our own Dana Blankenhorn argued, Alibaba offers underappreciated cloud solutions. Combined with U.S.-China optimism, BABA could surprise in 2019.

### Baidu (BIDU)

Another one of China's best stocks to invest in, internet stalwart Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has grown exponentially since its 2005 IPO. It, too, suffered a few years of choppy trading until it regained decisively bullish momentum in 2017.

While it got off to a turbulent start last year, optimists hoped for a repeat performance. Unfortunately, the U.S.-China trade war had other ideas. Moreover, BIDU stock was particularly affected by the ensuing volatility. In the second half of 2018, shares dropped a staggering 33%.

For speculators eyeballing what to invest in now, BIDU stock has substantial upside potential. Unlike other Chinese companies, Baidu has yet to enjoy a noteworthy dead-cat bounce. Therefore, you're getting the internet firm close to the bottom.

  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks You Really Need to Look at for 2019 



Of course, the caveat is that we're assuming no other economic or geopolitical event suddenly dampens enthusiasm. That's a big risk, but the rewards may justify it for adventurous investors.

### Tencent (TCEHY)

Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) follows a familiar trajectory with its Chinese compatriots. Following a dramatic rise against its IPO, Tencent's mercurial rise slowed noticeably between 2014 and 2016. However, 2017 produced a monster result for the popular internet-services company.

Unfortunately for shareholders caught up in the enthusiasm, TCEHY stock peaked in January of last year. Since then, it has largely been a downhill slide. Overall, Tencent lost more than 26% in 2018.

But what makes TCEHY one of the best stocks to invest in is momentum. Since hitting bottom on Oct. 29, shares have jumped more than 33%. More importantly, the bulls have carried this enthusiasm into the new year, moving toward double-digit territory.

While you're not getting the biggest discount with Tencent, you're receiving in its place more stability and confidence. Plus, a diplomatic headway will almost surely attract a surge in investor dollars.

### China Green Agriculture (CGA)

At first glance, China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA) doesn't meet the criteria for what to invest in now. For starters, CGA has become a veritable penny stock, with shares currently trading for less than a can of soda. Plus, the U.S.-China trade war directly and negatively impacts the agricultural industry.

But as a contrarian, CGA is also a candidate among the best stocks to invest in. The reason? Fundamentally, it can absorb many of the troubles associated with the U.S.-imposed tariffs. Management is sitting on $153 million in cash, while it only has $7.2 million in debt. Despite obvious pressures, CGA has enjoyed consistently positive free cash flow.

  * The Bogle Way: 7 Index Funds for Passive Investors 



Still, a resolution will go a long way. The tariffs have negatively impacted growth. In its most recent quarter, CGA suffered a 6.6% decline in revenue year-over-year. But based on its price action, we may have seen a bottom.

### Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)

Should we enjoy a breakthrough in the trade war, Chinese companies won't be the only ones to benefit. Several American organizations, including Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), offer plenty of upside potential.

As a manufacturer of smartphone components, Skyworks is heavily levered towards China. According to CNBC, 83% of its revenue originates from the world's second-largest economy. Based on that statistic, it's no surprise that SWKS stock tanked last year, giving up 29%.

That said, Skyworks is enjoying a positive start to the year, gaining 5%. This sets up an intriguing case for speculation. On one hand, the company has likely suffered severe damage due to the trade war. China is the biggest smartphone market in the word.

On the other hand, SWKS will easily become one of the best stocks to invest in following a truce. Like the other names on this list, it's a tough call, but the possible rewards are tempting.

### Qualcomm (QCOM)

From a glance at its technical chart, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) doesn't belong on a list for what to invest in now. Last year, QCOM stock lost shareholders 8% of market value. Even worse, since peaking around mid-September, the tech giant has slipped more than 26%.

Of course, Qualcomm is a major player in the smart-device sector. Therefore, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war levers an onerous headwind. At the same time, if American and Chinese leaders agree to a practical solution, QCOM would suddenly look attractive.

More importantly, Qualcomm has other avenues to explore, namely the 5G rollout and autonomous-vehicle technology. The former is already a reality: we're just talking about when global integration occurs, not if.

  * Take Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy 



The latter component is a little trickier because autonomous vehicles will take time to implement. However, QCOM does have reasonable assurances of a long-term revenue stream, which helps buffer the trade-war waves.

### Micron Technology (MU)

When the international community greenlighted China's insatiable thirst for all things tech, semiconductor firms flourished. But now that the U.S.-imposed tariffs dampened enthusiasm, companies like Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are feeling the heat.

Its price chart tells you all you need to know. In the first half of 2018, MU stock was cruising to another outstanding year, gaining over 25%. But the second half told another tale, with shares sliding over 38%. With neither side budging, Micron ended last year down nearly 24%.

Betting on diplomacy isn't the safest thing to do, especially with the Trump administration. However, an unexpected breakthrough could make MU one of the best stocks to invest in. Currently, the company generates over half its revenue in China, so a truce is crucial.

### United Continental (UAL)

With the world's two largest economies going at it, you'd think international airliners would stall. However, United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) has surprisingly been one of the best stocks to invest in. Last year, UAL stock returned a surprisingly robust 23%.

As it turns out, diplomatic troubles don't always translate downstream. Demand for flights to Asian countries have performed relatively well. Moreover, UAL has witnessed a surge for European travel, as well as domestic routes. Plus, a steep decline in fuel prices for the final quarter of 2018 provided an earnings boost.

  * The 3 Best Telecom Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio This Year 



All that said, if UAL wishes to see continued momentum, a truce holds the key. On average, a Chinese tourist spends nearly $7,000 in the U.S. Therefore, sustained tensions between the two countries along with economic damage won't do our tourism industry any good.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-28,"There's good news and bad news when it comes to Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) stock.

At the moment, investors mostly are focused on the good news that's affecting VZ stock. Verizon stock touched an all-time high in November, though it has fallen about 7% amid stock-market declines since that point.

And there's a lot to like about Verizon stock. Verizon continues to post strong subscriber numbers. I highlighted the company's blowout Q2 report in July as a catalyst for VZ stock, which did indeed rally nicely in the wake of the results.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



The company's third-quarter numbers were impressive as well, and its Q4 preliminary subscriber figures indicate that it will report strong Q4 results this week.

The primary concern is Verizon's sector. I've called its industry a &quot;circular firing squad,&quot; because the four major carriers continue to cut prices and/or offer more benefits in an effort to poach subscribers from one another. Verizon famously had to start offering unlimited-data plans, after insisting for years that it never would offer such a plan.

Even with VZ stock at $57, however, it has enough positive catalysts to offset those worries. And given Verizon's dividend yield of 4%+, a strong case can definitely be made that VZ remains a solid pick for income investors, in particular.

### Subscriber Growth Drives Verizon Stock

Verizon stock is only up about 7% over the past year, which doesn't sound all that impressive. But the S&P 500 is down about 7% over that same period, and VZ's rival, AT&T (NYSE:T), has seen its share price fall almost 18% during that time. Moreover, VZ stock is up 20%+ from its March lows.

It has been a strong run for Verizon stock, and there's a simple reason for its strength. Specifically, the company's subscriber numbers have been strong. Verizon remains the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. That has made the company an obvious competitive target of not only AT&T, but T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S).

T-Mobile has led the industry in terms of subscriber growth. That's one reason why TMUS stock had surged tremendously before stalling out over the past two years. Sprint has shown occasional signs of life in net adds as well, and both companies seemed to be taking at least some of their new subscribers from Verizon.

After reporting strong numbers for three straight quarters, Verizon has shown that it's holding its own. Churn remains well under 1%, and VZ clearly is outperforming second-place AT&T.

And so, at least for now, the market-share risk to Verizon stock looks minimized. And that's been a big reason why VZ has been able to rally over the past ten months.

### The Outlook of VZ Stock

Of course, stocks are valued based on companies' expected future performance, not their past numbers. On that front, there's good news for owners of Verizon stock as well.

Notably, 5G is on the way. Admittedly, 5G may not be the profit driver that some expect. Verizon's capital spending will have to rise ahead of the shift (although Verizon has lowered its 2018 capital expenditure guidance), owing to better-than-expected efficiency. Some of the potential incremental profits no doubt will evaporate due to competition, as the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in the space continues in one form or another.

That competition may become lighter, however. The merger between Sprint and T-Mobile appears likely to pass regulatory muster. That would shrink the industry to a &quot;big three&quot; from a &quot;big four.&quot; (US Cellular (NYSE:USM) has had a huge run of late, but it remains a small fish in a big pond.)  The deal should also lessen pricing pressure, potentially boosting Verizon's profit margins.

Meanwhile, Verizon still has a number of options. AT&T has the largest debt load in the world. T-Mobile and Sprint likely will be focusing on obtaining approval for their merger and then integrating for several years. Verizon, however, has a clean balance sheet and the ability to either make an acquisition of its own or look to boost the returns of the owners of Verizon stock.

So far, it appears that VZ is planning to focus on the wireless space rather than follow the AT&T path of adding content. And given the struggles of Verizon's content division, Verizon Media (formerly known as Oath), that may be the wisest path. But if an opportunity presents itself, Verizon can capitalize. At this point, none of its rivals can say the same.

### The Valuation of VZ Stock

All told, the outlook of Verizon stock remains upbeat. And it has an enticing dividend and an attractive valuation as well. VZ stock yields a healthy 4.2% and trades at a little over 12 times analysts' 2019 consensus earnings-per-share estimate.

VZ does trade at a notable premium to T stock, which now is valued at just 8.5 times the consensus 2019 EPS estimate. But Verizon doesn't have close to the same debt load as AT&T. Unlike AT&T, it didn't pick up a media business facing continuous pressure from cord-cutting. And it's obvious that Verizon's wireless business is performing much better than that of AT&T at the moment.

Even given the lower current yield of Verizon stock, I'd rather own the better business with the better balance sheet. Right now, that's clearly VZ.

As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-02-07,"As a customer, I have many reasons to dislike AT&T (NYSE:T). Their service is a joke. Their products are pricey and underwhelming, at least in my market. And the idea of switching to DirecTV is laughable. As an investor, T stock has also delivered its own, sad punchlines.Source: ShutterstockSource: ShutterstockTelecommunications stalwarts are supposed to represent the hidden part of your portfolio. They don't make much noise because that's not their intention. Unlike a sexy tech startup, telecoms offer consistent reliability. We're talking slow growth that occurs at a predictable pace. In exchange for the boredom, we receive healthy passive income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut last year, AT&T made headlines for all the wrong reasons. After a tumultuous time, the T stock price ended 2018 down nearly 23%. Investors simply got tired of watching the company get bloated without delivering substantive results.Certainly, I can appreciate the frustrations. However, I also believe that the volatility in T stock is overdone. We're still talking about an influential organization, one that could surprise naysayers in the coming years. Here are three reasons why I'm buying what &quot;Ma Bell&quot; has to sell to investors: Massive Network a Plus for AT&T StockOver the past several years, AT&T has invested significantly on its telecommunication networks. While the company's efforts haven't moved the T stock price higher, I'm optimistic about its longer-term prospects.  * The 9 Best Stocks to Invest In During a Manic Market In the Memphis area, AT&T spent $275 million for various upgrades, including LTE coverage and bolstering network capacity. On the other side of the country, T invested more than $400 million upgrading both wireless and wired networks.One of the common criticisms directed against AT&T stock is that management spends too much money. Conspicuous failures such as the DirecTV buyout -- especially in the cord-cutting era -- add fuel to the bearish fire.I'm not going to dismiss the profligate spending, nor am I going to dismiss the debt load. At around $170 billion, the figure imposes an eyesore in the balance sheet. Plus, the liabilities have picked up in recent quarters due to high-profile acquisitions.Yet it's also this spending that makes AT&T stock compelling for patient investors. Thanks to its investments, AT&T levers a formidable network presence. In fact, one of the key reasons why Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) wanted to merge was to compete more vigorously.Both telecom firms are committed to the next-generation 5G rollout. But individually, they can't compete with large-scale rivals like AT&T or Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Combined, though, they have a better shot.My point isn't about the morality of mergers. Rather in this case, both Sprint and T-Mobile have acknowledged AT&T's daunting reach. For me, that's a clear signal to buy T stock in this weakness. Potential Gamechangers in 5G and Content StreamingDespite its strengths in the network, Verizon scored a pivotal victory, becoming the world's first commercial 5G service. Obviously, this is a big positive for the AT&T rival, as being the first to market -- especially in an ultra-competitive sector -- often affords key advantages.And while I'm generally bullish on VZ for the same things as AT&T stock, the former's 5G win isn't decisive. As InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley mentioned, it's more of a &quot;paper&quot; victory. For instance, subscribers in limited markets can enjoy home-based 5G broadband services. That's a far cry from where we want the next-gen tech, in our smartphones.Unfortunately, the hardware must play significant catch-up to the platform. Likely, this gives AT&T time to implement 5G the proper way. Although Verizon won the initial battle, they used non-standard equipment to achieve that victory.Another component that could drive the T stock price higher is the underlying company's content umbrella. True, AT&T paid a hefty sum to acquire media giant Time Warner. As I previously mentioned, management attracted sharp criticism for the extra liability imposed on the balance sheet. But in this business, you have to pay to play.This is one of the reasons why Disney (NYSE:DIS) bought out Twenty-First Century Fox's (NASDAQ:FOXA) entertainment assets.This same sentiment also explains Sony's (NYSE:SNE) motivation to completely own EMI Music Publishing's equity. If you want to thrive in today's entertainment landscape, you must leverage natural synergies.For AT&T stock to benefit from management's shift towards content streaming, the company must first offer compelling content. The Time Warner deal accomplishes exactly that, whether with entertainment via HBO or through news streaming via CNN.com. T stock and Those Dividends!Finally, we've arrived at the real reason why I'm very interested in AT&T stock. I'm not suggesting that the other reasons are invalid. However, the telecom giant's payout provides an almost-guttural reason to jump aboard.  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday At the present T stock price, it has an absolutely-ridiculous 6.9% dividend yield. Discounting recent performances, that's about the long-term average return of the S&P 500 index. If you think about it, investing in the telecom firm offers similar confidence and stability.For starters, AT&T stock has a history of consistent payouts. Moreover, this is not a typical high-yield investment in that you're constantly worried about viability. Barring a nuclear apocalypse, I'm sure the company will outlive us all.Plus, I don't think that the T stock price will melt down like other legacy companies. While telecoms are boring, they're intrinsically tied into our push for digitalization of everything.

2019-02-26,"Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) has shown good growth numbers in the past few quarters from its cloud segment. In the recent quarter, Alibaba reported $962 million of revenue in cloud computing with year-on-year growth of 84%. This has had a positive impact on the sentiment around Alibaba stock. Cloud segment is a high growth business with a potential for good margins as shown by Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS.Source: Charles Chan Via FlickrHence, Alibaba's management has announced their intention of focusing on cloud to drive future growth. CEO Daniel Zhang has also mentioned that cloud would be the main business of the company in the future.But due to the trade tensions and the negative impact of Huawei fiasco, we could see additional scrutiny on Alibaba's cloud expansion in several international regions. Financial Review has recently mentioned the security challenges faced by Alibaba in its cloud push in Australia. Similar issues will arise in Europe, Canada, India, and other regions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Importance of Cloud SegmentThe Cloud Computing segment of Alibaba is the fastest growing segment for the company. In the recent quarter, the revenue from this segment was RMB 6,611 million or $962 million, up from RMB 3,599 million in the year-ago quarter. Hence, the revenue share of cloud computing increased from 4% to 6%. The EBITA margins for this quarter were negative 4%. This was a slight improvement from negative 5% in the year-ago quarter. Although all companies do not separately report their cloud revenue, Alibaba's revenue pace puts it among the top players of cloud business. The industry leading growth rate in cloud is a major favorable aspect for Alibaba stock. The company is rapidly setting up new data centers in international regions. It has recently opened two new data centers in UK and another in Indonesia. We should see a number of new opening in Europe and South Asia over the next few quarters.Alibaba has the capacity to invest substantial amounts to improve the long term growth potential of its cloud business. The company can also decide to forego profits in the short term to provide more attractive pricing to customers. This should improve the market share and revenue growth at a rapid pace.Last year, Wells Fargo's Ken Sena estimated the standalone valuation of Alibaba cloud to be around $80 billion. If we look at the contribution to Alibaba's ecosystem, the valuation could easily top $150 billion. This is over one-third the current market cap of Alibaba stock. Hence, any negative impact on cloud computing will hurt the bullish sentiment around Alibaba stock. Trade Rhetoric and the Huawei IssueEven if there is a win-win deal on trade issues between U.S. and China in the near term, the brand image of Alibaba cloud could take a beating. In addition, there has been the Huawei issue which is still unresolved. The sentiment against Huawei can be seen in a statement made by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere. He said, &quot;Let me be clear--we do not use Huawei or ZTE network equipment in any area of our network. Period. And we will never use it in our 5G network&quot;Corporate clients who are procuring equipment are more risk averse. They would like to prevent any upsetting of the business due to changes in the regulatory environment. The cloud computing business is different from 5G network but it also requires big contracts worth millions of dollars from corporate clients. If these cloud providers want a risk-free cloud provider, they would always have an alternative to choose Amazon's AWS or other tech companies.The top management from Alibaba is yet to make a statement on this issue as they would be waiting for a favorable trade deal. However, investors need to look at the possible impact of these challenges on the long term potential of Alibaba cloud in international regions. Options Available with AlibabaAlibaba is trying to add new clients by aggressively pricing its cloud services. We can see this from the huge difference in the margins of Amazon's AWS and Alibaba cloud. In the recent quarter, AWS posted an operating margin of 29.3% while Alibaba cloud showed EBITA margin of negative 4%. The company can continue to lower its prices in the near term to provide heavy discounts to clients compared to AWS.Alibaba has also formed a strong partnership with Europe's biggest department store, El Cortes Ingles. Alibaba would be providing payments supports, logistics, ecommerce and New Retail options to the Spanish company. But the most important part of this partnership for Alibaba is the ability to add another big client for its cloud program. Having bigger brands on its client list should make it easier for Alibaba to add new clients in the future.Alibaba is also a big cloud player in China where Amazon and Microsoft are very small. If a foreign brand wants to have a presence in China, Alibaba cloud would be the first choice. This gives the company a starting point to explore additional cloud service for these brands in their home country. Impact on ValuationThe growth potential of cloud business in China is itself quite big. Hence, Alibaba will continue to deliver decent growth due to its domestic cloud services in China. But a few major hiccups in international regions could reduce the long term potential for Alibaba cloud. This should also impact the valuation multiple of Alibaba stock.Alibaba stock is currently trading at forward P/E multiple of around 30. This is quite low for a company with revenue growth at close to 40% and improvement in EBITDA margins. However, a big part of Alibaba's valuation is tied to its ability to show continuous growth and improvement in margins in the cloud business. Investors need to watch the possible challenges faced by this segment to gauge the future momentum in Alibaba stock. Investor TakeawayAlibaba cloud could face security concerns similar to Huawei as it expands in international regions. The current U.S. administration has put pressure on allies to ensure that sensitive national infrastructure does not use Chinese technology. This will limit the usage of Alibaba cloud in many areas. It also negatively impacts the brand image of Alibaba cloud. Corporate clients who are risk averse would rather pay a premium to get AWS or other cloud providers instead of using Alibaba cloud.A long term trend towards poor reception of Alibaba cloud will limit the revenue growth of this segment in international regions. It will also force Alibaba in giving bigger discounts to lure clients which should reduce the margin expansion within cloud segment. The cloud segment plays a vital role in the bullish thesis for Alibaba stock. Hence, it would be important to see how the management deals with any additional security concerns regarding its cloud business.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal held no positions in the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-14,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock has spent the last months fighting to complete its merger with Sprint (NYSE:S), a deal that has become a partisan Washington soap opera. The question for investors is, what happens after the merger goes through?Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)CEO John Legere has been grilled by Democrats over the company's use of the Trump Hotel, over where it gets its equipment and over what it does with data it collects from handsets.But the deal will likely get done, if only because Democrats are now so opposed to it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Legere's Fight for TMUS StockDemocrats argue the merger will cut the number of national wireless competitors from 4 to 3. T-Mobile and Sprint argue that three strong competitors are better than two strong and two weak ones. They also point to the wireless ambitions of competitors like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Throughout this decade, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) have each controlled one-third of the U.S. wireless market. T-Mobile and Sprint share most of the other third. In arguing for the merger, Sprint notes the two larger companies have 93% of the industry's cash flow, a shared monopoly the new T-Mobile would break.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% The main change this decade has been T-Mobile's rise at Sprint's expense. The trend wore down Masayoshi Son, who took a controlling interest in Sprint in 2012 and had wanted his company to control any merger. Son is now focused on his $100 billion &quot;Vision Fund,&quot; buying big positions in companies like Uber.Deutsche Telekom AG (OTCMKTS:DTEGY) owns about two-thirds of TMUS stock. The Sprint deal will reduce that.  The combined company would be mainly foreign-owned, but no one foreign entity would have control.The focus would shift to Legere, which is where he likes it. After taking command in 2012, he grew out his hair, threw leather jackets over t-shirts, and began the &quot;un-carrier&quot; campaign that finally brought Sprint to the table as junior partner. Legere has become an adept politician, and like any politician, he has spent the merger campaign making promises. T-Mobile Will Be a Spectrum BuyerMost of those promises have involved 5G, an encoding technology that lets carriers use a host of new frequencies. It can build markets from TV and intelligent devices to self-driving cars.As part of its merger effort, TMUS stock is promising more, cheaper bandwidth for rural customers, a wireless replacement for cable or satellite TV, and stable prices.To make this happen, Legere is promising to buy more spectrum, in the 24 GHz and 28 GHz range.Using the new spectrum means lower power radios, but many more base stations since the waves attenuate so fast. T-Mobile is also fighting to get more C-Band spectrum, at between 4-8 GHz, against an alliance of satellite companies.  The Bottom LineRight now, T-Mobile shares sell at a premium price to earnings multiple of 21.5, despite paying no dividend. AT&T and Verizon pay dividends yielding 6.5% and 4.5%, respectively.The reason for the price is growth. T-Mobile revenues grew 3% last year. Investors are betting the Sprint merger will go through, giving it more than the $45 billion in combined operating cash flow the two companies earned last year.T-Mobile is also seen as a more entrepreneurial company than any other wireless outfit. If a bus ran John Legere over tomorrow, the stock would tank. Fortunately, Legere prefers limousines.To turn his big plans into reality, however, T-Mobile is going to need executive depth. Promises without execution are called failure.Dana Blankenhorn http://www.danablankenhorn.com is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-21,"Over the past few months, the telecommunications industry has enjoyed a lift in attention, and for good reason. With Verizon (NYSE:VZ) leading the 5G high-speed network rollout, the new technology has strong implications for everyone. That includes relative bit-player Sprint (NYSE:S). As T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) makes its case for buying out S stock, how should investors react?Source: Shutterstock On the surface, the merger appears to make economic and logical sense, if only because T-Mobile CEO John Legere is constantly fighting on the campaign trail. With his quirky mannerism and even quirkier fashion-sense, Legere cuts a controversial figure. Nevertheless, you can't fault the guy for his ambitiousness.Legere has faced a circus of attention from legislators and committees. Some of the questioning, in my opinion, borders on the ridiculous. For example, Democratic Representative Hank Johnson criticized T-Mobile executives for spending $195,000 at one of President Trump's hotels. The implication was that Legere was subtly attempting to curry favor in his quest for Sprint stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPersonally, I view that inference as a stretch. Consistently, the media has focused the spotlight on Trump's possible collusion with Russia. The last thing anyone needs in this environment is more attention.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter That said, Legere has redirected the media's glare to a positive direction. Throughout telecom's version of the Spanish Inquisition, Legere emphasized the benefits of a T-Mobile-Sprint merger. Primarily, a combined entity would upend the duopoly of Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). The TMUS head rightfully points out that three strong competitors are better than two contenders and two afterthoughts.If all opposing politicians have are silly or irrelevant questions, then T-Mobile has a clear shot at acquiring Sprint stock. Unfortunately, nothing is ever that easy. Tough Questions Plague S Stock and the Proposed MergerFrom combing through various articles on the web, the consensus appears that Legere has a compelling argument. Therefore, the legal greenlight for the merger is an inevitability. But I can't help looking at the S stock price.Although shares are up over 9% this year, the journey has been a choppy one. Based on current levels, the S stock price hasn't moved at all since late summer of 2016. And the fact that it lost steam in recent trades does nothing to bolster confidence in a possible merger.On the other hand, both Verizon and AT&T are doing what they usually do: trudging along while paying their shareholders generous dividends.But I'm getting more concerned when I consider the arguments against T-Mobile's buyout of Sprint stock. While Legere emphasizes the broader argument that the merger will benefit society, that logic doesn't hold up well. For instance, a combined entity would almost surely lead to job losses, particularly the high-paying kind.The counterargument is that this reinvigorated telecom firm will make inroads to rural communities, boosting both connectivity and job growth. If anything, Fox Business has bought into this narrative as well, I suspect, as rural residents.However, the idea that this merger will close the digital divide isn't entirely convincing. For one thing, the buyout will take many years to complete. During that time, rural residents must settle for less-than-stellar internet speeds. In addition, unless the T-Mobile-Sprint entity encounters competition, it has no incentive to reduce prices.On top of that, consolidation in telecom risks depressing prices in major markets, and therefore, wages. Ironically, opposing Democrats have adopted the stereotypical Republican playbook by supporting the status quo in the telecom industry. Complicated Nature Hurts Sprint StockI don't necessarily like giving my thoughts about high-level mergers. With so many gears involved, it's difficult to predict the deal's trajectory with any confidence.  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens But with S stock, you're also talking about telecom. This is one of the most important, if not the most important sector. As we head toward true 5G integration, telecoms will touch virtually every area of our lives. From automated technologies to artificial intelligence to healthcare, this industry will lever unprecedented influence.As such, lawmakers and regulatory agencies will go over the proposed deal with a fine comb.

The communications giant will launch its long-awaited 5G network on Apr. 11, setting up another battle between VZ  and its longtime-rival, AT&T (NYSE:T).Source: Shutterstock Many will prefer VZ stock due to its first-mover status. Others will likely favor AT&T due to factors such as its more diversified holdings and its 5G network that will probably become the industry standard. However, because VZ will be one of the three companies to own a nationwide 5G network, VZ stock should move higher once consumers widely adopt the new standard.  * 15 Stocks to Buy Leading the Financial Charge  Verizon Will Lead the Way on 5GThe Apr. 11 launch will bring 5G only to select areas of Chicago and Minneapolis. Nonetheless, that will make VZ the first company to bring 5G wireless service to the market. It also places pressure on peers AT&T and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) to play catch-up.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut first-mover advantage is not the only key difference between VZ and its longtime peer, AT&T. As with 3G and 4G, Verizon will use a version of connectivity that will differ from its peers.In past years, VZ utilized CDMA wireless networks while AT&T and T-Mobile used the more common GSM standard. That difference will continue in the 5G realm.VZ stock has delivered positive, long-term returns despite the fact that it uses a different type of network. Likewise, using a different type of 5G network will likely not hurt Verizon stock. VZ Stock Has Become an &quot;All-In&quot; BetVerizon has adopted more of an &quot;all-in&quot; strategy than its peers on 5G.  Although it owns what once encompassed AOL and Yahoo, it has pursued a smaller content-media strategy than AT&T, which recently completed its $85 billion Time Warner acquisition.The strategy of VZ stock itself is also different. Both VZ stock and AT&T stock have low price-earnings ratios. Both also pay generous dividends, which have increased every year for decades.However, the stocks' PE ratios and dividend yields indicate that investors have more confidence in Verizon stock. Due to concerns about AT&T, its forward PE ratio has fallen to 8.8, while its dividend yield now stands at 6.5%.  The valuation of VZ stock also appears  reasonable. Still, with its relative stability, its forward PE comes in at a higher 12.3 with a dividend yield of 4.1%.TMUS stock pays no dividend, and its forward PE stands at 14.9. For this reason, I give both T and VZ stock the edge over T-Mobile. Also, for risk-tolerant investors, I agree with Barron's that AT&T, with its lower valuation and higher dividend yield, is superior . However, for those who are more risk-averse, I see many reasons to take a closer look at VZ stock. VZ Will Become &quot;Systemically Important&quot;Verizon's future depends almost exclusively on the success of 5G. For this reason, many will think that calling its &quot;all-in&quot; strategy less risky appears to be illogical.However, the importance of 5G will keep the three companies that own 5G networks--AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile--critical components of the overall economy. In essence, they have become &quot;systemically important&quot; in the same way that the stability of the largest banks has become vital to the health of the American economy. Due to our dependence on wireless communications, much of the economy would cease to function if the carriers' networks failed. This makes VZ stock one of the few  &quot;all-in&quot; bets that are safe.Ironically, AT&T's &quot;diversification&quot; into content could make that stock less safe. With its move into content, AT&T has become a competitor of industry giants such as Disney (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).AT&T will struggle to match the heavy content spending of those companies. I doubt a failure of AT&T's content strategy would destroy it since it could sell its content assets. Still, since AT&T spent tens of billions to develop a 5G network,  it is unable to match the content spending of its peers. That makes the likelihood of AT&T's success in this area far from certain and could push more investors looking for a play on 5G into VZ stock. The Bottom Line on VZ StockVZ stock will likely benefit from its increased systemic importance. Verizon will lead the way as it launches some localized 5G networks later this month. However, as all three major wireless companies take networks online, many believe AT&T's diversification and its own 5G networks will give T stock the advantage over Verizon stock.Investors who can tolerate risk will more likely choose AT&T with its lower PE ratio and higher-yielding dividend. However, as 5G becomes an essential component of the economy, Verizon's strategy to bet primarily on wireless could make VZ stock less risky than its more content-dependent peer, AT&T.Moreover, VZ's valuation and dividend advantages probably give it the edge over T-Mobile. As a result, those who want less risk and a growing stream of 5G-related income are more likely to choose Verizon stock than its peers.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

MoffettNathanson argued that a recent report that a group of  state attorneys general were prepared to fight the deal without  help from the federal government - an unusual but not  unprecedented situation - actually increased the likelihood that  the Justice Department or FCC would act to stop the proposed  transaction.",Telecom analyst says approval for Sprint/T-Mobile deal less likely

2019-04-04,"Sprint (NYSE:S) stock has taken a fall. After spending most of the past few quarters trading between $6 and $6.50, Sprint stock has tumbled over the past week. Shares now trade around $5.60 each. That's their lowest level since this past August.Source: Shutterstock It's not hard to see why. The tortuously slow merger process between Sprint and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has hit more snags. On Thursday, reports surfaced that New York, California and many other states are considering suing to block the deal, even if the federal government gives it approval.That comes on top of the FCC pausing its merger review earlier this month to pursue more information. Additionally, some congressional representatives have harshly criticized the proposed tie-up recently. As a result, S stock slumped more than 10 percent over the past week as investors priced in the rising odds of the deal breaking.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises  Rite-Aid All Over Again?The government's anti-trust department has made some odd moves in recent years. For a notable example, think back a couple years ago to the department's decision to block the Staples and Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) merger because it would supposedly create a monopoly.The government seemed unaware that office supply stores themselves are increasingly an anachronism in the age of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In any case, ODP stock languishes around $3.50, down nearly 50% since its merger was blocked. Similarly, the government stopped a merger of two video rental companies after Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) already existed, again, to block a supposed monopoly in a dying industry. Both subsequently went bust.Fast forward, and last year we saw a dreadful outcome for poor Rite-Aid (NYSE:RAD). Walgreensm (NYSE:WBA) had been trying to take over Rite Aid for several years. but it was unable to get regulatory approval. Then Walgreens tried modified proposals to buy a smaller number of stores.Rite Aid management got distracted from running their business, and store performance lagged. By the time Rite Aid finally got any sort of deal done, its business economics had collapsed. RAD stock now trades at just 65 cents, down more than 90% from Walgreen's initial takeover offer.Sprint stock could be heading for a similarly tragic fate. It's been apparent for years that Sprint and T-Mobile should merger to create a viable third option to AT&T and Verizon. Yet, the government seems increasingly set on blocking the deal. With Sprint set to have a poor 2019 as an independent company, shareholders need to start asking what happens if the deal is scuttled. What Happens With 5G?An interesting element of the proposed merger is the 5G question. Sprint, like the other carriers, has invested heavily in 5G. Yet, it doesn't seem like they have the capability to be a true contender. Witness former CEO Marcelo Claure's comments last year:&quot;Our plan anticipates a limited 5G build over time that will lack broad coverage. Given the characteristics of our mix of spectrum and the size of the capital expenditures involved, Sprint will be able to deliver 5G only in limited areas, focusing on population-dense metropolitan areas. Consequently, Sprint as a standalone company cannot fully seize the tremendous opportunity that 5G creates.&quot;The Trump administration has made national 5G rollout a priority and is seemingly concerned that China will beat the U.S. to the punch. That augurs in favor of the government looking more positively on a proposed Sprint/T-Mobile tie-up.On the other hand, the clock clearly is ticking for Sprint. If they can't merge with T-Mobile, will customers still view them as a reasonable option if they can't deliver faster speeds outside of major cities? Sprint: Very Rocky Financial OutlookOver the past decade, Sprint has run annual net losses in the $2.5 billion to $4 billion range. Excluding last year's tax reform driven gains, Sprint hasn't been profitable on an annual basis even a single year over the past decade. All told, it has lost more than $25 billion. Long-term debt is now up to $36.3 billion.Sprint stock represents an investment in a very sick standalone company. This is why it is so imperative that Sprint merge with T-Mobile. There are so many costs each company faces separately now, ranging from infrastructure deployment such as 5G on through to advertising, store locations, and management staff. Sprint desperately needs to slash its overhead to become profitable and face its gargantuan debt obligations.In fact, though it may be posturing to try to get the deal approved, Sprint has suggested that it may run out of cash if the deal is blocked. And given its huge losses, it's not unreasonable to think that creditors would pull the plug if there's no realistic exit strategy. Sprint Stock VerdictIt could be tempting to buy S stock after the recent more than 10% decline. If the government backs off and lets the merger through, Sprint stock buyers here should make a nice profit.But before you take the plunge, make sure you think about the potential downside closely. Sprint's business model hasn't proven viable over the past 10 years. And with the huge capital necessary to roll out 5G in coming years, it's unclear if Sprint can make it as a standalone company. Sprint stock will trade much lower if the government breaks up the deal.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned WBA stock and had no position in any of the other aforementioned securities.

Rather, it's the stock charts of Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) that merit the closest looks. Amgen (AMGN)AMGN stock isn't beyond salvaging yet. But, it's taking on water. A little more downside could do the trick and put a self-sustaining selloff into motion.  Click to Enlarge  * The technical problem is most evident on the weekly chart. The lower boundary of the rising trading channel hasn't cleanly kept the uptrend intact. In fact, Wednesday's close was below that floor.  * There are still two horizontal floors in place, both plotted in red on both stock charts. Each is a level at which AMGN stock has made key lows since October.  * It's subtle, but the string of lower highs seen since the early December peak is the first time we've seen two lower lows since 2015. Citrix Systems (CTXS)Citrix Systems is a name that has been on our radar, and examined frequently, for the better part of the past few months. With our last look on April 4, a failed effort to break above a major ceiling was a major red flag that the bulls just aren't ready to roll.Since then, things have continued to deteriorate. CTXS stock remains below a minor support level, and a couple of major support lines are under attack.  Click to Enlarge  * One of those support lines is right around $98, plotted in green on the daily chart. That's where Citrix stock bottomed a couple of times since October.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can see the support line -- plotted in blue -- that has tagged both major lows since early 2016 is also under pressure.  * The lower edge of the converging wedge pattern marked by yellow lines on both stock charts hasn't been able to keep CTXS stock propped up since March. Goldman Sachs Group (GS)GS stock hasn't made any major net progress since January's surge. But, it has been working on a breakout thrust that's almost ready to launch. One or two more good days could do the trick, and the backdrop is already as encouraging as it needs to be.  Click to Enlarge  * The make-or-break level in question is right around $208, where the white 200-day moving average line currently lies, and where the resistance line that tags the prior three major highs also awaits. That line is plotted in yellow on both stock charts.  * Zooming out to the weekly timeframe we can see the past four slightly bullish weeks have been on decent -- and growing -- volume.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Granted, it was a dubious win that may or may not have actually helped boost VZ stock. Being the first to achieve any technological feat, however, translates into good publicity.Source: Shutterstock Now the telecom giant may be positioning to set the pace for &quot;real&quot; 5G when that becomes the norm sometime later this year. Specifically, on Tuesday Verizon announced a &quot;Built on 5G Challenge&quot; which is supposed to encourage tech developers to create solutions that best utilize the power of ultra-high-speed wireless connections.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability The contest is once again great publicity, but more than that, it may actually serve as a breeding ground that puts Verizon front-and-center among the outfits aiming to utilize the nascent platform.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt may also be something of a red flag for VZ and VZ stock. The First to Cross the Finish Line5G is not yet available to most smartphone owners, but should be later this year. Once the infrastructure is in place and wireless customers have the right phones,  they will enjoy 5G broadband speeds that are effectively 20 times faster than the standard 4G network most smartphone users utilize now.5G will easily make mobile phones powerful entertainment and business tools, but that won't be the most exciting part of it. The oft-discussed Internet of Things (IoT) era, for instance, will be ushered in by 5G connectivity, enabling the automated transfer of massive amounts of digital data.But Verizon's October unveiling of at-home 5G connectivity was aimed at consumers who want high-speed internet, delivered by a provider that won't run a physical line all the way to their homes.That launch was widely criticized because the hardware used to power the connections doesn't comply with  the working standard the industry's other key players like AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) have decided upon. That standard is known as 5G NR.Verizon's 5G TF hardware will have to be swapped out once 5G NR standards are firmed up. Sprint (NYSE:S) even went as far as to file a lawsuit against Verizon for what it alleges are misleading statements about Verizon's 5G network.But building a standard-compliant 5G network was never Verizon's point. Demonstrating its lead in 5G was its point and purpose.Mission accomplished. But at what cost and to what end? Uses Remain UnclearWhile 5G NR technology may not be completely ready, the 5G NR standard is gelled enough to be used as a developmental platform. To that end, VZ has committed a prize pool of $1.75 million that will be given to the top three small companies that come up with the best ideas on how to use 5G.The contest tacitly touches on one stumbling block for 5G:it will be very expensive to utilize the most impressive capabilities of 5G.While 5G connections via smartphones don't appear as if they will cost mobile customers leaps and bounds more than 4G connectivity, consumers don't necessarily need wireless connection speeds 20 times faster than their current service.That's not true of companies and other organizations. Networks of thousands of smart meters that a utility company may wish to deploy, precision manufacturers, and smart/self-driving vehicles all need ultra-high-speed connections and can make the best use of them. Those applications of 5G technology will be very expensive.Beyond that, though, practical applications of the technology remain fuzzy. Even as recently as January, the best argument Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg could muster for 5G was, &quot;It's so much more - it's going to be cordless manufacturing, it could be retail stores that capture real-time information in order to give you, as a customer, a much better experience when you're in the store.&quot;Retailers may, however, have maxed out on the amount of technology they truly need to tap. Manufacturers seems to be doing well enough as-is.It's time for the specifics to start materializing. The Bottom Line on VZ StockThe contest, which is more of a grant program, in and of itself will do little to prod VZ stock in either direction. What VZ learns and the tech it gains from the Built on 5G Challenge, however, may serve as seeds for the company's biggest current priority.And it needs to. While customers often have difficulty initially understanding and utilizing new technologies, some recent tech evolutions have proven to be more bark than bite even well after theior launch. Virtual reality comes to mind. It was and is amazing, but it's hardly the earth-shattering development it was billed to be.It's a matter current and would-be owners of VZ stock may want to put on their radars, considering the company plans to spend between $18 billion and $19 billion on equipment next year, and most of that spending is meant to maintain Verizon's lead in the 5G race.Related questions are likely to come up during the Q&A portion of the company's Apr. 23 earnings call.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in AT&T.

The delay has raised doubts about the deal getting the green light,  sending both T-Mobile and Sprint stock lower in Monday trading. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;I have not made up my mind,&quot; Delrahim told CNBC. &quot;The investigation continues. We've requested some data from the companies that will be forthcoming. We don't have a set number of meetings or a timeline,&quot; he added.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in May, But Don't Go Away I'm not a legal analyst, but when a decision is delayed by three months, I think that usually indicates that the applicants are not winning the PR battle. I could not care less about either company, and I wouldn't own either stock, although I did suggest in February 2017 that investors interested in T-Mobile stock buy its parent, Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS:DTEGY), instead because it pays a healthy dividend. As for Sprint stock, InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek recently stated that its share price would be squashed if the Department of Justice denied the transaction. &quot;Sprint stock could be heading for a similarly tragic fate. It's been apparent for years that Sprint and T-Mobile should merge to create a viable third option to AT&T and Verizon,&quot; Bezek wrote in an article published on Apr. 3. &quot;Yet, the government seems increasingly set on blocking the deal. With Sprint set to have a poor 2019 as an independent company, shareholders need to start asking what happens if the deal is scuttled.&quot;At this point, I'd be shocked if the government allows the deal to go ahead. Here's why.  Just Like CanadaIn Canada, there are only three wireless carriers: Rogers Communications (NYSE:RCI), BCE (NYSE:BCE) and Telus (NYSE:TU). Sure, a few independent carriers are operating, but there's a reason why Canada has some of the highest wireless charges in the world. &quot;While progress is being made, prices in Canada remain expensive compared to other nations,&quot; the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED), which commissioned the annual study of wireless prices in Canada compared to the world, stated in December. The report found that a 2GB plan in Canada was 20% more expensive than the average price for the same plan in four mid-sized American cities. The Canadian package was also more expensive than similar plans in Berlin, Paris, London, and Rome.Naturally, the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association has a problem with the study because it doesn't focus on promotional pricing offered by its members. Anecdotally, I know how expensive Canadian plans are because friends of mine in Halifax who moved there from Washington D.C. last year, couldn't stop remarking about the difference in cost between their U.S. provider and Canadian ones. Let's just say that Canada has not benefited from a telecom triopoly.  Significant OppositionSeveral different groups representing unions, consumer associations, media types, and other concerned citizens have railed against the Sprint-T-Mobile marriage because it does not help the average American much. &quot;Our nation's antitrust and telecommunications laws set a purposefully high bar for mergers that consolidate a market to this degree,&quot; the detractors told the FCC. All of these diverse stakeholders have one clear message: The Department and Commission should reject this merger, because it means less competition, fewer choices, and higher prices for consumers.In what world does it make sense to have three companies controlling a wireless market with 327 million people?Canada has a population of 37 million, about one-eighth of America's, and yet it has three major providers, albeit ones that charge an arm and a leg for service. It is sheer lunacy to allow these companies to merge because if Canada is any indication,  the results that the detractors warn about -- fewer choices and higher prices -- most certainly will materialize. If you own Sprint stock, I would sell it while you still can, because unless President Trump has something to gain financially from this deal going through, it isn't going to be approved. Full stop.

The business added that its total number of subscribers was down by 8,000 when compared to the previous quarter, which saw a net addition of 48,000 subscribers.Sprint is being negatively impacted by the fact that the company has yet to merge with T-Mobile in the companies' proposed $26 billion deal as federal regulators are still reviewing the potential impact of the move.

Today's network capital expenditure will pay off tomorrow through higher subscriber growth and average revenue per user.In the very near future, the introduction of 5G in select cities should accelerate that subscriber growth in the next few quarters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips  Strong Fiscal 2018 and Sprint StockSprint reported operating income of $398 million, while its loss of $1.9 billion is due to a non-cash charge of $2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.8 billion. Post-paid net additions of 710,000 is an increase of 286,000 from last year's levels.Cost controls resulted in a $1.2 billion gross cost reduction of services, general and administrative expenses. For this fiscal year, the cost cuts will be offset by incremental costs related to network and customer experience initiatives.The Mobile 5G offering is through the execution of the Next-Gen Network plan. In the fourth quarter, Sprint deployed 80% of its 2.5GHz spectrum, with 30,000 outdoor small cells deployed. The 1,500 MIMO radios will increase the capabilities of its LTE network.Sprint said that a software update will give 5G service in various cities in the coming weeks. Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and Kansas City are the cities that the company plans to offer 5G services first. Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, Phoenix, and Washington D.C. are next, with deployment set for the end of June. Fourth-Quarter Results by the NumbersPostpaid additions of 169,000 were offset by postpaid phone declining by 189,000. Total wireless additions was a net 8,000. Churn in postpaid, postpaid phone, and prepaid all rose slightly but not enough to concern investors. ARPU was mostly steady except for prepaid, which fell from $37.15 last year to $33.67.Net operating revenue from service, equipment sales, and equipment rentals all rose. And on a non-GAAP basis, Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 55.4%, up from 47.2% last year.With numbers this strong, Sprint has potential upside even though the merger with T-Mobile is uncertain. Citi calculated a bear-case scenario where the deal would fall through and said Sprint would be worth just $3 a share. But Sprint has a manageable debt load, cut its costs and is demonstrating higher profitability. The 5G rollout will only lift ARPU and could potentially help the company accelerate subscription growth. Merger Alternatives and Sprint StockIf the Sprint/T-Mobile deal does not work out, Sprint could instead merge with Dish Networks (NASDAQ:DISH). Dish Networks would benefit from having a telecom unit in its business, diversifying the company from its pay-TV services.Markets are confident that the T-Mobile/Sprint deal will go through because the stock, at $5.79, is not far from its high of $6.61. Sprint has a valuable network of 5G, so this high-speed network is of strategic importance for T-Mobile. Because T-Mobile has the low to mid-end of the spectrum, its signal can penetrate buildings in the city. Sprint is at the other end of the spectrum and offers high-speed services.Investors could buy Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) and get a regular dividend yielding 4.26%. The stock topped over $60 a share and closed recently at $56.63. AT&T (NYSE: T) is a dominant player in the wireless space. Its stock dipped recently from over $32 down to $30.53. The stock now yields a dividend of 6.68%. Your TakeawaySo few analysts cover Sprint stock that there is no price target available from Wall Street. Conversely, the street has a 15% upside target on TMUS stock. Analysts are even more bullish on AT&T stock, setting an 18% upside target price on shares. I believe the recent dip in Sprint shares creates a compelling entry point.If the deal with T-Mobile moves forward, shareholders will get rewarded. Plus, owning a combined T-Mobile-Sprint company is worth the wait.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-14,"Investors already knew Sprint (NYSE:S) has been on the defensive, struggling to remain competitive in a market that powerhouses AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) dominate. But, until Tuesday of last week, when Sprint reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results, the owners of Sprint stock may not have fully realized just how much trouble the company was in.Source: Shutterstock There was more than one red flag for Sprint stock, though the big one was the loss of 189,000 phone subscribers, topping the 117,000 voice customers analysts had modeled.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk Sprint added 169,000 net new devices to its networks, but only thanks to the addition of 358,000 &quot;data&quot; devices, which are usually secondary (and lower revenue) devices used by existing phone-service customers. Without those, Sprint would have lost more than the 8000 net total subscribers it shed in Q4 versus Q3.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSprint's average revenue per prepaid and postpaid users fell, although the ARPU of its postpaid phone-only subscribers rose slightly. Their average monthly bill edged up from the prior quarter's $50.01 to $50.18. But that figure was still down from the year-ago figure of $50.44.Sprint's EBITDA improved from $2.77 billion to $3.13 billion, and its operating cash flow increased from $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. However, its free cash flow fell from -$240 million in Q4 of 2017 to -$539 million in Q4  of 2018.The worsening cash flow is largely the result of a lease-turn-in program the company put in place back in 2015. As it turns out,  Sprint can't afford the promotion.Sprint stock price stumbled last Wednesday after the company reported those results, despite the fact that nothing about last quarter was exactly new or surprising.Sprint stock price has recovered in the meantime, mostly on expectations that Sprint's poor results would inspire regulators to go ahead and approve its merger with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) rather than risk letting Sprint fall apart and cede even more market share to Verizon and AT&T.Indeed, given the slow and relentless deterioration of Sprint's  business -- again, last quarter's results weren't uncharacteristic -- the owners of S stock  may want to upgrade their hopes that the T-Mobile deal gets done to prayers.Analysts certainly don't see any other viable way out for Sprint stock. What They Said&quot;Sprint won't survive as a stand-alone company with their current capital structure,&quot; wrote New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin, adding &quot;If the T-Mobile acquisition is blocked, Sprint will need to find another deal. If they can't find another deal they will likely need to restructure sooner or later. I have a hard time imagining anyone wanting to buy Sprint.&quot;The restructuring Chaplin referenced was at least a partial nod to the company's $35.36 billion in long-term debt, which forced the company to shell out $629 million worth of interest payments last quarter. Sprint has been working to whittle down its debt burden, though that's proving difficult.Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan noted &quot;We remain sidelined on Sprint (stock) due to the merger, though (we) believe that Sprint would have difficulty remaining competitive as a standalone company.&quot;It was MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett, however, who dished out the most eyebrow-raising assessment of the matter for existing and prospective owners of Sprint stock. He explained, &quot;The most recent articulations of their predicament are the most urgent yet. Not only is their network badly deficient, they now concede, their communications with the investment community have also been 'highly selective' at best, and intentionally misleading at worst.&quot;If Moffett is right, even last week's concerns voiced by the company itself may still not fully paint the picture of how much trouble Sprint stock is in. The Bottom Line on Sprint StockThere may be more hope on the horizon for S stock than is readily apparent.The bulk of the government's concerns about the deal to date has been expressed by the Federal Communications Commission, although the Department of Justice itself has been interested in telecom companies as well. Allowing the third and fourth biggest wireless names to combine would take another competitor off the table, possibly setting the stage for higher, unchecked prices from the likes of AT&T and Verizon.The FCC and the DOJ, however, may  offer some pushback more for effect than out of actual concern. That is, regulators don't want to appear to be pushovers when it comes to mergers because they don't want a surge of completely anti-competitive mergers to take place.The FCC and the DOJ likely know the wireless market is going to turn into a three-horse race in the end anyway, one way or another. And it's better for consumers to have three solid players than two strong players and a still-distant-third T-Mobile all scrambling to pick up the pieces of a shattered Sprint.The toughest part for the owners of Sprint stock is waiting for that green light. Sprint clearly can't continue to do business in its current condition, and every day it has to wait is another opportunity for the Sprint stock price to lose ground.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-14,"There's an interesting phenomenon going on when it comes to Sprint (NYSE:S) stock. Sprint is hoping to merge with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in an all-stock deal. Owners of Sprint stock would receive a little over one-tenth of a T-Mobile share in such a deal. Yet as TMUS keeps moving higher, Sprint shares generally keep moving lower.Source: Shutterstock Indeed, since Oct. 1, T-Mobile shares have climbed over 4%. S stock has dropped almost 8% despite some recent bullish trades. That divergence seems somewhat strange given that the ratio established by the merger agreement hasn't changed. Sprint investors still would get a tenth of T-Mobile's equity (0.10256 shares, to be exact) if the merger goes through. TMUS now is more valuable, yet Sprint isn't.There are two reasons for the falling Sprint stock price, however, and neither bodes well for the future. At this point, particularly after disappointing subscriber numbers in the company's first quarter report, S stock represents a bet on the merger going through. And that doesn't seem like a bet worth taking.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips TMUS Shoots Up, Sprint Stock Price Falls DownYou must assess several factors to estimate the value of a stock ahead of a potential merger. First is the consideration paid. Second is the perceived odds of the deal going through. Third is the imagined price if the deal breaks. And fourth is the time to close: investors won't pay $100 today for $100 of value that won't be realized a year from now.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites In the case of Sprint, the consideration paid actually has risen since the merger was announced last April. T-Mobile stock is up over 21%. At the current TMUS stock price near $74, Sprint shareholders now would receive about $7.53 per share in market value. Yet the Sprint stock price sits at just $6.02, suggesting an unusually large 25% deal spread. In other words, the consideration paid is 25% above the current trading price.That spread has widened notably from just 4% to 5% for much of last year. Most of the increase has come just since January. The upside of S stock might look higher in a best-case scenario, but that's clearly not what investors are focused on at that moment. A Widening SpreadTwo key factors have led to the widening spread. The first is that it appears the odds of the deal going through are much lower. As I wrote back in 2017, when rumors of the merger were again swirling, approval seemed reasonably likely after the surprise 2016 election of Donald Trump.The oft-cited rule of thumb is that Republican antitrust regulators want at least three competitors in a market, and Democrats four. A new Republican administration seemed to promise a much easier path to approval.And as Luke Lango wrote back in June, the green light for the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T (NYSE:T) seemed to strengthen that case. Lango wasn't alone in making that argument: the Sprint stock price and TMUS shares moved in concert for the rest of 2018. This suggested that investors were valuing Sprint as a discounted version of T-Mobile.That's not the case anymore. Another delay in the approval process seems to suggest the odds are lower than previously anticipated. Consensus seems to be that the chance of approval is closer to the 50/50 range. With much less confidence in the merger going through, investors have sold off Sprint stock.The second problem is that the potential downside in a deal-break seems to be larger. Citigroup (NYSE:C) has said of late that it sees a standalone Sprint as worth $3 per share. Both Q4 and Q1 results show a company losing market share to T-Mobile and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Generous free line promotions are hitting margins. It does seem like S stock, without merger news, would have declined over the past year-plus.Indeed, improving market share and optimism for a merger fueled 2016's rally. Without the merger, S stock doesn't have much to offer. Is S Stock Worth the Risk?Last year, an investor might have argued that Sprint had an 80%-90% chance of being acquired and gaining some $7-plus per share in value. In the other 10%-20% of outcomes, a fall to $5 or so might be expected. That in turn suggested a Sprint stock price -- discounted back a couple of percentage points to account for time to close -- in the mid-$6 range, which is about where shares traded.The math looks different now. The upside is a little higher, at about $7.50. But if the odds of approval are truly 50%, and the downside case is a valuation of $3, Sprint stock only should be worth about $5 now, maybe a touch more. Its expected value in this model would be $5.25, less, again, a percentage point or two because the deal likely won't close until at least the end of this year.In other words, the market right now is either pricing in greater than 50% of odds of approval or downside closer to $4 than to $3.To some investors, that might seem an intriguing bet. Sprint isn't doing great from an operational standpoint, certainly. But its spectrum still has value. 5G still is on the way. Sprint likely isn't going bankrupt if regulators block the merger. Meanwhile, rising TMUS shares suggest much more in the way of upside should the gamble pay off.But here's the problem: if the merger is approved, Sprint stock likely rises 20% or more. If it's blocked, S stock could fall by a similar amount. Assuming the odds are roughly 50/50 -- and that seems about right -- owning S stock appears little more than a gamble.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Perhaps, but the clock is ticking. Maybe that will get S stock down to the $5.50 level, which gives investors a more favorable risk/reward entry. Sprint and T-Mobile MergerWe've been hearing about a possible Sprint/T-Mobile tie-up for years. Once AT&T's (NYSE:T) acquisition of Time Warner was approved last June though, that got the ball rolling with Sprint and TMUS. On June 15, the two companies finally put through their merger application with the FCC.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk What's followed has been a long list of rumors, reports and a lot of back-and-forth. First there were reports the FCC favored a merger and a telecom market dominated by three major carriers (the third being Verizon (NYSE:VZ)). More recently, it was suggested that the FCC is reportedly 50/50 on the merger. That was in April. On that same day, Citi analysts said there could be 50% downside in Sprint stock price if the deal doesn't go through. That was with the stock at ~$5.90.So where are we now?New reports show S and TMUS are making concessions to try and get the deal approved by the FCC and DoJ. The FCC has implemented an informal &quot;180-day shot clock&quot; for reviewing the merger. That &quot;shot clock&quot; has been paused several times now, with the government shutdown and new merger plans being a few of the reasons. That clock most recently began ticking again on April 10th and we're now on Day 162.I don't know if the deal will go through, but a decision either way could be coming down soon. That is, if they follow the shot clock and don't pause it in the next few weeks. Valuing Sprint StockSprint stock has been bumbling along in the single digits for years now. It hasn't been able to get the growth it needs while reducing its debt and generating the profits that are needed for more investor money. AT&T and Verizon are cash flow machines. Sprint? Let's just say it doesn't have a long history of great cash flow.Cash and short-term investments stand at about $7 billion, while total debt stands at $39.9 billion. Growth is anemic, too. Estimates call for earnings of 4 cents per share this year and 5 cents a share in 2020.While this year's forecast is up big from a penny per share in profit in 2018, 4 cents is still not all that impressive. Particularly as revenue estimates call for a 1.1% decline this year and a 90 basis point gain in 2020. If these estimates come to fruition, Sprint's revenue in 2020 will be below that of its 2018 total.In other words, Sprint needs a deal with T-Mobile , otherwise it will continue flailing about in the single digits. While that may mean a 40% or 50% gain under very rosy circumstances, it still lags what other telecom stocks bring to the table, at least from an investor's perspective. The Bottom Line on Sprint Stock  Click to EnlargeSince October, the $5.50 area has buoyed Sprint stock price and did so again earlier this month. Buying Sprint near $5.50 gives us a clear risk/reward, because we know exactly what we're willing to lose. Should Sprint stock fall below $5.50, we can use the recent low of $5.44 as a point of reference. Our stop could be a dime below our entry, while allowing for a potential run back to $6 or even $6.50.There are other considerations, too. First, Sprint stock is currently holding over the 10-week, 50-week and 200-week moving averages. Those are between $5.96 and $6.01 and should act as support at the moment. If they do, a bounce back to $6.50 is on the table. If they don't, then $5.50 becomes possible.Second, I personally will not trade Sprint stock because it's entering a binary event. That is, shares could explode higher or crater lower depending on the merger ruling. I don't like binary situations and will pass on Sprint for that reason. For those that don't mind a risky, speculative setup though, $5.50 is a reasonable entry point.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-20,"The markets opened the week with more losses, with trade-war worries still on investors' minds. In particular, semiconductor stocks took a hit, but on the flip side, financials showed some resilience. It's a tricky market in the short term and one investors need to be careful with. Let's look at some must-see stock trades for Tuesday.  Must-See Stock Trades 1: T-Mobile  Click to EnlargeThe FCC chairman gave his OK for the T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) merger, sending shares higher by 3.7% and 22%, respectively. It's one more step in getting the deal done. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTMUS shares are jumping to new 52-week highs and over channel resistance on Monday. Interested buyers who were waiting for some clarity before getting long now have their chance. A pullback into prior channel resistance -- now near $77 -- could be their opportunity to get long.   * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) A larger correction down to channel support and the 50-day moving average may also be an advantageous spot to initiate a position. Must-See Stock Trades 2: Broadcom  Click to EnlargeBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has been hammered over the past few sessions. The stock fell 6% on Monday and has shed 10.5% over the last three trading days.   Where will it bottom?   I'm watching to see if AVGO will get down to $260. This $256 to $260 area has been notable over the past year, while the 50% retracement for the one-year range is at $257.70. Further, the 200-day moving average is just below at $253.76 and trending higher. While AVGO already sports an attractive dividend yield of more than 3.9%, that yield would surpass 4% on a pullback to $260. Finally, shares are entering an overbought condition.   While I don't really want to dabble much with stocks that could get caught in the trade-war crosshairs, this level offers a reasonable risk/reward in Broadcom stock.  Must-See Stock Trades 3: Burrito Breakout?  Click to EnlargeChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is flirting with a potential breakout right now. We highlighted this stock as an important one to watch given how strong it has been in the face of market-wide weakness. Learn to spot the stocks showing relative weakness. In any regard, the $721 level has kept a lid on CMG stock since April, but now shares are pushing through. Coupled with a series of higher lows and all of CMG's moving averages trending higher, and this one looks good for more upside. Look for a slightly lower open on Tuesday to see if CMG maintains or recovers this $721 level. A quick recovery likely sends it to new highs. A false breakout could send shares down to the 50-day. Must-See Stock Trades 4: AT&T I like AT&T (NYSE:T) for its cash flow and dividend, but the stock's aggressive rally on Monday morning certainly caught my eye. The stock has been moving much better over the past few sessions and Monday morning's 4% jolt was nice… at least while it lasted.  Click to EnlargeT stock has since given up most of those intraday gains, as the 200-week moving average is -- for now at least -- keeping a lid on the stock. A weekly close over $32.31 would gives us confidence more gains can be had. Otherwise, we'll have to see how T does on a pullback into the $30.40 to $31.40 area and see if it can put in another higher low. AT&T has been doing well, but Monday's pop-and-flop is a bit discouraging. Must-See Stock Trades 5: Stitch Fix  Click to EnlargeUp 5% on the day and Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) is looking better. However, the stock is far from out of the woods. Shares are lodged in a downtrend and are bouncing off channel support on Monday. I first want to see if SFIX can push through the $24 to $24.35 area. If it can, it sets up a test of its 20-day moving average and channel resistance near $25.32 to $25.50. Above that and it can gain some real momentum, but for now, I'm in the wait-and-see camp rather than the benefit-of-the-doubt camp.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential If $24 to $24.35 is resistance, look for another test of channel support.

2019-05-21,"AT&T (NYSE:T) stock has struggled over the past several years as the telecommunications giant has been weighed down by a plethora of headwinds, including cord-cutting, wireless price competition, stagnating streaming growth, and a rising debt load.Source: Shutterstock T stock peaked near $45 in mid-2016. Ever since, AT&T stock has been down and out. Today, the shares trade hands at prices that are more than 25% below those peak 2016 levels.   * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential But T stock scored a huge win recently. The proposed merger between wireless peers T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) looks like it will receive regulatory approval after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai told Bloomberg that, in light of their recent concessions, he is going to recommend that his colleagues approve the merger.That's a big win for T stock. Wireless price competition has been a huge headwind for AT&T stock, especially wireless price competition from T-Mobile and Sprint. Both of those companies have compensated for often worse coverage than AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) with aggressive price cutting. Now, those two aggressive price cutters are combining. That means the wireless telecom industry will have one less overly aggressive price cutter, indicating that price competition across the whole industry will decline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a result, the margins and stability  of AT&T's core wireless business will improve. That's a big deal for T stock because the company's mobility business generated about 40% of its revenues last year. As the revenue and margin trends of that huge business rebound over the next several quarters, T stock should rally from today's depressed base. AT&T's Mobility Trends Should ImproveAT&T has always been a really large company with a lot of moving parts. After its recent acquisition of Time Warner, its business got even bigger, with even more moving parts. Among the company's businesses are wireline. entertainment. HBO, the Turner stations., Warner Bros studio and its international assets.But its most important holding is still its mobility business, which generates about $70 billion of revenue and about $30 billion of EBITDA each year. Mobility represents roughly 40% of AT&T's revenues and over 50% of its EBITDA. Thus, integral to the success of AT&T stock is the success of AT&T's mobility business.The mobility business has done just fine over the past several years, adding several thousand wireless subscribers each year and gradually expanding its EBITDA margins from the mid-30's earlier this decade to the lower-40's last year.But this business has been held back by stiff competition. Specifically, the price discounts of T-Mobile and Sprint have become tremendously aggressive over the past few years, inevitably creating somewhat of a drag on AT&T's subscriber growth and margins. That's because some of AT&T's customers are fleeing to Sprint and T-Mobile, while AT&T has tried to stymie that trend by cutting its prices.That era is officially over. T-Mobile and Sprint will likely become one combined company in the near future, meaning that there will be one less overly aggressive price cutter  in the market. Thus, going forward, AT&T's mobility trends should improve. In other words, the business' EBITDA margins should move materially higher, driven by  less steep discounting.As those margins improve, AT&T stock price should rally. AT&T Stock Is Too Cheap to IgnoreIn a nutshell, T stock is simply too cheap to ignore, and any and all operational improvements at these valuation levels should spark a sizable rally in AT&T stock price.Here are the valuation metrics of AT&T stock:  * Forward price-earnings multiple of nine, miles below the market's average forward multiple of 16 and the stock's five-year average forward multiple of 12.  * Dividend yield of 6.3%, miles above the market yield of roughly 2% and the stock's five-year average yield of 5.4%.  * Trailing price-cash flow multiple below five, also well below the market's average cash flow multiple of 13 and the stock's five year average cash flow multiple of nearly 6.AT&T stock price is dirt cheap, with a single-digit forward earnings multiple, a 6% yield, and a cash flow yield above 20%. This stock is too cheap to ignore any operational improvements, especially any improvements by the all important mobility business. Thus, if AT&T's mobility business materially improves over the next few quarters, T stock should subsequently rise. The Bottom Line on T StockThe fundamentals underlying AT&T have been challenged by non-cyclical headwinds for the past several years, and as a result, T stock now trades at dirt-cheap valuation levels. Indeed, AT&T stock price is so cheap that any and all operational improvements  by AT&T should spark a meaningful rally by T stock.Over the next few quarters and years, AT&T's most important business - its mobility unit - could substantially improve. As it does, T stock should rise. The increases of AT&T stock price, on top of a 6%-plus yield, should make  the returns of T stock attractive over the course of the next few quarters.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T, TMUS, and S.

2019-05-21,"Until FCC chair Ajit Pai spoke on May 20, Sprint (NYSE:S) stock had been stuck at $6 for over a year. That's because in April, 2018, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) offered $6.62 per share to buy it. The all-stock deal was struck with T-Mobile at $64.52 per share. At the May 17 opening price of $75.38 for TMUS, the buyout is now worth $7.73 per share.Source: Shutterstock But none of that matters if the deal isn't done. Sprint was practically begging regulators to sign off on it in its latest quarterly report. On May 21 there are conflicting reports about the Department of Justice's attitude, some saying it's a yes, others a no.Pai's signal that he would support the merger S stock up more than 20% as trading opened yesterday, and it kept most of those gains, closing at $7.34. But T-Mobile also rose, so Sprint's value on May 21 is over $8 if the buyout goes through.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sprint Without T-MobileSprint lost 189,000 postpaid subscribers during its most recent quarter, along with $2.17 billion, 53 cents per share.  It's the kind of news most companies bury in a press release. Sprint highlighted it.  * 7 Battery Stocks for High-Powered Gains Without T-Mobile, Sprint still generated $10.4 billion in operating cash flow during fiscal 2019, ending the year with over $7 billion in cash. Sprint also reduced its debt by $2 billion during the year, to $35.36 billion, against assets of $84.1 billion.The problem is that Sprint must invest heavily to justify its spectrum investment and prepare for 5G. The company spent nearly $5 billion on the network during the year, up from $3.3 billion, so total free cash flow for the year was negative $914 million.InvestorPlace's Chris Lau notes that this means the company's plan for installing smaller cells on phone poles instead of leased towers continues. Some 30,000 have been deployed so far, meaning 80% of its precious 2.5 MHz spectrum is now sectorized in this way.But most analysts are taking the company line that Sprint's prospects are grim unless the deal gets done. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which has been selling WiFi-based mobile under its Xfinity brand, could step in, but probably at a lower price than T-Mobile is paying.Sprint made other mistakes during the last decade, going with WiMAX technology instead of LTE for 4G service, writing off $30 billion in shutting the old Nextel network, and sitting out the 600 MHz auction in 2016, leaving it without low-band spectrum.If the deal is cancelled, some see the stock going to $3. T-Mobile Without SprintWithout Sprint, T-Mobile still looks healthy. Its own quarterly report showed net additions of 1.7 million and net income of $908 million, $1.06 per share, on revenues of $11.08 billion. T-Mobile also cut its long-term debts during the year, from $12.1 to $10.95 billion, and reported positive free cash flow of $618 million.But many of T-Mobile's expansion plans have been frozen in place by the merger, whose deadline was extended again at the end of April. The Justice Department said only &quot;the investigation continues&quot; and merger opponents said the companies haven't shown it to be in the public interest.Odds that the deal goes through are now little more than 50-50 even though T-Mobile is already handing out big chunks of stock to executives in anticipation. Who Else?My guess is that, after a few drinks, you'll find AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) lobbyists chortling over this. The failure of this merger to launch would leave them each holding one-third of the U.S. wireless market, a dominant position against two much-smaller rivals.On the other hand, if the deal is rejected a larger company, like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), could decide Sprint is cheap at $12 billion, its market cap at $3 per share. That would make the phone giants choke on those chortles. Despite their size and financial strength compared with Sprint and T-Mobile, the phone giants are tiny next to the likes of FANG.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential But you can't invest in fantasy.

2019-05-21,"Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has played an essential role in communications for decades. From landlines and wireless to internet and television, Verizon and its predecessors have served generations of Americans.  This has also made VZ stock a conservative, stable investment.Source: Mike Mozart Via FlickrHowever, the rise of 5G promises to again change the company's role in American life. Due to a deeper reach into machinery and electronic components, the economy will depend even more heavily on wireless. With its massive 5G investment, VZ stock will transition to both an income and a growth stock as the company and its two largest peers solidify their oligopoly status. Verizon vs. AT&TAs I stated in a previous article, Verizon, along with AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) will become &quot;the wireless Big Three.&quot; This will occur once two things happen:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips1) Sprint (NYSE:S) will leave the scene either by takeover or decline.  2) The launch of 5G will make wireless more essential than ever to the U.S. economy.Admittedly, in the past, I have stated my preference for AT&T. The current dividend yield of about 6.6%, and the fact that T-Mobile does not pay a dividend primarily explain why. However, AT&T has also chosen to enter the content race.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential This has left that company more heavily in debt and, hence, riskier. Verizon currently holds around $113 billion in debt, much lower than AT&T's debt of approximately $176.5 billion. Moreover, with declining revenues in pay-TV and the current spending by the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) on content, AT&T's gamble could easily fail.For investors who want both a dividend and something closer to a pure-play on 5G wireless, I see VZ stock as the choice. Verizon has made some comparatively modest investments in content. Verizon Media includes sites such as AOL, Yahoo, MapQuest and Tumblr. However, that pales in comparison to AT&T's stake in Time Warner and DirecTV. With a $4.6 billion write-down of some of these media assets, Verizon has become primarily focused on its 5G future. VZ Stock Focuses Mainly on Dividend InvestorsThe dividend yield exceeding 4.1% offers a lot to income-oriented investors. Not only does the payout stand at more than double the S&P 500 average, but it also increases yearly. Verizon has raised this payout every year for the last 12 years. Even before 2007, the dividend generally trended upward, albeit more slowly.In the past, VZ stock has typically not attracted investors focused on growth. Looking at current figures, one can understand why. Analysts expect profit growth of only 0.8% this year and 2.1% in 2020. Even at a modest forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 12, buyers will not flock to VZ for that reason alone. 5G Will Turn VZ Into an Income and Growth PlayHowever, I agree with my colleague Luke Lango that 5G will change those growth numbers and that perception. 5G will power more than just laptops and mobile devices. Thanks to 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology will power more electronic devices, as well as cloud and data center services.As a result, 5G will increase the importance of wireless in people's lives. Smart appliances, self-driving cars, and numerous other electronic components will soon depend on 5G. This fact may have helped the VZ stock price rise above $58 per share in recent months.I refer to Verizon as part of the &quot;Wireless Big Three&quot; because only three companies can offer this essential service. Like the &quot;Big Three&quot; of the previous century, they will enjoy tremendous market power as part of this oligopoly. I think this will drive not only higher profit margins, but also multiple expansion for VZ stock. Also, with the tens of billions it costs to build a 5G network, I do not foresee any new market entrants. In the end, Verizon stock will further prosper because it helps make the future possible. The Bottom Line on VZ StockVZ stock will become one of the more significant income and growth stocks due to a solidifying wireless oligopoly. At a yield exceeding 4.1%, Verizon stock has already become one of the more attractive income plays. Its stable cash flows and its role in communications have bolstered that role for decades. Now the rise of 5G will expand the significance of that capacity exponentially.For investors who do not mind the risks associated with a large investment in content, I would probably choose AT&T. However, for those who feel more comfortable with the almost single-minded focus on 5G, I think VZ stock will serve income, and ultimately, growth investors well.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Look for 5G to make the coming wireless oligopoly considerably more essential and, by extension, more profitable for holders of Verizon stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-21,"U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning.Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.59%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.57%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.79%.In the options pits, call and put activity ended the day on equal footing, while overall volume fell to average levels. Specifically, about 16.2 million calls and 16 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe relative calm made an impact at the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropped to 0.65 -- a three-week low. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average inched higher to 0.72.Options activity was hot in the following three stocks: Sprint (NYSE:S), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Let's take a closer look: Sprint (S)Traders swarmed telecom stocks after the Federal Communications Chairman, Ajit Pai, said he's in favor of the $26.5 billion merger between Sprint and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) that was announced in 2018. After a volatile intraday ride, S stock ended the day up 18.8%. TMUS gained 3.87%. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) joined the rally, though their gains were pared significantly by the closing bell.  * 7 ETFs for Healthy Healthcare REITs With the surge, Sprint now sits at an eighteen month high. Before the pop, the stock was stuck in a sloppy range. Time will tell if a bona fide trend emerges. Until then, I suggest patience for Monday's gap to be digested and a better pattern to emerge.On the options trading front, puts surprisingly ruled the roost. Activity rocketed to 622% of the average daily volume, with 185,578 total contracts traded; 75% of the trading came from put options alone.With the resolution of the proposed merger now seemingly priced in, implied volatility dropped on the session to 93%. That places it at the 51st percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 43 cents or 6%. Alibaba (BABA)Trade war jitters already had Alibaba shares on the ropes, but a nasty earnings report from Chinese internet giant, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) delivered the knockout blow. The losses in BABA stock since peaking last month have now grown to 18%, placing the company's shares a stone's throw from bear market territory.Yesterday's 5.3% drubbing was enough to push the stock back below its 200-day moving average for the first time since February. With it now pushing into oversold territory, a rebound may be in the cards, but it has high odds of failing. If anything a pop back toward $170 or $175 should be eyed as a potential shorting opportunity.As far as options trading goes, calls won the day by a slim margin. Total activity grew to 191% of the average daily volume, with 383,956 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 54% of the tally.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 35% placing it at the 28th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $3.56 or 2.2%. Apple (AAPL)Apple is another victim of the latest round of tariff-induced trauma. In a client note, Credit Suisse highlighted the threat that further deterioration in the trade war poses to Apple earnings for 2019. With Greater China contributing 20% to the company's 2018 revenue and operating profit, the health of its economy is of utmost importance to Apple earnings.The recent drop in AAPL stock has it trading below all major moving averages. Watch for a break back above $192.50 resistance to signal that the short-term downtrend is reversing and bears have officially been evicted from the premises.On the options trading front, traders favored puts over calls. Activity held steady at 100% of the average daily volume, with 582,288 total contracts traded. Puts claimed 51% of the day's take.Implied volatility lifted to 33% or the 51st percentile of its one-year range. The expected daily move now stands at $3.76 or 2.1%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-22,"Sprint (NYSE:S) continues to remain in limbo. Amid a merger in jeopardy and a disappointing earnings report, Sprint stock had fallen even as that of its buyer-in-waiting, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), steadily rises. Sprint stock spiked higher on Monday as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) appeared to green light the merger.Source: Shutterstock However, with the Department of Justice (DOJ) set to block the union, Sprint has again begun to fall. Worse, given the known state of Sprint's 5G network, one has to wonder if it can remain a viable entity without the help of T-Mobile. Given these conditions, Sprint stock offers no viable investment options for shareholders. FCC, DOJ on Opposing SidesSprint stock surged higher by almost 19% in Monday trading as FCC Chairman Ajit Pai gave his approval to the merger. Before this announcement, S stock traded more than 20% below the price T-Mobile guaranteed to Sprint shareholders if the deal took place. With FCC approval, much of that gap had closed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the stock fell back by more than 3% in Wednesday trading as antitrust staffers at the DOJ recommended blocking the deal. Now, political appointees within the DOJ must decide whether to file a suit to block the agreement. Most expect a final decision within a month. Whatever happens, it brings further uncertainty to a deal seen as both controversial and inevitable. Expect Some Kind of MergerInvestors need to understand that a merger will occur whether or not a merger occurs. The government can allow T-Mobile to buy Sprint's assets. It can also let Sprint decline. If Sprint folds, some or all of the remaining 5G players could buy Sprint's assets in the bankruptcy process. As my colleague Dana Blankenhorn suggests, they could also face better-heeled players such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) buying Sprint's assets. Hence, few in the telco industry will win if the DOJ blocks the deal.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy Our own James Brumley spells out this case in greater detail. I agree with him that regulators know that the market may end up with only three 5G players regardless of their decision on the merger. Still, predicting if and when a deal occurs remains the challenge. Sprint Stock Is Not an InvestmentAs a result, Sprint stock has ceased to serve as an investment. Both the numbers and management's illustration of the network leave investors with few reasons to choose S stock over AT&T (NYSE:T) or Verizon (NYSE:VZ). CEO Michael Combes even declined to answer a question as to whether the company can offer nationwide coverage if the T-Mobile merger does not occur.By itself, this makes Sprint's 5G less valuable than that of its three direct peers. That bodes poorly for a company with $28.27 billion in book value and $36.28 billion in long-term debt.In fairness, the stocks of AT&T and Verizon also face their challenges. Due to the cost of a 5G buildout and other factors, both companies face heavy debt loads. In AT&T's case, a move into media content has placed further pressure on that equity. As a result, both stocks support low multiples.However, one can still classify those companies as investments. Lower stock prices have given both AT&T and Verizon some of the highest dividend yields in the S&P 500. Sprint cannot afford a payout at all. Moreover, both AT&T and Verizon have increased their payouts every year for decades. 5G will probably finance these dividend increases in the future. Hence, even if these equities remain somewhat depressed, they can still deliver shareholder return. A Deal Is the Only Hope for Sprint StockThe merger has become the only known possibility for Sprint stock to deliver further significant upside. Since holders of S stock will receive 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile stock, this translates into a purchase price of about $7.85 per share as of the time of this writing. With the current Sprint stock price of around $7 per share, that represents a premium of almost 12%. Without the deal, traders will probably watch Sprint become the Sears Holdings (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) of the wireless industry as it gradually bleeds out.  * 7 Athletic Apparel Stocks With Marathon Pace In the end, we do not know what regulators will do. Hence, I mostly agree with my colleague Vince Martin that Sprint stock has become a gamble. However, I see this as a poor gamble, as we do not know when government regulators will make their final decision. The Bottom Line on Sprint StockSprint stock offers little hope for investor returns outside of the formal approval of the T-Mobile merger. Given its financial condition, Sprint will struggle to build a nationwide 5G network without some help. Hence, a takeover of some kind will likely occur regardless of what regulators may think.This leaves holders of Sprint stock with only gambling instead of investing options. They either bet on government approval, or they witness an almost-certain drop into penny-stock status. With the FCC and DOJ at cross purposes, what will happen is anyone's guess.People who want to gamble might have better luck (and certainly more fun) at a blackjack table. Those who wish to invest will likely see higher returns in the equities of AT&T, Verizon or that of their prospective suitor.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-22,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concessions by T-Mobile US Inc to win U.S. government approval to buy Sprint Corp will likely lead to higher prices for the poorest Americans, many of whom use prepaid wireless plans, analysts and activists said.  The more expensive prepaid plans, used by people who lack the good credit to qualify for a cheaper postpaid plan means low-income users will have less access to the internet for job hunts and job applications, and for children to do homework, activists say.  T-Mobile and Sprint said on Monday they would sell Sprint's Boost Mobile business, which sells prepaid plans, and ensure that the divested company has access to a wireless network for six years.","T-Mobile-Sprint deal would boost prices, hurt poorest U.S. consumers, experts say"

2019-05-22,"Telecom heavyweights T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) captured headlines and received a big lift in the markets. In a stroke of good fortune, Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai recommended approving their $26 billion merger. But as great as this news is for TMUS and Sprint speculators, sector giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock also received much love.Source:  Via FlickrGranted, the scale is completely different. T-Mobile shares jumped nearly 4% on the news, while Sprint went berserk, gaining almost 19%. On the other hand, the VZ stock price increased a modest 1.6%. It was a similar tale with telecom leader AT&T (NYSE:T), which eked out a 1.2% single-day profit.But why would this merger help either AT&T or Verizon stock? The combined T-Mobile-Sprint entity will have a wireless-subscription base of 125 million customers. AT&T won't feel immediately threatened with their 148 million subscribers. But Verizon has 118 million subs, which would put it last in this three-way race.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNevertheless, it's important to recognize market sentiment here. Despite the sudden presence of a third stalwart in the mix, the VZ stock price went up, not down. I don't think this swing, albeit a small one, is an anomaly.For one thing, Verizon is the dominant leader in the 4G network, with 70% coverage. There's quite a gap from there to T-Mobile in the number-two slot, with 59%. Plus, VZ delivered the world's first 5G service, giving it a leg up on the competition. That's one reason not to worry about Verizon stock.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) The other reason is customer loyalty. Here, T-Mobile wins but Verizon holds a strong second. Combined with the coverage-advantage, VZ stock is compelling. VZ Stock Is Fundamentally Critical to National InterestsBut for me, the overriding factor supporting the bull case for Verizon stock is the ultra-long-term national interest. Pai listed out his agency's top goals during the merger-approval announcement, stating, &quot;Two of the F.C.C.'s top priorities are closing the digital divide in rural America and advancing United States leadership in 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity.&quot;I don't think you can overemphasize this point: the U.S. must win the technology race if it wants to maintain its global economic and military dominance. Our fiercest adversaries, China and Russia, already have strategized their vision that extends decades. Based on the priorities of the President Donald Trump administration (ie. the wall), we may be desperately behind.Therefore, it's critical that we not only build out our 5G network, but that we decisively lead the sector. Obviously, with Verizon taking that key first step, this embodies the leadership our government wants and needs. You can easily expect support at the highest level, which bodes extremely well for the VZ stock price.Really, it's the same argument for AT&T. Recently, I mentioned that T shares represent more than a mere investment. When you have Russian President Vladimir Putin essentially stating that he's going to do his level best to win in artificial intelligence, these telecom giants immediately take on more significance.With AT&T or Verizon stock, you don't need to get complicated: we have to win and win bigly in 5G. This groundbreaking platform is the backbone of all technologies of tomorrow. If we're going to do anything -- be it AI, automation, or robotics -- we must implement the best telecommunications network.I would say that anything short of that jeopardizes national security because the pace of innovation is exponential. Verizon Stock or AT&T?If you've decided to invest in telecom -- and it's a very wise decision -- you now have a choice: assuming you're going with the leaders, do you pick Verizon stock or AT&T?Both names are similar in their size, fundamental importance and potential reach. While some analysts may swing one way or the other, I think it comes down to risk tolerance.Obviously, AT&T carries more risk because it has much more debt than VZ stock. That said, I'm more convinced that the former has made relatively smarter choices in their acquisitions. For instance, while the DirecTV buyout has not panned out well, it has some possibility of at least breaking even.I say that because streaming isn't a complete panacea. It has drawbacks, such as requiring expensive high-speed internet, and limited access in remote areas. On the other hand, Verizon buying out assets like Yahoo probably has no chance of redemption.Still, Verizon stock is on paper the safer way to go. Based on how critical 5G technology is and will be, you can't go wrong with either giant.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AT&T stock.

2019-05-23,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in January 2019. It has been republished to reflect the current market sentiment for, what we believe, are long-tail investment ideas.]With the trade war raging, investors can't be blamed for wanting to play some defense. Even when the markets are having one of their green days lately, volatility has been looming. As such, people are buying some more stable stocks, such as the phone companies.Telecom stocks are known for their conservative nature. Even during bear markets and recessions, people tend to keep paying for their phones and internet connections. As such, telecom stocks are a solid place to take shelter during volatile market storms. The fact that most telecoms are dividend stocks, sometimes yielding excess of 5%, only adds to the appeal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend With all that in mind, what telecom stocks are looking good as we head deeper into 2019? Telecom Stocks To Buy Now: T-Mobile (TMUS)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)Let's start off with the telecom stocks to buy in the United States. Unfortunately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has run up recently and is no longer a strong value at this price. Meanwhile, AT&T (NYSE:T) has bet the farm on content with the Time Warner deal and is not a good choice for risk-averse telecom investors.That leaves us with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S). For years now, there has been talk about how the two need to merge to stay competitive with AT&T and Verizon. It appears that the deal is finally coming to fruition now.On Monday, FCC head Ajit Pai said that: &quot;In light of the significant commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint as well as the facts in the record to date, I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it.&quot; The deal is far from a sure thing. There is talk that the DOJ still has misgivings about the potential merger. But in general, the odds now appear to favor the government approving the long-discussed merger.Both T-Mobile and Sprint have struggled to achieve the sort of profitability that the larger two telecom players have obtained. However, combining T-Mobile's nearly 60 million subscribers with Sprint's 40 million would take the company to 100 million, overtaking AT&T to become number two player in the country. T-Mobile believes it can achieve a whopping $6 billion in yearly cost synergies out of the deal, giving it plenty of funds for robust 5G deployment along with, hopefully, dividends and perhaps a share buyback.TMUS stock looks expensive on a standalone basis now, but once it gets Sprint integrated, the company should be a huge profit generator. Telus (TU)Source: Shutterstock Vancouver, Canada-based Telus (NYSE:TU) is a strong choice for yield-seeking telecom investors. The company pays a 4.5% dividend and is gaining market share in its home country. It's supported by solid organic business growth. Telus sported 9.2 million paying subscribers at the end of 2018. That's a gain of around 200,000 subs since the end of 2017 and an increase of half a million since 2016. Telus has benefited from some of the lowest customer churn in the North American telecom industry, keeping customer acquisition costs in line while growing the user base.Telus stock has been off to a good start in 2019. Shares are up 13% year to date. But don't let the recent strength scare you off. Over the past five years, TU stock has consistently traded between $30 and $40, so the $37 share price is pretty muted. Why hasn't TU stock broken out to new highs yet?For one thing, there has been tons of talk about the Canadian &quot;housing bubble&quot; popping. Home prices, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver, have surged in recent years. Government action to cool the market has led to a reversal in prices. This could lead to a recession. Canadian housing data in 2019 is looking particularly ugly so far.Oil prices have been pretty spotty as well, and the Canadian government has taken some anti-oil measures that have led to job losses and economic slowdown in that key industry.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors That said, telecom stocks hold up during recessions. People keep using their phones regardless. With that 4.5% dividend yield and selling at less than 12x forward earnings, TU stock is a buy on any weakness. China Unicom (CHU)Source: Maher Najm via FlickrIt's no secret that the ongoing U.S.-China trade war has put a hex on Chinese stocks. While most of the focus has gone to beaten-down Chinese tech companies, that's not the only place where we can go bargain shopping.For example, look at China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), a leading Chinese mobile carrier. CHU stock started the year at $10.50. It rallied to as far as $13.50 in March as U.S.-China relations were looking up. Now, however, the stock has slumped back to $10.50 as American investors don't want anything to do with Chinese shares.That said, the company, as of its recent semi-annual results, is posting strong numbers despite concerns about the Chinese economy. Its service revenue grew by 8.3%, for example, which was more than double the pace of the industry overall. EBITDA and free cash flow both grew by 5%. For a telecom companies these are fine numbers indeed, especially in a so-so economy.Prior to the trade war, China Unicom stock was trading around $14. Just a couple months ago, it almost reached that level again. From the current $10.50 share price, it's not hard to see a path to 25-30% gains later this year once the trade war is resolved.There's also the possibility that China Unicom may pair up with China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) to combine the second and third largest players in the Chinese market. With the rollout of expensive nationwide 5G networks on the way, this would help the two smaller players stay competitive and save money to compete against behemoth China Mobile (NYSE:CHL). In any case, don't overlook the Chinese mobile carriers as a way to play a fast-growing telecom market with huge mobile data demand.The trade war drama is a negative. Additionally, the FCC has already blocked China Mobile's bid to offer service in the U.S. on national security grounds, adding another question mark for the industry. Tension is high, but this won't drag on forever, and when it ends, CHU stock will make gains. Telefonica (TEF)Source: Shutterstock It was a rotten, no-good year for emerging markets in 2018. If anything, 2019 has gotten off to a worse start. China is dragging down emerging markets around the globe, and the strong U.S. dollar is another headwind. Europe's economy is struggling as well. Hence, Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) put in an underwhelming performance.Telefonica derives 24% of its business from Spain, 14% from Germany and 13% from the U.K., with most of the rest coming from assorted countries in Latin America. These economies have largely been mediocre to bad in recent years.However, with sustained underperformance comes opportunity. Economic activity tends to revert, and there have been some recent signs of life in various Telefonica markets, notably Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The company's operating income has quietly rebounded from just 3.5 billion Euros in 2015 to 5.5 billion in 2016 and 6.8 billion Euros in 2017 before a slight dip recently due to currency swings and restructuring charges.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential TEF stock has slid a bit in 2019 thanks to the weakness in emerging markets. The current $8 share price is just 5% or so above 52-week lows. That's also way down from the $15 level where it generally traded between 2012 and 2015. Regardless, profitability has been picking up and the company is one of the most widely diversified telecoms out there. It wouldn't take much for TEF stock to catch a bid. Additionally, it has historically paid extremely generous dividends and currently offers a 5% yield. Telecom Stocks To Buy Now: BT Group (BT)Source: Shutterstock For many American investors, BT Group (NYSE:BT) is overshadowed by the U.K's other telecom giant, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). But don't sleep on BT. The $25 billion market cap BT Group has a rather impressive business of its own. And besides, Vodafone, with its recent dividend cut, has some problems at the moment.Turning to BT, it has its mobile business, enterprise division, international subsidiaries and so on. But its crown jewel is Openreach, which controls the phone cables and telecom pipes across Britain. This gives it an effective monopoly over the so-called last mile of connectivity. The British government was considering making BT divest this most powerful asset, but so far, it appears the worst of the regulatory storm has passed.Despite that, BT stock is down from more than $30 a share a few years ago to just $13 now. Much of this has been due to Brexit concerns. Businesses in particular have spent less in preparation for a potential slowdown in the British economy. BT's Italian subsidiary also was hit with an accounting scandal.Regardless, the selling is way overdone, as the company remains strongly profitable and has maintained its greater than 6% dividend yield despite the share price decline. The stock fell another 10% on its recent earnings report, setting up a dip-buying opportunity. From the low $13's, where the stock currently trades, Goldman Sachs sees nearly 50% upside. That, plus the dividend, would be a nice return indeed.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned TEF, BT, and VOD stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-05-23,"My InvestorPlace colleague Luke Lango recently laid out a compelling argument why AT&T (NYSE:T) is too cheap to ignore. Never a fan of AT&T, I've given his case the fair consideration it deserves. Lango's good at what he does and if he thinks AT&T stock is ready to pop, I ought to at least consider his argument.Source: Shutterstock In a nutshell, Lango views the pending green light of the merger between T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) as excellent news for AT&T because it removes a major price cutter from the wireless equation; a headwind that's weighed on T stock for some time. He goes on to say that AT&T's mobility business generates 40% of the company's revenue and 50% of its EBITDA. With one less competitor to deal with, it's likely that its EBITDA margins will move higher in the future due to less discounting in the mobility marketplace.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Higher margins and revenue combined with dirt cheap financial metrics, and you've got the makings of a good value stock. For example, Lango points out it's got a 6.3% dividend yield, three times the average dividend yield for the market itself. In other words, you're getting paid handsomely to wait for T stock's revival. Also, its forward P/E and P/CF are both well below the market averages and its historical five-year average, making it hard to deny there's unlocked value in AT&T stock.  What About Debt?Value isn't just about higher margins, less competitive headwinds, etc. It's also about the strength of the balance sheet. If I'm looking at two companies and one has a forward P/E and P/CF of 20 and 8, respectively, and the other has a forward P/E and P/CF of 15 and 6; based on a value supposition, I'm going to go for the latter stock every day of the week.However, if the latter stock's net debt was $168.9 billion in the most recent quarter or 71% of its market cap, and the former stock's net debt was $111.3 billion or 45% of its market cap, the extra leverage of the latter's stock makes the former a better value on a relative basis due to its superior balance sheet. The latter stock in this example is AT&T and the former is Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The forward P/E and P/CF aren't those of the two wireless carriers. They were merely meant to illustrate why valuation metrics based on price don't always tell the entire story.The real metrics, according to Morningstar, are as follows:AT&T Forward P/E = 9.0Verizon Forward P/E = 12.5AT&T P/CF = 5.0Verizon P/CF = 7.1     The question for investors interested in AT&T stock is whether the 28% discount on the forward P/E and 30% discount on P/CF is worth it given AT&T uses significantly more leverage to generate its earnings and cash flow. Furthermore, Verizon currently yields 4.1%, which isn't bad for a company that utilizes far less leverage to pay for these dividends. Getting back to Lango's argument about the merger removing the discounting headwind from AT&T's sails, the same effect would apply to Verizon. AT&T might generate more free cash flow than Verizon, but it does it at the expense of the balance sheet. Furthermore, AT&T's cash flow as a percentage of revenue is virtually the same as Verizon's, which means it's not doing a better job generating cash flow than its biggest competitor. Is AT&T Stock Too Cheap to Ignore?If you're looking for less risk, Verizon is the better stock to buy.Sure, AT&T might have paid down $538 million in net debt (repayment less issuance) in the first quarter, but that's a drop in the bucket for a company with $169 billion in net debt. If you're an AT&T investor, you better hope that interest rates don't move higher, because if they do, it's in a whole heap of trouble. Value sometimes comes at a price.

Sprint (NYSE:S) wasn't far behind though, with its 7.6% setback after the Department of Justice recommended its impending merger with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) be blocked.While not nearly as many, there were a handful of winners on Wednesday. Chief among them was Target (NYSE:TGT). Shares of the retailer rallied almost 8% yesterday on the heels of an encouraging Q1 print.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy None of those names are especially compelling trading prospects headed into today's session, however. Rather, it's the stock charts of Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) that are worth the closer looks. Under Armour (UAA)Athletic apparel company Under Armour is a well-known brand, but years of expensive decisions caught up with the company in 2016. Nervous investors finally expressed their concern with a steep selloff.Under Armour finally started to work on its issues in 2017, and investors responded accordingly. That is, UAA stock began to rise again. A technical ceiling has taken shape in the meantime though, and while it's a clear problem, it's also a clear potential catalyst if it can be hurdled. And, the stock is catching a pretty healthy tailwind.  Click to Enlarge  * The technical ceiling in question is around $24.60, near where UAA has topped out several times since the middle of last year. That line is plotted in blue on both stock charts.  * Although it hasn't been able to break above $24.60 yet, UAA has left behind a trail of higher lows. The most recent low was made by a push up and off the white 200-day moving average line, highlighted on the daily chart.  * The tide is bullish, but there's a gap from last week that needs to be filled, and for Under Armour shares, volatility is the norm. Any breakout may not take shape straightaway. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS)Monday's tumble from Cadence Design Systems shares could have been chalked up as an effort to close the bullish gap left behind in April. Generally speaking, the market doesn't like to leave gaps unfilled. That selloff was a good start to that effort, even if it didn't actually touch that all-important April 22 low of $64.27.The gap still hasn't been filled either, as CDNS bounced a bit on Tuesday, and Wednesday's lull wasn't terribly devastating. The tendency to fill in gaps, however, may have done some other technical damage to Cadence Design Systems that will lead to more downside anyway.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy   Click to Enlarge  * The chief damage done is the move below the 50-day moving average line, plotted in purple on both stock charts. That line appears to be something of a technical ceiling now.  * Underscoring the way the tide has turned is the volume surges behind Monday's and Wednesday's selloffs.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart it's easy to see just how overbought CDNS was as of last month, and how vulnerable it was and still is to profit-taking. Shares rallied 70% from their December low to their early May high. Nordstrom (JWN)At first glance, Wednesday's big stumble from Nordstrom would be alarming. It has been one of the bigger victims of the so-called retail apocalypse, and shares have been underperforming for years. A disappointing Q1 only underscores that worry.Yet, a closer look at yesterday's 9.2% setback -- and the lead into it -- suggests that sharp loss may actually be something of a capitulation that ultimately turns into a buying opportunity.  Click to Enlarge  * Wednesday's bar was a doji, where the open and close are in the middle of the bar. This indicates that an equilibrium between the buyers and the sellers was met. The volume spike yesterday is also something often seen at key pivot points.  * On the weekly chart, we can see JWN hit a new multi-year low, falling under 2016's low of just under $35. In many cases, traders are waiting to see prior lows met or exceeded before stepping back in.  * Also on the weekly chart, it's clear that the RSI line doesn't stay in an oversold state for very long.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-28,"For a brief few days, it looked as if Nokia (NYSE:NOK) might be on the mend. Off nearly 30% from its January peak as of mid-May, NOK stock bounced nearly 10% after the U.S. banned imported products made by rival Huawei.Source: Shutterstock That budding uptrend, however, was up-ended on Thursday, with Nokia stock tumbling 3.0% for no news-driven reason.It's difficult to ferret out the impact the broad market tide has had on NOK stock. At times the Nokia stock price has moved in tandem with the herd; other times, it hasn't. Shares have been particularly weak since March, and downright terrible since late April, severely underperforming the overall market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat disconnect, however, may also prove to be an opportunity right now, in an environment that looks and feels more bearish than not. Indeed, the trip back to the consensus target price of $6.54 is a relatively short and straightforward one, especially given the news backdrop. Lots of Bark, Not Much BiteIt's not without its problems. Chief among them is the bevy of class-action lawsuits in preparation right now, arguing that Nokia's due diligence regarding the 2015 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent was inadequate. The company disclosed in March that some Alcatel-Lucent practices were concerning, and possibly not compliant with all applicable laws.  * 4 Reasons the Next 12 Months Will Make or Break AT&T Stock In the meantime, Nokia has fallen into the same quagmire as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), facing lawsuits that claim the company -- in violation of U.S. antitrust law -- conspired with other patent holders to improperly inflate the price of some of its wireless connectivity technologies used in automobiles. The EU's antitrust regulators, at the request of Daimler (OTCMKTS:DMLRY), are also probing the same possibility in preparation of a suit.There's probably something to it. The proverbial &quot;pushing of the envelope&quot; is the norm on the modern technology landscape, with collusion (spoken and unspoken) not being entirely uncommon and lawsuits -- merited or not -- serving as a means of disrupting rivals. Even the venerable Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently lost a fairly flimsy patent suit against Qualcomm, extending a long-standing saga between the two tech giants.As history has shown though -- particularly with Qualcomm and Apple -- these patent-driven problems mean very little in the end. Apple's total liability with its recent loss to Qualcomm? Only $31 million -- petty cash for the multi-billion dollar company.Indeed, not even regulatory bodies wield as big of a weapon as the headlines generally imply, setting the stage for what could be an easy rebound for NOK stock, especially in light of the United States' recent ban on China's Huawei-made technology.Don't be too detracted by the headlines. With Huawei Out of the Way…Not even Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri was willing to say exactly how much he thought it might prove a boon to the company. But, he was willing to say that with Huawei's 5G tech out of the picture for the time being, &quot;Perhaps there is long term opportunity.&quot;He was underselling the prospect.The world has largely responded to the White House's plea to assist it in keeping China, via Huawei, in check. Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) is re-scrutinizing its business relationship with the company. Google, which maintains the Android operating system employed by Huawei smartphones, will for the time being not facilitate any OS updates of Huawei devices. UK-based chipmaker ARM is suspending business with China's Huawei as well, accommodating the United States' action.These are all actions that will indirectly be interpreted as positives for Nokia, because they are.Not that the company wasn't already making some bigger waves on its own. Even as Suri suggested Nokia is a few weeks behind in the 5G race, he also noted at this month's shareholder meeting that NOK now has &quot;37 5G commercial contracts -- 20 with named customers including T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), AT&T (NYSE:T), STC, and Telia -- and more than half of them include wider portfolio elements that our competitors cannot match.&quot; Looking Ahead for NOK StockNOK stock still travels in something of a vacuum, doing its own thing rather than the market's thing. This could be good, or bad, or both, depending on the backdrop.Given the opportunity and the technical context at hand, however, it's difficult to think Nokia stock won't be back at $6.54 sooner than later; its sheer volatility may do most of that work. Zooming out to the weekly chart of Nokia stock it's clear that wild, wide swings are the norm.Also note that the upper edge of the two-year trading range is around $6.64, just above the consensus target of $6.54. That leaves NOK stock plenty of leeway.Again, the lawsuits mean little, in the end. The addition of several new 5G contracts on top of previously-made ones, however, is just the kind of rhetoric that can lift a stock out of the drugs.To that end, analysts are hopeful again.  * 7 Stocks to Buy From One of America's Best Pension Funds While revenue is expected to slip about 3% this year, the pros say it will grow by the same amount next year. That should drive this year's projected profit of 25 cents per share of NOK stock to 39 cents next year, on the heels of Nokia's 5G ramp-up. The company wouldn't even really have to turn that revenue into a meaningful profit though. The mere promise should be enough.Welcome to the game… understanding the difference between news and noise, and figuring out how the crowd is going to interpret each.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-28,Investors focused on the Computer and Technology space have likely heard of T Mobile US TMUS but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers One simple way to answer this question is to take a look at the year to date performance of TMUS and the rest of,Has T-Mobile US (TMUS) Outpaced Other Computer and Technology Stocks This Year?
2019-05-28,"These days there are plenty of varied viewpoints and conversations on where Sprint (NYSE:S) is heading. But for bullish investors committed to doing more than just talk, a marriage of call options in Sprint stock to gain long exposure looks like smart business. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock The proposed $26 billion merger between mobile telecom disruptor T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), the country's third-largest provider, and the market's distant fourth outfit, Sprint, has been one filled with public opinion over the past year. But on the heels of last Monday's unexpected favorable verdict by the Federal Communications Commission, that debate has intensified.From gloomy Gus anti-trust types to optimistic advocates that see an already oligopolistic industry controlled by Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile as becoming more competitive and fair for consumers under the deal's pledged key concessions, the S stock merger discussion is a hot topic to say the least.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs it stands for Sprint stock, all eyes and ears are waiting on the Department of Justice to chime in with its ruling following the more influential FCC's blessing. When that verdict will be announced is anybody's guess, but it's likely to happen sooner rather than later.If the DOJ approves the deal, the merger has an assigned value of .01056 TMUS shares for every one share owned of S stock. As of Friday's close, and with T-Mobile at $77.27, that makes Sprint stock worth $8.16 upon a blessing from the DOJ.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement On the other hand, if regulators refute the FCC's decision, the consensus view is S stock would quickly be worth a good deal less. Compared to Friday's close of $7.16, a year ago and just prior to the first whiff of a merger with TMUS, shares of Sprint were trading under $5. What's more, many pros see that price as a gift to S stock investors if the deal is nixed. Sprint Stock Monthly Price Chart    Click to EnlargeTo be clear and what the provided monthly chart doesn't show, Sprint stock has much larger-than-normal chance for increased gap risk. That type of volatility can work both ways. But based on what has been discussed, downside exposure does appear to be much larger than the reward potential for holding long S shares. That's concerning, but it's also not all that matters.Assigning the likelihood of one outcome versus the other is key to investing in Sprint. Is S stock a 50/50 gamble like InvestorPlace's Dana Blankenhorn wrote in a recent article? Could Sprint be a much more bullishly conceived situation as drawn up by Luke Lango? Or are the odds really stacked in the bears' favor? Similar to Dana, I'm on the fence. Admittedly though, the chart is tempting.The monthly chart shows Sprint stock's reaction high to the FCC ruling challenged but failed to break above Fibonacci-based and angular trend-line resistance. That's a technical obstacle until it is overcome. Moreover, given the $8.16 target price for S shares based on TMUS' Friday close is within this resistance area, that's a dollar of profit or 14% return without requiring a full-blown breakout.Technically, that's not all Sprint stock has going for it either. Sprint Stock Daily Chart  Click to EnlargeSprint stock's daily chart shows a simple pullback pattern has formed. And with Friday's technical signal confirming a low off price support is in place, Sprint bulls appear to have the trading edge right now. Nevertheless, bullish investors should be cautious.Ultimately, deal stocks like Sprint do have a history of challenging traders committed to the price chart for buying and selling decisions. That can't be stressed enough. Furthermore, S stock's options market isn't indicating any sort of advantage to the bull case in terms of volume, open interest or volatility skew.  * 10 Top Pot Stocks to Buy With caveats in place, if bullish investors are inclined to position long in S shares I'd recommend the options market. One opportunity that fits in nicely with the situation on the Sprint stock charts is marrying the long June $7.50 call with a short June $8.00 call. This union forms a bull vertical call spread that reduces and limits risk to a finite dollar amount … which in our estimation looks 100% like smart business.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-05-30,"Despite its decades-long presence, AT&T (NYSE:T) has become a risky investment. AT&T stock faces a crushing debt burden and high dividend obligations as it experiences a fundamental transformation in its industry. Even after recovery from the December lows, the stock price has fallen by more than 25% from its 2016 peak.Source: Shutterstock However, its challenges appear manageable. Moreover, I think the potential of 5G could turn the stock around. Hence, AT&T should rise above the following three risks to the future of the company. Service BundlesVerizon (NYSE:VZ) took a less costly strategy in making 5G wireless the focus of the company. AT&T paid $85 billion for Time Warner and $48.5 billion for DirecTV. With these purchases (and the debt that comes with them), AT&T has taken a riskier strategy in trying to sell service bundles.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June Our own Laura Hoy has outlined the risks and possible payoffs of this strategy well. I think she has a more optimistic view of this gamble as I worry about content costs. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has placed intense pressure on its balance sheet to stay ahead in the content race. The costs AT&T will face in fighting this battle could weigh further on the stock.However, I see it as a risk that makes sense. If this move pays off, AT&T will own a powerful ecosystem, as Hoy says. However, if it fails, the company holds options. Time Warner's content assets will still hold value, while DirecTV can reach those without other forms of broadband access. If AT&T needs to sell either of these assets, I see the worst-case scenario of the bundle option as a manageable loss. Sprint/T-Mobile MergerThe profit margins of all the major telcos have long taken a beating as competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) forced both AT&T and Verizon to cut costs, and by extension, profit margins. Bulls in AT&T stock felt hopeful that the long-awaited union of T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE:S) would finally happen with the approval of the Federal Communications Commission.However, with the Department of Justice wanting to block the merger on antitrust concerns, prospects from the merger remain in doubt.I do not think owners of AT&T stock have to worry. As I said in a previous article, a merger will occur in all likelihood even if a merger does not happen. Sprint remains heavily in debt. They likely cannot gain the financing to upgrade their network by themselves. If their situation forces them to liquidate, the other three major telcos will buy their assets.Some have floated the possibility that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could buy Sprint. This could happen. However, the tens of billions in costs required for a 5G buildout would put place tremendous pressure on either firm despite massive cash reserves.Sprint also holds nearly $40 billion in debt. Couple that with likely competition, and it becomes a huge expense that probably will yield little profit. FinancialsWithout question, high debt levels have hampered AT&T stock. AT&T holds over $175 billion in debt vs. just under $114 billion for Verizon. Further, Verizon's supports a dividend yield of almost 4.1%. AT&T's payout comes in at over 6.3%. Moreover, since the company has hiked this dividend every year for the last 34 years, any end to that streak would devastate AT&T stock.However, thanks to the discounted stock price, AT&T trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just 8.9. It also trades at about five times cash flow, well under the S&P 500's average of about 14.Investors should also note that the company earned almost $20 billion last year and generated more than $22.8 billion in free cash flow. This allows AT&T to meet $13.8 billion in dividend obligations, thus benefitting shareholders.Also, analysts predict an average profit growth rate of 2.53% per year over the next five years. While that sounds lackluster, it should keep AT&T out of trouble. That estimate could also rise once more customers switch to 5G.AT&T and its peers have each spent tens of billions on network construction. That investment will soon pay off. Once the network starts earning ever larger profits, not only will the company meet dividend and debt obligations, but it also should send AT&T stock much higher in the coming years. Concluding Thoughts on AT&T StockBoth business and financial uncertainty face AT&T. Still, I think Wall Street has overreacted to the three biggest concerns surrounding the company. The gamble with service bundles remains risky, but they can afford to take that risk. Moreover, the company's position in wireless remains stable no matter the outcome of the proposed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. Further, while AT&T's debts and dividend obligations should cause concern, but I think the company can manage those issues.It should overcome these challenges thanks to the potential of 5G wireless, which will become an indispensable part of the economy and cars, factories, health care facilities, smart cities, and other critical applications will depend on the technology.Like the internet and the smartphone before it, once the public adopts 5G, they will have trouble imagining their lives without it. Best of all, we will likely have a world with only three 5G companies, creating what I called a &quot;wireless Big Three&quot; in previous articles.In the end, AT&T offers a massive dividend. It also gives stockholders ownership of what will become a powerful oligopoly at a bargain multiple. That in itself makes it a risk worth taking.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-05-31,"Since early 2017, Sprint (NYSE:S) stock has been on a downward trajectory. The price has gone from $9.25 to $6.90. But recently, the Sprint stock price has gotten a lift. Apparently, the prospects look more promising that its $26 billion merger with rival T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) will get done.Source: Shutterstock Keep in mind that the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has recently indicated his support. This was then backed up from FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr. For approval, there needs to be three votes.All this has come after Sprint and T-Mobile have agreed to some important concessions, which include the following:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Sprint will maintain its wireless distribution deal with cable provider, Altice USA (NYSE:ATUS).  * The companies would commit to having their 5G network cover 85% of rural America in three years and 90% within six years. There would also be broadband access -- at a minimum of 100 megabits per second -- for 90% of Americans.  * There will be the sale of the Boost Mobile business, which is focused on prepaid customers (there are about seven million). This is critical since T-Mobile already has a strong position in this market.     * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War   *  Sprint and the DOJWhile the approval of the FTC would be very good news for Sprint stock, and it does look likely, there is another hurdle. The Department of Justice will also need to approve the deal and this may prove to be much tougher. There are already indications that the DOJ is skeptical about the deal, as it could lead to higher prices.It's important to note that the FTC and DOJ have different roles when it comes to dealing with mergers. For the FTC, it has the authority to look beyond market impacts, such as how the transaction could lead to higher quality offerings or broader access. The DOJ, on the other hand, is more focused on the adverse impact on consumers.  For the most part, it's about classic antitrust analysis.With the merger of TMUS and Sprint, there will only be three key wireless players remaining in the US, which will include Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). This reduced competition could easily lead to higher prices and fees as well as less innovation. For example, back in 2011 the DOJ blocked AT&T's attempted acquisition of T-Mobile because of concerns of lower competition in the U.S. market. Bottom Line on Sprint StockThe final determination of the TMUS-S merger should come soon - say within a month or so. But it does look like a toss-up. The fact is that investing based on regulatory outcomes can be dicey, especially for highly concentrated industries.The problem for Sprint stock is that the company really needs this deal to happen. It has a massive debt load of to $35.36 billion; the market share is a lowly No. 4, and there will likely be a need to raise substantial amounts of capital for the 5G buildout.As for the merger, the potential upside is about $8 for Sprint stock or a 16% increase from current levels (this is based on the stock-for-stock exchange ratio of .01056). This is fairly decent but really does not seem like enough to account for the risks that the deal will implode.Now it's true that there still may ultimately be a deal, say with a company like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). But these companies would probably be more interested in the spectrum assets - not other parts of the business. And this would not lead to much of a boost in the valuation.In other words, it's probably best to stay away from Sprint stock for now.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-06-03,"It's an interesting time to be a stakeholder of Sprint (NYSE:S). For years, the mobile firm ran as an afterthought behind telecommunications leaders AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). As a result, the Sprint stock price has swung all over the map.Source: Shutterstock However, S stock has seen a resurgence in recent weeks. For starters, regulatory approval is the only hurdle left to merge Sprint with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Falling consistently behind the aforementioned leaders, a combined S-TMUS entity would present a viable competitor to the current de facto duopoly.More importantly, Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai recommended that the agency approve the $26 billion. Part of his reasoning was that both Sprint and T-Mobile promised to expand rural broadband service. And with such a high-level supporting voice, the Sprint stock price skyrocketed, putting a smile on beleaguered shareholders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War From perusing various analyst commentary, the consensus appears that the merger will receive the regulatory greenlight. Not only did Pai give the thumbs up, but the deal makes economic and practical sense.However, opposing voices are also prominent. Earlier this year, several Democrats complained that the merger would hurt the consumer. They have a point. Right now, four companies dominate the U.S. telecom sector. A merger would bring that number down to three, or a huge 25% loss.Fewer competitors lead to less incentives to compete. Unsurprisingly, the Sprint stock price was flat to declining before Pai's bullish take.Even now, critics of the deal from the entire political spectrum have forwarded their reasons why the merger will fall through. This is generally the reason why I don't like speculating on mergers: you never know how these things will turn out. The Bull Case for Sprint StockStill, Pai's supportive voice represents a significant catalyst. True, the FCC isn't a monarchy so investors shouldn't pounce on a single opinion. But let's be real: that's a very important and influential one.Moreover, the overriding reality is that our telecom industry is a duopoly. Verizon fired the first shot in the race for the 5G rollout, but AT&T isn't far behind. The latter levers vast communications networks that affords it credibility in implementing this technological paradigm shift.As such, T-Mobile is waffling around in the rear-view mirror. Plus, that situation risks exacerbation on an exponential scale. I say that because technology flies at lightning speed. You only need to reference Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) troubles in rolling out their next-generation chips. Falling behind is almost a death sentence in this arena.Here, you just have to look at the basic differentials in scope. AT&T has an enterprise value of $411 billion. T-Mobile has $75 billion, while Sprint is looking at $62 billion.A key reason why S stock has floundered in the markets is that the underlying company has signaled the obvious: they can't roll out 5G on their own. Therefore, allowing this dynamic to persist would heighten AT&T and Verizon's duopolistic advantage. That, in turn, is bad for consumer pricing.Naturally, if the merger goes through, you'll probably want exposure to Sprint stock. As the worst of the best, the embattled telecom firm will piggyback off the deal. Geopolitics Is a Tailwind for S StockAgain, I must reiterate: I don't like to speculate on mergers. No matter how reasonable your thesis, your thesis simply doesn't matter. Multiple factors could influence the final decision, including and especially politics.But here, I think recent international developments bolster the case for Sprint stock. Of course, everyone in the media has focused on the deteriorating U.S.-China trade war. But in this coming pain, we can extract a useful lesson: China is not our friend.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault More broadly, the trade war has taught Americans that energy independence is just one cog in the economic gear. The next most relevant goal is technological independence.It's interesting to note that Pai stated that 5G represents a top priority for the Trump administration. That's probably the smartest thing the President has said in a while. In the coming years, 5G will form the foundation by which all other technologies will base themselves.Thus, we absolutely need a vibrant, dynamic and competitive telecom sector. Facilitating a viable third competitor is not just a matter of consumer interest. It could really be, like energy independence, a matter of national security. That's why I like AT&T. And if you're a gambler, you should probably like S stock too.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AT&T.

2019-06-03,"Late last month, it looked as though the merger between T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) was in the bag. Then, the Department of Justice threw a wrench into the proceedings, which is terrible news for the owners of Sprint stock. Here's why.  It Looked Like the Deal Would Go ThroughT-Mobile CEO John Legere got a boost of confidence on May 20 when FCC Chairman Ajit Pai gave the thumbs up to the merger between the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers in the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Although the FCC has asked for several concessions from the two companies, including the sale of Sprint's Boost Mobile prepaid cell service, the $26 billion deal appeared to be nearing completion. Not so fast. There are many opponents to the deal who feel it will merely increase prices for American wireless customers. Included in the group opposed to the merger is FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who happens to be a Democrat, while the FCC Chairman is a Republican. &quot;We've seen this kind of consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,&quot; Rosenworcel tweeted on May 20. &quot;It hasn't worked out well for consumers. But now the @FCC wants to bless the same kind of consolidation for wireless carriers. I have serious doubts.&quot; The DoJ Wants to Maintain the Status QuoBloomberg reported on May 29 that the DoJ was looking for a way to retain the status quo of four wireless carriers while allowing the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile to go through. DOJ wants T-Mobile and Sprint to facilitate the creation of a fourth national carrier, using  some of its network along with resources from external third parties such as Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH), which has a significant amount of spectrum that it's not currently using.   The problem with this solution is figuring out who would run this new fourth wireless carrier.In addition, just because Sprint and T-Mobile have made all kinds of concessions to the FCC, including not raising prices or cutting jobs for the next three years, it's highly likely that the combined company will do both those things once the three-year agreement runs out. Over the long-term, this deal isn't likely to be positive for American consumers, no matter what T-Mobile and Sprint are saying.  Why the News Is Bad for Sprint StockAt the beginning of May, I recommended that owners of Sprint stock sell their shares because  I thought there was no way the DoJ would approve the merger, even though the agency appeared to be on the fence at the time. Now, with the FCC looking poised to approve the deal, the DoJ would prefer not to go against another department of the government. Therefore, it's going to do everything in its power to reach a suitable compromise.   However, if T-Mobile and Sprint can't figure out how to create a fourth carrier, the DoJ is likely to oppose the merger,  creating a long, drawn-out legal battle. In my article published on May 3, I said this about the Sprint-T-Mobile merger:&quot;In what world does it make sense to have three companies controlling a wireless market with 327 million people? Canada has a population of 37 million, about one-eighth of America's, and yet it has three major providers, albeit ones that charge an arm and a leg for service,&quot; I wrote. &quot;It is sheer lunacy to allow these companies to merge because if Canada is any indication,  the results that the detractors warn about -- fewer choices and higher prices -- most certainly will materialize.&quot;At this point, I can't tell you what's going to happen to the deal. What I do know is that T-Mobile's stock won't be the one plummeting if the DoJ blocks the deal. TMUS will still be in a strong third position. Meanwhile, Sprint will have to find another partner with which to roll out 5G. That's easier said than done. $5 or lower could be right around the corner for Sprint stock.

2019-06-04,"Following years of decline, investors in CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) have seen some signs of hope. After reporting a mixed quarter in early May, CenturyLink stock has begun to rebound after briefly dipping into the single-digits.Source: Shutterstock Many have responded well to the lower but generous dividend and management's plan to turn the company around. The business still faces high debt levels and declining revenues. However, the advent of 5G could bring a demand for fiber infrastructure that could bring about a recovery in CTL stock.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault  The Long, Slow Decline of CenturyLink StockIt goes without saying that bulls in CTL stock have deeply suffered in the 2010s. CenturyLink peaked at just under $47 per share in late 2010. Declines came slowly at first, and CenturyLink stock traded at just above $40 per share as late as 2014. However, the drop accelerated, falling briefly below the $10 per share level in May.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPut simply, the stock has suffered from cord cutting. In an increasingly wireless world, the wireline and fiber offerings of the Monroe, Louisiana-based technology company have seen less demand.The company diversified into connectivity, cloud, security, and managed services. However, that did not immediately stem declines in the customer base or the stock price. As a result, the previous $2.16 per share annual dividend became unsustainable. Cutting the dividend to $1 in February may have increased cash flow, but it also steepened the selloff of CenturyLink stock. Sentiment Is ImprovingStill, this leaves the dividend yield at a generous 9.4%. Management has also shifted priorities to turn the company around. Moreover, they initiated plans to cut debt and increase free cash flow. This should strengthen the balance sheet that leaves the company in a better position to acquire more valuable assets.Much of that debt reduction could come from asset sales. As our own Will Ashworth reported, the company has explored strategic alternatives for its consumer unit. That could mean selling the unit that generates about 25% of company revenues. However, that would also make a meaningful dent in its crushing $36 billion debt load.With the lower stock price, investors have again begun to take an interest in CTL. Guggenheim upgraded the stock to neutral when it fell below $10 per share, saying it had reached fair value. CenturyLink and the Rise of 5GHowever, investors might have a much better reason to take an interest in CenturyLink. A recovery in the stock may come about from an unexpected source--5G wireless. Given the expected reach of 5G, one might think that reduces the demand for CenturyLink's fiber infrastructure. With a wireless signal reaching phones, tablets, laptops, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the average consumer will probably not want CenturyLink's fiber-based offerings.Still, businesses and wireless providers may see the situation differently. 5G brings real-time data, lower latency, and higher bandwidth capacity. However, that requires as many as 600 cells to cover the square mileage covered by just one site in the 4G world.To connect these cells to the larger network, wireless providers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) will need fiber.Fortunately, optical fiber has become the preferred medium for this purpose. Hence, a technology that some regard as the past could bring a needed component to connect the future. Final thoughts on CenturyLink stockAmid a falling revenue base in a falling business, CenturyLink may have positioned itself to connect the future with the rise of 5G. CTL stock has suffered for most of the decade as residential customers have abandoned landline phones and pay-TV plans. These consumer trends have reduced revenues and made many investors question the company's long-term viability. CTL responded by reducing the dividend and exploring options to reduce its debt.However, its saving grace could come in the form of 5G wireless. Rather than making fiber obsolete for customers, it may bolster the connectivity that makes 5G possible.The high dividend yield and the elevated debt levels make CenturyLink high risk. I agree with Ashworth that such an equity does not belong in a retirement account. However, for those wanting a low-cost play in 5G with a generous payout, CTL may provide a lucrative solution for risk-tolerant investors.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The firm would have three years to offer coverage to 97% of the U.S. population and 99% of the population within six years.On May 29, Bloomberg reported that top department officials want the two companies to set the groundwork for a fourth carrier. If fulfilled, DOJ will approve the $26.5 billion deal. The condition doesn't make much sense. People familiar with the matter said that Altice USA Inc. will enter the wireless market. It will offer wireless service for half the monthly rate of rivals (at $20 - $30 a month) and running on Sprint's mobile network.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Altice may offer such a low rate because the service will rely on the customer's Wi-Fi service and the company's network of hotspots. More Competition on the WayMany national and regional cable companies, including Dish Networks Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), are planning to offer wireless services. And to meet the FCC requirements to get the deal done, Sprint will sell Boost Mobile. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rumored to be considering buying Boost, although this sounds unlikely. Amazon would need to raise $3 billion by selling stock and raising debt. It could offer a mobile service to the existing 8 million customers. But if Amazon favors offering its own mobile services over others, it may raise antitrust concerns.  Two Dominant Players with a Third on the WayAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) fell 4% and 4.36%, respectively, on May 30 when rumors circulated that Amazon would enter the wireless market. Investors could assume the e-commerce juggernaut will not enter the market and that the two telecom firms will continue to dominate the industry. In effect, the sudden drop in AT&T and Verizon stock created another entry point for income investors seeking a growing dividend. AT&T's stock has a dividend yielding 6.59% after closing yesterday at $31.09 while Verizon's stock dividend yields 4.21%. Sprint's 5G Catalyst for the Merged FirmSprint will offer 5G services to nine major cities in the United States, including Chicago, Atlanta, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New York, and Phoenix. The faster service should lift Sprint's wireless services revenue, which, at $22.5 billion, is flat from FY 2017 but down from FY 2016's $23.8 billion. Average revenue per user (ARPU) of $44.54 fell steadily in the last two years but could increase with customers signing up for 5G services.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War  Valuation Sans Buy RatingsWith the merger pending, investors may not want to pay much attention to Wall Street's price target on Sprint stock. With no buy ratings and five holds, the average price target is $5.88, according to TipRanks. This suggests the stock has downside risk of 14.4%. Investors need only bet that the $26.5 billion deal goes through but what Sprint shareholders get depends on where T-Mobile is trading. For example, on May 21, S stock was worth $7.73. But after TMUS stock fell by more than 3% last week to $73.44, Sprint stock is worth 0.10256 x $73.44, or $7.53 a share. Your Takeaway on Sprint StockThe government could impose tougher conditions before allowing the deal to go through. This creates uncertainties for investors holding either T-Mobile or Sprint stock. Still, the companies remain attractive speculations in the near-term. For investors who prefer steady income instead, AT&T and Verizon are worth considering, too.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

In other words, you will not need a cable modem to download and stream movies in four to five years. That's an incredible development, and it's going to be huge for many technology companies. As a result, the drive to 5G will be an epic battle, with China's Huawei Technologies pitted against American companies.Source: Shutterstock When I wrote in early May about 5G stocks, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) were still battling for first place in the 5G race. For now, Verizon is still ahead. Back in April, it launched its 5G network in downtown Chicago and Minneapolis, and it's stayed there. The coverage in Chicago has expanded a bit. And now, Verizon is looking to bring its 5G coverage to New York, potentially by the end of 2019.But what's even more exciting is that 5G is no longer limited to the U.S. It's finally spread across the pond to the U.K., thanks to EE Limited, a British mobile network operator. Currently, 5G is available in Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, London and Manchester. EE's rival, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), is planning to turn on its 5G service in the next few weeks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the meantime, the U.S. and China continue to battle out their own 5G war. A few weeks ago, President Trump took another step in an attempt to further protect American intellectual property. Within the U.S.-China trade war, China's 5G company, Huawei Technologies, has been a major point of contention. The Trump administration claims that Huawei's technology enables the Chinese government to spy on the U.S.President Trump later inked an executive order to ban American telecommunications networks from utilizing equipment from foreign suppliers, like Huawei Technologies. The Chinese company was also added to the Commerce Department's &quot;Entity List,&quot; which blocks Huawei from purchasing equipment from U.S. companies without government approval.But last week, the U.S. eased a few of its trade restrictions on Huawei. Specifically, the Commerce Department issued a temporary license for American companies to continue partnering with Huawei for the next 90 days. The key word here is &quot;temporary.&quot;Essentially, this 90-day window allows Huawei to stock up on U.S. semiconductor orders, which will temporarily boost orders at many U.S. companies. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) all initially complied with the emergency ban on Huawei, but Google has now reversed its ban for the 90 days. The reason was to help limit the disruption to customers and subscribers who rely on Google's Android system and updates on Huawei's 5G phones. But if the 5G fight continues past the next 90 days, Huawei will be forced to develop its own system.As a result, the drive to 5G will be an epic battle, with China's Huawei Technologies pitted against American companies. The winner will essentially run the internet for the next few years, which means that the investors who invest in the right company will be big winners, too.I know what you're thinking: My 5G stock recommendation will be one of the big wireless companies we talked about earlier, or maybe a tech company working on self-driving cars or a big Internet of Things (IoT) device. Not so.I believe the real money will be made not with the company that needs 5G to create exciting products, but the one involved in the creation of 5G. In the long term, this will be the company that will profit off of almost every aspect of 5G.The global 5G infrastructure market is expected to grow from $2.55 billion in 2020 to over $42 billion by 2025 -- a 75.1% increase in just one market.And remember, because 5G plays a big role in industries like the Internet of Things and self-driving cars, this company will have an even bigger sandbox to play in.I believe I've found that winner, which has done well for my Growth Investor subscribers. In less than six months, it's already up in the double digits. I see even bigger upside ahead once 5G really takes off, which could come in the nearer term now that it's in the U.K., too.

Back in the day, T stock was the giant to break up.Source: Shutterstock Today I share the opportunity to trade T stock inside a range. So I could consider this on a tactical trade but one that I don't mind turning it into an investment if price goes against my assumption.But first let's consider the fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAT&T stock is cheap in absolute term as it sells at a 12 trailing P/E ratio. This is a little bit cheaper than Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and almost twice as cheap as T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). AT&T even pays a fat 6% dividend which is not in jeopardy.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets So clearly owning AT&T stock at these levels is not going to result in a financial debacle. And that's the main reason that I don't mind turning this trade into an investment. I get to own a quality stock that pays me a strong dividend while I ride out any trouble. Trading T StockSo now the opportunity at hand. Although it's up about 11% year to date and in line with the S&P 500, the price action in this stock has been choppy. Since the October correction started, every time T stock approaches the area from which it fell, the sellers pile into the stock to cause the rallies to fail.This established a roof which is frustrating to the AT&T bulls but it also created an area of opportunity. One of these breakout attempts will eventually succeed and the roof will turn into a launching pad.So I could buy the shares now and hold it with a stop below. But why is now different? Energy!The short-term range is tightening into a pinpoint. The stock is bouncing off the $30.40 low and has strong momentum as it approaches the descending trend line. So we have lower highs and higher lows meeting at a point. This usually creates tension in T stock that needs to resolve itself in a breakout in either direction.My bet is that this time and since the markets in general are also rallying, the direction of the AT&T move will be UP. If so then the rally should target $35 per share. But there will be resistance lines along the way at $32 and $32.60. If the bulls can beat $33.10 there is open air above.This won't be easy because this is whole region is a pivot zone that dates back to 1996. This is another reason why I don't mind holding the shares even without a stop loss because the bottom cannot be too far below current price if I am wrong.The plot twist: Options can give me the edge here for better execution.To mitigate the risk I can use options to generate income from the support that is below T stock price this month. While I hold the shares I can sell the January T $28 put and collect $1 per contract. This lowers my out of pocket expense.But if T falls below $28 this year than I own more shares but at a breakeven price of $27 per share. For perspective, this would be an entry point as low as the December lows and we all know that it was a special bearish case then.The bottom line is that AT&T stock has value here, so it's cheap. I'd like to own it while it resurfaces above a 23-year-old pivot zone. Once above, it will be bullet-proof support and a base for a monster rally.But I recognize that we are still in the throws of an economic war so I have to expect volatility from political headlines.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Rumors began to circulate that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be interested in the business, which sent shares of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) tumbling. Is this an overreaction for AT&T stock and Verizon?Source: Shutterstock In my view, it's an overreaction. First, we don't even know that Amazon will step up and buy Boost Mobile. That's why JPMorgan analysts said the dip in AT&T and Verizon were buying opportunities last week. Second, let's say Amazon does enter the wireless race. There are plenty of reasons not to, but in theory, the ecommerce juggernaut could. In that event, while AT&T and Verizon will again suffer more temporary stock losses, consider that it would take a long time for them to start feeling the impact, assuming they do at all.In short, these worries don't make sense. Just like it doesn't make sense to sell AT&T because President Trump says to boycott the company as it is now the parent company of CNN.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far With that in mind, let's look at why AT&T stock is a solid holding for investors' portfolios. Valuing AT&T StockThe key concern for AT&T is its debt load. Following the company's acquisition of Time Warner, we saw long-term debt shoot from $127 billion (an already high figure) to $170 billion. I won't defend the company's acquisition of DirecTV, as investors continue to worry about cord-cutting trends leaving an exodus of subscribers.However, the Time Warner deal is working, as it's helped to boost free cash flow (FCF) significantly. While it upped the debt load in a big way, the added profitability, revenue growth and cash flow were worth it. As management pays down debt and sheds some non-core assets, it will hopefully prove to investors over time that AT&T is a dependable and stable addition to one's portfolio.At it stands, analysts expect 7.4% revenue growth this year and 0.4% growth in 2020. They also expect 1.7% earnings growth this year and next. Short of this year's revenue estimates, that's not very impressive, right? Right.But at 8.7 times this year's earnings, AT&T is not exactly expensive. Plus, it's pretty clear this isn't a revenue growth story. It's an income play. AT&T DividendLast quarter, AT&T missed revenue expectations and reported in-line earnings per share results. However, cash flow was the focus for me.Operating cash flow jumped 24% to $11.1 billion. When accounting for CapEx, FCF came in at $5.9 billion, up 107% year-over-year (YoY) from $2.83 billion. More important, though, consider the implications of what that FCF means. First, the company paid $3.71 billion in dividends for the quarter. So FCF less the dividend leaves about $2.15 billion in cash flow. That amount can go directly to paying down debt should management choose to do so.Further, the FCF dividend ratio (or the percentage of FCF that's paid out in the form of a dividend) went from 108.5% in Q1 2018 to just 63.3% in Q1 2019. That's a significant reduction and pads the safety in AT&T's 6.6% dividend yield. Not that we needed any more confidence in this payout. AT&T has not only paid, but has raised its dividend for 35 straight years.From the press release:&quot;Our first-quarter results show that we're delivering on what we promised,&quot; said Randall Stephenson, AT&T chairman and CEO. &quot;We're on plan to meet our de-leveraging goals with strong free cash flow and asset sales.&quot; Trading T Stock  Click to EnlargeAT&T stock is slowly but surely repairing the technical damage. The 200-week moving average has been working against the stock since April 2018. Twice in the last two months, this moving average has contained the rally in AT&T. If it eventually gives way, we can see a more dramatic change in the tide.Until then, AT&T stock is going in the right direction. It broke over downtrend resistance (purple line) and is in the midst of a bullish channel (blue lines). The 50-week moving average has turned from resistance in Q1 to support in Q2.The $32-ish level remains significant and so far, continues to act as resistance. If AT&T stock can keep its uptrend (channel support) in play, it increases the odds it will push through $32 and the 200-week moving average.Remember, we're mostly here for that 6.6% yield, but a decent return wouldn't be frowned upon either. On the downside, look to see that the post-earnings lows near $30 hold. On a weekly basis, the $30.40 level needs to hold.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long T and AMZN.

2019-06-07,"There's no shortage of worries when it comes to AT&T (NYSE:T). The T stock price hasn't moved in years. In fact, shares touched a seven-year low in December, and trade below where they did at the beginning of 1998. AT&T is the most indebted company in the world. Growth remains meager.Indeed, I've been a longtime skeptic toward T stock. I argued as recently as last month that shares should sit below $30. From a broad standpoint, the concern is that AT&T simply isn't winning.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn Mobility, the company is losing market share to Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The Time Warner acquisition remains reliant on the Turner networks -- likely victims of cord-cutting. DirecTV is hemorrhaging subscribers. The streaming service is late to market, and seems to have little chance of dislocating Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu, let alone the coming offering from Disney (NYSE:DIS).A little over two weeks after the finale of HBO's Game of Thrones, some investors have added that network to the list of worries. Will subscribers abandon the network, which potentially is AT&T's most attractive asset? Did poor reviews for the finale undercut future opportunities for the franchise?  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets They are interesting questions from a business standpoint. But in fact, Game of Thrones -- and even HBO -- aren't necessarily that material to the AT&T stock price. That's good news, but it's also part of the problem. Game of Thrones and T StockViewers did not enjoy the GoT finale, or even the last season. As Vox pointed out, the finale has far and away the lowest rating on IMDB of any episode in the series. A petition at Change.org to remake the final season &quot;with competent writers&quot; has received 1.6 million signatories.Game of Thrones hasn't yet really moved T stock. Indeed, despite initial backlash to the ending, shares actually increased modestly the next day. But that hasn't stopped market participants from voicing concern about the franchise, and its impact on HBO.Most notably, without GoT, HBO doesn't have a headline blockbuster series with which to attract subscribers. The finale itself set a record as the most-watched HBO show ever. That's a truly impressive accomplishment in a time of increasing audience fragmentation. No doubt some of the 19 million viewers are subscribers who are now at risk of canceling.HBO could, of course, keep or win back those subscribers with expansions to the GoT universe. Three successor shows reportedly are in the works. But the disappointment of the finale might keep those viewers from returning.And it's that risk that could weigh on T stock. At Marketwatch, columnist Brett Arends went as far as to breathlessly argue that AT&T shareholders would have a case to sue the company. &quot;AT&T's management has just needlessly thrown away a prize asset for no good reason,&quot; he wrote in arguing against the decision to even end the series. Arends compared that decision to the infamous &quot;New Coke&quot; rollout by Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) back in the 1980s.Meanwhile, after the apparently disappointing season, the new offerings are now tainted. &quot;The question now is whether the franchise has much magic left anyway,&quot; he added. Does HBO Matter to the AT&T Stock Price?Arends furthered his point by noting that AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson specifically called out HBO and GoT in justifying the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner back in 2016. From that standpoint, the GoT misstep -- if it was a misstep -- presents a real risk to AT&T stock.And subscriber losses are a risk. HBO's direct subscribers contribute some $15 per month, or $180 per year in revenue each. Incremental subscribers are gained and lost at exceedingly high margins. The cost of adding a subscriber is minimal: it doesn't make HBO's programs more expensive, and incremental infrastructure costs are modest as well. But the reverse is true of losing a subscriber: most of the revenue dollars fall away from profits.All that said, HBO is only a small part of the AT&T empire. In the first quarter, according to figures from the 10-Q, HBO contributed just 5.6% of total segment-level profit. EBITDA is in the range of $2.4 billion annually.Two factors do amplify the importance of HBO to T stock. First, the company has a tremendous amount of debt. And so, HBO's contribution to the equity is more important than its contribution to the business. Take away HBO's profits, all else equal, and the T stock price would drop close to 10%.Secondly, HBO is probably the most expensive asset AT&T has. The $2.4 billion in EBITDA suggests the business could be worth as much as $25 billion. That's assuming a 12x EBITDA multiple, and that a standalone HBO would have some level of corporate costs. That figure is a little over 10% of the current market capitalization of $231 billion. HBO Is Neither Catalyst nor Headwind for AT&TStill, modest or even significant erosion in HBO subscribers doesn't necessarily mean enormous downside for AT&T stock. Even the loss of five million subscribers -- nearly 25% of the GoT finale viewers -- would only hit revenue by about $900 million. Full-year segment-level profit should be over $40 billion.While that might seem like good news in the context of AT&T stock, it also currently highlights the broad problem. HBO truly is AT&T's most impressive asset. It would be hugely in demand if the company were to sell it (though it obviously won't). Also, the markets would dearly value the network if the company spun it off.Yet AT&T's most impressive asset doesn't matter all that much in the context of the total business. Wireless will ultimately drive T stock, where market growth is minimal and AT&T's share is shrinking. The merger between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile could help, though the forced sale of Boost Mobile might mean a fourth large player like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) joins the industry. Other key contributions come from Turner and DirecTV, both of which likely are in secular decline.Subscriber losses at HBO won't help the cause, to be sure. But they simply don't change the case all that much. HBO isn't going to move T stock significantly, which raises the question of what actually will.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-07,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you: Monday was a very, very bad day for the FANG stocks. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were all pummeled. Facebook, which took the biggest hit, fell 9.3%, Google fell 7.2% and briefly into bear market territory, while Netflix dropped 3.1% and Amazon 5.8%. The selloffs were largely due to news of potential antitrust investigations and breaking up the companies.Source: Shutterstock On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee said it was beginning a &quot;top to bottom&quot; review of the tech industry. Rumors that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission came to an agreement to divide up the labor of investigating Google and the other FANG stocks also did not help.Time will tell how these investigations play out, and I'm sure not going to buy into those rumors. Instead, I'm staying laser focused on what's truly important: the underlying fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI was not particularly excited about buying Facebook or Google during Monday's selling. As I stated, in my Portfolio Grader both companies had poor Quantitative and Fundamental Grades. Remember, the Quantitative Grade measures a stock's buying pressure. Think of this as &quot;following the money.&quot; The more money that floods into a stock, the more momentum a stock has to rise. In this case, both stocks held a C-rating.The Fundamental Grades weren't looking so great, either. Both stocks received a C-rating here, too. Fundamentals are important, as they tell us about a company's sales growth, earnings growth and the like. Growing companies are companies that are healthy and thriving. They have smart leaders who know how to run and manage a smart business. If a company is struggling to sell its products or is spending more than it makes, it's not a company that you want to own for growth. Given these grades, as well as the fact that Facebook's Total Grade is a D, which makes it an automatic sell, the weakness on Monday was not a good opportunity to buy the dip.Amazon is a different story. As you can see below, it receives a B-rating for both its Fundamental and Quantitative Grade, meaning it continues to see solid buying pressure and has solid underlying fundamentals to drive the stock higher over time.The solid fundamentals aren't surprising. The company reported a stunning first quarter in April, smashing analysts' earnings estimates by 50.2%. The online retailer reported that its Amazon Web Services business continues to add to the company's top and bottom lines. It achieved $7.7 billion in sales in the first quarter, which translated to 42% annual growth.Amazon reported total sales of $59.7 billion, up from $51.04 billion in the same quarter a year ago. That topped analysts' estimates for $59.65 billion by a hair. The company also noted that earnings per share surged 116.8% year-over-year to $7.09, which beat estimates for $4.72 per share.But as I said, a good company must have a smart leader, and Amazon certainly does in Jeff Bezos. What I like right now is that he is looking to capitalize on the 5G trend. As you may recall, 5G is spreading like wildfire. It's making waves in the U.S. and has now gone across the pond to the U.K. This technology is a big deal because it brings cable, modem and internet speeds to the air. So, in the near future you won't need a cable modem to download and stream movies.Reuters has reported that Amazon is working to get itself a piece of the 5G pie. The company is considering acquiring Boost Mobile, which will be sold by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) as part of the wireless carriers' plans to receive regulatory approval of their proposed $26.5 billion merger. This would give Amazon access to the combined company's wireless network. In turn, it would give Amazon an opportunity to really tap into the 5G space and potentially take on the bigger wireless carriers, like AT&T (NYSE:T). So, this would be a very smart move.By purchasing Boost Mobile, not only would Amazon enter the wireless market but it would allow the company to improve its cloud systems and have more control over the services it already offers, such as Amazon Prime. And 5G devices that are connected to the cloud could allow Amazon to sell a full suite of products for customers who want to build 5G services and give it an edge over competitors.Amazon has come a long way from its days selling books in 1998 to an e-commerce giant today with a hand in just about every tech space. Any foray into 5G, which I am confident will revolutionize the internet, should really get it firing on all cylinders.To learn more about Amazon's latest moves, as well as my thoughts on 5G and exactly how it will change the internet, sign up here for my Growth Investor service.

2019-06-11,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of states sued to block T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed takeover of Sprint Corp. on antitrust grounds, putting pressure on the Justice Department as it nears a final decision on the merger of the two wireless carriers.State attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia filed the lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in New York to stop a deal they say will harm competition and raise prices for consumers by at least $4.5 billion a year.“When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “This is exactly the sort of consumer-harming, job-killing mega-merger our antitrust laws were designed to prevent.”The states’ challenge is a major setback to T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s plan to combine and take on industry leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. Last month, the carriers cleared a key hurdle when they won support for their deal from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.The all-Democratic attorneys general are taking the rare step of suing to block the $26.5 billion deal while the Justice Department is still reviewing the merger. State enforcers have the authority to go to court to block a merger even if federal officials at the Justice Department and the FCC approve it. Sprint shares dropped 6.4% at 12:15 p.m. in New York trading. T-Mobile fell 1.7%.The spread between T-Mobile’s offer price and Sprint shares is the widest since May 17. It’s a sign that investors are more doubtful that a deal will get done.Sprint and T-Mobile representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The case, which was filed under seal, puts pressure on Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division. He can either side with the states, which say the merger should be blocked, or negotiate a remedy that would allow the deal to proceed. Delrahim doesn’t think a settlement with the FCC goes far enough to resolve competition problems from the deal and is in talks with the companies about additional concessions.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:T-Mobile getting its proposed $27 billion acquisition of Sprint past regulatory hurdles is no done deal, though the companies have some defenses that stand a chance. The Department of Justice has expressed interest in the competitive potential of 5G technology and a strong competitor to AT&T and Verizon in that area. The outcome depends to a great extent on whether the evidence supports T-Mobile’s assertions about future market dynamics and 5G competition.&#92;--Jennifer Rie, litigation analystClick here to view the pieceThe state attorneys general say that combining T-Mobile and Sprint would eliminate competition between them and lead to higher prices. And in a more consolidated market, AT&T and Verizon would also be able to charge more.“Although T-Mobile and Sprint may be promising faster, better, and cheaper service with this merger, the evidence weighs against it,” said California’s Attorney General Xavier Becerra. “This merger would hurt the most vulnerable Californians and result in a compressed market with fewer choices and higher prices.”In the retail mobile wireless market, not including enterprise accounts, T-Mobile and Sprint would lead AT&T and Verizon in market share, according to the states. In some areas of the country, their market share would be more than 50%, they said. Harm from the tie-up will disproportionately fall on lower-income consumers who are customers of Sprint and T-Mobile’s pre-paid brands, Boost and Metro, they say.Deal InvestigationAccording to people familiar with their thinking, state officials don’t know whether the Justice Department will ultimately approve the deal. They are taking action because after investigating the merger for about a year they determined it violated antitrust laws and they don’t see any reason to wait for the Justice Department to make a decision, the people said.The states’ investigation, led by the chief of New York’s antitrust bureau, Beau Buffier, relied on technical and economic experts, according to one of the people. Their economists are Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley and Yale University’s Fiona Scott Morton, the person said.The case comes more than a year after T-Mobile and Sprint announced the deal to combine, claiming together they could better compete with Verizon and AT&T while speeding deployment of the next generation of wireless technology known as 5G. Although a previous attempt to merge was frustrated by the Obama administration, T-Mobile and Sprint were betting on a more receptive audience from the Trump officials.The tie-up’s fate now rests with a federal judge, who must decide whether it should be blocked on antitrust grounds. The companies could still reach a settlement before the case goes to trial.If the carriers are stopped from completing the deal, they would be left to their own to compete in a maturing wireless market while financing expensive investments in developing their own 5G networks.‘Supercharge’ T-MobileSprint’s challenges are bigger. Despite becoming profitable last year after a decade of losses, it warned the FCC that without a deal it sees “no obvious path to solve key business challenges.”T-Mobile Chief Executive Office John Legere took the lead on Capitol Hill -- and on social media -- advocating for the deal. He said the transaction would “supercharge” his company, which he made a maverick competitor in the market. The centerpiece of his case was that combining with Sprint would help the U.S. lead in 5G technology, a priority for the Trump administration.That argument was dismissed by opponents of the deal, including consumer groups and the Communications Workers of America, which said the merger would reduce choice, lead to higher wireless bills and cause job losses.Getting a deal with T-Mobile was a long-held plan of Masayoshi Son, the chairman of SoftBank Group Corp., which owns Sprint. In 2014, he came to Washington vowing a price war if he was able to acquire T-Mobile and personally lobbied U.S. officials about a potential tie-up. If the deal goes through, T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom will end up with a 42% ownership stake while SoftBank will own 27%.(Updates with statement from James in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Scott Moritz.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Erik Larson in New York at elarson4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Joe Schneider, David GlovinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",States to File Antitrust Suit to Block T-Mobile-Sprint Deal

2019-06-12,"It was back and forth all day yesterday, and when all was said and done, the tug-of-war essentially ended in a tie. The S&P 500 lost 0.03% of its value on Tuesday, squelching the rally effort for a day, but at least keeping the market positioned for another try that doesn't have to start with a lot of groundwork.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) did more than its fair share of damage, falling 2.5% mostly following worries that its newest graphics cards may be priced too high. Sprint (NYSE:S) actually lost more ground though, off nearly 6% in response to news that several states were suing to block its intended merger with rival T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS).There were some big winners all the same though. Chief among them was the 6.7% gain metal company Vale (NYSE:VALE) logged, mostly as a bounce back from news that it would be spending nearly $2 billion to shutter nine dams in Brazil where the company has suffered from multiple fatal dam breaks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession None are particularly compelling prospects as we move into Wednesday's trading, however. Rather, pay close attention to the stock charts of Under Armour (NYSE:UA), General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Ventas (NYSE:VTR). Here's what's most noteworthy for each. Ventas (VTR)The last time we looked at Ventas back in November, it had just popped above a nagging resistance line, which put it en route to higher highs. And, that's what happened. VTR poked above resistance around $58.40, and by December, it was trading around $65.50. That's when VTR shares bumped into another set of resistance lines.Those ceilings are still a problem. But, they're also now just part of a much bigger consolidation effort that's about to come to an end. A huge converging wedge shape is nearing its point, and Ventas has already knocked one of them over. The last big one is in reach.  Click to Enlarge  * The final line in the sand is plotted in yellow on both stock charts. Although VTR shares poked above that ceiling once last month, it has otherwise been the big resistance level.  * Zooming out to the daily chart you can see several different support and resistance lines, each of which puts the stock in a successively bullish position. Under Armour (UA)Under Armour has tried three times since April of last year to get back in a bullish groove. The first two times failed, and the third one is now underway. Given its history and the fact that the stock is once again overbought, odds are good this third time won't be the charm either. However, the fact that UA shares continue to take swings suggests it's only a matter of time before the effort finds success. Best of all, it's crystal clear where Under Armour shares will slide out of its rut and into a prolonged uptrend.  * 10 Smart Dividend Stocks for the Rest of the Year   Click to Enlarge  * The big resistance line to watch is currently near $23.50, marked with a white dashed line on both stock charts. That ceiling tags all the major peaks since last year, including the one from Monday.  * Zooming out to the weekly timeframe, we can see what happens when the stochastic lines move into overbought condition like we are now. The bulls may find more success at a slower pace, though they'll need to peel back from here either way to make that happen.  * The weekly chart also clarifies how much room there is to recover the big selloff from 2016, once the effort gets moving at a sustainable pace. General Electric (GE)All of the rebound efforts General Electric shares have made since the beginning of the year have proven fruitless, making the current one suspect. Indeed, most would-be buyers have lost interest in GE, and aren't even aware that the once-struggling company's shares are even toying with a true rebound.Yet, now's precisely the time investors need to put General Electric back on their radars, and watchlists. Although not over the last of its key hurdles yet, it quietly moved above one big one, and is within sight of the final one. It's not the ideal effort thus far, but there's still a whole lot working in favor the recovery move.  * It's evident on the daily chart, but only fully appreciable on the weekly chart … the moving average lines that have been diverging since the beginning of 2017 are converging again. It's a major clue of transition.  * As of Tuesday, GE shares are back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Although the weekly chart shows us the Chaikin line is back above zero, the daily chart makes it clear that there's not much volume behind the recovery effort so far.  * The make-or-break level is right around $10.50, plotted in yellow on both stock charts, where the stock has peaked a couple of different times since March.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But, it's clear investors remain hesitant.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)The bulls weren't hesitant about Sprint (NYSE:S), pushing it up nearly 3% on renewed optimism the Federal Trade Commission could give its impending merger with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) a green light as early as next week after all.

Rather, it's the stock charts of Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), Allergan (NYSE:AGN) and Centurylink (NYSE:CTL) that are worth closer looks. Here's why. Centurylink (CTL)We've seen fakeout moves from Centurylink shares before, so take this one with a grain of salt. But, this one is different in the sense that it's starting to take hold after a major selloff that has left the stock oversold and ripe for a rebound. There's just one more hurdle to clear, though it's not a small one. It has proven to be a ceiling in the past, though in slightly different circumstances.  Click to Enlarge  * The slow break above the falling resistance level marked in yellow on both stock charts ultimately petered out, but the break above the falling ceiling plotted with blue lines since April seems to be taking shape at a much stronger pace.  * This time around the rebound move is materializing after the weekly chart's RSI indicator fell well into oversold territory. The move out of that condition in the meantime is a sign that a reversal is underway.  * The key from here is a move above the purple 50-day moving average line. That level was a ceiling a couple of times in the fall of last year, but that was when the selloff was just getting started. It really is a different scenario now. Allergan (AGN)Long-term Allergan shareholders are no stranger to disappointment. The stock has been in a choppy downtrend since 2015, managing to reach new multi-year lows on Friday of last week. It looks and feels like the stock is about to implode.And, maybe it is. But, with Friday's 4.1% meltdown, AGN stock has actually bumped into a very well-established technical floor that could throw bears for a loop. Although some sort of verification is necessary before jumping to any conclusions, the binary outcome that has to take shape from here is apt to offer some significant swing trading opportunities no matter what.  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy   Click to Enlarge  * As of Friday, Allergen shares are kissing the lower edge of a converging wedge pattern that extends back to 2015.  * The bullish case is simple enough -- at a major floor and with the weekly chart's RSI indicator almost into oversold territory, another rebound could be imminent. The bulls will have to confirm that's going to happen with a bounce this week.  * It's not a very well watched dynamic, but thanks to Friday's tumble, AGN shares are now 25% below their white 200-day moving average line. That was about the maximum divergence allowed to take shape in late 2017 and early 2018, also bolstering the bullish case. Charles Schwab (SCHW)A month ago, Charles Schwab shares were toying with a recovery move. Although a falling resistance line was still intact, a handful of other bullish clues were materializing.The effort never panned out. Instead, SCHW bumped into that technical ceiling one last time, fell back again and then continued to fall. The last bastion of hope was wiped away on Friday with a 3.1% setback that dragged Charles Schwab shares back to their lowest level in months. And, that's not even the worst of it.  Click to Enlarge  * The resistance line that remains intact is plotted in blue on both stock charts, tagging all the key highs since November.  * Support was developing around $41.40, by virtue of shares making a couple of major lows there since March. That floor was smashed on Friday.  * Although anything is still possible at this point, with a floor now taken out of the picture, the next most likely landing spot is the most frequent low seen since early 2017. That floor near $37.80 is marked in yellow on both stock charts.  * From the perspective of the weekly chart, the pattern since early 2017 loosely looks like a head-and-shoulders pattern. Should the &quot;neckline&quot; at $37.80 also fail, the ensuing selloff could be significant.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The deal hasn’t been finalized and talks could still fall through, said the people.The potential divestitures are aimed at appeasing the Justice Department, which wants T-Mobile and Sprint to sell enough assets to ensure that the U.S. maintains at least four viable wireless players.Representative for Dish and the Justice Department declined to comment. Representatives for T-Mobile and Sprint didn’t respond to requests for comment.Dish rose 1.9% to $39.74 at 1:16 p.m. in New York trading, giving the Englewood, Colorado-based company a market value of about $18.6 billion. Sprint gained about 2.3% while T-Mobile rose 1.3%.T-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in April 2018 for $26.5 billion, betting that together the carriers can build a next-generation wireless network to better compete with industry leaders Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.Dish, co-founded by billionaire Charlie Ergen, had been on a shortlist of bidders for T-Mobile and Sprint assets favored by the Justice Department, people familiar with the matter said this month.

2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- T-Mobile US Inc. may have found a way to salvage its takeover of Sprint Corp., but it comes at a cost, and leaves one to wonder whether its single-minded focus on sealing the deal is clouding its judgment. It certainly wouldn’t be the first company to let that happen in M&A. T-Mobile is in talks to sell assets, including wireless spectrum and Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid brand, to satellite-TV provider and known spectrum-hoarder Dish Network Corp. for at least $6 billion, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. This is being done in an effort to appease the U.S. Department of Justice, which is concerned about the impact that T-Mobile’s $59 billion acquisition of Sprint will have on consumers’ wallets.The DOJ is said to want T-Mobile to lay the foundation for the emergence of a viable No. 4 competitor in the U.S. wireless market to help fill the hole that buying Sprint would leave behind. Dish could, in theory, be that new fourth competitor, and that’s likely the motivation behind the reported arrangement. But given the strategic needs of all involved, the logic of this workaround is puzzling. Let’s start with Dish. While it doesn’t have a wireless network, it already owns lots of mid-band spectrum licenses. These valuable assets have underpinned the company’s $18 billion market capitalization, even as its core satellite-TV business has lost droves of subscribers. Charlie Ergen, the billionaire chairman of Dish, has vaguely laid out plans for using the company’s spectrum to build a nationwide network to service the “internet of things,” ostensibly a step toward later launching a 5G network. Despite what he says, many investors and analysts have expected (or hoped) to see Ergen just sell the spectrum, rather than spending years entangled in a costly network build-out and as a latecomer to the 5G race at that. In any case, the last thing Dish would seem to need is more spectrum. Taking on Boost’s prepaid customers also wouldn’t seem to give Dish much of a leg up in the wireless space, and their bases don’t really overlap. What Dish does need is a partner with the ability to help build its network. If the Sprint deal were to collapse, T-Mobile could be said partner. (After all, Dish has been one of the biggest opponents of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger, at least until now it seems.) Or what about Amazon?A couple of years ago, Ergen reportedly discussed a partnership of sorts with Amazon.com Inc. – and that has to make T-Mobile a little nervous. It’s hard to see how buying Sprint and potentially providing an entry point for Amazon is a better outcome for T-Mobile than the status quo of competing with Sprint, a far weaker rival. Gaining Sprint’s spectrum is also one of the biggest reasons for doing the merger in the first place, so it’s surprising that T-Mobile is willing to divest some of it. And a forced seller isn’t known to get the best price. This is why I wrote last week that it wouldn’t be a surprise if at this point T-Mobile decided to walk away from the deal, on account of disagreeable concessions and a lawsuit by a group of state attorneys general seeking to block the transaction. It may not be a stretch to think that may have been part of the DOJ’s angle in pushing for such divestitures. But if the DOJ and T-Mobile can come to this simple of an agreement – sell spectrum and Boost – then I’m left with two questions: Were regulators really not taking a hard line? Or are executives at T-Mobile and its German parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG, so resolved to get the merger done that they’ll do it even if the merits are spoiled in the process? Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC, put it this way in a note to clients on Monday: “At the end of the day, a bad deal is worse than no deal at all.” That’s true – unless you’re Sprint, in which case no deal is the worst outcome. But T-Mobile shouldn’t feel that same desperation.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

2019-06-19,"On Friday, Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile U.S. (NASDAQ:TMUS) stocks jumped higher on reports that the Department of Justice would give the green light to their merger. Sprint stock rallied toward $7. TMUS stock initially ripped higher too, although it's cooled off already. Both stocks moved higher on Tuesday on news that Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) could be involved in the asset sale that's needed to get the deal done.Source: Shutterstock Many investors are wondering what Sprint stock price and T-Mobile stock will do going forward.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half The argument for a Sprint/T-Mobile tie-up is that the new entity will be better able to compete with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). For ages, VZ  and T have had a tight grip over the wireless sector. Because of their dominance, it's easy to see why a stronger third player in the telecom space would benefit consumers. That said, one can see why going from four competitors to three is worrisome to regulators.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the Justice Department wants to be more certain that the deal will benefit consumers.  For that reason, Sprint is looking to offload its Boost Mobile prepaid business. There were rumors that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be interested in Boost, which temporarily sank the stocks of wireless carriers like AT&T and Verizon. However, Boost now looks to be going to Dish rather than Amazon. Now that we're on the cusp of a Sprint-T-Mobile deal, what's likely to happen to the companies going forward? Sprint and T-MobileWhile it's hard to imagine a tie-up between S and TMUS hurting consumers, that doesn't mean it's been easy for them to get the deal approved. For instance, ten state attorneys general have opposed the deal, filing a lawsuit against it. That lawsuit should be headed to pretrial soon, where the plaintiffs will look to convince a judge to grant a temporary restraining order. If they succeed, the deal will be pushed back by another several months. Good grief.However, that lawsuit could be scrapped if the Department of Justice gives the deal the green light, according to recent reports. To get that approval, S and T-Mobile will need to shed several assets that will allow a fourth competitor to emerge in the wireless carrier space. The duo has since approached Dish, Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Altice USA (NYSE:ATUS) about buying their Boost Mobile business.Current reports now suggest Dish is close to paying $6 billion  for the assets that Sprint and TMUS need to unload to get their merger approved. Those assets are expected to include Boost Mobile, as well as spectrum.At the time the deal was announced -- now more than a year ago -- it was valued at $26.5 billion. The all-stock transaction is based on pricing from April 2018, with 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile being swapped for each share of Sprint, or 9.75 shares of Sprint for each share of T-Mobile. At the time, it valued Sprint stock at $6.62 per share.T-Mobile will be the name of the combined company if the deal is complete. T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom will hold a 42% stake in the combined entity, while Sprint parent company SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) will hold a 27% stake. Trading Sprint Stock  Click to EnlargeBased on each investor receiving .10256 shares of TMUS for every 9.75 shares of S stock they own,  Sprint stock would currently be valued at around $7.70 per share, provided the deal goes through.On the surface, that level is the point to which S stock can rise. That level is also above short-term range resistance near $7.20. Worth noting is that Sprint stock price is now over this level too, near $7.40, after the Dish news. On the downside, $6.60 has buoyed Sprint stock. However, make no mistake about this setup now: It is very much a binary event. Either the deal gets done or it doesn't. If it does, S stock can instantly rise. If it doesn't, Sprint stock will get hammered.While investors can make a case for owning TMUS stock without a deal, Sprint really needs this acquisition to go through. Both companies want this deal to get done, but one of them really needs it, and that's Sprint.So while investors can map out upside and downside levels, they won't matter. All that matters now is whether the deal gains approval. If it does, then the next consideration is T-Mobile's share price. That will determine Sprint's share price, since it's an all-stock deal.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Some evidence used to charge Huawei Technologies Co. with bank fraud and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran was deemed so sensitive that the Chinese telecom giant’s lawyers must now take unusual steps to review the information -- and even then, the company may never see it.While specific evidence wasn’t disclosed, prosecutors convinced a federal judge that releasing too much would pose a risk to national security and other governmental concerns. The U.S. already had banned the company’s technology and accused Huawei of aiding Beijing in espionage. Last week, the court imposed restrictions on when and how information in the criminal case gets shared, and who can see it.“What underlies all of this is the allegation that there are deep and close connections between Huawei and the Chinese government,” said Ryan Fayhee, a former Justice Department national security lawyer. “That’s why this presents differently than a traditional fraud case.”The Huawei prosecution has forced government lawyers to balance evidence rules and a defendant’s right to a fair trial, while safeguarding intelligence gathering. A similar dilemma has threatened to undermine a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller against 16 individuals and companies in Russia over election meddling, because the government is refusing to disclose some sensitive evidence.For now, the Huawei case is proceeding with disclosures to the company’s American defense lawyers under restrictions set June 10 by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn, New York. On Wednesday, she scheduled a Sept. 4 hearing to decide whether one Huawei lawyer, James M. Cole, should be disqualified because he had access to classified data when he worked as a Deputy Attorney General of the U.S. from 2011 to 2015. Cole, now a partner at Sidley Austin LLP, has said he has no conflict.Criminal ProbeAs the criminal case against Huawei moves forward, the prosecution of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, remains on hold. She is fighting extradition from Vancouver, Canada, after being arrested at the request of the U.S. last year. She is accused of defrauding banks when she made a presentation to one of its major banking partners and lied about by lying Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions.Prosecutor Alexander Solomon disclosed on Wednesday that the company’s defense lawyers, who have received at least 700,000 pages of evidence turned over by the U.S. in the New York case, want to share some of the information with Meng’s defense team. The U.S. has said that Meng wouldn’t be permitted to see evidence until a separate order is worked out with her lawyers.Meng’s billionaire father, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has rejected the U.S. accusations against the company and his daughter. On Monday, Ren said the U.S. sanctions against Huawei -- one of the world’s largest makers of smartphones and networking equipment -- could reduce revenue by about $30 billion over the next two years, wiping out any growth prospects by withholding critical American technology.The indictment against Huawei and Meng also mentions Ren, a former engineer with the People’s Liberation Army before he founded the telecommunications company. Prosecutors say he lied to FBI agents in 2007 when he “falsely stated” it had no business dealings in Iran. He hasn’t been criminally charged. The same day Meng, Huawei and its U.S. subsidiaries where charged with violating sanctions, prosecutors filed a separate case in Seattle accusing the company with stealing trade secrets from American rival T-Mobile.Under the restrictions imposed by Donnelly, some evidence labeled “sensitive” by the government can’t be distributed beyond Huawei’s legal team, can only be accessed by certain witnesses in the presence of American lawyers, and must remain in the U.S. If there are disputes over evidence handling, a separate group of government lawyers not involved in the prosecution can be consulted or the judge can get involved.David Bitkower, a lawyer for Huawei, declined to comment on the case, as did John Marzulli, a spokesman for Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue.The rules are even tighter for classified information, and evidence gathered under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will require a separate process to determine what the defense will be able to view, prosecutors said in a court filing Monday.Unusual RestrictionsDonnelly’s order includes unusual restrictions, even for sanctions cases, legal experts said.Some of the evidence can only be reviewed by defense lawyers who are U.S. citizens, because the information could identify potential witnesses or contains “national security” material, prosecutors say. Those documents must be stored on a computer that isn’t connected to the Internet and can’t be taken or transmitted outside the country or shared with Huawei.If Huawei lawyers want to share sensitive material with anyone outside the U.S., they must notify the government. There are also provisions for allowing foreign nationals to view the evidence in the U.S., including with safe-passage guarantees against arrest. There also are options for reviewing information outside the country, but only in the presence of U.S. defense lawyers.Without such provisions, Huawei could accuse the U.S. of hampering its ability to defend itself, said Henry Mazurek, a partner at law firm Meister Seelig and Fein LLP in New York.Huawei’s close ties to the Chinese government have impacted the willingness of the U.S. to share evidence with the company, but prosecutors are obligated to turn over evidence, said Fayhee, the former federal prosecutor.“The government has the view, as also substantiated by its recent blacklisting, that Huawei is an arm of the Chinese government,” Fayhee said. “The founder of the company served nearly a decade as an engineer with the People’s Liberation Army, and continued connections have been regularly alleged. But that’s what the government signed up for when it decided to bring this case.”The case is U.S. v. Huawei Technologies Co., 18-cr-457, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).(Updates with Huawei wanting to show Meng evidence in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Patricia Hurtado in Federal Court in Manhattan at pathurtado@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Steve Stroth, Peter BlumbergFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Huawei Iran-Sanctions Evidence Deemed Too Risky for China to See

The layoffs might also call into question the state of AT&T as the company redefines itself. Still, despite these concerns, T stock investors will more than likely keep their focus on the future of AT&T rather than its headcount.Source: Shutterstock AT&T stock investors have suffered for years as the company faced tremendous financial pressures. Competition squeezed revenues in wireless services as well as cable and satellite TV. At the same time, the company had to spend tens of billions of dollars to build a 5G network. On top of that, it has to pay down a massive debt load that rose as high as $168.5 billion in the third quarter of last year.Further, T stock has maintained a 34-year streak of annual dividend increases. Ending the payout hikes would likely devastate AT&T stock. Hence, despite a 6.3% dividend yield, the company must also continue to increase this payout on top of its other financial obligations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Amid these challenges, employees likely feel a sense of betrayal. Back in 2017, the company promised 7,000 new jobs if tax reform became law. Donald Trump signed his tax plan into law in 2017. However, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) says the tax savings likely went into stock buybacks and other things that do not benefit workers. Although AT&T continues to higher, the headcount has shrunk over the last few years. Traders Focus on ATT ExpensesUnfortunately for the CWA rank-and-file, Wall Street traders continue to focus on expenses, as was evident as the AT&T stock price rose slightly on Tuesday following the news. Given its debt and dividend obligations, traders probably see any cut in expenditures as a positive. Many believe this has long affected the T stock. The forward price-to-earnings multiple now stands at less than 9x. Many blame the company's expenses for this low multiple.  Focus Will Return to 5G, WarnerMediaDespite the layoff news, over the long-term, T stock will trade based on the performance of 5G and how its content performs. Of the two, the outlook for 5G appears brighter. Once T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) acquires Sprint (NYSE:S), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile, and AT&T will be the only companies providing the wireless service poised to connect the future. With so few players in the space, intense price wars will likely not occur since all three carriers face huge expenses from building these networks.  * Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less Admittedly, AT&T's foray into content brings greater risks. The company combined its HBO, Warner Brothers, and Turner content into WarnerMedia. With that, AT&T will compete directly with the likes of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). At between $16 and $17 per month, AT&T WarnerMedia streaming service should compare well from a cost perspective. However, that will probably mean less revenue than the cable and satellite services once brought. Moreover, failure would likely attract investors to Verizon stock as Verizon has staked most of its future on 5G.Whether AT&T succeeds or fails with WarnerMedia could also determine how often the company faces issues with layoffs. However, it will probably have less-dramatic effects on T stock. Bottom Line on T stockAlthough the announced layoffs could bring negative sentiment and publicity to AT&T, they will likely have little long-lasting effect on T stock. Perhaps traders saw this move as path to cutting company expenses. However, AT&T remains heavily in debt and faces mounting costs.Still, as more customers sign up for its 5G service and the newly formed WarnerMedia, AT&T should find itself in a better position to grow revenues and profits. Over the long-term, these factors will be what probably drives T stock. Perhaps they will also motivate AT&T to add jobs again.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-06-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. stole trade secrets from a company co-founded by a former employee, a U.S. jury said Wednesday as it rejected claims that China’s largest technology company was the real victim in the dispute.The jury in Sherman, Texas, said Huawei didn’t benefit from the theft and awarded no damages to the startup, CNEX Labs Inc. Still, the verdict following a three-week trial could provide ammunition to critics who say Huawei doesn’t play by the rules in the global technology playground.Huawei said it was evaluating the verdict. “We are disappointed that the jury didn’t support Huawei’s claims based on the evidence,” Jason Ding, director of the company’s intellectual property rights department, told reporters at its Shenzhen base on Thursday.Huawei and CNEX had each accused the other of stealing inside information regarding data storage. The eight-person jury heard testimony involving dueling tales of intrigue, disloyalty and corporate espionage. The trial featured an inside look at the Chinese maker of smartphones and networking gear, as well as the sometimes cutthroat battle over highly skilled employees with the talent to develop the next generation of technology.Overshadowing the case is Huawei’s position firmly in the middle of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China, with President Donald Trump seeking to sharply curtail the company’s ability to do business. In the U.S., Huawei is fighting a criminal indictment that accuses it of stealing critical phone-testing technology from T-Mobile US Inc.The trial in Sherman, about an hour north of Dallas, marks a rare instance in which Huawei has accused a former employee of stealing secrets.The dispute concerns solid-state drives, which are made up of chips called Nand flash memory that store information on semiconductors. They access data much more quickly than traditional magnetic disk-based technology.For CNEX, its reputation and relationships with technology companies like Microsoft Corp. were at stake. The company is working to develop a method to make the drives faster and cheaper, a crucial need when it comes to storing and retrieving the massive amounts of data kept on cloud storage.“Because we are a new business without revenue or profits, the jury was not able to award CNEX any money damages,” Matthew Gloss, general counsel for CNEX, said in a statement following the verdict.“This case was never about the money,” he said after the hearing. “The case was about saving the company.”Huawei lawyers at the trial had no comment and company officials didn’t immediately respond to queries seeking comment. The jury said that Huawei, but not its U.S. research unit Futurewei Technologies Inc., had stolen CNEX trade secrets. The jury found that CNEX had not proved that either of the companies were “unjustly enriched.” Gloss said it was because CNEX was able to get its product sample back quickly.Founded StartupCNEX was founded in 2013 by two former Marvell Technology Group Ltd. executives and researcher Yiren “Ronnie” Huang, whose previous job at Futurewei in California was at the heart of the trial.Huawei claimed that Huang had wanted to set up his own business but couldn’t get backing so joined Futurewei in 2011. While there, according to Huawei, Huang used a team to develop new technology for the storage devices and then left the company to help start CNEX three days later. There, he and other CNEX founders claimed Huawei’s ideas as their own and poached other Huawei employees, Huawei claimed.The jury found there were no Huawei trade secrets in the case. CNEX had argued that anything Huawei claimed was secret was actually public information.Huang, who is on leave from CNEX, said he came up with the ideas long before joining Futurewei, and left when he realized the company didn’t have much to offer.The jury found that Huang was in violation of his employment agreement’s patent application disclosure provision, but that Futurewei wasn’t harmed by that failure. Huawei had said Huang began seeking patents in the months after joining CNEX, and told the jury it was based on work he had done at Futurewei.CEO TestifiedCNEX Chief Executive Officer Alan Armstrong said he asked Huang to help found CNEX after being introduced by a mutual friend because of Huang’s work with other companies. Any former Huawei employees who joined CNEX did so because they were “very unhappy where they were working and wanted to come to a startup,” Armstrong told the jury.CNEX contends that Huawei posed as a potential customer to get secret details of its plans and, when that didn’t work, persuaded Xiamen University to work as a research partner with CNEX so it could surreptitiously turn over plans.District Court Judge Amos Mazzant, who presided over the trial, also is overseeing a Huawei lawsuit against the U.S. government. The company is asking Mazzant to rule that a ban on federal agencies and contractors buying its gear is unconstitutional.The case is Huawei Technologies Co. v.

2019-07-02,"What a boring trading session it was on Tuesday. While a late-session rally elevated the indices -- with the Nasdaq climbing 0.22% and the S&P 500 up 0.21% -- both hugged the flatline for most of the day. Source: Shutterstock In fact, an odd anomaly stood out to me. The so-called &quot;fear gauge,&quot; more formally known as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) plunged on the day. Even when the S&P 500 was flat on the day, the VIX was down 5%. After the index's slight rally, the VIX ultimately fell 8%. What does that suggest? The VIX measures the 30-day outlook of future volatility. Essentially, investors aren't expecting much in the next month, despite earnings set to start in a few weeks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Nasdaq continues to hover right near that key 8,100 mark and with this week's interesting price action, it's got investors wondering if new highs could be next. Combined with the weakness in the VIX, it's encouraging that sellers aren't pushing the markets down, even after Monday's subpar rally. Let's see if bulls can harness enough momentum to generate new highs.   Click to Enlarge Highlights on the Nasdaq TodayDespite the promising start to Monday's trading session, chip stocks continue to flounder. Specifically, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 2.4% on Tuesday as the company unveiled its new &quot;Super&quot; chip lineup. Apparently investors weren't wowed, as shares now flirt with support.   * 7 Stocks on Sale the Insiders Are Buying Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) self-driving unit Waymo took another positive step forward. While the unit has made great progress by offering autonomous driving taxi services in the Phoenix area, the company now has state approval from California. Well, sort of. It was approved for a permit to participate in the state's Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service pilot. It cannot charge passengers, will have a safety drivers and it will start with its own employees as the riders. The company tends to roll out slowly and carefully, although that's exactly what you want from a robo-taxi service. In any regard, Waymo continues to put distance between itself and its peers. It's also exciting news for the autonomous driving industry. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is seeing a somewhat alarming exodus of talent. The company's engineering VP Steve MacManus has left, as has European Head Jan Oehmick. The reports are troubling as these two -- and others -- flee Tesla amid a big production push to end the second quarter. We'll find out how Tesla's production numbers came out soon enough, and while the company has always had seemingly high turnover, the news is still concerning. Finally, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has apparently settled on a deal with Dish Networks (NYSE:DISH). The company is trying to meet various government concessions to get its deal for Sprint (NYSE:S) approved. This is one step closer, but the parties may still need to do more. Sprint rallied over 4.5% on the news. When will it finally end? Caution From the AnalystsThere were a few noteworthy calls this morning, despite the sleepy stock market. The first was on Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), which received a downgrade from RBC Capital Markets. The analyst downgraded the stock from outperform to neutral and maintained his $90 price target. His actions seem justified given the stock's major run this year (up 204% year to date). To be even more fair, the analyst said the rally was justified and that investors should buy on any major pullback. However, one could argue that it came a little late, with shares down almost 20% from its recent highs. Citigroup analysts were cautious on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The analysts are concerned about China's impact on Apple, even though CEO Tim Cook said he believes the holiday period should mark the trough for its business in China. Further, the trade war just took a positive step forward and Apple's most recent revenue guidance came in handedly above consensus estimates. So what's the problem? Analyst Jim Suva says that Apple's China sales &quot;could be cut in half.&quot; That's thanks to a &quot;less favorable brand image.&quot; Ironically, Suva maintains a buy rating and $205 price target on Apple.   * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate Lyft &gt; Uber? That's according to one analyst, who raised his price target on Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) from $70 to $76 and maintained his buy rating. For Uber (NYSE:UBER), he initiated the stock with a hold rating and $50 price target. Although, with that $50 price target, it would mean Uber stock would need to breakout over its $45 IPO price. Perhaps that's the silver lining. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-07-03,"(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile U.S. Inc. is on the cusp of securing U.S. Justice Department approval for its $26.5 billion merger with Sprint Corp., after establishing the general outlines of asset sales to Dish Network Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.The Justice Department is hammering out final issues with T-Mobile on an agreement aimed at ensuring Dish can become a strong fourth competitor in the U.S. wireless market, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. While the sticking points aren’t insurmountable, the Justice Department has yet to bless the arrangement to allow Sprint’s acquisition to proceed.T-Mobile is trying to offer just enough concessions to gain approval but not so many that it creates a formidable rival while the Justice Department is aiming to maximize competition, the people said.Sprint and Dish shares both jumped on Bloomberg’s report. Sprint was up 1.7% to $7 at 12:35 p.m. in New York, while Dish climbed 2.3% to $40.07. T-Mobile climbed less than 1% to $75.94.T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to sell to Dish some airwaves and Sprint’s pay-as-you-go brands, including Boost, Virgin Mobile and Sprint Prepaid, the people said. Dish would also get a six-to-seven-year wholesale agreement allowing it to sell T-Mobile wireless service under the Dish brand. The package would also include a three-year service agreement from T-Mobile to provide operational support as prepaid customers shift to Dish, according to one of the people.The companies are expected to hash out the unresolved issues around network sharing within a few days, setting them up for a possible decision from the Justice Department as early as next week, they said.CNBC first reported the details of the wholesale agreement as well as potential timing of the Justice Department’s decision.Representatives for T-Mobile, its parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG and the Justice Department declined to comment. A representative for Sprint didn’t have an immediate response to a request for comment.T-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in April 2018, pitching the transaction as a way to advance the introduction of the next generation of wireless technology known as 5G, a priority of President Donald Trump.Regulatory ConcernsThe companies have already won the support of the Federal Communications Commission, in part by promising to deploy a 5G network that would cover 99% of the U.S. population within six years.They still have to win over Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who wants the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers to shed enough assets to lay the groundwork for a new fourth competitor.Approval from the Justice Department could give the carriers a boost as they contend with a lawsuit filed by a group of state attorneys general who say the deal should be blocked because it will hinder competition and raise prices.Ergen’s AmbitionsThe concessions would be a boon for Charlie Ergen, the billionaire chairman of Dish. Long aware of the inevitable decline of satellite television, he has spent billions of dollars in government auctions to amass wireless airwaves.Gaining a wireless business and some airwaves would bring him closer to building a state-of-the-art network that can send video and other content without the need for cable or a satellite antenna.(Updates with trading in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from William Wilkes.To contact the reporters on this story: Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.net;David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, ;Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Sara FordenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",T-Mobile on Cusp of Justice Department Approval for Sprint

2019-07-05,"I can't believe how badly the media is downplaying the 5G revolution. They're so focused on the U.S.-China trade war that they're completely missing the epic battle over 5G.You may have heard that the big wireless carriers -- Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T),T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) -- are racing to roll out 5G networks.But this story is MUCH bigger than that. 5G will literally change the world forever (as we'll see).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd you better believe Wall Street is all over this. While the  mainstream media may be mostly ignoring 5G, the &quot;smart money&quot; sure isn't.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 So…why are investors so fired up about 5G stocks? And why should you be, too? Let me explain why. 5G: What You Need to KnowI remember very well, back in the early days of the internet, when folks often referred to it as the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;So let's picture it that way. You're heading home after a long day of work. Your commute shouldn't take very long, but there is only a one-lane highway, and it's the only way home. The traffic is bumper-to-bumper, and what should be a quick 20-minute drive takes hours instead.Over time, a second lane is built. There's still plenty of traffic, but the congestion is less.Eventually, a third lane is built, and then a fourth. Those of you who commute this way find that your ride home is getting shorter and shorter.Then, one day, 10 more lanes suddenly open up. Not only is that awful congestion gone, but cars are zipping along. Now you're home almost instantly! With the commute done, you've got the rest of the day to yourself.That's the kind of difference we'll see with 5G.5G -- the fifth generation of wireless technology -- will introduce blazing speeds…and be more readily available. I'm expecting a massive upgrade to smartphones and other mobile devices.What's so exciting is that it has low latency: Instead of two minutes or more to load a webpage, like we dealt with in the 1990s, now it'll take you six seconds to download a whole movie with 5G!With so many web services going to the cloud, that's key. You'll now be able to interact with them in real-time. Phones Getting Smarter By the DaySince 5G tends to be associated with the big wireless carriers, like Verizon's &quot;5G Revolution&quot; and AT&T's &quot;5G Evolution,&quot; let's start there.1G wireless devices were those big, clunky phones from the 1980s. Since they used analog technology, they only supported voice calls. They also had poor battery life and security and were prone to dropped calls. And most people could barely fit them in their car's glove compartment, let alone their pants pocket.Wireless technology certainly has come a long way since then, as the graphic below illustrates. 2G brought us SMS text messaging. With 3G we had texting and internet access, while 4G tacked on video -- and 5G opens the door to Ultra HD, 3D video and smart home apps. The hardware is also much, much sleeker.The first five phones are in the works, starting with the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G and the LG V50 ThinQ, and with the Huawei Mate X, the Xiaomi Mi Mix3 5G and the ZTE Axon 10Pro soon to come.These will offer buffer-free video, faster downloads, and greater bandwidth to handle more data. So much so that they'll be able to capture an entire 3D space!According to CCS Insight, sales of 5G smartphones should hit 100 million units in 2021. Grab Your Slice of the PieYou can see why Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint are all vying to place first in the race to 5G. In fact, all of them released some form of 5G this year. Verizon is in the lead: It's already rolled out mobile 5G in Chicago and Minneapolis in April, with 20 other metro areas to come later in 2019.So, you might be expecting me to recommend VZ, or one of its peers, as my 5G play. Not so.5G has many more applications than smartphones -- we'll look at some more tomorrow -- and one of them is &quot;the mother of all technologies,&quot; a breakthrough that will change our world…once we've got those &quot;extra lanes&quot; for it to run on.The 5G global infrastructure market is expected to grow from $2.55 billion in 2020 to over $42 billion by 2025. That's a 75% increase -- far larger than many other industries could ever imagine in just five years.The bottom line: 5G is a very, very big deal. Essentially, whoever controls 5G is anticipated to control the internet several years from now. So, the long-term investment potential is huge.However, instead of one company that needs 5G technology, I think more money can be made in the one that's involved in the creation of 5G. That will be the stock that lets us cash in on that whole meteoric rise of the 5G market.In Growth Investor, we own a little-known electronics company -- that is helping some high-profile clients move to 5G. Its customers include the top 25 telecoms…the top 25 tech companies…and 78 of the Fortune 100 companies.Go here to watch my presentation on the huge technological shift going on now.

2019-07-06,"(Bloomberg) -- About $20 billion worth of wireless airwaves are sitting dormant, public goods whose rights were acquired by Dish Network Corp. in government auctions over the past decade. Put to use, they could create more competition and supply millions more high-speed connections. To finally unleash those airwaves, the government is being asked to place more trust than ever in Dish and its owner, billionaire Charlie Ergen. Dish is on track to get even more airwaves and other assets this year, this time as part of a side deal to T-Mobile US Inc.’s purchase of Sprint Corp. The idea is set up Dish, known for its satellite TV service, as a nationwide wireless carrier, creating a new competitor after the $26.5 billion T-Mobile-Sprint merger subtracts one provider from the U.S. market. Any airwaves transfer would need approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which has been pressuring Ergen to use the spectrum he already has. The FCC has said it will move to take away licenses if Dish doesn’t meet requirements to begin offering mobile service on its existing airwaves holdings by 2020. Those warnings may be overtaken by events. Talks among T-Mobile and Sprint, the Justice Department and Dish are at an advanced stage, Bloomberg News reported July 3. The Justice Department could decide to back the deal as soon as next week. “It would be foolish to have him spend money on a network build that no longer makes sense by the spring of 2020,” Blair Levin, a Washington-based analyst for New Street Research, said in an interview.The Justice Department appears to see Dish as a credible new competitor in the wireless market. T-Mobile and Sprint would let Dish use their infrastructure for six or seven years until Dish can build its own network, people familiar with the matter said this week. That might appeal to the FCC because it would let Dish immediately enter the market, even though it might take more time to use its airwaves. “The FCC will hesitate to cripple what the DOJ views as a critical fourth competitor,” Matthew Schettenhelm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a June 19 note.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in May announced his support for T-Mobile’s merger, and in the following days, so did the remaining two members of the agency’s Republican majority. The statements preceded news in June of the Justice Department’s desire to create a new wireless competitor and Dish’s interest in bidding for T-Mobile and Sprint assets.Dish has had other misadventures at the FCC that may be fresh in Pai’s mind as he weighs whether to entrust Ergen with the fate of the wireless market. The agency is considering whether to grant a $3.3 billion discount on airwaves claimed at auction in 2015 by two Dish partners that said they were small businesses. The FCC denied the discount, saying the firms weren’t independent of Dish -- with Pai at the time saying he was “outraged.”Now the partners say they’ve reduced their ties with Ergen’s company, and the FCC is weighing whether to restore the discount. The issue may remain separate from the other airwaves considerations, Levin said.To contact the reporters on this story: Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Crayton Harrison at tharrison5@bloomberg.net, Shamim AdamFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",A $20 Billion Wireless Stockpile Is the Key to T-Mobile Merger

2019-07-08,"The stock market began to sell off on Friday, but a lack of sellers on low volume meant there was little follow through. Investors were a little on edge with the Nasdaq today, with a notable downgrade on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), weakness in many semiconductor stocks and investors' worries about whether the Federal Reserve will actually cut interest rates now. As a result, the Nasdaq slipped 78 basis points, closing near the key 8,100 level at 8,098. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore Friday's better-than-expected labor report, the market had been pricing in as much as a 50-basis-point cut in the Fed Funds rates. Consensus expectations still call for a 25 bps cut.   In any regard, all but removing the hopes for a 50 bps cut -- there's still a ~6% chance this month -- is denting equities. Worth mentioning though is that the market is 100% pricing in some form of a cut. We detailed why this is important for tech stock specifically on Friday. We won't rehash that conversation. However, we will just say that, should the Fed opt to not cut rates -- and remember, this is the same Fed that was way too hawkish in Q4 2018 -- stock market investors will throw a tantrum.  Google-Dish to Battle the New &quot;Big Three?&quot;Typically used in reference of Detroit's three largest automakers, the &quot;Big Three&quot; of telecom very well could become AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), assuming the latter is able to close on its acquisition of Sprint (NYSE:S).   * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 However, part of getting the T-Mobile/Sprint deal approved requires divesting enough assets for a fourth large carrier to emerge. Short of working out a few of the details, it seems that Dish Networks (NASDAQ:DISH) will be the emerging player.  Rumors that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is considering teaming up with Dish were quickly squashed by the company. But it brings up an interesting point. Surely investors will boo GOOGL getting involved in a capital-intensive business like telecom, no matter how strong its balance sheet is or how much free-cash flow such a business generates. Capital-intensive businesses generally come with a high valuation and dividend yield (which makes the Big Three of telecom and auto more similar than just the nickname). Want more? Rumors say former Ford (NYSE:F) CEO Alan Mulally is negotiating for Google in these alleged talks. Speculation and potential coincidences aside, I don't know that I believe GOOGL is considering such a move. That's even with its Android operating system and its line of Pixel smartphones. But it wouldn't be the worst way to pump life into its handset/smartphone business, even if it is capital intensive. In any regard, shareholders would have a fit and the c-suite knows it.  Tesla TodayTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) made headlines -- when is that not the case? -- when its CEO Elon Musk opened up further about the automaker's self-driving car plans. One Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user asked, &quot;Do consumers have limited time left to buy a Tesla car since prices would have to go up severalfold to balance supply & demand once you solve FSD?&quot;Musk's answer: Yes. Of course, the next question then turns to solving FSD (full self-driving). Level 5 autonomous driving is no easy feat, and it's hard to imagine that it will come into play to the point where consumers have to worry about how much time they have left to buy a Tesla vehicle near today's prices. Musk also said the company is working on launching new self-driving chips for older Teslas by the end of the year.   Last but not least regarding Tesla, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas stuck with his full-year vehicle deliveries forecast of 347,000. That's below the company's estimate of 360,000 to 400,000 and despite its second-quarter results of 95,200 came in ahead of consensus. Jonas also lowered his revenue estimates for Q3 and Q4, while maintaining a $230 price target and an equal-weight rating.  Other News in the Nasdaq TodayApple was also in the analyst spotlight Monday, catching a downgrade to &quot;sell&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; at Rosenblatt Securities. The analyst has a $150 price target, implying about 25% downside. He believes that iPhone and iPad revenue will be disappointing in the second half. Apple fell 2.06% on the day.Finally, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is apparently making progress on its deal for Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC). The company is also apparently considering a purchase of the privately held Tibco, but the deal will be &quot;sidelined&quot; if the SYMC deal moves forward. That seems to be the case on Monday, with AVGO reportedly making progress on securing the financing for the deal. An announcement could come later this month. In any regard, investors still aren't happy about the news, pushing AVGO down 2.72% to roughly $275 on the day.

This spot was previously held by Red Hat. However, that company is no longer on the public market after being acquired by IBM (NYSE:IBM).The T-Mobile news about is joining the S&P 500 is actually a little ahead of its debut on the index.

2019-07-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Players beware when Charlie Ergen holds all the cards. As T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. continue to fight in Washington for their long-awaited merger, the wily satellite-TV billionaire is the companies’ best hope for getting the deal through. Unless, of course, he walks away.Ergen, the 66-year-old chairman and co-founder of Dish Network Corp., has a reputation for being an finicky dealmaker, with a tendency to upset merger processes and then drop out. The former professional poker player would say he’s simply not afraid to fold his cards – or alienate his peers. Case in point: A few years ago, Ergen offered to buy both Sprint and Clearwire, which then turned into a bidding war against Sprint for Clearwire, a collection of wireless-spectrum assets. Ergen ultimately gave up on both pursuits, but not before driving Sprint to pay about 70% more than it initially bid. Sprint got Ergened. Back to present day, and what do you know: Sprint’s fate pretty much rests in Ergen’s hands, as the U.S. Department of Justice determines whether to approve or reject its $59 billion takeover by T-Mobile. Makan Delrahim, the DOJ’s head of antitrust, reportedly wants the companies to divest assets that could be used to create a new viable fourth competitor as a check on the industry’s pricing power. So Ergen, who had been among the merger’s biggest opponents, is now ostensibly ready to be the deal’s savior by acquiring those assets and committing to morphing Dish into a full-fledged wireless carrier. Maybe. Over the years, Ergen had gamed the government auction system to scoop up Dish’s own valuable spectrum licenses, which have a use-it-or-lose-it provision with nearing deadlines. Taking on the scraps from the T-Mobile-Sprint deal could ease that pressure and help Ergen make good on his promises to build a network. But if unnamed sources cited by the New York Post are to be believed, Deutsche Telekom AG, T-Mobile’s parent, is insisting it will only hand those assets to Dish if it vows not to sell more than a 5% stake in itself to a third party such as Google or Amazon.com Inc., which are two giant would-be threats to the industry.It makes sense that T-Mobile’s side would be worried about Dish teaming up with one of those deeper-pocketed companies, as I wrote last month. And agreeing not to do so certainly isn’t in Dish’s best interests. Ergen has said he needs a partner for Dish’s network build-out, which presumably would entail some sort of shared ownership.For that reason, Ergen could just walk away once again. Without him, there may be no T-Mobile-Sprint merger. After all, 13 states and the District of Columbia have sued to block the deal in a trial that may start in October. No deal could also mean T-Mobile turns to Dish to fulfill its spectrum needs.“Charlie is very hard to understand and predict,” billionaire dealmaker John Malone, owner of the Liberty media assets and director emeritus at Charter Communications Inc., said of Ergen a few years ago. “He’s very creative, but he’s a poker player.” (Ironically, Fox Business Network reported that because some at T-Mobile and Sprint are skeptical of Ergen’s dealings with the DOJ, they’re “praying” Charter and Malone will bid for the divested assets.)John Legere, T-Mobile’s outspoken and genial CEO, has been an ideal pitchman for the deal, smoothly handling inquisitions by Congress over the past year and constantly using his highly followed social media channels to promote the merger. But his style may be no match for Ergen’s whimsy. At the end of Legere’s latest episode of “Slow Cooker Sunday” this week – where he demonstrated recipes for Cajun corn on the cob and lemon feta drumsticks – the magenta-apron-wearing executive took a moment to make a wish. I think I know what it was. This may be the week that finally yields a decision from the DOJ, and what that decision will be is still anyone’s guess. But what I can say for certain is something I’ve said many times before: Good luck betting against Charlie Ergen. To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

2019-07-12,"When it comes to finding great dividends, the telecoms can't be beat. Thanks to their stable demand and fixed operating costs, the major telecommunication providers have long been able to provide their investors with a steady income and high yields. That's certainly been true for giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) over the last decade or so. And, as a result, both VZ and T stock have become staples of many retirees' portfolios.Source: Shutterstock However, growth at both AT&T and Verizon has slowed in recent years. Wireless saturation is near 100% and upstarts like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) have driven down prices for wireless and data plans. That hit T & VZ right in their wallets. To compensate for that, each telecom took a similar, yet different path to finding future growth.The question now is: which of the two major telecom stocks -- AT&T or Verizon -- makes more sense for your portfolio today?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips VZ & T Stock Make Some Big MovesThese days, investors can't think of Verizon or AT&T as strictly old-fashioned telecoms. It's no secret that landline usage has fallen off the map. Meanwhile, new wireless subscriber growth has basically flatlined. At this point, everyone has a smartphone and perhaps a secondary device hooked up to wireless networks. Moreover, thanks to fungibility among carriers and price wars, consumers are able to switch with ease. Because of this, the major U.S. telecoms like T and VZ have had to look elsewhere for growth.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown For AT&T, that meant becoming a media powerhouse. Cable television provider Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) set the trend when it purchased NBCUniversal. T followed a similar playbook by adding exposure to cable with its buyout of DirecTV. These gave the ability to offer triple-play services as well as wireless service to its consumers. Like CMCSA, AT&T then added content origination with its mega-sized buyout of Time Warner. This acquisition gave T ownership of HBO, Turner Broadcasting as well as Warner Bros. entire movie catalog. The idea was that AT&T could now bundle original content with its own private network of mobile/wireless video and satellite services.Verizon is playing in the same sandbox, albeit it's building a different castle. VZ decided to go hard into web properties. This included buying AOL and Yahoo. The idea was that the firm could become a major player in digital advertising and the mobile web. The firm also beefed its other tech operations with Telogis and Fleetmatics Group. These cloud operations allowed businesses to take advantage of fleet operations software that can be used on VZ's wide and high-speed wireless networks. Not What VZ Stock & T Stock Bargained ForAs you can see, the shift in both AT&T and Verizon was designed to offer tangential services using their huge networks. T was setting itself to be an all-in-one media and content provider. It would make the movies and then distribute them over its satellite and mobile video operations. And there would be some exclusivity in that. AT&T recently unveiled its plans for its own streaming service to accomplish this goal. VZ went hard into the lucrative world of digital advertising, data mining and cloud services.Unfortunately, neither operation has proved too fruitful for either T or VZ.The combination of AOL and Yahoo is basically worthless for Verizon. At the end of last year, the firm wrote down the goodwill of the deals by just under half -- or a whopping a $4.6 billion. And the hits kept coming. Verizon Media showed a big 7.2% decline in year-over-year revenues. The company specifically blamed lower ad revenues for the dip.Things haven't been great for AT&T either. It turns out providing cable services is just as sticky as providing wireless ones. People continue to cut the cord at a fevered pace and adopt streaming instead. That's hurt DirecTV in a big way. The firm has lost nearly 1.3 million video subscribers over the last two quarters. It's streaming service -- DirecTV Now -- has lost nearly 20% of its total net subscribers in the last 6 months. This is a huge issue if your entire M.O. was getting people to watch your produced, movies and T.V. shows on your exclusive networks. The firm continues to bleed traditional cable subscribers -- via its U-Verse business -- as well.So, neither transition is working out the way AT&T and Verizon planned. To make matters worse, both stocks are now heavily indebted because of the buyouts, mergers and plans to change their business model. At the end of March, T had more than $169 billion in debt on its balance sheet. Verizon is doing a tad better at $113 billion. That's a major problem for both stocks if these efforts don't pan out. Should You Buy T Stock or VZ Stock?Given the struggles at both AT&T and Verizon, neither one makes a compelling purchase right now. Those debt loads are pretty scary considering the assets used to make them aren't performing as planned. Honestly, I'd be worried about their dividends -- the reason why people buy them in the first place -- if things don't improve.But if I had to make the decision today, I'd most likely go with Verizon. The firm has at least acknowledged that its move in advertising was a poor choice and has removed the Band-Aid on these operations. The write-downs, layoffs and cost-cutting efforts will make it much easier for the firm to bounce back. And these brands -- like Tech Crunch and the Huff Po -- are valuable to someone, if it decides to sell them. Meanwhile, it's gone gung-ho on its 5G network services.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth in the Second Half of 2019 On the flip side, AT&T has decided to double-down on its problems -- launching four different streaming services in a bid to regain customers.In the end, both major telecoms have plenty of warts and may not be big buys at all. But if investors were looking at them both, VZ stock gets the slight nod over T stock.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-07-12,"Back in late May, yours truly suggested the 5G opportunity Nokia (NYSE:NOK) has ahead of it made NOK stock a buy. The 37 commercial 5G contracts Nokia had inked at the time was lighting the path ahead for Finland's telecom-tech giant, despite the fact that NOK was still facing its share of headaches.Source: Shutterstock In the meantime, the figure has been ramped up to 42 contracts.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond But that early-June news did nothing to bolster beaten-down Nokia stock. However, a rebound of NOK stock may be in the works. The comeback is just going to take some time to pan out, as NOK does indeed appear to have become a &quot;show me first&quot; stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe show is coming. Setting the StageOne of the 42 5G deals that NOK has received was with Taiwan Star Telecom, which is growing its existing network  to prepare for 5G service. It was the &quot;off the shelf,&quot; complete nature of Nokia's portfolio that made NOK the easy choice for TST.China Mobile (NYSE CHL) confirmed at last month's Mobile World Congress that it would be the first to utilize Nokia's Massive MIMO solution, laying the ground work for its 5G network. China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) announced on Wednesday that Nokia's optical fronthaul hardware would help usher in its foray into 5G. Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and BT Group (NYSE:BT) are all also tapping Nokia for help on the 5G front.Given NOK's confirmed 5G contracts, CEO Rajeev Suri's June comment that his company wins &quot;two-thirds of the time&quot; when competing with rival Ericsson (NYSE:ERIC) for new business isn't a tough idea to believe. His company is making new deals at a pace Ericsson has somehow been unable to keep up with.But that just hasn't mattered to investors, who ultimately dictate the price of NOK stock. Slow Moving, But Not That SlowWhen Nokia's CEO, Suri, commented in May that &quot;5G is not the future anymore. It is here, and Nokia is leading it. We are winning deals and rolling out some of the world's first 5G networks&quot; he didn't necessarily mean that NOK was literally in the process of rolling out 5G networks.For that matter, he didn't mean that it would launch the networks during that week or month. It can take several weeks -- if not months -- just to put the new hardware in place and put it into operation. In some cases, the installations called for by inked contracts likely aren't even scheduled to happen until next year.Revenue from such deals can't be booked yet, of course, and none has been. NOK made that point in conjunction with its Q1 report, and Suri reiterated it last month. The publicly available details of those contracts are minimal, at best; NOK doesn't divulge the specifics of deals it makes, nor should it.With 42 contracts in hand, however, analysts and investors alike are arguably underestimating how much revenue is in its pipeline for the latter part of this year and all of next year.Meanwhile, NOK will sign additional 5G deals, which aren't factored into most analysts' estimates.Analysts'  alarmingly anemic average estimates for NOK adds further credence to that theory. They've estimated that its revenue will drop by 3%, and only recover by about as much in 2020. The following year's revenue growth outlook is only marginally better. Earnings per share is projected to improve at a faster clip, but still modestly, and still not rapidly until 2021.  Click to EnlargeIt's going to take some time for Nokia's 5G opportunity to bear fruit, but it may not take nearly as much time as the pros are suggesting. The Bottom Line on NOK StockSo far, NOK has gotten little to no credit for its newly-won contracts, as investors struggle to get past the company's disappointing first -quarter results. Unfortunately, the upcoming second -quarter results may be equally disappointing.Any Q2 trouble may already be more than priced into Nokia stock, though.Whatever's in the cards, from Q3 on, the telecom technology giant is far better positioned to top revenue and earnings estimates than most investors appear to believe. The weakness of Nokia stock since April is still a dip worth buying if you can stomach a few quarters of volatility.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Makan Delrahim, the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust chief, is trying to shape a deal combining T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. that he can pitch as a win for consumers. Here’s how he may do it.If the $26.5 billion deal is approved, it’s likely to include conditions that give satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp. enough airwaves, prepaid customers and network access to emerge as a new national wireless competitor.That would allow T-Mobile and financially struggling Sprint to merge and create a stronger No. 3 rival to AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. Dish’s role would satisfy the government’s longstanding demand that there be four national mobile-service companies remaining.“The right deal could be a genuine win for consumers, and if Delrahim structures it right, the facts and history will stand by him,” said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research LLC.The Justice Department is nearing a final decision. While the broad outline of an accord has been established, key issues are still being debated -- including possible limits on Dish’s ambitions as a wireless carrier. The company owns billions of dollars in unused airwaves that could be tapped to create an even more formidable competitor if it’s free to obtain sufficient outside investment to build its own network, according to people familiar with the matter.Under that broad outline, Sprint’s airwaves would land in more financially stable hands. The No. 4 U.S. carrier has the most mobile-phone spectrum in the U.S. but has limited ability to build a network given its years of losses and financial constraints. Combining with No. 3 T-Mobile would solve those problems.Opponents LurkEven if Delrahim gives his blessing, he’ll still have to convince opponents that consumers won’t see higher prices and fewer choices. One point he’ll likely to highlight is that the deal provides a path to putting Dish’s trove of airwaves to work. The department declined to comment.Skeptics point out that the track record for competitors created by divestitures has been dismal. French communications firm Iliad SA became Italy’s fourth carrier last year after buying assets divested by two larger rivals that merged. Iliad had an initial surge in subscriber growth, followed by a slowdown across the sector.“The premise that this deal will be good for everyone may be a little overly optimistic,” said Phil Berenbroick of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. “It’s obvious how harmful they think the deal is if they have to create a remedy as extravagant as this.”New KidThe shift to wireless will be a challenge for Dish, which is better known as the second-largest U.S. satellite TV provider. Dish has no experience selling phones or operating a mobile service. As part of the deal taking shape, the company would take over fewer than 9 million prepaid customers from Sprint to get its wireless business started. But that’s a tiny runway to competing against incumbent carriers with 10 times more subscribers.The future looks better for T-Mobile. With Sprint’s spectrum, it will have nearly twice the wireless capacity of any other carrier. The company’s cost per gigabyte, a measure of how expensive it is to deliver service, will be cut in half, Chaplin said.“If that isn’t a recipe for lower prices and share gains, I don’t know what is,” he said.Judgment DayThe merger has already won a nod from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, provided the combined company divests its Boost prepaid business, freezes prices and deploys a 5G network that would cover 99% of the U.S. population within six years.If the Justice Department approves, T-Mobile and Sprint would gain an important ally as they fight a lawsuit challenging the merger brought in June by 13 states and the District of Columbia. The states argue the tie-up will harm competition and lead to higher prices.Chaplin said investors may provide a crucial clue when the Justice Department announces its now-expected approval.“Watch what happens to the stock price of AT&T and Verizon on the day the deal is announced,” he said. “That will be the best litmus test of whether the deal is good for consumers, or not. If their stock prices fall, it is probably a good deal for consumers.”&#92;--With assistance from Todd Shields.To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net;David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Antitrust Boss Playing Kingmaker in T-Mobile’s Deal for Sprint

2019-07-16,"[Editor's note: &quot;4 Internet of Things Stocks That Will Connect Investors to Profit&quot; was previously published in January 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]As the reach of wireless expands, the Internet of Things -- or IoT -- promises to become one of the more robust niches in tech over the next few years. As such, Internet of Things stocks should prosper along with the industry.Semiconductor firms play an essential role in the growth of the IoT industry. However, due in large part to factors not related to IoT, many  of the best semiconductor stocks have seen their values drop dramatically in recent months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip While this may put off some investors, many Internet of Things stocks now trade at valuations so low that they could become the best stocks in tech once a recovery begins. With low valuations, a potential for growth, and their critical roles in IoT, these four stocks appear well positioned to benefit investors: AT&T (T)AT&T (NYSE:T) stands in a uniquely strong position in the 5G market. Assuming T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) succeeds in acquiring Sprint (NYSE:S), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T, and T-Mobile will form a &quot;Big Three&quot; of wireless. Given the tens of billions in cost it takes to build a 5G network, the market will likely not see new entrants. Hence, most IoT devices will eventually run on services provided by one of these firms.I chose AT&T primarily because it maintains the lowest forward P/E ratio -- 9.3 -- and has the largest dividend yield -- currently 6% -- among the three.To a degree, T stock has become cheap for a reason. Unlike its other major peers, it has taken on tens of billions in debt to acquire a sizable media content library. Investor skepticism about this move likely explains the lower P/E ratio.Admittedly, I do not know if this strategy will succeed. What I do know is that AT&T can sell the content library if that business line fails. Also, with the oligopoly forming in the nascent 5G industry, chances of failure in that niche are near zero. Hence, I feel okay with collecting a 6% dividend while waiting for this approach to play out. Once AT&T finds their path to success, the P/E ratio should catch up to that of its peers. Due primarily to its 5G network, AT&T should eventually become one of the more successful Internet of Things stocks. NXP Semiconductor (NXPI)NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI) takes its place among Internet of Things stocks on many levels. The firm's work in chips for automotive, consumer, and industrial applications means IoT plays a critical role in the company's products. Through IoT, it connects devices ranging from cars to health monitors to drones.As a result, NXPI stock appears more immune to the chip glut that has hurt profit growth for many semiconductor companies. However, despite this immunity, the market has punished NXPI stock. It fell for most of 2018, losing over 35% of its value since hitting its all-time high in February. Granted, the failed takeover attempt by Qualcomm hurt the stock as well. However, with a forward P/E of 10.8, Wall Street values it as if it were being hit by the chip glut.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Analyst forecasts indicate otherwise. For 2019, on average, they predict 10% profit growth. They think NXPI will see double-digit profit increases in 2020 as well. Moreover, as 5G networks launch in earnest in 2020, and self-driving cars take to the roads, IoT should take off exponentially. This should propel NXPI stock to more gains. With a market cap of $28.3 billion, its story has only just begun. Once the market notices the continued profit growth of NXPI, I doubt the P/E will remain so low for long. Qualcomm (QCOM)In recent years, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) seems better known for its failed attempt to take over NXP or its court battles with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, Qualcomm has led the way in connectivity for decades. That has helped to make QCOM one of the leading Internet of Things stocks.Even without 5G, Qualcomm has already shipped over 1 billion IoT devices. The firm offers turnkey IoT solutions. Also, its latest 5G-compatible Snapdragon processor will further strengthen its IoT presence.IoT could also lead a recovery in long-suffering QCOM stock. QCOM has lost one-third of its value since reaching a multi-year high in 2014.Years of pain have taken its forward P/E to about 14.75. But analysts forecast a return of profit growth next year, as they expect its profit to increase by 35%. Forecasts also indicate double-digit earnings increase will continue after 2020.Investors should also take QCOM seriously as a dividend stock. It has hiked its payout for eight straight years. The company will pay $2.48 per share this year, amounting to a yield of nearly 3.3%. Even if the stock languishes, stockholders earn a decent return while they wait for a recovery. Hence, with a low valuation and a recovery in profits forecast, QCOM could become one of the more lucrative IoT stocks. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)At first glance, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) may not stand out from other Internet of Things stocks. Like most IoT players, SWKS specializes in chips designed for RF and mobile communications. Its IoT chips appear in smartphones, wearables, appliances, medical devices, and many other areas. SWKS also provides IoT in the world's industrial and wireless infrastructure.Despite decades of trading history, IoT has put SWKS stock on the map. It traded in the single-digits for years after the dot-com bubble burst. However, it had risen as much as 28-fold from its 2009 low before pulling back in 2018.Like most of its peers, SWKS suffered as a chip shortage quickly became an oversupply situation. SWKS stock has fallen 20% from its 52-week high. Like other Internet of Things stocks, the decline appears overdone. Thanks to the dropoff, SWKS stock trades at just 12 times the consensus forward earnings estimate.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Profits also appear positioned to recover once the industry works off the glut in available chips. For next year, Wall Street analysts, on average,  forecast profit growth of 6.8%. They also believe those increases will reach the double-digits in future years. The move to 5G should ensure this growth continues. With few companies offering such a value proposition at so low of a P/E ratio, SWKS should see increased interest from investors in the near future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

(T-Mobile US), the parent of T-Mobile, and Sprint.  While this proposed settlement still needs to be approved by the US District Court for the District of Columbia, a primary hurdle for the merger's close remains in the form of litigation by 13 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia (state AGs group).","T-Mobile USA, Inc. -- Moody's says DOJ approval of T-Mobile's merger with Sprint has no ratings impact; lawsuit by 13 state AGs remains primary hurdle"
2019-07-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said he’d move soon to push T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed purchase of Sprint Corp. through the agency, the final regulatory step for the $26.5 billion deal.Pai, in a statement issued as the Justice Department cleared the deal, applauded the gains in fast 5G communications from the merger. He didn’t say when the vote would be held, but three Republicans who comprise a majority at the FCC, including Pai, earlier expressed support for the deal, and their votes will be enough.“The commitments made to the FCC by T-Mobile and Sprint to deploy a 5G network that would cover 99% of the American people, along with the measures outlined in the Department’s consent decree, will advance U.S. leadership in 5G and protect competition,” Pai said in the statement.The deal has the “potential to help close the digital divide in rural America and maintain our nation’s leadership in 5G,” he said.The merger faces a lawsuit from states that contend the combination will reduce competition and raise prices for consumers, with a trial scheduled for October.New York’s LetterNew York sent a letter to the judge on Thursday saying T-Mobile has refused to turn over needed documents “that go to the heart of this merger challenge,” including certain internal discussions regarding talks with the Justice Department and the FCC. Five other states, including Kansas and Nebraska, signed on to the Justice Department’s approval.The transaction proposed in 2018 would combine the third- and fourth-largest nationwide mobile providers into a single competitor to the established leaders, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Supporters say the new company could quickly build an advanced 5G network, a priority of the Trump administration. Critics say it will reduce competition by eliminating Sprint as a separate force, and ultimately raise prices for consumers.Pai on Friday said he would offer the merger and accompanying economic analysis to fellow commissioners for them to consider, and to vote upon when ready. FCC rules allow three weeks or more for the process to play out behind closed doors.‘Behind Closed Doors’Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel has expressed concern that agency Republicans voiced support without awaiting the agency’s own analysis, and she cited the merger’s possible effects.“I remain skeptical that this combination is good for consumers, good for competition, or good for the economy,” Rosenworcel said in a statement on Friday. “Before the FCC votes on this new deal, the public should have the opportunity to weigh in and comment. Too much here has been done behind closed doors.”Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr said in an interview in Bloomberg’s Washington office that he will vote in favor because the merger would give rural areas access to high-speed broadband for services like telemedicine that promise to be more effective with 5G networks. Developers of applications, devices and other products reliant on the faster networks would more likely be American companies if the U.S. has a bigger and more developed network than China, he said.Pai first announced his support for the merger on May 20, and FCC’s other Republicans followed. Since then the deal has changed, with the companies agreeing with the Justice Department to set up a new, nationwide wireless provider to restore a fourth competitor to the market.The role of the new competitor is to be filled by Dish Network Corp. The company, known for its satellite TV service, has agreed to pay $5 billion for wireless assets and use airwaves from T-Mobile and the Boost brand to set up the service. Separately, Dish already has amassed a $21 billion trove of airwaves that could be used for broadband, and is under pressure to offer service using the frequencies or have the FCC seize them.Boost and VirginIn addition to spectrum Dish is buying Sprint’s prepaid businesses, Boost and Virgin. T-Mobile also is required to provide Dish with access to its mobile network for seven years while Dish builds out its own 5G network, according to a statement from the Justice Department.Dish could face penalties of up as much as $2.2 billion and potential forfeiture of licenses if it doesn’t meet its commitments, according to a Dish filing with the agency.Carr said there were “concrete requirements” on Sprint and T-Mobile to build the networks and “robust obligations” on Dish with potentially billions of dollars in penalties for all the companies if they fail to follow through on their pledges, he said.Consumer groups weren’t convinced, with Washington-based Public Citizen calling it “a monopolistic disaster.”Skeptical of Dish“Dish is never going to build out a wireless network,” Alex Harman, competition policy advocate for Public Citizen’s Congress Watch Division, said in a statement. “It has been promising the Federal Communications Commission and the Congress for nearly a decade that it would enter the wireless market but has never done so. But the company’s spectrum assets have only grown more valuable as it has sat on them without taking action to build any network infrastructure.

2019-07-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The government body that long posed the biggest obstacle to the union of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. because of the deal’s glaring antitrust issues has now given its blessing. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice approved the controversial $59 billion merger, capping a rather unconventional regulatory review process with a decision that will utterly transform the U.S. wireless market.The deal may alter how wireless-plan prices are set in the industry, where Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. are currently the only other national carriers. As part of the flimsy concessions meant to offset the negative effects, T-Mobile agreed to sell Sprint’s Boost and Virgin pay-as-you-go wireless businesses and some airwaves to Dish Network Corp., a satellite-TV company. Makan Delrahim, the DOJ’s top antitrust enforcer, is seeking to synthetically create a new fourth competitor through Dish, which will have access to T-Mobile’s wireless network for seven years while it builds its own. But Dish is inexperienced in this business, so it has a long way to go and much work to do before it can disrupt the market the same way that competition between T-Mobile and Sprint has for the last few years.In an earlier agreement with Ajit Pai, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, T-Mobile pledged to hold off on price increases, but only for three years, by which point it promises to cover 97% of the population with 5G service. Backing a deal that was once seen as off-limits, the federal government broadly has taken the stance that the merger is essential for U.S. companies to lead the world in launching faster 5G data networks, though it’s not entirely clear why.There’s irony in the fact that amid all the chest-thumping about U.S. technological dominance, the biggest beneficiary of the DOJ’s decision is a billionaire from Japan named Masayoshi Son. His company, SoftBank Group Corp., controls the downtrodden Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint, which has largely been a disappointing investment for Son. Sprint, strained by debt and a run-down brand, now gets to join a superior operator on healthier footing – and Son gets a piece of it. SoftBank is retaining 27% economic ownership of the combined entity, while T-Mobile’s German parent, Deutsche Telekom AG, will own 42%. Shares of their rivals, Verizon and AT&T, extended gains after the DOJ announcement.It’s not a done deal yet. Attorneys general from 13 states and the District of Columbia have sued to block the merger; should they proceed, they may have a strong case. However, Delrahim is reportedly trying to negotiate with state officials.Still, the DOJ appears to be contradicting itself. Just three days ago, Delrahim’s antitrust division announced a broad review of the U.S. technology giants, such as Facebook Inc. and Google, to look into whether they possess too much power and cause consumer harm. Backing a deal that similarly has the potential to hurt consumers is inconsistent with his concerns about tech overreach. The appearance of a double standard doesn’t help to suppress speculation that political forces may be at play.Questions have been raised about White House interference, just as they were during last year’s trial over AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner, in which the DOJ failed in its effort to block the deal. While some 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have come out against the Sprint takeover, arguing it would hurt lower-income consumers and Americans in rural areas, President Donald Trump has signaled support by emphasizing the need to be globally competitive in 5G and facilitate such investments: The FCC also became fiercely divided along party lines. Pai, a Republican, broke with tradition by voicing his support for the transaction in May, before his own agency colleagues and counterparts at the DOJ had the chance to complete their analyses. Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, expressed her displeasure with how this was handled, saying it “looks like some backroom dealing.”The country’s 5G push isn’t based on fantasy or a ruse, but it’s not clear how enabling T-Mobile and Sprint to combine their 5G capabilities abates the antitrust issues. On the one hand, T-Mobile will gain Sprint’s desirable mid-band spectrum, which can carry data at fast speeds and still travel long distances and through buildings. That makes it practical for connecting rural areas, as the companies promise to help close the country’s digital divide. After all, there’s a connection between income inequality and a lack of affordable access to wireless connectivity, which has become part of our social fabric.But while addressing that problem is certainly a mission to support, skepticism is warranted when any megamerger promises better service and better prices as a result. Just look at the airline industry: Consolidation has left the carriers with little incentive to compete on price or labor, improve the experience for customers or try to earn their trust (and in the case of wireless companies, part of that trust is with our personal data, and it’s been broken before).As for the notion that Dish is going to maintain the competitive balance, if that were true there’d be little reason for T-Mobile to do the deal as it likely seeks to close the gap with its larger rivals and earn margins more on par with theirs. Dish hasn’t even proven a reliable narrator in its own story yet, given that Chairman Charlie Ergen’s wireless talk has mostly been just that. It will take time for Dish to become widely known as another option for wireless service, never mind the costly, time-consuming process of actually building a network.T-Mobile and Sprint have been important competitive and innovative forces in the wireless market. We’ll know in due time whether regulators erred in not trying harder to preserve that.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

2019-07-26,"(Bloomberg) -- The Justice Department approved T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp., a deal it rejected under the previous administration, clearing one of the biggest hurdles to a takeover that will reshape the wireless industry.T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to sell multiple assets to Dish Network Corp. as a condition for approval, paving the way to creating a new wireless company, the Justice Department said in a statement Friday. The carriers have promised to deploy a 5G network that would cover 97% of the U.S. population within three years and 99% within six years.“The remedies set up Dish as a disruptive force in wireless,” said Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, during a briefing with reporters.In addition to spectrum, Dish is buying Sprint’s prepaid businesses Boost and Virgin. T-Mobile also is required to provide Dish with access to its mobile network for seven years while Dish builds out its own 5G network, according to the statement.Delrahim said Dish is paying $5 billion to $6 billion for the assets and that there are penalties if the company doesn’t follow through on its commitments.Shares of the companies climbed to session highs on the news. T-Mobile rose as much as 6.6% to $85.22, while Sprint added 8.3% to $8.06. Dish was up as much as 3.5% to $40.54.”Today is a whole different day,” said Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure on Bloomberg TV. “It gets us closer to the final milestone. We want to build the best 5G network that the U.S. will need to lead 5G.”States LawsuitThe Justice Department approval moves Sprint and T-Mobile a step closer to completing their $26.5 billion tie-up and gives the carriers a significant boost as they contend with a lawsuit by a group of states that say the deal should be blocked because it would harm consumers.If the states decide to continue the litigation, they will have to convince a judge that the agreement with Dish to establish a new wireless carrier doesn’t go far enough to resolve competitive harm from the merger. That’s a tougher challenge than showing the merger alone is harmful.The states wrote a New York judge late Thursday to complain about what they said is a lack of transparency around the planned Dish deal, which the states suspect may be arranged to “hobble” Dish as a competitor.The combination of T-Mobile and Sprint, the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers in the U.S., also has come under fire from lawmakers and consumer advocates who say it will lead to higher prices and less innovation in a market that is already concentrated. The deal leaves just two other national carriers: Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.Yet by acquiring Sprint’s spectrum, T-Mobile will have nearly twice the wireless capacity of any other carrier. That should lower prices for subscribers by cutting in half the company’s cost per gigabyte, a measure of how expensive it is to deliver service, according to Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research LLC.The Dish agreement is aimed at allowing the merger while maintaining four national wireless carriers, a longstanding requirement of the Justice Department. To work, Dish, the No. 2 U.S. satellite-TV provider, will have to build a national network. That could be a steep challenge. The company owns billions of dollars worth of unused airwaves, but it has no experience selling phones or operating a mobile service.Maverick CompetitorT-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere -- who remade T-Mobile into a maverick competitor by eliminating annual contracts and offering unlimited data plans -- disputes that prices will go up. He insists that by buying Sprint he will be able to better compete against industry leaders Verizon and AT&T, all to the benefit of U.S. consumers.The Justice Department approval puts Sprint and T-Mobile within reach of completing a deal that they have flirted with for years. In 2014, top officials at the Justice Department and the FCC rebuffed an effort by the companies to combine. The carriers returned in 2018, hoping for a more favorable reception from the Trump administration.In May, they won the backing of Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai with the promise to deploy an advanced fifth-generation wireless network.Pai said he will present a draft order “soon” that would follow the DOJ’s filings. He said the agreement “will advance U.S. leadership in 5G and protect competition.”He said the the transaction has “the potential to help close the digital divide in rural America and maintain our nation’s leadership in 5G.”Read More: FCC Chief Reaffirms Support for T-Mobile Deal and Sets Up VoteDelrahim forced the companies to go further to remedy competition problems in the merger. That led to the Dish agreement, which is intended to restore competition in the market. Whether it works depends on whether Charlie Ergen, the billionaire chairman of Dish, can carry out plans to build a new competitor. If not, Delrahim is sure to face criticism for accepting a failed remedy.Gaining a wireless business with some airwaves thrown in would get Ergen another step closer to his goal of building a state-of-the-art network that can send video and other content without the need for cable or a satellite antenna. Ergen has long been aware of the inevitable decline of the satellite-TV business and has spent billions of dollars in government auctions to amass wireless airwaves.Dish is now committed to rolling out a nationwide 5G network that reaches 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023. If the company fails, it owes the government as much as $2.2 billion.Ergen likened the endeavor to his start in the satellite-TV business in the ’90s.“We’ve been here before,” he said in a statement. “When we entered pay-TV with the launch of our first satellite in 1995, we faced entrenched cable monopolies.”But the company went on to shake up the industry, he said. “Dish encountered many skeptics who questioned our ability to succeed,” he said. “But customers loved the disruption we brought to the marketplace.”(Updates with comment by Sprint’s Claure in seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Lucas Shaw, Susan Decker and Erik Larson.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net;Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Sara Forden, John J.

2019-07-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Dish Network Corp., the hard-bargaining satellite-television company, is embarking on a second act as a major wireless carrier. But even with a cache of prized assets, it faces long-shot odds of pulling it off.The Justice Department opened the door for Dish on Friday when it cleared the $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. In doing so, it forced those companies to divest assets that will potentially transform the pay-TV provider into a major competitor.But Dish, controlled by Chairman Charlie Ergen, will still need to spend $20 billion over the next few years to build a nationwide wireless network and make use of the spectrum it owns, according to Roger Entner, a telecom analyst and founder of Recon Analytics LLC. Additional billions will be needed to run the network, set up stores and buy advertising, he said.“If you are spending less than the others, you are usually not closing the gap,” Entner said. “The others are not going to stand by and let Charlie Ergen take away their lunch. So difficult!”Becoming a wireless carrier would be a dramatic makeover for Dish, a company whose very name is synonymous with satellite equipment. Still, others have pulled off similar feats. Apple Inc. was a nobody in the mobile-phone market before 2007. Nintendo Co. was a 19th century maker of playing cards.And Ergen, a longtime card player, likes to gamble. In an interview on Friday, he said that anyone betting against Dish is making a foolish wager. “I’ve been in plenty of card games with guys across from me betting wrong,” he said.But he faces pressures that will make the overhaul challenging. With $14.4 billion in long-term debt at the end of the first quarter, Dish already is highly leveraged and may have trouble raising funds at affordable rates, Entner said.Dish’s existing satellite-TV business, meanwhile, has hemorrhaged subscribers in recent years.Even if Ergen is able to raise the money, competing with giants Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. and the new T-Mobile-Sprint will be tough, Entner said. In most countries, only three wireless companies are able to make a profit. In the U.S., No. 4 Sprint has been a financial train wreck, racking up billions of dollars in debt and losses.Dish said on Friday that it won’t need additional funds for at least the next year or so. And it’s already getting offers from prospective financing partners, said Tom Cullen, Dish’s executive vice president overseeing its wireless push.Long WaitConsumer groups have doubts about the endeavor. Public Citizen labeled the Justice Department deal a disaster on Friday, and called out Englewood, Colorado-based Dish in particular for failing to deliver on a long-promised network. Even before the agreement with T-Mobile and Sprint, the satellite company had vowed to turn its wireless airwaves into a network.“Dish is never going to build out a wireless network,” Alex Harman, competition policy advocate for Public Citizen’s Congress Watch Division, said in a statement. “It has been promising the Federal Communications Commission and the Congress for nearly a decade that it would enter the wireless market but has never done so.”What’s more likely is that Dish will ultimately sell its wireless assets to a top-three wireless carrier, analyst Chetan Sharma said in an interview. And that would leave U.S. consumers in the exact situation that the Justice Department sought to avoid: picking among just three options.DOJ RestrictionsAs part of the Justice Department agreement, Dish agreed not to sell some of its spectrum for six years without prior regulatory consent. The company also can’t lease more than 35% its capacity to the top-three providers for six years without regulatory approval.Dish is committed to rolling out a nationwide 5G network that reaches 70% of U.S. population by June of 2023. If the company fails, it owes the government as much as $2.2 billion.“As we enter the wireless business, we will again serve customers by disrupting incumbents and their legacy networks, this time with the nation’s first stand-alone 5G broadband network,” Ergen said in a statement.Underlying that pledge is $5 billion in assets that T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to sell to Dish as a condition of Justice Department approval of their merger.Prepaid BusinessUnder the accord, Dish is buying spectrum, as well as Sprint’s Boost and Virgin prepaid businesses. T-Mobile is also required to provide access to its mobile network for seven years while Dish builds its own 5G network, according to a Justice Department statement.The spectrum purchase is expected to be completed three years after the closing of the acquisition of the prepaid business, Dish said.“The remedies set up Dish as a disruptive force in wireless,” Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a briefing with reporters.While Dish may struggle to build a network on its own, it could fare better if it secures a partner, such as a large technology company, said Tim Farrar, principal at TMF Associates. The terms of the deal with the Justice Department bar an outright change in control.“The key question is whether a new entrant can disrupt the wireless market,” Farrar said. “On its own the answer is no, but if Dish secures a major partner like Amazon, then it becomes more plausible.”To contact the reporters on this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.net;Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Dish Faces ‘Difficult’ Path to Becoming a Wireless Powerhouse

2019-07-29,"After months of delay, Sprint (NYSE:S) looks set to get its wish and disappear into T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). S stock jumped 7.39% while TMUS stock gained 5.43% as investors reacted to the deal's likely fruition.Source: Shutterstock Washington reporters say merger approval could come &quot;any minute&quot; as Justice Department lawyers talk state attorneys general into dropping their opposition to the deal. The good news comes as T-Mobile announced earnings that beat estimates. The company earned $939 million, or $1.09 per share, on revenue of $10.98 billion. This came despite shelling out $222 million on the merger during the quarter.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now The earnings call to celebrate the numbers was delayed, as the company awaited word from the Justice DepartmentInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In Better Shape Than RivalsSince the deal was announced in April 2018, T-Mobile is up by 41%, or more than two times the average NASDAQ stock. Its market cap has increased to north of $68 billion, which with Sprint's market cap of $30.4 billion gives the combination a value of nearly $99 billion.That's a fraction of Verizon Communication's (NYSE:VZ) $233 billion, or AT&T's (NYSE:T) $247 billion. But Sprint no longer has technology debt, having decommissioned its wired service in 2017. T-Mobile has always been a wireless company. Verizon and AT&T still sell wired services in an age when wire cutting is more popular than avocado toast.Together, Sprint and T-Mobile had almost 30% of the U.S. wireless market at the end of 2018, against 34% for AT&T and 35% for Verizon.AT&T, however, had $167 billion in debt this year, much of it spent buying Time Warner, a content company. Verizon had $106 billion in debt, much of it spent buying its former joint-venture partner Vodafone (NYSE:VOD). Sprint's long-term debt in March was $35 billion, T-Mobile $25 billion.This means the new company is much better able to afford the cost of upgrading to 5G. Together T-Mobile and Sprint had $19 billion of capital spending last year.The bottom line is that Sprint and T-Mobile are, together, in much better shape than their rivals. They're a pure-play wireless company with minimal technology debt. If you believe 5G will be wildly profitable, they're by far the best place to invest. German WinnersReporters will write that the big winner is T-Mobile CEO John Legere, hired in 2012 when T-Mobile was a poor fourth in the U.S. market. Speculation over a Sprint merger began immediately, because Softbank Group (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) had just bought it for $20.2 billion with the aim of building a global carrier. It was assumed Sprint would be the surviving entity.Then Legere grew out his hair, started rocking t-shirts, and began marketing T-Mobile as the &quot;un-carrier&quot; with low-cost, innovative pricing schemes. T-Mobile overtook Sprint in market share, and Softbank shifted to its Vision Fund, taking big stakes in a wide swath of technology companies.The biggest winner, however, is Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS:DTEGY), formerly the state-owned phone company, still one-third owned by the government.It owned 62% of T-Mobile before the merger and will now own 42%, with nine of the 13 directors. T-Mobile dates its history from Voicestream, a mobile company formed in 1994, bought by Deutsche Telekom in 2002.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season The Germans spent more than $60 billion acquiring the assets that became T-Mobile but were willing to sell it all to AT&T in 2012 for $39 billion. Antitrust concerns scuttled that merger. The Germans are glad it did. Bottom Line for TMUS StockSo with Sprint stock certificates looking like soon-to-be historical relics and TMUS stock emerging as the surviving shares, what else should investors know?Well, for one, it's important to recognize that the Sprint-T-Mobile merger is being made because the partners are selling $3.5 billion in spectrum and their $1.5 billion re-sale business to DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH), creating a new fourth carrier.But DISH's spectrum assets will now be operating assets, meaning their value will decline. It faces huge capital spending bills.The bottom line is simple: If you want to own a stake in the wireless business in the 2020s, TMUS stock is a must holding.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- T-Mobile US Inc.’s guerrilla-style marketing and remarkable brand overhaul – one that even included CEO John Legere reinventing himself – shows what it takes to truly disrupt the market when you’re starting from last place. Are Dish Network Corp. and its chairman, Charlie Ergen, willing to go to the same lengths?Dish, the satellite-TV provider, wants to start selling wireless phone service to compete with T-Mobile, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. The biggest underestimated hurdle is how it tells that to consumers. After all, Dish’s ability to steal away subscribers is what the federal government is counting on to foster competition so that T-Mobile’s takeover of Sprint Corp. doesn’t result in higher prices. The U.S. Justice Department mandated last week that T-Mobile and Sprint sell the Boost and Virgin pay-as-you-go businesses and some spectrum licenses to Dish to help it eventually build its own high-speed 5G data network and become a formidable competitor. (It gets to rent access to T-Mobile’s network in the meantime.) That will give Dish a good jump-start, but putting together a wireless network is a costly, intricate process. Indeed, Ergen has been looking for the assistance of a deep-pocketed partner, with speculation centered on tech giants like Google or Amazon.More importantly, the difference between becoming a success story like T-Mobile and a basket case like Sprint isn’t just network quality. Brand reputation plays a huge role, and Dish has a long way to go. For starters, pay-TV operators aren’t exactly beloved by consumers, and Dish isn’t a name currently associated with mobile-phone service, although T-Mobile wasn’t always winning awards for popularity either. I find this to be one of the most fascinating and instructive statistics about T-Mobile’s turnaround: The company’s selling, general and administrative expenses, which comprise things like marketing costs, were equal to 53% of gross profit last year. That means more than 50 cents of each dollar of gross profit was going to SG&A, and it’s been that way for years. That compares with only about 40 cents at both AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., and even less at Sprint.This goes beyond just run-of-the-mill advertising, for which T-Mobile and Sprint have equally spent roughly $10 billion over the past eight years. If you’ve ever seen a T-Mobile corporate or consumer event, you know that the company pulls out all the stops when it comes to magenta props and swag. Even its quarterly earnings calls, which can be streamed live on YouTube, are a branding bonanza: The executives’ outfits are playfully emblazoned with the magenta T, as are their microphones and almost anything else in the background. Legere, at one time a suit-wearing businessman indistinguishable from all the rest, can now be spotted in pink whenever he’s out for a run or testifying before Congress. He records a Facebook Live cooking video each week called “Slow Cooker Sunday” sporting a T-Mobile apron. The 61-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology grad is the company’s very own social-media influencer, and shameless self-promotion is part of T-Mobile’s corporate ethos.It’s over the top, but it’s been an incredibly effective strategy that's every bit as responsible for T-Mobile’s ascent over the last few years as were its decisions around spectrum and pricing. As for Sprint, improving its network is merely a matter of money (which it’s short on). But revamping the Sprint brand perception would have required much more than its billionaire controlling shareholder, Masa Son, writing a check. Dish also can’t make the same mistakes it did with Sling TV. Sling was one of the earliest entrants to the video-streaming market, but Dish neglected the product, and a too-little-too-late advertising push hasn’t shielded it from an onslaught of new competition. These reasons are why I’m skeptical Dish can be the antitrust cure that the Justice Department has deemed it to be. T-Mobile seems to be betting Dish isn’t a serious threat either. If so, “they’re betting wrong,” Ergen assured my Bloomberg News colleague and me in an interview last week. “But without question, if you only do one thing right, you've got to have the best network,” he said. Otherwise, “you’re wasting your money from a branding perspective.” Dish needs to get both right if it stands a chance of someday catching T-Mobile. To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

2019-07-30,This deal to merge wireless carriers is a big step closer to changing the industry. But it&apos;s unlikely to change T-Mobile&apos;s approach to the industry.,1 Big Reason T-Mobile/Sprint Will Be Good for Consumers
2019-07-30,"After 15 months of lobbying and negotiations, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) have finally secured both FCC and DoJ approval for their proposed merger. In response to the DoJ putting their stamp of approval on the merger, Sprint stock rallied from $7 to $8, as investors priced in a higher likelihood of the deal actually going through.But, the T-Mobile/Sprint merger -- which promises to forever alter the wireless industry by reducing the number of relevant and important players in the space from four to three -- isn't out of the woods just yet.Normally, all you need for a big M&A deal to close is FCC and DoJ approval. T-Mobile and Sprint have that. What's the hold up? A lawsuit from over a dozen state attorneys general who -- despite FCC and DoJ approval and concessions from Sprint regarding their prepaid business -- remain concerned that consolidating the wireless industry to three players presents a huge risk to consumers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Fortunately for T-Mobile and Sprint shareholders, this last legal hurdle for the merger is the most passable of any of the hurdles this merger has faced so far. As such, it seems very likely that this lawsuit will be settled soon, and that T-Mobile and Sprint will finally and officially merge.In that event, Sprint stock still has more upside left. If the deal were to go through today, Sprint stock would be taken out around $8.40. Sprint stock currently trades hands below $8. Thus, there's reason to stay long Sprint stock. T-Mobile/Sprint Merger Will Pass This Last HurdleIt is increasingly likely that the T-Mobile/Sprint merger will pass its final legal hurdle, and that the two companies will close their merger within the next few months, if not weeks.There are two big ideas here. First, a lawsuit from a dozen or so attorney generals (AGs) amounts to a very passable hurdle relative to gaining DoJ and FCC approval. Second, the validity of the anti-competitive arguments from these AGs seems to have been eroded by Sprint's prepaid business concessions.On the first point, historically speaking, there have really only been two blockers when it comes to proposed M&A. Either the proposed deal doesn't win DoJ approval, or it doesn't win FCC approval. I cannot recall a major merger in recent memory that was blocked by a lawsuit from AGs after winning both FCC and DoJ approval. Right now, the T-Mobile/Sprint merger has both. Thus, history says that this last legal hurdle is something that will most likely be resolved in a short time.On the second point, T-Mobile and Sprint won DoJ and FCC approval by making certain concessions so as to ensure the existence of a viable fourth player in the wireless industry. Sprint has to divest its prepaid business (Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Sprint prepaid) to Dish (NASDAQ:DISH), and T-Mobile has to provide Dish with robust access to the T-Mobile network for the next seven years. Thus, this deal is supposed to birth a new, low-price competitor in the wireless industry, which erodes the validity of the anti-competitive arguments against the merger.It seems very likely that within the next few weeks or months T-Mobile and Sprint will officially close their proposed merger. Sprint Stock Has Upside to Above $8In the event T-Mobile and Sprint do close their proposed merger within the next few weeks or months, then Sprint stock has tangible upside to levels well above $8.The merger is a stock deal, wherein Sprint stock shareholders receive some fraction of T-Mobile shares for each share of Sprint they own. That fraction is 0.10256. Thus, when this deal closes, one share of Sprint will be equal to 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile.T-Mobile stock currently trades around $82. If the deal were to close today, Sprint stock would be taken out at roughly $8.40. But, T-Mobile can and should head higher the closer the company gets to closing the deal, since the closing of such a deal will improve the company's long-term revenue and profit growth prospects.The 52-week high price on T-Mobile stock and the consensus sell-side price target are both around $85. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that when this deal does close, T-Mobile stock will rise towards $85. If so, Sprint stock will get taken out around $8.70.Either way, both $8.40 and $8.70 are substantially above Sprint stock price today, which is below $8. As such, there's reason to remain bullish on Sprint stock for the foreseeable future. Bottom Line on S StockThe merger will close soon. The last remaining legal hurdle -- a lawsuit from over a dozen state AGs -- is just noise. As all noise does, it will pass. When it does, T-Mobile and Sprint will close their merger. And, when that happens, Sprint stock will rally to levels substantially above $8.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long S.

2019-07-31,"After 15 months of lobbying and negotiations, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) are finally on the verge of closing their proposed merger. Back in May, the FCC approved the merger after the two companies agreed to certain concessions, mostly revolving around Sprint divesting its prepaid phone business. Those same concessions won over DoJ approval in late July.Source: Shutterstock Although one legal hurdle remains (a lawsuit from over a dozen attorneys general who remain concerned about wireless industry consolidation), it seems very likely that T-Mobile and Sprint will finally merge under the T-Mobile umbrella. The Sprint name will be retired.This merger has huge implications for wireless industry stocks. It immediately thrusts T-Mobile into the &quot;Big 3&quot; conversation in the wireless industry. Both Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have around 100 million customers. T-Mobile will now have 90 million customers, rivaling Verizon and AT&T in size for the first time ever.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt also essentially turns the wireless industry into a three-horse race. While Sprint is selling its prepaid phone business to Dish (NASDAQ:DISH), that business isn't terribly large. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile will control 95% of American phone plans.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August Even further, it is happening ahead of what promises to be the biggest catalyst this industry has seen in several years -- the mainstream and widespread roll-out of 5G coverage.Big change is coming to the wireless industry over the next few years. That change will be positive for some stocks and negative for other stocks. As such, investors should pay especially close attention to these five 5G stocks, especially on the heels of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger winning DoJ approval. 5G Stocks to Watch: Sprint (S)First on this list of 5G stocks to watch after the T-Mobile/Sprint merger won approval is -- unsurprisingly -- Sprint.The reason you watch Sprint stock is because the T-Mobile/Sprint merger saga isn't over. The final chapter has yet to be written. There is still one not-so-insignificant legal hurdle here that the proposed merger has to pass: A lawsuit from over a dozen state AGs that claim the prepaid phone business concessions from Sprint are insufficient to address anti-competitive concerns.It is unlikely that this lawsuit stops the merger from going through. Historically speaking, the two big blockers in the U.S. to M&A are failure to win either DoJ or FCC approval. I cannot think of a case in recent memory where a proposed merger won FCC and DoJ approval, but failed to get closed due to a state AGs lawsuit. That's exactly where the T-Mobile/Sprint merger finds itself today. As such, it is increasingly likely that the merger does close over the coming weeks.In the event that it does, Sprint stock will run higher. The deal between T-Mobile and Sprint is structured in a way that, upon closing, each share of Sprint equals 0.10256 each share of T-Mobile. Under those terms, if the deal closed today, Sprint stock would be taken out at roughly $8.40.Sprint stock trades under $8 today. Thus, this is a 5G stock worth watching because -- pending legal developments over the next few weeks -- it could run substantially higher. T-Mobile (TMUS)Second on this list of 5G stocks to watch after the T-Mobile/Sprint merger won approval is -- also unsurprisingly -- T-Mobile.The reason you want to keep a close eye on TMUS stock is two-fold. First, as mentioned earlier, the T-Mobile/Sprint merger isn't a done deal, and legal developments over the next few weeks will influence TMUS stock price either higher or lower, depending on the outcome of those legal proceedings.Second, assuming the legal proceedings develop as expected and the deal closes within the next month, T-Mobile's long-term growth prospects are dramatically altered. This company goes from David to Goliath overnight in the wireless industry.Price competition on the low-end -- which has been a huge problem for T-Mobile over the past few years -- will ease dramatically because the industry will go from Big 4 to Big 3. The company will have a much larger base heading into the mainstream development and roll-out of 5G coverage and 5G phones, giving it broader exposure to that secular growth tailwind.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Broadly, this deal should significantly boost T-Mobile's long term revenue and profit growth prospects. Thus, if the deal closes in the foreseeable future, TMUS stock could be in the early stages of a healthy long term uptrend in the share price. Verizon (VZ)Source: Shutterstock Another 5G stock for which the T-Mobile/Sprint merger has huge implications is wireless industry leader Verizon.Ostensibly, Verizon has a lot to lose in the event T-Mobile becomes a viable third horse in the wireless industry race. The top-end of this industry has long been dominated by two companies. Adding a third player into the mix should create more price competition and Verizon's operating results could suffer as a result.But, I think this bear thesis is overstated. In reality, what has really hurt Verizon over the past several years is the fact that coverage standards have been commoditized across the whole industry, so Verizon's high quality advantage is less meaningful than it has been in the past. 5G changes this. Coverage across the whole wireless industry will be de-commoditized, as some higher-quality players (like Verizon) will have higher quality 5G offerings from the onset. This de-commoditization will ease pricing headwinds, and allow Verizon to simultaneously grow revenues and margins during the 5G boom.From this perspective, I don't think VZ stock stands to lose much if the T-Mobile/Sprint merger goes through. Instead, I think this company is positioned to win big during the 5G boom, regardless of how the T-Mobile/Sprint merger plays out.The reason you watch VZ stock, though, is that the market might sell the stock in the event the merger does close. Given the company's still-favorable long term fundamentals, that dip should be perceived as a buying opportunity ahead of the 5G boom. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Much like Verizon, the T-Mobile/Sprint merger has huge implications for wireless giant AT&T.AT&T finds itself in a similar situation to Verizon. On one hand, the T-Mobile/Sprint merger closing creates more competition at the top-end of the wireless industry by turning a market with two leaders, into a market with three leaders. On the other hand, the T-Mobile/Sprint merger closing removes a competitor at the bottom-end of the wireless industry, and thereby improves the overall competitive landscape.You can probably call it a draw in terms of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger impact on AT&T stock.But, also like Verizon, AT&T should benefit tremendously over the next several years from wireless industry standards being de-commoditized due to the roll-out of 5G coverage. This will enable higher-quality players like AT&T to re-separate themselves on quality and command more pricing power. That will create a multi-quarter tailwind for AT&T's revenues, margins, and profits.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Overall, investors should keep an eye on AT&T stock because much like VZ stock, it could be heading into a buyable dip if the T-Mobile/Sprint merger actually closes. Qualcomm (QCOM)Last, but certainly not least, on this list of 5G stocks to watch after the T-Mobile/Sprint merger won approval is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).Qualcomm is the chip giant behind the 5G movement, owning a wide portfolio of 5G-related IP that will enable it to benefit in a big way as all that 5G-related IP is deployed across the world over the next several years. Its legal issues have been momentarily sidelined, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has come back on as a Qualcomm customer in a move that solidifies Qualcomm as a 5G leader. The DoJ has essentially asked that a federal appeals court pause enforcement of an antitrust ruling which would have had a negative impact on Qualcomm's licensing business during the 5G boom.Consequently, this company appears ready to benefit in a big way over the next few years from the widespread and mainstream roll-out of 5G technology.The T-Mobile/Sprint merger doesn't have a big impact on that bull thesis for QCOM stock. If anything, it actually improves it. T-Mobile likely now has the resources to compete on more equivalent footing with Verizon and AT&T, which should promote better 5G coverage offerings across the board. The better those offerings, the more 5G related products will be sold. The more 5G related products are sold, the more money Qualcomm makes.As such, QCOM stock looks like a solid stock to buy for the forthcoming 5G boom, especially with the T-Mobile/Sprint merger winning approval.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long S, T, and QCOM.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Verizon Communications Inc. is the wireless industry’s sleeping giant. Suddenly, its smaller rivals – AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Sprint Corp. and Dish Network Corp. – are giving it every reason to wake up. Shares of Verizon have been a snooze this year, as AT&T steps up the competition and the drama around T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint continues to dominate the news. On Thursday, Verizon said it added 451,000 wireless subscribers during the second quarter, which was much better than analysts were expecting and helped lift its stock price. However, AT&T, in its own earnings report last week, crowned itself America’s “fastest, best and most reliable network,” based on scoring done by GWS OneScore, Ookla and PC Mag. Ouch, Verizon. Of course, at this point, there’s not actually much of a difference among the national carriers’ networks when it comes to 4G LTE service – it’s more about bragging rights for TV ads. Plus, 5G connections are already being rolled out. Verizon has made 5G available to customers in parts of nine cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Indianapolis and Providence, Rhode Island. Still, its launch has been clouded by concern that the company is betting on the wrong kind of wireless spectrum for 5G. And so for every pro there seems to be a con.Verizon controls the biggest share of the U.S. wireless market, and it certainly has the deep pockets needed to protect that. That hasn’t stopped it from getting lost in the shuffle this year. The U.S. Justice Department last week made the controversial decision to approve T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint, which has been the talk of telecom town. The deal is conditional on the companies divesting certain assets to Dish Network, the satellite-TV provider, so that it can become a new competitor in the wireless market.There are those who believe the T-Mobile-Sprint merger and the arrival of Dish will increase industry competition, which would be interpreted as bad news for Verizon. I’m of the camp that Dish probably won’t be much of a threat, at least not for a long time, and that the temptation for T-Mobile to take advantage of its newfound pricing power will be too great to ignore. In that case, Verizon would seem to benefit, if not for this one major consequence: Dish, and its valuable unused mid-band spectrum licenses, are now technically off the market. Those assets would have been attractive for Verizon to buy.   As Verizon gears up for 5G, it’s instead relying almost exclusively on finicky millimeter-wave spectrum. While these frequencies can transport lots of data at the lightning-fast speeds that people imagine when they hear “5G,” they can travel only short distances, making them impractical for less densely populated areas. That means Verizon has to focus on urban zones. “The experience in urban areas is going to be fantastic,” CEO Hans Vestberg said at an investor conference in May.  The company wants to ensure that it’s offering something “truly transformational” for customers, Adam Koeppe, Verizon’s senior vice president for technology strategy, said at another conference that month. He means for certain customers if they’re standing in the right location. Dish’s spectrum could have helped Verizon blanket broader geographic areas with 5G service. In contrast to Verizon’s approach, the other carriers are using millimeter waves in combination with low- and mid-band spectrum. Those different frequencies together provide a better mix of capacity and coverage. Like Dish, Sprint also has a stack of these desirable lower-spectrum bands, which T-Mobile gets to be the beneficiary of (unless the states suing to block the merger win their case). To be fair to Verizon, all its rivals are more interested in bringing 5G to bigger cities first because it’s less costly to do so and offers better returns. It’s too early to start grading these nascent 5G networks. But Verizon needs to wake up and smell the competition.

2019-08-04,"As the world’s population continues to digitize, the demand for faster connectivity speeds is only growing. To meet this demand, the wireless industry has been rapidly developing 5G technologies. Based on a Research and Markets report, the global 5G market is expected to reach $277 Billion by 2025. 5G networks will cover 40% of the world by 2024 according to Ericsson, with these networks expected to handle 25% of all mobile data traffic. The introduction of 5G coverage and devices has created a new segment in the market, with some stocks representing unique investment opportunities. This new standard is expected to revolutionize online communications, and analysts are saying now’s the time to get on board. Here are the analysts’ top 3 5G stocks. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS)T-Mobile is becoming a strong player in the 5G sector of the market.After drawn out lobbying and negotiations that lasted 15 months, TMUS and Sprint Corporation (S) are close to finalizing their merger after the Department of Justice gave its approval on July 29. Once the merger is finalized, TMUS will have 90 million customers and be able to compete with AT&T (T) and Verizon’s (VZ) size for the first time in its history. Both of its competitors have about 100 million customers each.Not to mention the company reported a second quarter earnings beat on July 25. EPS increased from $0.92 in the prior-year quarter to $1.29, surpassing the Street’s $0.99 estimate. Total revenue also gained 4% year-over-year reaching a record high of $11 billion. While T-Mobile has had trouble in the past with competitive pricing, the Sprint deal puts it in a position to sustain healthy long-term growth. “Price competition on the low-end — which has been a huge problem for T-Mobile over the past few years — will ease dramatically because the industry will go from Big 4 to Big 3. The company will have a much larger base heading into the mainstream development and roll-out of 5G coverage and 5G phones, giving it broader exposure to that secular growth tailwind. Broadly, this deal should significantly boost T-Mobile’s long term revenue and profit growth prospects,” financial blogger, Luke Lango, writes.      Top analyst, Jennifer Fritzsche, reiterated her Buy rating and raised her price target from $82 to $98 on July 29. She believes share prices could surge by 26% over the next twelve months. “While we are still waiting on the resolution of State lawsuit, we believe this deal is a significant positive for T-Mobile,” the Wells Fargo analyst said. She has a 69% success rate and gets an average return of 8% per rating. Wall Street takes a bullish stance on TMUS as well. It has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus, with 6 Buy ratings vs 1 Hold received over the last three months. The stock has an average price target of $92, suggesting 18% upside potential.  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)While its litigation with Apple Inc. (AAPL) has cast a shadow over the chip maker, some analysts are telling investors not to count Qualcomm out just yet. Many point to QCOM as one of the original forces behind the 5G movement. The company has a wide variety of 5G internet protocols and modem chips, with it only standing to benefit as 5G is more widely deployed. QCOM also wouldn't be negatively impacted by the T-Mobile/Sprint merger. T-Mobile now has a greater competitive advantage and the resources to offer improved 5G coverage. The better the offerings, the more 5G products that will be sold to consumers, which is good news for Qualcomm.    Despite reporting an earnings miss on July 31 in which revenue dropped 13% year-over-year to almost $5 billion, the company expects a large boost in 2020 and 2021 after the widespread release of 5G smart phones. Raymond James analyst, Chris Caso, said, “While we can't be as confident in the timing, the improvement is inevitable. The near-term issues don’t change the 5G story.” On August 1, he reiterated his Buy rating and price target of $115, suggesting a whopping 62% upside.  Another analyst, Tal Liani, agrees that demand weakness is a temporary issue ahead of the 5G smart phone release. On August 1, he reiterated his Buy rating and lowered the price target from $105 to $100. Despite the price target drop, he believes share prices could jump 41% over the next twelve months. “We believe Qualcomm's bull case is unchanged, with global 5G roll outs expected to increase both royalty income and demand for semiconductors beginning in 2020. Press reports suggest that all of Apple's 2020 iPhones will contain Qualcomm's 5G chipset, which could drive a 5G cycle across the entire industry,&quot; the Merrill Lynch analyst said. QCOM has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $79 average price target, indicating 11% upside potential.  Crown Castle International Corporation (CCI)In order to deploy 5G coverage, an investment will have to be made in upgrading current infrastructure. The new communication standard will require smaller cell towers and antennas located within several hundred yards of mobile devices. That’s where CCI comes in. Crown Castle is one of the leading providers of shared communications infrastructure. The company operates 65,000 small cell nodes, with it planning to expand to 85,000 by 2020. It is poised to sustain its long-term growth as carrier networks will more often than not rent tower spaces as opposed to building their own. On July 17, the company not only reported that its second quarter results had exceeded the mid-point on each of its targets, but also raised its full-year profit guidance. Net income is now expected to be $926 million, up from the previous $821 million estimate. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFD) was raised to $5.94 per diluted share, up from $5.84. On August 1, CCI got a vote of confidence from J.P. Morgan. Top analyst, Philip Cusick, believes the telecom stock is well positioned to surge as connectivity continues to grow. He upgraded CCI to a Buy and raised his price target from $125 to $150, suggesting 11% upside. Cusick has a 70% success rate and gets an average return of 12% per rating.Five-star rated financial blogger, Laura Hoy, also believes that CCI is in it for the long haul. “Demand for CCI’s infrastructure will only increase as 5G gains momentum and unlike companies like VZ and TMUS, Crown Castle doesn’t have to battle it out to hold on to subscribers. CCI stock wins as long as mobile usage and the demand for connectivity is growing — and that trend looks likely to continue for the foreseeable future,” she writes.     The telecom stock has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $150 average price target, indicating 11% upside potential.",3 5G Stocks Analysts Say to Add to Your Portfolio

2019-08-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son can’t wait to wash his hands of Sprint Corp.SoftBank Group Corp. will stop consolidating the U.S. carrier in its results starting next earnings report, anticipating a successful merger with T-Mobile USA Inc. despite questions over the deal’s eventual closing. That accounting change will slash SoftBank’s debt load and help it shed its image as a staid telecoms company, the Japanese billionaire said Wednesday.Son is eager to put the Sprint chapter behind him. The wireless carrier’s roughly $47 billion debt pile has weighed on its Japanese owner’s valuation ever since the latter agreed to pay $21.6 billion for a majority stake in 2012. Son in turn has repeatedly railed at investors for misjudging his company’s true value. Now, the entrepreneur can better plug SoftBank as an technology investment powerhouse, allowing him to focus his energies on the $100 billion Vision Fund and its $108 billion successor.“For years, investors have focused on the immediate struggles at Sprint, overlooking the longer-term potential of Son’s technology investments,” said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group.The accounting change will reduce the group’s overall interest-bearing debt load by about 29%. But because Sprint’s borrowings are non-recourse to the parent, meaning the Japanese company will not owe anything to its U.S. unit’s creditors, the removal of the debt from the balance sheet is largely symbolic and may not affect SoftBank’s credit rating.Son has previously pointed out that the Sprint excision will have a significant impact on SoftBank’s annual interest expenses — as much as halving them — which amounts to an even greater reduction than in the overall debt because Sprint pays higher interest on its borrowings.“There is still a lingering image of SoftBank as a debt-laden telecommunications company,” Son said at the briefing. “That’s quite different from the truth.”On Wednesday, SoftBank reported first-quarter profit that beat the highest analyst estimate thanks to valuation gains from Vision Fund investments such as Slack Technologies Inc., which went public in June, hotel chain OYO Rooms and food-delivery app DoorDash Inc. The gains were offset by a 195.3 billion yen decline in the fair value of holdings including Uber Technologies Inc. Operating income in the three months ended June slipped 3.7% to 688.8 billion yen ($6.5 billion), but trumped the 345.3 billion yen average analyst estimate. SoftBank also said the Vision Fund held 81 investments worth about $66.3 billion.The Sprint accounting change signals Son’s confidence in sealing the deal. While the Justice Department approved the acquisition last month, the transaction has been held up by an antitrust lawsuit by more than a dozen states including California and New York. Texas was the latest to join the fight last week. The deal already has the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has expressed support.“There hasn’t been a case in history where you had those three approvals and the deal didn’t get done,’’ Son said.Sprint has been profitable for only one of the past five years. It accounted for 38% of SoftBank’s revenue in the three months ended June, slightly less than the company’s domestic telecom operations.Son originally considered buying T-Mobile in 2014 before abandoning the effort when officials at the FCC and Justice Department signaled they were against a theoretical merger with Sprint. Another attempt at a merger fizzled out in late 2017 amid disagreement over control. SoftBank finally agreed to sell Sprint to T-Mobile in 2018, getting about a 27.4% stake in the resulting entity in return.The billionaire acknowledged that his Sprint purchase has been largely seen as a failure, but said that SoftBank generated a 21% rate of return on the deal. All but 400 billion of the 2.1 trillion yen acquisition came from borrowing, he said. That smaller proportion of shareholder value has tripled to 1.3 trillion yen, “not bad at all as an investment.”“From a sentiment perspective, Sprint got in the way of a lot of investors, who thought of it as a bad deal,” said Chris Lane, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “This at least cleans up a mess. It’s a good save and allows them to move on.”Last month, Son announced that he’s setting up a second Vision Fund. SoftBank is committing $38 billion in capital itself and expects to collect money from Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Foxconn Technology Group and the sovereign wealth fund of Kazakhstan. He also won broad support from Japanese financial institutions, with seven of them identified as signing memorandums of understanding to participate.“The merger of Sprint with T-Mobile and Vision Fund 2, these are great milestones for SoftBank,” Son said. “The only way from here is forward.”To contact the reporter on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank’s Profit Beat Shows Its Vision Fund Is Delivering

2019-08-07,"Interest rates act as a driver (or sometimes a detriment) to the performance of a stock. On July 31, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. However, those looking for cheap stocks to buy faced only disappointment, at least for now. Interestingly, the rate cut didn't lead to stock buying, but a stock selloff in Wednesday trading.Despite that short-term reaction, the first rate cut since the financial crisis should lower interest costs across the board. Also, depending on a company's offering, lower rates can change the value proposition on many products. Further, this will likely improve corporate balance sheets, many which hold dangerous levels of debt.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip As a result of debt, many equities have become cheap stocks to buy. With lower interest costs, some could gain the catalyst necessary to send stock prices higher. These five stocks to buy could see such gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock AT&T (NYSE:T) has become one of the cheap stocks to buy that is safe and dangerous at the same time. The company owns one of three nationwide 5G networks. Several of the latest technological advances such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT) will not advance as quickly as 5G. This will put AT&T along with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)However, unlike its peers, T also invested heavily in a content strategy through ownership of DirecTV and WarnerMedia. The content strategy helped to leave AT&T with the largest long-term debt load among its peers. These obligations stood at almost $164 billion as of the end of the first quarter. That leaves debt levels nearly as high as the company book value of just over $185.1 billion.However, lower rates can help lower interest costs, thus increasing their profit. It also makes capital more accessible as it continues to spend on 5G buildouts.Further, the company maintains a 34-year streak of dividend increases. Despite a yield of around 6%, ending the streak would devastate T stock despite a modest 9.3 forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. The lower borrowing costs ease the burden of this dividend. A lower debt burden could lead to more buying of AT&T as investors begin again to believe in the company. Caterpillar (CAT)Source: Shutterstock Real estate gets a lot of attention after a rate cut, but often forgotten are stocks like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), whose equipment plays a crucial role in building construction. Nonetheless, Caterpillar has not only suffered from slowing real estate sales, but the uncertainty brought about by the U.S.-China trade war. Moreover, CAT stock actually dropped after the Fed announced its interest rate cut.Before earnings, I warned investors that CAT stock only made sense for dividend-oriented investors. Shareholders have long benefited from a rising dividend, and nothing on the horizon looks like a threat to this payout.However, the lower price makes it an even better buy for income-focused investors. Thanks to the lower share price, CAT stock now yields 3.25%.Also, I mentioned that CAT had recovered from the $120 per share level three times. This current pullback has taken it to about $124 per share as of the time of this writing. That could indicate a limited downside.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Further, I list CAT as one of the cheap stocks to buy by virtue of the forward PE ratio which has fallen below 10. Even with lowered guidance, analysts expect 5.3% profit growth. Even if the stock took time to recover, investors would collect a generous dividend while they wait. If the rate cut helps it bounce off the $120 per share price flow, it could make CAT stock an income and growth play again. Chesapeake Energy (CHK)Source: Shutterstock Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) stock is among the cheap stocks to buy for a very good reason. The company maintains a market cap of around $2.7 billion even as it faces debt levels that stood at about $9.17 billion at the end of the first quarter. This debt rose when it purchased Wildhorse Resource Development so the natural gas company could increase its exposure to oil.Such debt levels make it a risky play. However, the company had returned to profitability before acquiring Wildhorse. The ability to refinance some of this debt at lower rates should ease the burden.Moreover, rising demand for oil should mean that Chesapeake can sell its oil and natural gas at higher prices, thus increasing profits. Furthermore, Chesapeake has steadily sold off assets to pay some of the debt off. Higher energy prices also make those properties easier to sell.Lower debt costs also provide lower borrowing costs for an industry CHK stock needs to drive its future, the natural gas export industry. Lower rates should facilitate the construction of planned natural gas facilities, thus further enabling Chesapeake to sell its product in Europe and Asia where natural gas sells for higher prices.Despite improving prospects, investors should still treat CHK stock as a speculative play. However, the odds of paying off debt and earnings profits dramatically increase in an environment of lower rates. Lennar Corporation (LEN)Source: Shutterstock Lennar (NYSE:LEN) brought in more revenue than its peers last year. However, its industry has begun to suffer as home sales have become flat. Interest rates have long served as an essential component of the real estate industry. These flat real estate prices likely helped influence the rate cut.Still, lower interest rates put home affordability within reach, and this should help sales and LEN stock. Due to the slower market in 2019, analysts forecast a 2% drop in profits for this year. However, they expect that growth will reach 8.8% this year. They also predict earnings increases averaging 9.45% per year over the next five years.With a forward PE ratio of around 8.2, we can easily classify LEN as one of the cheap stocks to buy in this industry. Further, with profit growth poised to reach almost 10% per year, such a valuation might give investors a reason to buy.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now LEN stock currently trades at around $49 per share. The home-buying spree in both the current and the last decade took Lennar above $60 per share before it fell back. It may take more than one interest rate cut for LEN to finally achieve a new all-time high. However, with profit growth set to resume, LEN stock looks set to return to historic highs. Newmont Goldcorp Corporation (NEM)Source: Shutterstock Early this year, Newmont Mining merged with Goldcorp to form Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM). The company suffered for years as falling gold prices sent NEM stock tumbling early in the decade. Today, it trades at a little bit more than half of its 2011 peak.However, gold prices have sustained themselves above the $1,400 per oz. in recent weeks as falling market interest rates and a rate cut have propelled investors back into gold. At just above $1,440 per oz., gold trades as its highest level since 2013.Currently, NEM stock trades at about 22.6 times forward earnings. That may not make it one of the more ideal cheap stocks to buy. An 8.2% profit decline expected for the year also does not help. However, analysts expect the benefits of higher gold prices to show up in profit forecasts soon. For 2020, Wall Street predicts that earnings will increase by 44.7%.The effects have yet to reach NEM stock. NEM has traded in a range since 2016. At $37 per share, it sells well above the $29-plus per share lows seen in this range. The critical points come at its 52-week high of $40.33 per share and its 2016 high of $46.27 per share. If it can break through both highs, Newmont Goldcorp could begin to enjoy the multi-year highs now bolstering the price of gold.As of this writing, Will Healy is long CHK stock.

2019-08-09,"At first glance, investors may not understand why AT&T (NYSE:T) stock trades at levels it reached in 1997. The forward price-earnings of T stock  stands at only 9.4 and it has a high dividend yield of about 6%.Source: Shutterstock However, traders may remain on the sidelines for one big reason: AT&T. Specifically, tough price competition in wireless and cord-cutting have hurt T stock. Other negative catalysts for AT&T stock have included high spending on video content and the construction of a  5G network, which is quite expensive.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What Still, 5G smartphones will hit the market soon. Once consumers begin to adopt this technology, T stock price may finally embark on a sustained rally for the first time in years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Long-Term Outlook of T stock Is UpbeatI have been bullish on AT&T stock for a long time. As I stated in an earlier article, AT&T, along with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), will form a &quot;wireless big three&quot; as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and The Internet of Things (IoT) cannot reach their full potential without 5G. Given the enormous cost of building a nationwide 5G network, other potential competitors will likely avoid entering the space. As a result, AT&T, Verizon  and T-Mobile will wield considerable pricing power.However, that's a good reason to buy T stock and hold it for the long-term. The short-term outlook of AT&T stock is a different story. AT&T Continues to Hamper AT&T StockI still believe AT&T has fought too hard to resist the cord-cutting trend. Consumers grew weary of $100-plus per month cable TV bills and the proliferation of unattractive channels. Let's be honest; consumers do not want 24-hour channels devoted to obscure topics like farm news or underwater basket weaving. That pricey model makes no sense in a world of on-demand streaming.AT&T eventually came to this conclusion and took on huge debts to acquire content providers such as HBO, Turner Cable, and Warner Bros. studios at a considerable cost. The company put these companies together to form WarnerMedia, a streaming service that could recruit a substantial number of subscribers.However, despite AT&T's investment, its video revenues will not match the levels they reached during the heyday of pay-TV. Moreover, content spending and the 5G buildout have left AT&T with a debt burden that stood at $157.79 billion as of the end of the second quarter. Since AT&T's equity stood at $194 billion at the end of Q2, one can see why many owners of T stock have become uncomfortable with its balance sheet. The Dividend Makes T Stock AttractiveNonetheless, investors can benefit from  the annual dividend of $2.04 per share of T stock, which comes to a yield of 6%. AT&T has increased its payout for 34 straight years. Consequently, ending the streak would show a lack of confidence and  hurt T stock for years to come. So even if investors don't expect AT&T stock price to rise much in the short-term, they can still earn substantial cash while they wait for the company to turn itself around.Moreover, I think the stagnation of T stock, which has lasted for nearly a decade,  may end soon.  Its long-term debt fell by more than $6 billion in Q2. Furthermore, 5G will almost certainly bring better pricing power than 4G.Additionally, price competition from T-Mobile, which has forced AT&T and Verizon to cut prices in recent years, should subside. Given the cost of building a 5G network and acquiring Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile will likely not be able to start another price war. Concluding Thoughts on T StockAT&T stock  price appears poised to move higher as the 5G rollout begins. T stock has remained rangebound for years as the company's revenues fell and its costs increased. The cost of the dividend has put the company in a difficult position.However, the 5G network that burdened the company for years may soon give AT&T a level of pricing power not seen since its days as a monopoly. Moreover, even if T stock stagnates in the near-term, investors can collect a generous, increasing dividend.The company's high debt levels and the questionable nature of its content strategy indicate that some of its decisions have been suspect. However, with 5G coming soon,  the current AT&T  stock price may look like a huge bargain in retrospect.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-15,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in May 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]As telcos launch the first of the 5G networks, 5G stocks will become a focus. The technology will change wireless. How much speed it will add has become a point of controversy. Estimates from a few years ago predicted that 5G would be 1,000 times as fast as 4G.More recent estimates peg the improvement at 10 to 20 times 4G LTE. Whatever happens after launch, consumers should see a quantum leap in speed and reliability.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSuch speeds will lead to capabilities not possible today. For this reason, it becomes difficult to know whether innovations will come from one of the large companies or from the mind of an unknown inventor working in his garage.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall Whatever happens, these 5G stocks to buy will likely be among the large companies that lead the way in the new networks, profiting from 5G while trading at reasonable valuations: Apple (AAPL)Although the latest version of the iPhone did not offer 5G capabilities, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will become one of the more prominent 5G stocks in future years. As one of the primary innovators in the wireless market, Apple will likely continue to enjoy a substantial presence in this industry.Source: Shutterstock Warren Buffett has made Apple the largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) portfolio for a reason. AAPL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 14.Also, the stock shows a solid record on dividends. The current yield of 1.50% may not inspire investors. Still, the company has increased its dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 2012. If one keeps AAPL stock as a long-term holding, this dividend will probably become more important.Apple has not yet released a 5G iPhone. However, as soon as it enters the market, the iPhone will become a critical device for 5G service, and AAPL will become one of the more important 5G stocks. Its investors should benefit. AT&T (T)AT&T (NYSE:T) will become only one of three companies, now that it appears as if  T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) will get merger clearance, to offer 5G wireless service. This factor in itself makes AT&T one of the more important 5G stocks. Because of the tens of billions of dollars needed to build such a network, the company will probably not have to deal with additional competitors.Source: Shutterstock The company has struggled recently. Cord-cutting in the pay-TV business, a highly competitive wireless industry, and the costly 5G upgrade have weighed on the company.However, this offers a tremendous advantage to those who want to invest now. The recent struggles of the stock have taken its forward P/E to about 8.7. This comes to less than half of the five-year average P/E of about 18.Still, the biggest reason to invest lies in the dividend. Its annual dividend comes to a yield of ~6%, triple the S&P 500 average of 1.9%.Even better, the psychology that drives T stock insures this dividend will increase. The company has increased its dividend in each of the previous 34 years. For this reason, maintaining the price of T stock hinges heavily on these dividend increases. The increased revenues that will likely come from 5G will also ensure that the company can afford the dividend increases.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul With 5G beginning to become a revenue source, the company's fortunes should improve. Moreover, a single-digit forward P/E and a generous dividend make AT&T one of the more attractive 5G stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Many will remember Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) as the company whose routers helped to provide internet service in the 1990s. Today, CSCO stock behaves more like an old-line industrial than a high-flying tech stock.Source: Shutterstock However, the company still offers critical internet infrastructure. Its products along with the stock's value and rising dividend should make CSCO one of the more compelling 5G stocks.Cisco employs what it calls a &quot;Cloud-to-Client&quot; approach to 5G. The company wants to transform networks end-to-end, making Cisco equipment a critical component in delivering 5G faster. This technology is designed to encompass every aspect of 5G into a seamless network, providing security and enhancing video optimization.In addition to 5G customers, Cisco also offers a compelling value proposition to new investors. Its stock trades at about 16.5 times forward earnings. Analysts expect about 5% revenue growth this year.Also, unlike the Cisco of the 1990s, this company also embraces dividends. Cisco paid its first dividend in 2011, and it has increased these payouts every year since. Today, CSCO stock pays an annual dividend which yields about 2.7%. Hence, Cisco stock offers a reasonable P/E and an above-average dividend yield that will probably rise on a yearly basis. With 5G revenues funding its profits, CSCO stock should hold investors in good stead for years to come. Intel (INTC)As the PC business, which had sustained Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for decades, began its decline, the changing marketplace forced INTC to seek new lines of business.Source: Shutterstock As a result, Intel has embraced 5G by involving itself in the Internet of Things (IoT) and data centers. These two components should make Intel prominent among 5G stocks.Client computing still makes up Intel's largest revenue source. However, data center revenue grew 21% in 2018, compared with only 9% for client computing. The company warned data center growth might slow. Still, its high growth places data center revenue on track to become Intel's largest revenue source within a few years.By most accounts, INTC stock has become a bargain. If the consensus earnings forecast holds, Intel trades at a forward P/E of 9.8, well below the five-year average P/E of 15.75.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now Also, the company has paid dividends since 2000. It has increased them in most of the years since, and every year since 2014. Today, this 5G stock maintains a $1.26 per share annual dividend that yields around 2.75%. With a low valuation and a new company identity defined around 5G, I see Intel becoming a popular choice among 5G stocks to buy. Nokia (NOK)Many remember Nokia (NYSE:NOK) as a one-time leader in cell phones before the smartphone pushed its phones aside. As a result, the company redefined itself over the last few years.Source: Shutterstock Although it finally developed its own smartphone, NOK has taken its place among 5G stocks mostly as an equipment provider, furnishing wireless carriers with the hardware necessary to provide 5G services to their customers.Nokia signed a $3.5 billion multi-year agreement with T-Mobile. Under the terms of this deal, Nokia will provide T-Mobile with end-to-end 5G technology, which includes software and services, along with Nokia's hardware. So far, this stands as Nokia's largest 5G deal. I think this will lead to more 5G deals in other countries, bolstering NOK stock.Best of all, I do not think Wall Street yet appreciates the fact that Nokia has redefined itself. Although NOK lost a small amount of money in 2018, the stock looks poised to return to a path of earnings growth in the future. NOK currently trades at about 13 times its estimated 2019 earnings.The company will also pay stockholders well to wait for some appreciation. The company's 24 cents per share annual dividend comes to a yield of about 4%. While this dividend has fluctuated over the years, sustained profit growth makes it more likely the dividend will rise than fall. NOK stock also trades more than 80% below its 2007 high. If it gains more prestige among 5G stocks, I think it could return to its old highs within a few years, or perhaps beyond.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-20,"Recent news about the merger between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) reminded me why I don't like gambling on such events. As you know, the S stock price received a massive boost in the middle of the spring season. That was when Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai expressed his support for the merger.Source: Shutterstock Moreover, the proposed union between the third and fourth largest U.S. telecoms cleared additional hurdles. Late last month, the U.S. Department of Justice declared that the two companies can move ahead with their merger. Combined with Pai's show of support, Sprint stock skyrocketed upon the positive news.However, it wasn't a complete loss for opponents of the move, who claimed that it would impede competitiveness. This criticism was especially relevant for rural customers, who may be vulnerable to onerous price increases. To address this issue, the DOJ required the merged company to spin off various assets to create a Sprint replacement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) will buyout these assets, including Sprint's prepaid wireless business. The satellite-TV provider will also acquire several of Sprint's wireless airwaves. Theoretically, this should help deliver mobile-internet access to rural residents. But despite this concession, many Democrats are not satisfied with the terms. Several of the left's presidential hopefuls requested that the FCC attain a public response to the merger before approving it. Citing the familiar argument about antitrust concerns, Democrats worried about negative consumer impact. Naturally, this is a distraction for S stock.But in this particular case, I believe the geopolitical implications overwhelmingly favor the merger. Thus, I wouldn't have too much anxiety about Sprint stock. S Stock Is One of the Trade War's Few BeneficiariesIn normal circumstances, I believe the Democrats' concerns would carry much more weight. They might even be enough to disrupt the bullish trajectory of the S stock price. And when it comes to the telecom industry, greater concerns exist. Right now, we have four major telecom companies. With the merger, we'd have three, making for a sizable 25% loss.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential Put another way, post-merger, we'd be one company short of a duopolistic industry. At that point, consumers will have very little choice, thus bolstering the Democrats' argument.However, the narrative behind Sprint stock doesn't just involve competitive concerns. Rather, we have geopolitical ones as well. As I've argued a countless number of times, we're in the middle of a tech cold war. While China is technically an economic partner, they've made no bones about our underlying adversarial relationship.Let's remind ourselves that the biggest reason we're locked in a trade war is China's campaign of intellectual property theft. They want to catch up and later exceed our technological prowess. Obviously, the U.S. federal government will do everything to subvert China's plans.And that benefits S stock because part of winning in tech is winning in crucial sub-segments like 5G. With a successful rollout, 5G facilitates other innovations, such as artificial intelligence and automated transportation networks. Furthermore, in order to achieve this rollout, you must have strong telecom firms with appropriate know-how and capacity. Sprint has never really lacked in the former attribute. However, it's the latter that has inspired in part the merger proposition.Thus, here's the reality for Sprint stock. The U.S. can either have two relevant telecom names, and two hobbled ones. Or, all three can be vigorous rivals, competing not only for American customers but also American interests. The Sign of the TimesAs I mentioned back in June, Pai mentioned President Donald Trump when voicing his support of the merger. Specifically, Pai stated that 5G is a top priority for the White House. Back then, I said it was one of the smartest things Trump has ever uttered. I stand by that comment even more so today. That's because the Trump administration badly needs America's technological base to run in tip-top shape.According to a Wall Street Journal editorial, Trump is losing the trade war. As evidence, the president has increasingly ratcheted up the pressure on China, but without yielding substantive concessions. But because of the pressure, the domestic economy is showing fissures.With geopolitical events not working in the White House's favor, Trump must secure what he can. Plus, you have the combination of the FCC and the DOJ already greenlighting the merger. Therefore, the Democrats' opposition is nothing but noise for Sprint stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-21,"Some news just came out that could be another obstacle facing Sprint (NYSE:S) in its ongoing merger saga with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Oregon just joined the multi-state lawsuit to block the merger, and Texas joined the suit earlier this month. 16 states are now part of the suit which alleges that the new combined company would be anticompetitive.Source: BrandonKleinVideo / Shutterstock.com The Department of Justice announced that it had reached an agreement which would allow the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint to move forward. As part of the agreement, DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) will buy some of Sprints assets. The DOJ said that without these actions by DISH the merger could &quot;substantially harm competition.&quot; The idea behind this thinking is that afterwards there will be four companies and the competition between them will prevent anticompetitive practices. Despite this, the states decided to pursue their lawsuits because they believe that the deal will ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill Wall Street isn't sure whether or not this deal will close. 18 firms follow Sprint stock on a research basis. 14 of them have hold ratings on the stock while three firms have sell ratings on it. The average target price is $6.50, which is below current levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere is one buy recommendation on Sprint stock. The analysts at UBS believe the deal will close. They recently upgraded S stock from hold to buy and put a $10 price target on it. Though the upgrade was before the news about Oregon joining the lawsuit came out, it does not seem to have changed their opinion. Sprint's Earnings ReviewSprint just reported a net loss of $111 million, or a loss of 3 cents a share. This was in line with estimates, but well below last year's net income of $176 million or 4 cents a share. Revenues dropped from $8.44 billion to $8.14 billion. This was slightly above estimates of $8 billion. The company also announced that had lost 120,000 subscribers which was less than the loss of 150,000 that analysts were expecting.Overall, the Street seems to be slightly bullish on the numbers, but some analysts believe at this point the earnings do not really matter and will not influence the Sprint stock price. The question now for Sprint shareholders is if and when the deal will be closed.Don't hold your breath, because it isn't going to happen anytime soon. The court date just got pushed back from October to December. This means that the deal will almost certainly not close this year, unless by some chance all the suits are settled before then. What's Next for Sprint Stock?Sprint stock rallied up to the $8 level when UBS upgraded it, but news of additional lawsuits knocked it back down. There is support at $6.50. This was the top of the range from September through June and is also the average target price of the firms that cover it.It is currently consolidating, or trading sideways around the $6.80 level. S stock will probably continue to do so until there is some more clarity with regards to the outcome of the lawsuit.At the time of this writing Mark Putrino did not hold any positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

In the quarter, revenues rose by a decent 7.2% to 5.69 billion euros, which handily beat the Street estimates. There was also a beat on the bottom line - that is, after adjusting for various good will and non-cash charges.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More NOK even reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The earnings are expected to range from 0.25 euros and 0.29 euros per share in 2019 and 0.37 euros and 0.29 euros per share the following year. All in all, the company is certainly expecting more momentum.And the reason for this? It's the 5G megatrend. Carriers like AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are ramping up their efforts - and this means buying large amounts of telecom equipment.To get a sense of how strategic 5G is, just look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company abruptly settled its massive lawsuit against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) largely because it needs its 5G systems. Let's face it, if AAPL wants to remain a top smartphone marker, it has little choice but to get the max from next-generation networks.So yes, this is very good for NOK. Through is acquisition of Alcatel, the company is one of the world's largest equipment providers for 5G. 5G Timing and NOK StockOK, if the 5G opportunity is so great, why hasn't it done much for NOK stock? Well, it's important to keep in mind that the sales cycles are long in the industry. Before deciding on making large capital investments, telecom operators do quite a bit of due diligence.Next, 5G projects are multi-year endeavors. And they are risky. Even slight issues with execution can derail a project.But the good news for NOK is that next year there will be significant rollouts of 5G networks - and this should provide a nice catalyst for growth.Again, the latest earnings report provided key details on the traction. For example, the company announced 45 commercial 5G deals and nine live networks, such as with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and Sprint (NYSE:S). Interestingly enough, this is considerably more than rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC).Something else: The U.S.-China trade war will likely accelerate growth with NOK. Of course, Huawei has been a big target for President Donald Trump and this has caused quite a bit of disruption for the company. The result is that NOK should have more of an edge when getting new deals. Bottom Line on Nokia StockGranted, it's not easy to be bullish on NOK stock. The company's performance has certainly been choppy.But again, NOK has spent much time making significant changes in its business. Note that through next year, there are expected to be cost reductions of about $700 million euros.Even better, there should be improvement on the top-line as 5G hits critical mass. If anything, the buzz surrounding this technology should gin up lots of excitement.In other words, there's a good bet that NOK stock could finally get out of its funk - and fairly soon.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-22,"(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and 10 other large phone companies have struck an agreement with 51 attorneys general to enact technology to block robocalls before they reach consumers.The deal, announced Thursday, will help protect consumers from receiving illegal robocalls, and assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting bad actors, said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who is leading the effort that includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia.Under the deal, the companies will launch the call-blocking technology at no cost to consumers, and make other free anti-robocall devices and apps available to subscribers. “By signing on to these principles, industry leaders are taking new steps to keep your phone from ringing with an unwanted call,” Stein said in a statement.The companies are under pressure to protect consumers against the unwanted calls, which are a top source of complaints with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Across the U.S. there were 48 billion robocalls last year, up from 31 billion in 2017, according to a tally by YouMail Inc., a developer of software that blocks the calls.In July, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. said they were making progress toward installing technology to authenticate calls so consumers would know if the call is coming from the person supposedly making it. The FCC has demanded the technology be in place by the end of the year.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agreements with the states “align with the FCC’s own anti-robocalling and spoofing efforts,” including the agency’s caller authentication standards.“Few things can bring together policy leaders across the political spectrum like the fight against unwanted robocalls,” Pai said in a statement. “The FCC is committed to working together with Congress, state leaders, and our federal partners to put an end to unwanted robocalls.”Consumers are often duped into answering phone calls because they appear to be from a local number or business.“The bad actors running these deceptive operations will soon have one call left to make: to their lawyers,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in the statement.Companies InvolvedThe other companies signing the agreement are T-Mobile, CenturyLink Inc., Comcast Corp., Sprint Corp., Bandwidth Inc., Charter Communications Inc., Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc., Frontier Communications Corp., U.S. Cellular Corp. and Windstream Holdings Inc.The FCC has demanded that carriers adopt the system to digitally validate phone calls passing through the complex web of networks. The agency also has said that providers may block calls, and cast a preliminary vote to require the digital authentication if carriers fail to install it by year’s end.Several of the top U.S. carriers issued statements in concert with the state attorneys general announcement. While the group on a whole backed the effort, there were few if any new, specific anti-spam call actions or timelines mentioned.“It’s imperative that we stand together on a common set of goals that include stopping callers from hiding their identities, working with other carriers on efforts to trace back illegal calls to the source, and keeping the originators from sending robocalls in the first place,&quot; Verizon said in a statement.“The fight against the scourge of illegal robocalls requires all hands on deck, and we welcome and appreciate the support of the state attorneys general,” AT&T said in a statement.(Updates with carriers and FCC comment beginning in seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Erik Larson and Scott Moritz.To contact the reporters on this story: Jonathan Reid in Washington at jreid98@bloomberg.net;Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, ;Keith Perine at kperine2@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Phone Companies Strike Deal With States to Fight Robocalls

2019-08-22,"Mike's Note: For the past week, we've featured Jeff Brown's insights on the 5G wireless network rollout. Thanks to his direct connection to Silicon Valley's inner circle, and his decades of experience in the technology sector, Jeff's able to uncover big tech news before it hits the mainstream media.Source: Shutterstock Earlier, he showed us why this tech isn't just an investment megatrend, but a &quot;winner-take-all economic struggle.&quot;Read on below as Jeff continues to dive into why deploying this technology is a must-win race for the U.S… and a smart move for our national security…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy Jeff Brown, Editor, Exponential Tech InvestorIn the summer of 2018, Boston-based cybersecurity firm Cybereason discovered something troubling…  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More The company exposed a massive international espionage campaign that had hacked into at least 10 major wireless carriers.The hackers wanted to track around 20 high-profile political and military figures - including monitoring their phone calls, texts, and physical locations. It's something right out of a spy movie.This campaign (called Operation Soft Cell) had been going on for years. And based on the data, it appeared to be a nation-state attack - by China.Now, Cybereason didn't release the identities of the targets. It's too dangerous. And while we don't know for sure, prominent Western targets are a safe bet.But all this info was revealed to key U.S. government officials around the same time they started banning 5G tech and networking equipment from China's Huawei and ZTE.And today, I'll share why the ban was a smart move for our national security - and what it means for investors… The Next Generation of Wireless TechYou see, I've been tracking the 5G space very closely. It's the next evolution of wireless networks. And these new networks are going live on a weekly - and sometimes, daily - basis.On average, 5G will deliver mobile speeds 100 times faster than the 4G networks we connect to today. And having the fastest possible communications network on the planet is critical for economic growth and strength…Consider this: The economic impact of 5G will be in the range of three to five times more than the 4G wireless buildout.With 5G, as much as $275 billion will be invested by U.S. wireless carriers. Roughly three million jobs will be created in the U.S. And we can expect approximately $500 billion in GDP growth, too.At an industry level, expect $200 billion invested per year through 2025.So it's no wonder President Trump is eager to push the 5G wireless buildout forward.In fact, early last year, the current administration &quot;threatened&quot; to build out its own national 5G network if wireless carriers couldn't get it done. And my suspicion is that it was a warning.The White House was saying, &quot;Get out there and build these 5G networks quickly - or we'll do it for you.&quot; It was lighting a fire under private companies involved in the 5G buildout.And it worked…Verizon just launched 5G in four more U.S. cities: Atlanta, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Washington, D.C. So President Trump and America's senators will now have access to blazing-fast 5G.Now, some of us might be thinking that this early 5G coverage launch in D.C. isn't a coincidence. And we'd be absolutely right…Putting 5G tech in the hands of busy policymakers demonstrates progress. After all, the president has made his intentions on 5G very clear. In April, he said:The race to 5G is a race America must win, and it's a race, frankly, that our great companies are now involved in. We've given them the incentive they need. It's a race that we will win.And America winning this 5G race could be a matter of national security… Wireless World WarHere's what I mean by that: Countries leading the way in deploying 5G networks will have a competitive advantage over others.And the tech companies in these &quot;first-mover&quot; countries will be the first to develop the hardware and software enabling these 5G wireless services.Now, the fear is that China will set the 5G precedent. It'd leave America dependent on Chinese 5G infrastructure. The U.S. would be vulnerable to further cyber-spying.That's why Cybereason's discovery of Operation Soft Cell was alarming. And it's why the government further determined equipment from Huawei and ZTE was a security threat.Now, given the scale and origin of the operation, the ban looks like a smart move.Plus, the president is now insistent on getting America's 5G networks built out quickly - by American and European firms.And for investors, here's the bottom line…Behind the scenes, the world's top superpowers - the U.S. and China - are waging a war for 5G supremacy.So 5G is an unstoppable trend. And companies providing the necessary tech for these 5G networks will benefit.American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is one of these wireless communications infrastructure companies. It builds and maintains communications infrastructure like cell towers.It was instrumental in the 4G buildout that started in 2011. And it's also heavily involved in erecting and maintaining the towers used in the 5G buildout.Right now, investors should be looking at companies like American Tower that provide critical network infrastructure. These key 5G stocks will soar.Keep this trend on your radar. I expect 5G to be the best investing opportunity of the next decade.Regards,Jeff Brown  Editor, Exponential Tech InvestorP.S. Investors who miss the 5G boom will regret it for the rest of their lives. I expect key 5G stocks to soar as much as 10x - perhaps higher. 99% of investors will miss this chance. I encourage you not to be one of them.That's why I'm hosting the 5G Investment Summit tonight at 8 p.m. ET. I'll reveal my stock-picking method for finding the fastest-moving 5G stocks.

2019-08-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Three years ago this month, Hollywood executive Peter Chernin and AT&T Inc. CEO Randall Stephenson shared a dinner on Martha’s Vineyard. Stephenson is still waiting for his dessert to arrive. It was the meal that sparked the idea for Stephenson, a practically lifelong member of the staid telephone industry, to enter the TV and film business by acquiring Time Warner, a then-$60 billion giant of the media world. After Stephenson struck the deal, he told Bloomberg News that it was Chernin who “first got me to appreciate the library that this company owns.” That library includes HBO, with hits like “Game of Thrones” and “Succession;” the Warner Bros. studio, which that year had an almost 17% share of the box office; and the rights to “Friends,” a sitcom that hasn’t aired fresh episodes in more than 15 years but has taken on new life as the Holy Grail of the streaming-TV market.In June of last year, 601 days after the companies agreed to merge, Time Warner officially became part of the Dallas-based wireless-phone carrier, defeating an attempt by the U.S. Justice Department to block the transaction. AT&T’s WarnerMedia division, as the Time Warner assets are now called, is seen as one of the biggest threats to Netflix Inc., though it doesn’t yet have a competing product to show for it. In fact, little more has come out of the WarnerMedia acquisition so far than reports of culture clashes, differing visions and high-profile personnel exits.According to the New York Post this week, some HBO staffers have been put off by the brusque management style of their new WarnerMedia boss John Stankey, a longtime AT&T executive. The Dallas-based C-suite is putting pressure on its Hollywood employees to ramp up HBO’s production slate as they coalesce around building a new streaming app named HBO Max, the strategy for which is still nebulous and seems to keep changing. They have a deadline to unveil the product to investors on Oct. 29. Later in the year, HBO Max will officially join the alphabet soup of video services already offered by AT&T:The subscription on-demand product sounds akin to Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+ and Apple Inc.’s Apple TV+, which are both launching within the next three months and gunning for Netflix Inc.’s subscriber base. They’re spending billions of dollars to fill out their apps with HBO-quality content. In theory, AT&T is sitting on a set of assets best suited to draw a wide streaming audience, with HBO’s high-quality programming, plus news, sports, comedy, cartoons and popular films. But merger integration issues and AT&T’s lack of experience in the content business pose major challenges.The price could also turn off subscribers. HBO Max is expected to charge a few dollars more than the stand-alone HBO Now app, which at $15 a month is higher than Netflix’s $13 monthly fee and more than double the $7 that Disney+ will charge. In fact, bundling Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ will be just $13.  The irony is that while Stephenson tries to transform AT&T into a media conglomerate, the wireless business that’s effectively been overshadowed by the merger is improving. It's the healthiest area of the company. Wireless accounted for 37% of AT&T’s revenue in the last 12 months, but it was nearly 50% of Ebitda, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That cash flow is helping AT&T contend with a heavy debt load, which stood at $194 billion as of June. Wireless network performance has gotten better as new spectrum has been deployed, boosting AT&T’s image as the carriers transition to 5G service. Based on scoring by various outlets that track wireless connections, AT&T was able to crown itself America’s “fastest, best and most reliable network,” which are useful bragging rights for TV ads as the industry battles for customers. More important, AT&T is saving money through a public-private contract it won to build FirstNet, a network for first responders. Put simply, while AT&T’s workers climb towers to set up FirstNet, they’re also prepping its airwaves for 5G.These improvements haven’t yet reduced churn, or the rate at which customers are leaving AT&T, but that could be next should the wireless business stay on track. And if T-Mobile US Inc.’s takeover of Sprint Corp. overcomes state opposition (16 attorneys general have sued to block the deal), there will be one less competitor for AT&T and a chance to raise prices.AT&T’s DirecTV satellite business continues to shrink, with the company losing 946,000 video subscribers in the second quarter, including DirecTV Now customers who canceled in the wake of price hikes. That streaming service was recently renamed AT&T TV Now as the company moves away from the fading DirecTV brand. It also introduced a new service this week in certain markets called AT&T TV, which is a similar live-TV and on-demand app with various package options, but also involves using a streaming box where users can access other services they may subscribe to, such as Netflix. It became clear this week that AT&T TV and HBO Max together are at the center of Stephenson’s vision for the new AT&T.The idea must have seemed so sweet three years ago. But peering into the kitchen, it’s all still a bit hectic. He'll have to keep waiting for that dessert.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

2019-08-27,"Every once in a while, a stock chart just reaches out and grabs you. The trend is so strong that it compels you to pay attention. I recently had one of those moments with 5G stocks, so I wanted to share it now.This particular chart highlights a trend that debunks one of the biggest myths I'm hearing right now - the one that says, &quot;the market is doomed, everyone's selling off, and if you haven't yet, then you should, too.&quot;If that were true, why are these &quot;random&quot; stocks going absolutely wild compared to the broader market?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs you can see in the one-year chart below, they're racking up 30%, even 50% gains… during a time period when the S&P 500 (the orange line at the bottom) is flat.I call them &quot;random&quot; stocks because Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) and American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) are likely not top-of-mind for many investors. They're not the kind of stocks that folks like me usually get called to discuss on TV. (But with performance like that, they should.)But these are NOT &quot;random&quot; stocks. In fact, they'll be crucial in implementing 5G wireless, one of the biggest revolutionary technologies that's just taking off now and is set to explode into the 2020s.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs) specializing in telecom services. In other words, they often play landlord to companies like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S). At this point, that's basically the whole industry. And these telecom REITs help provide cell towers, plus newer technology called &quot;small cells,&quot; as well as the fiber-optic cables that run out to customers.Are cell towers a growth industry? Absolutely. And that's because people's usage of mobile data is skyrocketing. In 2018, the average smartphone in North America used 7 gigabytes per month. In 2024, that'll be more like 40 gigabytes per month, according to a June report from Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC).That's nearly 6X growth in just six years.Crown Castle CEO Jay Brown cited that stat when giving his 2019 guidance on new-leasing activity. In the July earnings report, Brown announced that his company expects a 30% increase in tower leasing, year-over-year.But this is a much bigger story than Crown Castle, American Tower, or any other individual 5G stocks.At Investment Opportunities, I've really been digging into the 5G mega-trend -- and you can bet I'll continue to do so. The closer I look, the more opportunities I find… some that you might never expect.Keep in mind that when we talk about 5G, we're talking about speed. Taking devices that don't look much different than the ones we use now… and transforming them into something exponentially faster and more powerful.With 5G, you will be able to download a movie in six seconds. Today it takes seven minutes with the current 4G technology.Now, here in the United States -- in tech strongholds like San Francisco and wealthy suburbs like Montgomery County, Maryland -- homeowners aren't too thrilled when Crown Castle or Verizon come to their neighborhood to put up a cell tower. (Or add to an existing one, like with the 5G buildout.)I get it, but these folks aren't seeing the big picture. They just see a big gray box. Ultimately, though, 5G is coming -- and it'll take us to the next level of wireless communications. Not just for consumer products, like our iPhones, but for industrial applications, advanced medicine, and even transportation. If we're talking about self-driving cars, we're talking about a lot of data that needs relayed back and forth in an instant.The speeds 5G provides will be the catalyst for just about every other game-changing technology that's coming down the pike. And the more people realize that, the more they'll start to notice stock charts like the one above.This is what I'm talking about when I say: The market is full of buying opportunities right now. Yes, right now.P.S. What are some of these game-changing technologies I'm looking at?Besides self-driving cars, there are electric cars in general (which are being adopted at a phenomenal rate)…There are tons of other connected devices -- a whole Internet of Things…There are smart medical devices, leading to precision healthcare…And artificial intelligence…No wonder data usage is taking off into the stratosphere.And guess what? All those devices need to be powered.Unfortunately, the current technology has some pretty severe limitations. But new technology is emerging to replace it -- one that's safer AND more powerful.Click here to learn more and prepare to ride this trend higher in your portfolio.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2019-08-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. blamed Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey’s mobile phone carrier for a hack of his Twitter account that sent out a stream of offensive tweets on Friday.“The phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider,” Twitter said in a comment posted by spokesman Brandon Borrman late Friday.Borrman clarified Saturday that the company isn’t identifying the carrier, and so far none of the four major U.S. mobile providers has admitted responsibility.The security incident “allowed an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number. That issue is now resolved,” according to the Friday statement. The clarification appears to support speculation that Dorsey was the victim of SIM swapping. That’s when someone convinces a mobile carrier to switch an existing number to a new SIM card they control. In this case, it may have required the hackers to have personal details that would allow them to convincingly impersonate one of Silicon Valley’s best-known figures.More than 15 tweets, many containing obscenities and racist comments, were posted on Dorsey’s account, @jack, shortly before 4 p.m. New York time on Friday. The company started deleting the tweets from Dorsey’s verified Twitter account, which has more than 4 million followers, about 20 minutes after the messages went viral.A person familiar with Sprint’s operations said the company checked late Friday and there was no record of an account associated with Dorsey. A spokeswoman for T-Mobile, Tara Darrow, said that “for privacy and security reasons, we would never discuss an individual’s circumstances or if they are a customer.” Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. didn’t respond to queries from Bloomberg News on Saturday asking if they were Dorsey’s provider.The attack may not have required any in-person communication on the part of the fraudster. A group calling itself the Chuckling Squad claimed credit for the hack.“You can call in and say, ‘I bought a new phone and I need a new SIM card assigned to this number,’” said Lawrence Pingree, a research vice president at the IT research company Gartner Inc. If the caller provides the correct information, they might succeed, and the problem is made worse because call centers handle a high volume of calls, he said.Some of the tweets sent from Dorsey’s account used anti-black slurs, praised Adolf Hitler and talked about a bomb at Twitter’s headquarters. Many of them referenced the Chuckling Squad, which also took credit for the hack of several YouTube and Instagram celebrities this month, including James Charles, Shane Dawson, King Bach and Amanda Cerny.Borrman said he “didn’t have anything to share on that right now” when asked whether the FBI or local law enforcement was investigating Dorsey’s hack. Sgt. Samy Tarazi, of the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, whose agency is part of a five-county cyber task force in the Bay area that’s been focused on SIM swapping for the last 18 months, said swapping represents a massive flaw in mobile security because the phone’s user loses all control of their device; the decision to change out the SIM is left to the mobile carrier. Some victims have been hit multiple times.Tarazi said in some cases employees of a mobile carrier are paid to swap the cards by the hackers, but in others, the perpetrators are just clever at impersonating the victim. Tarazi said he’s seen the fraud performed successfully by hackers as young as 13 years old.While the attack on Dorsey’s account didn’t appear to be financially motivated, SIM swapping can be lucrative when used to steal cryptocurrency that’s secured through data or applications linked to a victim’s mobile phone.Prosecuting SIM swaps is challenging because it’s often difficult to explain the process to a judge or jury that isn’t tech savvy, Tarazi said. In addition, “it’s really trying to explain the seriousness of a 16-year-old working from his bedroom in his parent’s house stealing millions of dollars. It’s hard to wrap your head around.”After Dorsey’s hack, other Twitter users expressed concern that an even more prominent and prolific user -- President Donald Trump -- could be just as easily hacked, compromising global political relations. Trump, who regularly uses the service to announce policy decisions, expressed little concern about that scenario.“Well, I hope they’re not hacking my account, but actually if they do, they’re not going to learn too much more than what I put out, right?” Trump told reporters Friday evening as he left the White House. “Shouldn’t be too bad.”Twitter declined to comment on the security measures Dorsey uses. His account was hacked in 2016 through a connection to his Vine account, so he probably uses more security around the account than most users.Twitter lets users post tweets by text, and it’s likely the method that was used to post the offensive remarks, which wouldn’t require having Dorsey’s password or directly hacking Twitter’s systems.The tweets were sent via a service called Cloudhopper that allows tweeting via SMS. Twitter acquired Cloudhopper in 2010.&#92;--With assistance from Andrew Martin and Alyza Sebenius.To contact the reporters on this story: Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.net;Michael Riley in Washington at michaelriley@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Matthew G.

2019-09-03,"Typically, a security that generates a 38% dividend yield means only one thing: run! And while that metric may seem like a fantasy, it's actually a very real narrative for GameStop (NYSE:GME). Beleaguered from a massive shift in the retail video game landscape, GameStop stock has never looked like a legitimate investment since the middle of this decade.Source: Shutterstock However, two major news items have breathed new life into GME stock. First, Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced earlier this year that their next-generation gaming consoles will utilize physical discs. Now, this is old news. However, a second catalyst has forced many analysts to reconsider it in a new light.And that spark comes in the form of famed short-seller Michael Burry. Famously, Burry predicted last decade's sub-prime mortgage. Additionally, he put his money where his mouth was, profiting from the downfall. His exploits later inspired the film &quot;The Big Short.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUsually, movies about the financial markets draw snores. But like many audience members, I was engrossed not only by the story, but also the implications. Burry, played by Christian Bale, was a reclusive genius. However, people really didn't understand the latter attribute until they profited handsomely from his outrageous call.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off How many of us wished we had access to Burry and his unconventional approach to the markets? Well, now we do. Burry is going long GameStop stock.It's an intriguing contrarian play. To us, betting on GME stock makes as much sense as the idea of shorting the mortgage industry must have been prior to the bubble collapse.But is this genuinely good advice on GameStop stock, or has Burry's reputation preceded him? Why You Should Ignore Burry's Advice on GME StockBefore we get into the details, we should reiterate a general point: you should never invest in an equity just based on an advisor's prior success. Obviously, Burry scored big on his big short. But can lightning strike twice? Maybe it can, or maybe he was just lucky that first time.As far as I know, there's no sequel to &quot;The Big Short.&quot;But specific to GameStop stock, the overriding reason why people are so bearish is because of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) effect; namely, gamers are increasingly gravitating toward the convenience of video game downloads.After all, why go through the hassle of driving to the store, waiting in line, and driving back home? Instead, you can just download your target game in the comfort of your own home.Furthermore, console developers are moving toward subscription models similar to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Rather than spending gobs of money for each new release, you pay a nominal fee monthly. Then, you have access to a much wider range of games than you would have buying them individually.And these aren't just talking points: they're negatively impacting the GameStop stock price. Just open a five-year chart and the debate is over. Why You Should Gamble on GameStop StockWhile GME stock seems like a far-fetched bet, I'm not going to dismiss that Burry is a genius. Plus, he might be onto something here.First, video game downloads aren't without their limitations. With today's data-intensive games, you've got to have super high-speed internet; otherwise, you're going to spend all day (or even night) to get them.Moreover, not all Americans have access to high-speed internet. In fact, one of the underlying issues with the T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) merger is the rural customer. Theoretically, a merger would provide rural internet users with a comprehensively more competent high-speed internet solution. But for now, they must make do with inferior service.Beyond that, high-speed internet is expensive, and some folks may not have the means to afford it, especially under a recession.This brings me to my second point. If we do have a recession, GameStop stock levers a critical advantage. In an economic downturn, customers will cut unnecessary expenditures. I'd call video game subscriptions unnecessary. But used physical games for half their new sticker price or better? That would fly very well, especially because recessions incentivize cheap entertainment.Additionally, we sometimes forget the fact that as technology improves, so too does their data and storage demands. There's a reason why Sony and Microsoft both elected physics disc formats for their upcoming consoles: next-gen games are extremely data-intensive, and that burden will only increase.For now, downloading such behemoths on the regular is too much. The Jury on BurryI nearly soiled myself when I saw the dividend yield for GME stock. This is about as desperate of a long play as you're going to find.However, Burry is in many ways a visionary. I think part of his thesis involves the concept that we're headed toward a recession. If that's true, consumer behaviors will necessarily change. And this change is what would drive the bull case for GameStop stock.Now, I'm not clear as to how long Burry intends to hold GME stock. But if you're looking for a nearer-term gamble, I believe the outside fundamentals are surprisingly positive.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE.

2019-09-05,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- T-Mobile US Inc. is trying to make the case that Sprint Corp. is on its deathbed, and that T-Mobile alone can save it. That’s rich coming from the company that happily helped put Sprint there. It’s also a misleading prognosis for Sprint. A Sprint pity party is one way T-Mobile is defending against a multi-state lawsuit that seeks to prevent the wireless carrier from taking over its weaker rival, and it used that reasoning in a court filing last week. Even though the deal already has the backing of the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission, 17 state attorneys general – who represent more than half the U.S. population – are challenging the transaction because of concerns that it will lead to higher prices, discourage innovation and hurt workers. Illinois, Oregon and Texas were the latest to join the now-bipartisan suit, whose trial date is set for Dec. 9. State officials are right to be concerned. T-Mobile and Sprint are the third- and fourth-biggest carriers, respectively, in a mainly four-carrier market. Lower prices and new features from them in recent years did a lot of good for customers, forcing industry leaders Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. to offer more competitive data plans. But without Sprint, there isn’t as much incentive for T-Mobile to keep prices down. In fact, for T-Mobile to close its profit-margin gap with the larger carriers, it more likely would need to do just the opposite. The DOJ is looking to wireless market newbie Dish Network Corp. to help preserve some equilibrium, putting Dish on the receiving end of the concessions that T-Mobile and Sprint are required to make. However, Dish is still years and multiple billions of dollars away from becoming a formidable competitor to fill the hole Sprint will leave behind. As such, the DOJ and the FCC may not be fulfilling their duties to promote competition and ensure that corporate tie-ups serve the public interest. T-Mobile’s argument is that if its deal gets blocked, Sprint is going to go away anyway. That’s a half-truth. I’ve written time and again about Sprint’s financial troubles and strategic missteps, including this series of charts showing just how ugly Sprint looks as a stand-alone. The data are almost sympathetic to T-Mobile’s case. But a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint doesn’t save Sprint. It does rescue an investment turned sour for many shareholders, especially a billionaire named Masayoshi Son. He’s the leader of SoftBank Group Corp., Sprint’s Japanese controlling shareholder, and he wants to remove any trace of his misguided optimism about Sprint from SoftBank’s balance sheet, equity valuation and image. SoftBank is retaining a 27% economic interest in the new T-Mobile, a superior operator on healthier footing.T-Mobile is casting itself as Sprint's savior, but T-Mobile CEO John Legere has been dancing on Sprint’s grave for years. Legere, a shameless yet successful self-promoter, often crossed the line in these instances beyond healthy competition, tweeting mean-spirited jokes about his rival going out of business. There were times he called Sprint “a melting ice cube,” said the company may have to resort to raising money on Kickstarter, and asked for “any guesses on what Sprint will fruckup today” (a swipe at Sprint’s “framily plan” promotion for friends and family). He used the hashtag SprintLikeHell. I’m not pointing this out for the sake of it or to say Legere is a big ole meanie. It’s more about this: While Legere was dissing Sprint, he continued to boast to investors that T-Mobile was actually posing serious competition for Verizon and AT&T – something he promises a combined T-Mobile-Sprint will also do. Except the data paint a slightly different picture. For years, T-Mobile regularly disclosed so-called porting ratios, which tell how many customers T-Mobile lost to another carrier and vice versa. For example, starting in 2013, its porting ratio with Sprint mostly held above 2 and at times went above 4 and higher, meaning that for every subscriber T-Mobile lost to Sprint, it gained four Sprint customers. T-Mobile will say that the overwhelming majority of its “porting” has come from Verizon and AT&T, but that’s explained by the fact that those companies have larger subscriber bases than Sprint does. The reality is that T-Mobile inflicted far more damage on Sprint than to what it calls “the duopoly,” as this chart shows:To be fair, T-Mobile isn’t the predominant reason Sprint is in such a desperate state now. Its problems date back to Sprint’s ill-advised merger 14 years ago with Nextel, a network that became a money pit for the company. And Sprint was never able to dig its way out from a mountain of debt, largely deal-related. Meanwhile, in 2011, regulators stopped AT&T from buying T-Mobile, a move that set T-Mobile up for a turnaround and to become the fastest-growing member of the industry. Had that deal gone through, consumers’ bills may have looked very different in the subsequent years.Going forward, if Sprint were to get any cheaper, other deep-pocketed buyers outside of the industry would likely surface, such as Charter Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and others. The idea of a cable giant owning Sprint might not seem like a better outcome, but it preserves a competitor in the wireless market and many more jobs. As the industry gears up for ultra-fast 5G wireless networks, there’s simply no way T-Mobile is the sole company interested in Sprint’s spectrum assets and subscriber base, even if its brand is beyond repair. So when T-Mobile tells a courtroom that Sprint needs it, you have to laugh.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-09-09,"(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc.’s sweeping transformation from Ma Bell to a multimedia titan has gone both too far and not far enough for Elliott Management Corp.Billionaire Paul Singer’s New York hedge fund disclosed a new $3.2 billion position in AT&T, taking on one of the nation’s biggest and most widely held companies with a plan to boost its share price by more than 50% through asset sales and cost cutting.Investors applauded the development, briefly sending AT&T shares on their biggest intraday rally in more than a decade.For Singer, the move represents one of the biggest bets in the four decades since the hard-driving activist investor founded his firm. And it strikes at the core of the way AT&T has built its bigger-is-better empire: a costly M&A binge that has turned the carrier into one of the most indebted companies on Earth.“There will be a fight,” said Chetan Sharma, a wireless-industry analyst.Elliott outlined a four-part plan for the company in a letter to its board Monday. The proposal calls for the company to explore divesting assets, including satellite-TV provider DirecTV, the Mexican wireless operations, pieces of the landline business, and others.It urges AT&T, led by Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, to exit businesses that don’t fit its strategy, run a more efficient operation and stop making major acquisitions. Elliott said it would also recommend candidates to add to AT&T’s board.In response, AT&T said it would review Elliott’s recommendations and said many of them are “ones we are already executing today.”The telecom giant said its strategy is “driven by the unique portfolio of valuable businesses we’ve assembled across communications networks and media and entertainment, and as Elliott points out, is the foundation for significant value creation.”The carrier said it believes that “growing and investing in these businesses is the best path forward for our company and our shareholders.”Still, investors seem to think Elliott’s plan could wring more value from AT&T. The shares surged as much as 5.2% to $38.14 in New York trading Monday. That was the biggest intraday jump since March 2009 and put them at their highest level since February of last year. They later settled down to a 2.7% gain amid a broader pullback in the market.Elliott said the investment -- among its largest to date -- was made because the company is deeply undervalued after a period of “prolonged and substantial underperformance.” It argued this has been marked by its shares lagging the broader S&P 500 over the past decade.It pointed to a series of strategic setbacks, including $200 billion in acquisitions, the “most damaging” of which was its $39 billion attempted purchase of T-Mobile US Inc. That deal resulted in the largest breakup fee of all time when the government blocked it in 2011 -- about $6 billion in cash and assets.“In addition to the internal and external distractions it caused itself, AT&T’s failed takeover capitalized a viable competitor for years to come,” Elliott said.The hedge fund also slammed the subsequent acquisitions of DirecTV and media giant Time Warner Inc. That puts particular pressure on Stephenson, 59, who oversaw the deals Elliott criticized in the letter.But, while the position in AT&T is large, Elliott may have a difficult time pushing for change unless it gets other investors to back its stance. Its newly disclosed stake in AT&T represents just about 1.2% of the company’s total market value.Elliott’s plan also calls for aggressive cost-cutting measures that aim to improve AT&T’s margins by 3 percentage points by 2022. Those margins have come under pressure amid cord cutting in video and widespread discounting in wireless, and Elliott said competitors like Verizon Communications Inc. have done a better job addressing those headwinds.Elliott said in the letter it has identified opportunities for savings in excess of $10 billion, but the plan would only require cost cuts of $5 billion.Elliott is also calling for a series of governance changes, including separating the roles of CEO and chairman -- currently held by Stephenson -- and the formation of a strategic review committee to identify the opportunities at hand.Transformative DealsWith a series of deals over the past several years, AT&T has transformed itself from a traditional telecom company into a multimedia behemoth. The company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV for $67 billion in 2015, leaping into first place among U.S. pay-TV companies. Elliott criticized that deal in its letter as having come “at the absolute peak of the linear TV market.”AT&T then moved firmly into entertainment and media with the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner in 2018. That deal brought marquee assets such as HBO, CNN and Warner Bros.“Despite nearly 600 days passing between signing and closing (and more than a year passing since), AT&T has yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale for why AT&T needs to own Time Warner,” Jesse Cohn, a partner at Elliott, and Marc Steinberg, an associate portfolio manager, said in the letter. “While it is too soon to tell whether AT&T can create value with Time Warner, we remain cautious on the benefits of this combination.”High-Profile FightsElliott has a history of tackling some of the biggest and most high-profile companies around the globe, including EBay Inc., Pernod Ricard SA, and Bayer AG in the past year alone. The AT&T investment marks Elliott’s single largest equity investment with an activist slant.It’s not the first time Elliott has taken on a major telecommunications company, either. The hedge fund battled Vivendi SA for control of the board of Telecom Italia SpA, eventually winning control in 2018 in a fight that dragged on into this year.Those battles don’t always end in success. In Elliott’s proxy fight at Hyundai Motor Group earlier this year, investors opted not to elect its slate of directors at two of the South Korean manufacturer’s subsidiaries. But even in some of its major losses, like at Samsung Electronics Co., the repercussion of its agitations can send ripples beyond the proxy clash.Samsung managed to keep Elliott at bay in 2015 but touched off a series of events that resulted in a brief jail term for the electronics giant’s billionaire heir apparent for influence peddling, protests by hundreds of thousands of people in Seoul, and the downfall and imprisonment of South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye.Heavy DebtAT&T is the most indebted company in the world -- not counting financial firms and government-backed entities -- with $194 billion in total debt as of June, a legacy of Stephenson’s steady clip of large acquisitions. The CEO used to keep a spreadsheet of a few dozen companies that he studies on his tablet to plan his next big deal, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in 2016.The stock is among the top 20 most widely held U.S.-traded companies among institutional investors, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s partially because of its steady dividend, which totaled $2.04 a share last year, giving investors a reliable payout in good times and bad.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“AT&T will likely be under greater pressure to streamline operations and wring better performance out of Time Warner following the involvement of activist investor Elliott Management, yet this probably won’t prompt a change in company strategy. ... Elliott’s recommendation to spin off the DirecTV satellite business isn’t practical, in our view, as AT&T likely needs its free cash to help fund its dividend.”&#92;-- John Butler, senior telecom analyst, and Boyoung Kim, associate analystClick here to view the research.Phone companies have also traditionally been considered a safety net for investors in bad economic times because people still need to communicate, though AT&T’s exposure to the landline business has more recently been a drag on profits because more people are shutting off their home phones and going wireless-only.Elliott’s move also put AT&T back in the cross hairs of one of its biggest critics: Donald Trump.The president, whose Justice Department unsuccessfully opposed AT&T’s Time Warner acquisition and who has slammed CNN’s coverage of him, cheered on Elliott’s efforts.“Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T,” he tweeted.&#92;--With assistance from Olga Kharif.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Nick Turner, John J.

2019-09-10,"(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese professor a Silicon Valley startup accused in a civil lawsuit of stealing its trade secrets for Huawei Technologies Co. now faces a federal criminal charge, as the U.S. escalates its crackdown on the telecom giant.Bo Mao, a professor at Xiamen University in China and a visiting professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Arlington, is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud against a California technology startup to obtain its “property” on behalf of a Chinese telecommunications company.The prosecution is the latest in a series of moves against Huawei by the U.S. The government is pursuing criminal cases against the networking company for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile US Inc. It has banned Huawei’s technology and accused the company of helping Beijing carry out espionage. Huawei has denied any wrongdoing and accused the U.S. of singling it out for political reasons.Mao’s case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Solomon in Brooklyn, New York, who is also prosecuting the Iran case.Mao, initially held without bail after prosecutors argued he posed a flight risk and could obstruct justice, was freed last month on a $100,000 bond after he agreed to waive indictment, according to court records. A waiver of indictment can signal a guilty plea, possibly along with an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors.John Marzulli, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Marion Bachrach, a lawyer representing Mao, didn’t return a voicemail seeking comment. Jeff Carlton, a spokesman for the University of Texas at Arlington, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on Mao.Read More: Huawei Iran-Sanctions Evidence Is Too Risky for China to SeeWhile federal prosecutors in Texas didn’t identify the Chinese telecom company or its alleged victim, their complaint parallels the allegations CNEX Labs Inc., a Silicon Valley startup, made against Huawei in the civil case. In that case, CNEX accused Mao of helping Huawei steal the technology by entering into an agreement with CNEX to obtain a circuit board, purportedly for academic research, in 2016.Acting with another professor in the U.S., prosecutors alleged, Mao emailed the U.S. startup, seeking to buy its proprietary technology “to build an experimental program,” according to an email they cited. The startup later agreed to provide the technology, they said.“It is clear that Bo Mao secretly provided the Victim Company’s proprietary information to Company 1 in violation of the agreement,” prosecutors said, in apparent respective references to CNEX and Huawei.Huawei lost the civil trade-secrets case in June, though the jury declined to award damages to CNEX. CNEX contended that Huawei had posed as a potential customer to get secret details of its plans and, when that didn’t work, persuaded Mao and Xiamen University to work as a research partner with CNEX to obtain the plans surreptitiously.Mao was arrested on federal charges on Aug. 14. His case was transferred from Fort Worth, Texas, to Brooklyn and assigned to U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly, who is also presiding over the Iran case.She scheduled a Sept. 11 hearing for Mao.The case is U.S. v. Mao, 19-cr-392, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).&#92;--With assistance from Susan Decker.To contact the reporter on this story: Patricia Hurtado in Federal Court in Manhattan at pathurtado@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Jeffrey, Peter BlumbergFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Charges Chinese Professor Accused of Theft to Help Huawei

That was the thought process behind AT&T's (NYSE:T) moves into becoming not only a distributor of content but a creator of one as well. As wireless adoption slowed, T needed to significantly move the needle to continue making investors happy. Unfortunately, it may be having the opposite effect on AT&T stock.Source: Shutterstock After struggling to integrate Time Warner into its system, never realizing the full potential of bundling as well as a few other missteps, T stock has now become the target of some very angry shareholders. That includes activist investors at Elliott ManagementAnd Elliott may have a point.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAT&T's big plans haven't come to fruition and they may never. Considering the debt that AT&T is now ladled with, it might be time to cut losses and run. For investors, AT&T stock may not be the risk-free investment they think it is. Elliott's involvement brings many of its issues to the forefront. AT&T's Big Moves Aren't WorkingAfter the growth of the wireless boom slowed to trickle and fungibility among carriers resulted in a price war, AT&T was caught between a rock and hard place.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Owners of AT&T had grown accustomed to getting some &quot;oomph&quot; with their investment. The firm couldn't go back to being a boring widow and orphan stock. So, as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) went the web route and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) began snagging up weaker rivals, AT&T decided to copy the creator/distributor model that worked for several other cable providers.The company set itself to be an all-in-one media and content provider. It would make the movies and then distribute them over its satellite and mobile video operations.The problem is, while this worked for Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), it really hasn't worked so well for AT&T.It turns out, providing cable TV services is just as fungible as wireless service. People continue to cut the cord at a fevered pace and adopt streaming instead. For AT&T's, DirecTV this has resulted in the fleeing of subscribers. The same could be said for T's U-Verse traditional cable service.When AT&T first purchased DirecTV, it had 20.3 million US customers. Adding in U-verse brings the total to 26 million. After AT&T reported earnings in the second quarter, that number had dipped to just 21.6 million. That's a 17% drop since the DirecTV buyout.Whoops.This is a huge issue if your entire future is based on getting people to watch your produced movies and T.V. shows on your exclusive networks. With people fleeing AT&T's distribution platform, the big buyout of Time Warner starts to make less sense. It can't just offer that content to its subscribers because there are no subscribers left. In order to justify the purchase of Time Warner, you have to lose the exclusivity. And once you do that, the model is broken. AT&T Gets a Letter From ElliottAll of this brings us to Paul Singer and Elliott Management. The activist shop disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the firm and sent a strongly worded letter to AT&T's management indicating that its recent blunders have hurt shareholders.In its letter, Elliott partner Jesse Cohn and associate portfolio manager Marc Steinberg wrote that AT&T should sell some of its non-core businesses such as its Mexican wireless operations. More importantly, it should cut DirecTV loose either via a spin-out or asset sale. Likewise, AT&T needs to focus on being more profitable and generate more revenue per employee. Something rival Verizon does well. Also on the menu was increased buyback and dividend programs.If management at AT&T complied and work with Elliott's suggestions, AT&T stock could be worth north of $60 per share by 2021. That would be a roughly 65% gain from recent closing prices. Elliott Has a Point with AT&TThe reality is, Singer and Elliott have a point with their demands. The buyout of DirectTV literally happened at the peak of cable T.V. and the beginning of streaming television.Since then, firms like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) have started to eat traditional TV's lunch. This is evident by the drop in AT&T's subscribers, and the company can't seem to compete. It's latest streaming efforts after DirectTV Now was bust is a new streaming service that looks just like cable tv and costs a staggering $93 a month.This isn't a smart business, especially considering the massive debt AT&T took on to do all of this. The firm spent $67 billion purchase DirecTV and another $109 billion in order to complete the buyout of Time Warner. That's insane. What's worse is that T is going to have to spend a ton in order to build-out its 5G network in order to compete with VZ and TMUS. That will just put more debt on the pile.So, stopping the bleeding makes sense. Spinning out DirecTV along with some of that debt could significantly reduce AT&T's burden. Meanwhile, Time Warner's assets aren't bad. Monetizing them better and creating more partnerships with other streaming networks could lead to bigger profits down the road from the division. The key is that the exclusivity is not going to happen. A Longer Road for AT&T StockIn the end, AT&T's big plans haven't worked out and shareholders have suffered. Elliott may be on to something by &quot;cutting the cord&quot; and freeing AT&T from the DirecTV shackles.Investors seem to like the idea as AT&T stock jumped at the announcement that the firm had taken a stake. The question is, whether or not, Elliott is able to make good on its ideas and get T's management to budge. In the meantime, investors may not want to stick around to find out.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any stock mentioned.

Oddly enough, his decision could hinge on a legal trial in December that has little to do with his company but everything to do with how far antitrust regulators can be pushed in the Trump administration.It was the $67 billion takeover of DirecTV four years ago that first turned AT&T into a diversified communications conglomerate. Stephenson overpaid and underestimated how quickly the satellite-TV service would lose subscribers to cheaper online alternatives. With AT&T now squarely focused on expanding its 5G wireless network and integrating HBO and the other WarnerMedia assets it acquired last year, the company is finally considering parting ways with DirecTV, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing unidentified sources. The pivot comes as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. puts pressure on Stephenson and AT&T’s board to streamline its operations. I explained in January how a sale of DirecTV might help AT&T pay down its mountain of debt more quickly and remove a cloud over its stock price. AT&T also has far too many pay-TV products, and it’s already started to play down the DirecTV brand by changing the name of DirecTV Now, a skinny live-TV streaming platform, to AT&T TV Now:One option is spinning off the unit into a separate publicly traded entity, though it’s hard to see the appeal for investors of a stand-alone DirecTV. It wouldn’t have the same advantages AT&T gets through its scale and simultaneous control of popular programming. For example, HBO went dark on Dish Network Corp.’s satellite-TV services last year because of a carriage dispute between the companies, leaving many HBO fans the choice to either switch to DirecTV or subscribe to the HBO Now app for $15 a month — both properties of AT&T. DirecTV has also lost customers rapidly while turning to desperate price increases to shore up profit margins.AT&T’s other option for unloading DirecTV is to combine the business with Dish, which is beset by the same industry challenges. Charlie Ergen, the billionaire who controls Dish, said in an interview in July that he sees “industrial logic” for putting the two together. They could substantially cut costs, and the added cash flow would aid Ergen in his efforts to build a nationwide wireless network.Regulatory friction is seen as the biggest obstacle to a DirecTV-Dish merger, with Reuters reporting Wednesday that the companies aren’t discussing a deal for that reason. But the way I see it, Stephenson and Ergen may just be awaiting the outcome of T-Mobile US Inc.’s attempt to buy Sprint Corp., as I wrote in June. Should that deal proceed, it would set a precedent for allowing the merger of two direct competitors in a highly concentrated market. So far, T-Mobile and Sprint — the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, respectively, behind AT&T and Verizon Communications — have received clearance from both the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division and the Federal Communications Commission. However, 18 state attorneys general — and counting — have joined a lawsuit to block the transaction on the grounds that it will lead to higher prices for consumers, discourage industry innovation and hurt workers. The trial is set to begin Dec. 9.(1) A triumph by the companies may embolden Stephenson and Ergen. They could even argue that the pay-TV market isn’t as concentrated, with numerous new streaming-TV apps posing competition to the traditional distributors. Walt Disney Co. has constructed a $13-a-month bundle for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ that almost rivals denser cable-TV packages in content, and certainly does in price. The wild card, of course, is President Donald Trump. It’s been reported that he tried meddling in AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner, a unit now called WarnerMedia, because of personal grievances with the news network CNN, one of the assets AT&T inherited in the deal. As for DirecTV and Dish, “the biggest ‘regulatory’ obstacle may be the president and his undying desire to punish CNN,” analysts for New Street Research wrote in a report Thursday. Stephenson said in December 2016, when AT&T was integrating the DirecTV purchase, “We did DirecTV not because we love satellite technology, but because it gave us access to some premium content.” It’s a refrain both he and his deputy and heir apparent, John Stankey, have repeatedly recited. But the subsequent $102 billion acquisition of WarnerMedia gave AT&T all the premium content it needs. DirecTV is just a distraction now. (1) Ergen also plays a key role in the T-Mobile-Sprint merger trial. The carriers were required by the Justice Department to divest certain assets to Dish so that it can enter the wireless market and foster competition.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-09-23,"The price action for the last two months is a perfect representation of the opportunity and risk behind Nokia (NYSE:NOK). On one hand, you have the societally and economically transformative potential of the 5G network bolstering the longer-term argument for Nokia stock. But on the other hand, fundamental and competitive risks cloud that narrative.Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com In July of this year, I voiced my doubts about Nokia stock. Primarily, I cited the lack of technical enthusiasm as a risk factor. Although the company has been wheeling and dealing, securing contracts with big players like China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and BT Group (NYSE:BT), the enthusiasm had failed to reflect themselves into the equity value. As a result, NOK stock has been rangebound since the spring of 2016. Naturally, this doesn't inspire confidence.  * 7 Triple-'F' Rated Stocks to Leave on the Shelf However, I was quickly proven wrong. In Nokia's second quarter of 2019 earnings report, the telecom firm produced a surprising beat. While consensus forecasts called for earnings per share of 0.03 euros, NOK delivered 0.05 euros. Moreover, the company generated $6.34 billion in revenue, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter the disclosure, the Nokia stock price skyrocketed (though not enough to break NOK out of its 3-year trading range).But it wasn't just the print that satisfied investors. In past years, Nokia's business along with the competition soured after 4G network sales peak. But with the 5G rollout, the new technology offers a fresh cycle for telecom firms. That's what Nokia's results confirmed, justifying the spike in NOK stock.Still, the bullishness was short lived. Nokia stock plummeted and has only recently started to look alive. So, which narrative is going to win out? Tailwinds for NOK Stock Are Interesting, but so Are the RisksUndoubtedly, the 5G narrative for NOK stock is alluring. As InvestorPlace contributor Theodore Kim pointed out, we're in the early stages of a global rollout. As he put it:The market for 5G will likely not take off until 2020. But when it does, users across the globe will need a brand new 5G standard smartphone. Carriers will sink billions into new 5G equipment. And Nokia will be positioned front and center in offering the new hardware across the globe.As a standard is established for this next-generation tech, only Nokia and Huawei will find themselves with comprehensive product and service solutions. But as we all know, Huawei is at the heart of a security debate that has underlined the U.S.-China trade war. The U.S. accuses Huawei of being a conduit for China-sponsored espionage.Of course, that benefits NOK stock, at least on the public relations front. No one is accusing the company of any such breach of trust. More importantly, this controversy gives Nokia an opportunity to work some uncontested deals.But the problem here is that they're not uncontested. Yes, 5G is a transformative innovation, one that augurs well for NOK stock. But it also provides the same opportunities for the competition. For example, regional rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) isn't going to stand by and let Nokia have all the fun.From a share price perspective, both telecom stocks have similar dynamics, largely going rangebound over the last few years. Both are eager to capitalize on the 5G rollout. As such, a risk exists that the two will engage in a price war, which would hurt profit margins.Plus, a recession in Europe would exacerbate this possible contentious situation. 5G Isn't Exactly PerfectAlthough I'm bullish on many companies that are levered to the 5G rollout, it's important to realize that it's not a panacea for underperforming organizations.While the tech generates excitement, the rollout itself has been somewhat slow. A big part of that is the expense involved in upgrading equipment to accommodate the new signals. Also, because the 5G waves are shorter and more intense, they require different cell infrastructure compared to 4G.Ironically, another costly factor is security. With or without Huawei, 5G requires advanced network safety protocols. That eats into profitability, negatively impacting companies that are fiscally sensitive.Overall, though, you cannot dismiss the excitement factor of the rollout. Thus, we could very well see the kind of momentum that lifted Nokia stock following Q2. But it's also fair to bring up the long-term wildness in NOK. It really hasn't earned investor trust.  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 Therefore, if you want to speculate on the emotions of 5G -- and not necessarily its fundamentals -- I must say that shares look interesting. That said, do make sure to pocket profits. The longer-term charts tell us that this will probably not be an easy ride.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Sprint Corp. dropped after a Democratic member of the Republican-majority Federal Communications Commission called for delay in considering the company’s merger with T-Mobile US Inc.Commissioner Geoffrey Starks reacted after the agency said Sprint had claimed payments for 885,000 subscribers to a subsidized phone service, even though those people weren’t using the system.“This raises questions about character and the thoroughness of our record,” Starks said in a tweet. “The merger should be paused until we figure this out.”The FCC is considering T-Mobile’s proposed $26.5 billion purchase of Sprint. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has recommended the agency approve the deal, and two other members of the five-person commission have said they are likely to go along. The agency is in the midst of a closed-door voting period that could last until late September.States are suing to block the deal combining the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, arguing that it will decrease competition and raise prices. The deal’s backers say it will quickly bring advanced 5G networks and raise a stronger rival to leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Sprint on Tuesday said it made an error adjusting to new rules surrounding the program for federally subsidized phone service. “We are committed to reimbursing federal and state governments for any subsidy payments that were collected as a result of the error,” Lisa Belot, a spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.Sprint dropped almost 4%, and was down 20 cents, or 2.96%, at 2:02 p.m. in New York.In its statement about the subsidy program known as Lifeline, the FCC said payments to those not using the system represented nearly 30% of Sprint’s subscribers to the program.“It’s outrageous that a company would claim millions of taxpayer dollars for doing nothing,” Pai said in the statement. “This shows a careless disregard for program rules and American taxpayers.”Pai said he had asked the agency’s enforcement bureau to investigate.Tina Pelkey, a spokeswoman for the FCC, didn’t respond to a request for comment.(Updates with Sprint statement in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Sprint Drops After Democrat on FCC Calls for Pause of Merger

2019-09-25,"(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed merger with Sprint Corp. remains on hold at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, where most commissioners have yet to vote upon the $26.5 billion deal even though the agency chairman asked for a vote in August.The inaction means the agency isn’t likely to conclude its review of the deal until October, because of delays built into its procedures. Passage is expected because all three Republicans who comprise a majority at the agency have spoken in favor of the deal.T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed not to close their deal until after a verdict in a multistate lawsuit, where trial is set for early December. The states say the combination of national wireless carriers will decrease competition and raise prices. The deal’s backers say it will quickly bring advanced 5G networks and create a stronger rival to leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.At the FCC, a deadline for action of almost three weeks would kick in once three of the five FCC commissioners vote in favor of a deal. The commissioners vote electronically in a shared system. The deadline period hasn’t commenced, meaning there hasn’t been a third positive vote, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.Pai voted for the deal as he sent it to commissioners on Aug. 14, the FCC said. Pai’s fellow Republican Michael O’Rielly in an interview Tuesday said he had voted. O’Rielly declined to say whether he had voted in favor. In May he spoke in favor of the deal.With those two decisions tallied, focus is turning to Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who in May issued a formal statement supporting the deal.Carr and an aide have been in contact with T-Mobile representatives at least nine times since Pai asked for a vote, according to FCC disclosure filings. The documents offer limited insights into the discussions, for instance saying topics included “network and economic modeling” and issues “relevant to the Commission’s public interest and competition inquiries.”Carr’s office didn’t respond to an email or phone call seeking comment. Tina Pelkey, a spokeswoman for the FCC, declined to comment on timing for a vote.Calculating when the FCC must vote is complex. According to a blog post by O’Rielly last year, deadlines begin to kick in only if an item has awaited a vote for 21 days. At that point, a vote in favor by three members commences a countdown clock that initially sets a deadline of 12 days. The deadline can be extended seven days upon a commissioner’s request. In a further wrinkle, the initial 12-day deadline usually doesn’t commence until the Friday after the third vote appears in the internal system the FCC uses. O’Rielly’s blog post pleaded for a simplified, speedier system.T-Mobile declined to comment, and Sprint didn’t immediately reply to a query.The FCC on Tuesday said Sprint had claimed payments for 885,000 subscribers to a subsidized phone service, even though those people weren’t using the system. The claim may slow but won’t threaten FCC approval of the merger, Matthew Schettenhelm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note.“The issue won’t cause FCC Republicans to block the deal, yet they may force a significant settlement before they approve,” Schettenhelm said in the note. Approval is expected during the fourth quarter of this year, he said.&#92;--With assistance from Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",T-Mobile-Sprint Deal May Linger Into October as FCC Vote Is Slow

2019-09-27,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is tapping Marcelo Claure to help turn around WeWork, after ousting co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann from the corner office earlier this week.Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, WeWork’s largest investor, has asked the former chief executive officer of Sprint Corp. to take a more hands-on role helping oversee a cleanup of the office-rental company from his position at SoftBank, said people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. No decision has been made on his exact role, the people said.Claure will help WeWork’s new leadership identify revenue and cost-saving opportunities, one of the people said.Representatives for WeWork, SoftBank and Claure declined to comment.In Claure, Son would be tapping an executive with a track record of fixing companies and overseeing his firm’s investments.The 48-year-old joined SoftBank in 2013, when the Japanese firm bought Brightstar, a phone distribution company Claure ran. Son tapped him in 2014 to run Sprint, which he helped turn around prior to the company’s pending sale to rival T-Mobile US Inc. He remains executive chairman of Sprint.Claure is currently chief operating officer of SoftBank Group, CEO of its international operations and a member of its board. He also oversees the firm’s $5 billion technology fund focused on Latin America, which it launched this year.After clashing with Rajeev Misra, head of the Vision Fund, the firm’s $100 billion investment vehicle, Claure changed his role at SoftBank, Bloomberg reported in February. Claure, already chief operating officer of SoftBank Group, was tasked with leading a new Latin America investment fund and helping Vision Fund companies expand into that region. He retained his duties overseeing SoftBank Group assets such as asset manager Fortress Investment Group, Sprint Corp., ARM Holdings Plc and WeWork.Neumann stepped down as chief executive officer of WeWork this week under pressure from SoftBank and other backers. Neumann was named non-executive chairman while senior WeWork executives Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson were appointed co-CEOs.The management shake-up came after WeWork’s plan to raise $3 billion in an initial public offering this month disintegrated over corporate governance concerns and boardroom drama.We Co., WeWork’s parent company, has likely delayed its IPO until 2020, people familiar with the mater said this week.(Updates with background in eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Nabila Ahmed and Gillian Tan.To contact the reporters on this story: Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Giles Turner in London at gturner35@bloomberg.net;Sarah McBride in San Francisco at smcbride24@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Hauck at dhauck1@bloomberg.net, ;Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Liana BakerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Plans to Name Former Sprint Boss to Help Fix WeWork

2019-10-04,"For investors, a little can go a long way. That's the theory behind investing in small-cap stocks. These stocks have the ability to beat large-cap stocks over time … if you know which of these stocks to buy.One of the reasons for this is because of their relatively low price. When these companies have even small increases in revenue, it can have a significant impact on their sales and profit. And since these companies typically have a lower stock price, a small movement of just a few dollars in their price can be a 20% or higher positive return on their investment.The end of the calendar year is a time for investors to take stock of where their portfolio is, and where they want it to go. We've identified five small-cap stocks that look to finish out the year in style. Some of these companies have seen growth this year that has outpaced that of the S&P 500, and represents a much smaller investment on our part.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy for Young Investors So without further explanation, let's take a look at five small-cap stocks to buy as we get ready to put a wrap on 2019. Best Small-Cap Stocks to Buy This Year: LivePerson, Inc. (LPSN)Source: Shutterstock If you've ever had a &quot;live chat&quot; online and realized that you weren't talking to a real person, you've probably been exposed to LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) technology. The company uses artificial intelligence to deal with customer relations management. The company calls their technology &quot;conversational commerce&quot; and it allows businesses to interact with their customers at a fraction of the cost of using live agents.LivePerson serves the needs of two demographics (milennials and Gen Z) who prefer messaging to human conversation. The company currently works with over 18,000 businesses, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Delta (NYSE:DAL) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). LivePerson is one of the best performing stocks on the market regardless of size. It is up nearly 100% year-to-date.In the most recent quarter, the company announced that it signed more deals than it had in all of 2018, and recent comments from the company's CEO Rob Locascio indicate the addressable market is continuing to grow. To capture this market, the LPSN is adding to its sales team, which will add to the company's expenses in the short term. However, the company forecasts year-over-year growth in the high teens for this year and 20% growth in 2020. The company generated $249.8 million in revenue, which is up 14% from 2017. Telaria, Inc. (TLRA)Source: Shutterstock The trend toward consumers cutting the cord is having an effect on how advertising is delivered. Which is where Telaria (NYSE:TLRA) comes in. Telaria delivers digital video solutions that address mobile, over-the-top and connected TV (CTV) content.For the past two years, Telaria has been a revenue-generating machine. Their revenue on CTV devices increased 322% year-over-year in 2018. As of March of this year, revenue from CTV devices accounted for almost 1/3 of their revenue. And the company is forecasting an increased demand for their tools, allowing them to capture more market share.  * 7 Stocks to Buy From the Harvard Endowment The share price took a recent tumble, but with the revenue the company is generating, this may have been a case where the market got ahead of itself. What is more intriguing about the stock is that the consensus analyst expectation is for the company to turn a profit in 2020. This would require a growth rate of approximately 68%. While this may be a little optimistic, the company has a clean balance sheet with regard to debt and certainly looks like a low risk for investors who are concerned about investing in a company that has yet to post a profit. Callaway Golf (ELY)Source: Shutterstock The good news for Callaway Golf (NYSE:ELY) is that they have high brand equity. They are one of the most recognized golfing brands. And their &quot;[e]quipment and golf balls account for over 60% of its revenue.&quot; What has some investors concerned is the added debt the company has accumulated as they've tried to grow through acquisition.However, this debt appears to represent an opportunity for ELY to increase its exposure in other markets. That has been the case with their acquisition of Jack Wolfskin that increased its presence in China and Central Europe. As of March, revenue outside the United States accounted for over 50% of its sales.Furthermore, the company has a solid balance sheet with a gross margin in &quot;the high 40% range.&quot; Callaway also has positive trailing-12-month net income of $90 million of net income through the first quarter of this year. Recently Raymond James raised its rating on ELY stock to an Outperform from Market Perform. The analyst firm also raised its price target for Callaway to $21, which would give the stock about a 15% bump from its current level. Instructure (INST)Source:  PRONEC Corporation via FlickrWhen you're looking to invest in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, you want to see that they have well-established products. Instructure (NYSE:INST) has two products that should be able to provide solid, repeatable revenue for the company. Its main product, Canvas, is widely used in the higher education market. And their newest product, Bridge, is starting to catch on with corporations.  * 7 Next-Generation Healthcare Stocks to Buy But Instructure has a wide range of software products that are being used by over 4,000 colleges, universities and K-12 school systems. And each client pays the company thousands to millions of dollars. Even better news for the company is a net revenue retention rate that exceeded 100% in 2018. In fact, revenue from recurring subscriptions is over 90% of INST's sales. And sales saw a 30% YoY increase to $210 million in 2018. The combination of the education and corporate markets gives the company an estimated $15 billion addressable market. Institutional investors are buying large volumes of shares from the company as well signaling that the stock may be on the verge of a breakout.  Freshpet (FRPT)Source: Shutterstock Rounding out our list of small-cap stocks to look at for the remainder of 2019 is Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT). In case you haven't noticed, the pet industry is big business. The math is simple and favorable. There are over 300 million pets in America. The dog- and cat-food retail market is valued at over $30 billion with a compounded annual rate of growth of 6%.That's the pool that Freshpet is swimming in. But they're not just swimming, they're disrupting the market. Freshpet supplies refrigerated, fresh food options by providing refrigerators in over 20,000 retail outlets. That was a 10% YoY increase. Sales are estimated to increase by 24% in 2019.The company's stock was punished after it posted a second-quarter loss that was larger than expected. There was also some concern about contracting margins. However, for a long-term growth stock like Freshpet, increasing revenue should be the priority for investors. That has been the driver for a stock price that has tripled over the last three years. According to CEO Billy Cyr, &quot;Our second-quarter results demonstrate continued momentum behind our Feed the Growth strategy. Our strategic advertising investment drove our strongest gains in household penetration and retail availability in several years, giving us tremendous confidence that Freshpet is still in the puppy stage…with significant growth ahead.&quot;As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-04,"(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed merger with Sprint Corp. has received a third “yes” vote at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, moving the deal toward agency approval in coming days, according to two people familiar with the matter.All three Republicans on the five-member agency have voted for the deal, setting in motion procedures that would require agency action by Oct. 9, or Oct. 16 if an extension is requested by a commissioner, the people said. Neither agency Democrat has cast a vote, and both have called for delay.The third “yes” came from Commissioner Brendan Carr, according to the people, who spoke on condition they not be identified because the voting is conducted behind closed doors. Carr in May issued a formal statement supporting the deal.Carr’s office on Friday didn’t immediately respond to an email or phone call seeking comment. Tina Pelkey, a spokeswoman for the FCC, declined to comment. Sprint declined to comment.Sprint rose 14 cents, or 2.4%, to $6.10 and T-Mobile was up 93 cents, or 1.2%, to $77.95 at 11:54 a.m. New York time.T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed not to close their deal until after a verdict in a multistate lawsuit, where trial is set for early December. The states say the combination of national wireless carriers will decrease competition and raise prices. The deal’s backers say it will quickly bring advanced 5G networks and create a stronger rival to leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Groups including Consumer Reports, the Communications Workers of America union and the Rural Wireless Association in a filing Friday asked the FCC to pause its review. They said the agency needs to fully investigate its accusation that Sprint improperly accepted subsidy payments.The FCC on Sept. 24 said Sprint had claimed payments for 885,000 subscribers, even though those people weren’t using the system. Pai told the FCC’s enforcement bureau determine the extent of the problem and propose a remedy.The claim may slow but won’t threaten FCC approval of the merger, Matthew Schettenhelm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note.(Updates with call to pause consideration in seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Justin BlumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Gets Majority Support at FCC

2019-10-07,"(Bloomberg) -- A federal court’s decision Monday to force President Donald Trump to turn over his tax returns may have ramifications outside of politics, and turn out to be a signal on how a judge may rule in the multistate lawsuit seeking to block T-Mobile US Inc.’s purchase of Sprint Corp.Judge Victor Marrero’s ruling on Trump’s taxes suggests that when he presides over the telecom mega-merger, he may not defer to the Department of Justice and Federal Communication Commission’s support for the phone company combination, New Street analyst Blair Levin said in an email. Instead, he will rule on the law when the court hearing about the deal begins in early December in Washington, and it may not be so predictable.“For those on Wall Street -- and there were many -- who believed that the judge was likely to defer to the judgment of the DOJ (and FCC), today’s ruling should be a data point to rethink that view,” said Levin, a former FCC chief of staff. “Today’s ruling suggests to me he is a very thorough, thoughtful judge whose decision will be carefully grounded in the law and facts. Reasonable minds can differ as to where that will lead him in the antitrust trial, but simple deference to the DOJ’s conclusion is not the likely path.”Levin’s assessment is similar to that of attorney Matthew Cantor, who told the New Street analyst last month that while the judge will weigh evidence about the DOJ and FCC decisions, he’s unlikely to defer to those agencies.To contact the reporter on this story: Joshua Fineman in New York at jfineman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Brad OlesenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Sprint Deal Watchers Should Look at Trump Tax Ruling for Clues

2019-10-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Masayoshi Son could be on track for the biggest triumph of his career. Or the biggest failure. His decision to jump in and save a drowning unicorn, WeWork, goes against the precepts of the SoftBank Vision Fund that he founded, and could cause reputational damage worth more than the billions of dollars in this one deal.SoftBank Group Corp. may get control of the troubled office-rental startup as part of a financing package that could relieve a looming cash crunch, Bloomberg News reported. Directors of The We Co. may soon choose one of two options: a SoftBank takeover, or a debt package led by JPMorgan Chase & Co.Actually running one of the fund’s portfolio companies would be a grave step for a man entrusted to manage $100 billion of investors’ capital. Such a move goes beyond doubling-down on a flailing investment in a single company and would saddle Son’s team with a task the fund wasn’t set up to tackle.  That puts at risk not just shareholder money, but the status of the Vision Fund and its mastermind, Son himself.WeWork was one of the world’s hottest companies before its IPO prospectus revealed it was burning cash and had a complicated shareholding structure that overly favored its founder and chairman, Adam Neumann. Public investors balked, forcing the company to shelve a planned listing. That brought its valuation crashing down, to as little as $15 billion from $47 billion.In late September, there was talk that SoftBank would give WeWork more cash in return for a reduced price at which it acquires stock. That deal would have made sense, allowing Son and his investors to enjoy a wider upside from an eventual exit, or at the very least narrow any downside from a worsening valuation.Having sunk as much as $10 billion in WeWork, it’s understandable that Son and his team want to do all they can to save it.Engineering the exit of Neumann, as SoftBank successfully did, is not tantamount to re-engineering the company and its troubled business model. This is likely the beginning of an ugly cleanup, as my colleague Shira Ovide wrote. But that doesn’t mean SoftBank should be the one to do the dirty work.It’s normal for a startup's investors to offer advice, make introductions, or even force change. It’s highly unusual for a venture capital vehicle to then become the parent company, tasking itself with being the turnaround merchant. That’s the realm of private equity and takes a different skill set. It also takes a lot of time and management resources.Son’s desire to be a savior may be strong. His 2012 takeover of U.S. telecommunications company Sprint Corp. is one of the most notable examples. But Vision Fund investors may also take it as a warning: Sprint remains unprofitable. It has also taken up a lot of management time as SoftBank executives worked to find a buyer — Sprint now plans to merge with T-Mobile USA — and then regulators to allow the deal to go through.As big as WeWork is, that investment is just 10% of the Vision Fund. Yet VC investing returns aren’t measured in percentage points, but multiples. The Vision Fund should be able to write off WeWork in its entirety and still post solid profits. It also means that expending an inordinate amount of time, and reputation, on one investee is not in the best interests of the Vision Fund’s other 82 portfolio companies, nor its investors.Of course, there may be another strategy: Keep WeWork on life-support just long enough to raise the second Vision Fund. Plans for this sequel already look shaky. Would-be backers seem to be having second thoughts and SoftBank is reported to have leaned on its own employees to take out loans to fund personal investments. The WeWork debacle isn’t making the Vision Fund 2 an easy sell.The reputations of Son and the Vision Fund needn't be made or broken by one deal. Sure, a successful turnaround could do wonders. But it seems more likely that negative headlines will keep coming for years and gradually erode Son and SoftBank’s mystique. This hill isn't worth dying on.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-10-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.China’s phone carriers offered discounts to subscribers after switching on the world’s largest 5G network Thursday, seeking to spur growth for an ultra-fast wireless system that’s key to technology supremacy. The country’s three wireless operators need to attract users to help pay for infrastructure they’ve spent more than $43 billion on in this year alone. While the technology is essential for developing industrial applications expected to drive a new digital economy, its faster speeds and lower lag times may be less compelling for consumers than previous upgrades.On the launch day of fifth-generation services in Beijing’s financial district, stores were quiet as carriers said they expect more users to sign up online.On the Twitter-like Weibo, “5G launching in 50 cities” and “5G package prices” were among the top-20 trending topics. But some Chinese consumers are balking at the high prices for handsets and service plans.“I don’t have money to buy a 5G phone, or to pay for a plan,” said Weibo user Yuanyao. “Too expensive. I can’t afford it,” said another named XBACK-No fear.Smartphone SupremacyWhile carriers look to lure more users to pay up for faster services, China’s handset makers also stand to benefit from fast uptake.Huawei Technologies Co., which also supplies the biggest slice of 5G network equipment, saw its smartphone market share jump to 42% in the third quarter, up from around 25% a year ago, according to research firm Canalys. It has already introduced several 5G models, as have Chinese brands including ZTE, Xiaomi and Vivo.Luring users to the world’s largest 5G networks may also help Chinese handset makers increase their global market share. Samsung Electronics Co. is the world’s top seller of smartphones, followed by Huawei. and Apple Inc.Huawei has already debuted models that work on the super-fast network in the U.K. and other markets in addition to China. On Wednesday, the Nikkei reported that Apple is telling suppliers that it expects to ship at least 80 million iPhones with 5G wireless modems next year.5G DealsAs of Thursday, China Mobile Ltd. was offering discounts of as much as 30% for users that pre-registered for 5G. Consumers buying 5G handsets from the carrier will get as much as 600 yuan ($85) off and gifts worth 699 yuan, the biggest operator by users said in a statement.China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., the No. 3 carrier, and No. 2 China Telecom Corp. are also offering similar discounts to pre-registered users, along with other discounts and gifts via online lotteries and through their branches throughout the country.South Korea’s wireless carriers were the first to offer commercial 5G services, with SK Telecom Co. launching its network in April and Samsung already offering a 5G-enabled smartphone. Total 5G subscribers have surpassed 3 million in the country, although consumer reaction has been mixed.The faster network’s coverage was initially incomplete, leaving users to fall back on 4G more than some had expected, especially when using the service indoors.South Korean carriers SK Telecom Co., KT Corp. and LG Uplus Corp., have also sought to entice new users to adopt the technology, offering trade-ins and incentives that slash the price of new 5G phones to less than $200 from sticker prices of as much as $1,000. The subsidies have declined as the rollout expanded, said Kim Hee Sup, vice president at SK Telecom.“It’s true that the speed and coverage of 5G didn’t meet consumers’ expectations in early days,” said Kim Hee Sup, a vice president at South Korea’s largest carrier SK Telecom. “Now, the 5G service is rapidly improving as carriers are expanding the roll-out.”T-Mobile US Inc. earlier this week said it will flip on a nationwide 5G service by year end. Still, the carrier doesn’t offer yet offer a 5G compatible device yet and the service will be available only on one band of airwaves they are calling the “foundational layer,” with more layers of spectrum to come.The largest U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc. launched 5G in April and has promised to have it available in parts of 30 cities this year. Rival AT&T Inc. has 5G in areas of 21 cities and plans to offer 5G nationwide by mid 2020. Sprint Inc., which has limited 5G available in nine cities, has promised a superior 5G network if its $26.5 billion merger with T-Mobile is approved.&#92;--With assistance from Sohee Kim and Scott Moritz.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Shirley Zhao in Hong Kong at xzhao306@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Nagarajan at samnagarajan@bloomberg.net, Dave McCombs, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",China Offers 5G Discounts in Race to Scale Biggest Network

2019-11-05,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Communications Commission formally blessed T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed purchase of Sprint Corp., publishing the decision approved by commissioners in a closed-door vote last month.The combination of the wireless carriers still needs to clear a court challenge brought by states. It was approved by the FCC on a 3-to-2 Republican-led vote on Oct. 16, but publication of the order was delayed.“The transaction will help secure United States leadership in 5G, close the digital divide in rural America, and enhance competition in the broadband market,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said Tuesday in a statement.The $26.5 billion deal won Justice Department approval in July as the carriers agreed to sell airwaves to Dish Network Corp. to create a new fourth wireless company and new competitor once Sprint is eliminated as a choice for consumers.T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed not to close their deal until after a decision in a multistate lawsuit. A trial is set for early December.Next HurdleThe states say the combination of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless providers will decrease competition and raise prices in a market that’s already concentrated. The deal’s backers say it will quickly bring advanced 5G networks and create a stronger rival to leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.The FCC, in its order, rejected claims the deal would harm consumers.“The transaction would not substantially lessen competition,” the FCC said in the order, in part because low-cost provider Boost Mobile will be divested to Dish, which also receives network access and retail stores to form a new competitor,Two FCC Democrats voted against the merger, saying it’s bad for consumers.“The most likely effect of this merger will be higher prices and fewer options for all Americans,” Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said in an emailed statement. “It will establish a market of three giant wireless carriers with every incentive to divide up the market, increase prices and compete only for the most lucrative customers.”T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere -- who remade T-Mobile into a maverick competitor by eliminating annual contracts and offering unlimited data plans -- disputes that prices will go up.

2019-11-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Radio technology that’s critical to helping utility workers deal with California wildfires is at the heart of a trial that pits an iconic American brand against a Chinese firm accused of corporate espionage.Motorola Solutions Inc. wants a federal jury in Chicago to order its Chinese rival Hytera Communications Corp. to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages over what it claims was stolen know-how related to two-way radios used by utility workers, construction crews, school officials and others.The case is the latest instance of an American company accusing a Chinese firm of stealing ideas or acting on behalf of China’s communist leaders. Huawei Technologies Co. is facing criminal charges that it stole phone-testing information from T-Mobile US Inc..Complaints about theft of intellectual property have been a key issue in President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. Congress has placed limits on the Defense Department’s use of components from Chinese companies including Huawei and Hytera.Motorola Solutions, based in Chicago, contends that Hytera, its former distributor, hired away workers as part of a plan to steal technology and compete in the market for digital radios. The systems enable two-way communications even in dire situations like the wildfires in California or other disasters where radio towers are not working properly.“We believe that Hytera’s unlawful acts create an unfair playing field and threaten the industry’s ability to innovate, ultimately hurting customers,” said Motorola Solutions General Counsel Mark Hacker.Hytera in turn has accused Motorola Solutions of abusing its superior market power to hobble competition, and has an antitrust lawsuit pending against the bigger company.“While Hytera seeks only fair competition based on innovation, Motorola Solutions continues to try only to drive out competitors, doing everything from forcing radio dealers to drop competitors’ products, to emailing our dealers and customers with blatant misinformation,” the company said in a statement.The dispute is over commercially-available radios, not those used by firefighters and police.Hytera, founded in 1993, was a distributor of Motorola products until 2001 when it began selling its own analog radios. According to Motorola Solutions, the analog products “faced extinction” with a U.S. Federal Communications Commission regulation regarding radio systems used by businesses that forced a switch to digital technology.Digital RadioMotorola Solutions introduced its digital radios in 2006, with features like hands-free communications, location functionality, emergency alarms for workers in distress and the ability to connect a phone user with a group of radio users.In 2008, Hytera hired three Motorola Solutions engineers who had worked at the company’s Malaysia facility. Hytera contends it didn’t know the three men had downloaded thousands of pages of internal Motorola Solutions documents until after the suit was filed. The men left Hytera last year.Hytera said the supposed secrets Motorola Solutions says were stolen were publicly known and were just part of the Digital Mobile Radio standard. Hytera conceded certain lines of source code were copied, but says it was so little that it didn’t amount to an infringement.Three WeeksSince Hytera’s radios first came out in 2010, Motorola Solutions waited far too long to bring suit on the trade secrets claims, the Chinese company said. Motorola Solutions said it sued in 2017 as soon as it figured out what had happened.The trial before District Judge Charles Norgle is expected to last at least three weeks.The Chinese government has focused efforts on transforming the Asian nation into a global leader in technology, investing billions of dollars in research in key industries. The past two U.S. administrations have said that push encouraged Chinese companies to steal American and European ideas to meet those goals.The fight between Motorola Solutions and Hytera spans the globe, with legal cases in the U.S., China, Germany and Australia. Motorola Solutions won an order that limited imports of some Hytera radios, though it didn’t affect current models.The case is Motorola Solutions Inc. v. Hytera Communications Corp., 17-1973, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).To contact the reporter on this story: Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Dispute Erupts Over Radios Utility Workers Use in California Wildfires

2019-11-11,"Nov.11 -- WeWork has held discussions with T-Mobile US Inc.’s John Legere as a potential chief executive officer of the troubled co-working company, said two people familiar with the matter. Legere is one of several people under consideration, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Bloomberg Intelligence's John Butler has more on &quot;Bloomberg Markets.&quot;",What John Legere Would Bring to WeWork as CEO
2019-11-11,"(Bloomberg) -- WeWork is searching for a new chief executive officer to turn around the troubled co-working company, said people familiar with the matter. The candidates include T-Mobile US Inc. head John Legere, who has spoken with WeWork about the role, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.Legere has deep ties to WeWork majority shareholder SoftBank Group Corp., which took ownership of the company after WeWork’s initial public offering broke down. Legere is currently pushing for a contentious merger of his wireless carrier with Sprint Corp., whose majority owner is SoftBank. Sprint’s executive chairman, Marcelo Claure, was recently appointed to the same position at WeWork.But people familiar with the CEO search stressed that WeWork intends to consider many candidates. Although Legere breathed new life into T-Mobile, he has an unpredictable and antagonistic public persona, reflected on his Twitter profile and in conference appearances. He’s also another man, in a company so saturated with male management that Claure has promised to increase diversity.Representatives for SoftBank, T-Mobile and WeWork parent company We Co. declined to comment. The discussions with Legere were reported earlier Monday by the Wall Street Journal. Shares of T-Mobile fell about 2% in intraday trading, while Sprint is down 3%.Adam Neumann, the former WeWork CEO, stepped down in September under pressure from investors over apparent conflicts of interest and mismanagement of the IPO process. Two WeWork executives, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, took over as co-CEOs. The pair secured multimillion-dollar severance packages with the board last month.Despite getting rescue financing from SoftBank a couple weeks ago, WeWork needs to quickly rehabilitate the business and fill empty space in its offices. The company is expected to soon dismiss thousands of employees.Legere and Claure, a SoftBank executive tasked with cleaning up WeWork, have occasionally sparred in the past. Claure, the former CEO of Sprint, was a T-Mobile antagonist before becoming a potential merger partner. In 2016, he called Legere “a con artist” on Twitter. At one point, Legere told Claure to “go back to the kiddie pool.” But more recently, the two executives have appeared friendlier as they argue in favor of the Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up. In May, they were spotted jogging together in Washington.Meanwhile, Neumann is exploring a potential next act with help from the money he got in his exit from WeWork. He considered investing in Barneys New York Inc. during the luxury department store’s recent bankruptcy, people with knowledge of the matter said Monday.(Updates with shares in the fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Gillian Tan and Scott Moritz.To contact the reporters on this story: Sarah McBride in San Francisco at smcbride24@bloomberg.net;Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",WeWork Has Talked With T-Mobile’s Legere in Search for New CEO

2019-11-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- John Legere may be exactly the kind of CEO WeWork needs. He brings much of the eccentricity and charisma that was initially appreciated about ousted founder Adam Neumann, but without all the headaches and liabilities. Is Legere ready to retire his closet of magenta T-shirts? We Co., the parent of the beleaguered office-sharing startup, is in discussions to recruit Legere, the current head of wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc., as its next CEO,  the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The talks come after WeWork’s plans for an initial public offering imploded in grand fashion in recent weeks, as a litany of questionable decisions and conflicts of interests involving then-CEO Neumann came to light in a saga that has captivated Wall Street. WeWork, for a short time one of the world’s most valuable startups, had said in its summer IPO prospectus that its “future success depends in large part on the continued service of Adam Neumann.” Weeks later, Neumann was considered such a risk that the company decided it was better to effectively give him $1.2 billion to step away.Hiring Legere would immediately help improve WeWork’s tarnished reputation, though repairing the business is another story. Office vacancies increased in the third quarter, and the company was at risk of running out of cash next year. Legere’s garish style and hectoring on Twitter may also cause some to wonder whether he’s just another Neumann; it’s certainly hard not to notice the physical resemblance between the long hair, loud personality and signature T-shirt-and-sports-coat pairing.But few CEOs can say they’ve taken on a challenge as difficult as reviving T-Mobile — and succeeded. That’s Legere’s claim to fame. As I wrote in July 2018, even the groaners who are tired of his shtick and Twitter snark can’t argue against his track record.When Legere became CEO of T-Mobile in 2012, it was a distant fourth-place competitor in the U.S. wireless market and losing customers. Now it’s the fastest-growing member of the industry, and its displaced Sprint as the No. 3 carrier. T-Mobile’s lower-priced plans and marketing mojo have even given AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. a run for their money. In the last five years, shares of all its closest rivals advanced anywhere from 12% to 21%. T-Mobile’s nearly tripled. Legere may seem like an odd choice given that he’s spent his career working in the telecommunications and technology industries. The connection becomes clearer when considering SoftBank Group Corp.’s role. The Japanese conglomerate built by billionaire Masayoshi Son not only controls WeWork — the result of a $9.5 billion rescue package — but also Sprint Corp., T-Mobile’s closest competitor and hopeful merger partner. Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure, who is also chief operating officer of SoftBank, was tapped to help fix WeWork’s problems. He’s spent a lot of time with Legere these last two years as they worked to sway federal and state officials to support the merger of the two wireless carriers. Legere has done with T-Mobile what Claure and his predecessors couldn’t with Sprint, even as SoftBank injected billions along the way. One might think that WeWork would seek out a lower-profile leader, given the roller-coaster it has been on the past few months; Legere is anything but that. And at 61 years old, it’s a little surprising that he would consider following up such a successful run at T-Mobile with a stint at a company as troubled as WeWork. T-Mobile has become part of his identity — he’s spotted in magenta T-Mobile gear whether he’s going for runs in New York City or filming his Facebook Live cooking show from his kitchen. T-Mobile shareholders wouldn't be happy to see Legere go. Worse, there's the appearance of a conflict of interest if SoftBank is pursuing Legere while the companies are separately renegotiating the terms of the Sprint merger.That aside, it’s clear that Legere likes a challenge, and WeWork is the ultimate one.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

The wireless competition headwind was moderating, the 5G boom was coming, HBO Max would spark a rebound in the video business and the valuation on AT&T stock was simply too cheap to ignore.Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com Fast forward to present day. We are now less than two months from the end of 2019, and AT&T stock is up an impressive 40% year-to-date. Even if shares went sideways over the next two months, 2019 would mark the best annual performance for the stock since 2006.The big question now -- can AT&T stock stay in rally mode?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI think so.Going back to the four reasons to be bullish on T stock for 2019 and 2020, all four of those reasons remain relevant today. To be sure, one of them (a cheap valuation) is becoming increasingly less relevant. At some point, the valuation on T stock will fully reflect the reality that the fundamentals here are improving.But, that point hasn't come yet. Instead, it appears that there's still another ~10% upside left before the valuation on the stock maxes out.Given this, AT&T stock should stay in rally mode for now.

Thus, now that they are one company, the industry has eliminated 50% of the companies that were leading the price cutting. Going forward, then, promotional activity across the whole industry should be less severe, and pricing trends should broadly improve.At the same time, as opposed to playing defense, AT&T is now playing offense on the price-cutting front. They recently announced a wave of price cuts to their unlimited data offerings. In so doing, AT&T is recognizing that price cutting isn't over, so they are doing the price cutting on their own terms. Doing so on your own terms should help mitigate the margin impact of the cuts.Big picture, across most fronts, it appears AT&T's big pricing headwinds which have plagued the wireless business over the past several years, are moderating in an important way. The 5G Boom Is Still ComingCalendar 2019 was the year of niche 5G testing, and 2020 will be the year when 5G goes from niche to mainstream. This transition will ultimately provide a big lift to AT&T's wireless business, and AT&T stock.The logic is pretty simple. By itself, 5G is going to be huge. Not only will it make every internet-connected device faster, but it will also enable a whole new generation of internet-connected devices (think smart appliances, smart apparel, etc.). As such, 5G will provide a lift to the whole internet service provider (ISP) industry.But, it will provide an especially big tailwind for large ISPs. Why? Because large ISPs, like AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), have the most resources to allocate toward 5G deployment, and so they reasonably project as the leaders of the 5G revolution. Thus, when 5G goes mainstream next year, AT&T and Verizon will likely have very good 5G offerings, while everyone else will have sub-par offerings.This &quot;de-commoditization&quot; of the wireless coverage industry will force customers out of cheaper plans at T-Mobile, Sprint and others, and into more expensive (but better) plans at Verizon and AT&T. This will lead to healthy customer growth for AT&T, at favorable price points and will re-ignite margin-additive growth in the wireless business. HBO Max Will Provide A Much-Needed Video BoostOn the video side of things, the fundamentals of that part of AT&T's business will improve significantly over the next few years, too, thanks to the deployment of AT&T's very own content-packed streaming service, HBO Max.AT&T's video business has been killed by cord-cutting headwinds. Long story short, consumers are cutting the cord and turning to non-AT&T streaming services, so AT&T is just losing video subs. AT&T's proposed solution? Let them cut the cord. But, turn them toward signing up for AT&T streaming services, so the company doesn't let any subs slip out of the ecosystem.The problem, though, is that AT&T has lacked the content firepower to launch a competitive streaming service. Until now. With the acquisition of WarnerMedia, AT&T can now package content from HBO, Warner Bros, TBS, TNT, Adult Swim and the DC Universe into one streaming service. That's exactly what they are doing with the launch of HBO Max in 2020.This new service will help AT&T offset cord-cutting losses in the video business, and in so doing, will provide a lift to AT&T's revenues and profits. This lift should support further gains in AT&T stock. Valuation on AT&T Stock Remains ReasonableLast, but not least, the valuation on AT&T stock remains supportive of further gains in this rally.To be sure, the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be. When I first wrote on T stock earlier this year, the forward-earnings multiple on the stock was nearly equal to the dividend yield, with both hovering around 6. Now, though, AT&T's forward-earnings multiple is up around 11, while the dividend yield has sunk to 5.2%.  * 7 Biotech Stocks to Buy With Plenty of Power in the Pipeline        On the negative side, the forward-earnings multiple is as high as it has been in a few years, and the dividend yield is below the stock's five-year-average yield. But, one could reasonably argue that this relative premium is warranted given the improving fundamental picture.On the positive side, the forward earnings multiple is in-line with the sector-average multiple and the stock's five-year-average multiple. The dividend yield is also above where the stock has historically topped out at (4.8%).Thus, I think the valuation on T stock remains reasonable. I'd only get concerned when the multiple soars substantially above 11, or when the yield drops toward 4.8%. At current dividend rates, that won't happen until the AT&T stock price reaches around $42. Thus, this rally appears to have 5-10% upside left before maxing out on the valuation front. Bottom Line on T StockAT&T stock is having its best year since 2006. While the best of this rally has already played out, the party isn't over just yet. The fundamental picture continues to improve and the valuation remains reasonable. So long as those two things remain true, the stock will stay on its best uptrend in over a decade.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T.

2019-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- WeWork reported a net loss of $1.25 billion in the third quarter, eclipsing its sales and more than doubling its loss from the same period last year. The quarter coincided with a spending spree in anticipation of an initial public offering that veered off the rails, a combination of events that nearly brought the company down.Revenue in the quarter was $934 million, up from $482 million a year earlier but failing to keep pace with the steeper losses, according to a financial document that was presented to bondholders Wednesday and reviewed by Bloomberg. A spokeswoman for WeWork parent company We Co. declined to comment on the report.In an email to staff Wednesday that was seen by Bloomberg, WeWork’s co-chief executive officers, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, described the quarter as a “difficult chapter” for the company and said they’re developing a plan to “provide a clear path to profitability.” That will include selling assets and cutting jobs, they wrote. Dismissals have already begun and are expected to number in the thousands.WeWork had always prized growth above profit, but it took the approach to another level on the eve of its expected IPO. The deal was set to raise at least $9 billion for the business in a combination of equity and debt. So WeWork spent the summer filling up office space with about 115,000 new desks in the quarter, a record for the company. That brought total desks to 719,000. Partly thanks to that push, the occupancy rate in its offices declined to 79%, from 84% a year before.It wasn’t until the final weeks of the quarter, which ended in September, that WeWork realized how doomed its fundraising plans were. Investors recoiled at the office rental company’s deep losses and flimsy corporate governance. Adam Neumann, the longtime CEO, stepped down in late September under pressure from investors, and the company pulled its IPO prospectus on the final day of the month. WeWork had $2 billion in cash that day, according to the document.The money evaporated fast. WeWork was on track to run out of funds by November and needed an emergency financing from its largest investor, SoftBank Group Corp., to stay alive. SoftBank took majority ownership in that deal and has installed an executive, Marcelo Claure, to help turn around the business. The company is seeking a new CEO, and T-Mobile US Inc.’s John Legere is among the candidates.SoftBank has said it will buy stock from employees and other shareholders at a discounted rate, but that deal has yet to happen, according to the financial document. When it does, SoftBank will own about 78% of the company and less than half of voting stock. Employees are sitting on a lot of stock, much of which is now underwater. WeWork doled out $220 million in stock-based compensation in the first three quarters, nearly five times what it spent in the same period last year.Based on the company’s performance in September, WeWork estimated it would generate $4.2 billion in revenue over the next 12 months, compared with $1.8 billion in 2018. But the business may look very different soon, as the company prepares to dismiss employees and refocus on the core business of renting office space.(Updates with staff email in the third paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.net;Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",WeWork’s Quarterly Loss Doubled to $1.3 Billion as IPO Faltered

2019-11-18,He'll be replaced by current COO and President Mike Seivert.,T-Mobile CEO John Legere to Step Down
2019-11-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I’m not sure which is the bigger question: What is T-Mobile US Inc. without John Legere? Or, who is John Legere without T-Mobile?“I own no other clothing,” Legere joked during a conference call Monday morning, after the wireless carrier announced that its magenta-festooned CEO will be stepping down soon. Legere’s last day will be April 30, capping a remarkably successful seven-year run during which he took T-Mobile from a distant last place among the top U.S. carriers and turned it into the fastest-growing member of the industry. He will be replaced by Mike Sievert, who is currently president and chief operating officer.Make no mistake, the CEO transition will usher in a new T-Mobile. That’s not because the visions of the two men are so different — they aren’t, and Legere has been grooming Sievert, 50, for quite some time. But T-Mobile is no longer the industry upstart, and Legere’s departure suggests that he feels his work there is almost done. The last step is to complete the acquisition of Sprint Corp., which is being held up by a group of state attorneys general rightly concerned about the potential harm the transaction may cause consumers.Legere, 61, made clear that he isn’t retiring — nor is he turning his “Slow Cooker Sunday” Facebook Live series into a full-time gig. While he said the rumors of him joining WeWork aren’t true, he has fielded a “tremendous amount” of interest from companies seeking the expertise he’s demonstrated at turning around a troubled business and generating broad enthusiasm for a brand. “I’ve got 30 or 40 years and five or six good acts left in me,” Legere, the class clown of corporate events, said on Monday’s call. When Legere joined T-Mobile in 2012, the brand was in disrepair and customers were fleeing. It looked as if the wireless carrier might never be able to catch up to Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. or Sprint. But Legere transformed T-Mobile into a self-marketing powerhouse, with he and the rest of the management team shamelessly adopting new looks as walking billboards for the company. And it worked. More important, investments in the network and novel moves to simplify customer bills altered T-Mobile’s perception from one of a budget operator of last resort to a company that’s driving industry innovation. That’s earned it customer loyalty, as evidenced by having the lowest rate of churn — or customer defections — among its peers. T-Mobile’s stock has also left the others in the dust:Over the years, Legere’s style has not only included a closet’s worth of Superman-esque T-shirts adorned with a giant letter T, but also sports coats, sneakers, a leather jacket, a chef’s hat, a sports jersey and anything that could be made hot pink or fit the company’s logo. He has 6.5 million Twitter followers — almost as many as Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian family — and is known to respond directly to them, even occasionally dropping into calls to the customer service line. It was all part of his effort to shake up an industry that was going the way of cable-TV, with subscribers irritated by steep, overly complex monthly bills. “We saw an opportunity to disrupt a stupid, broken, arrogant industry,” a typically off-the-cuff Legere said on Monday’s call. “And T-Mobile is far from done,” he added. Though that may be for better or worse. Should the Sprint deal survive or avert the trial that’s set to begin Dec. 9, T-Mobile will gain newfound pricing power. Legere and Sievert have promised that the combined company won’t exploit this, saying that the combination instead allows them to “supercharge” what’s known as T-Mobile’s Un-carrier strategy. But the logic doesn’t quite follow. There’s little reason to believe a merger that facilitates higher prices and better profit margins wouldn’t result in exactly that, and the goodwill Legere has built up with regulators and consumers isn’t insurance enough against this scenario. Fierce competition between T-Mobile and Sprint the last few years is what benefited consumers and forced the industry to do things like offer unlimited data plans. If Sprint gets swallowed, the marketplace will be narrowed to just Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.(1)Sievert is a fine choice as CEO. But the reality is that the company he’s inheriting is different from the one Legere joined, and the days of T-Mobile’s incredible rapid growth will fade into the past, and there will be a natural shift to take advantage of its enhanced market power. So when Sievert said on Monday’s call that after the Sprint deal closes, “customers are going to the be winners,” I wouldn’t count on it. (1) Regulators have mandated that T-Mobile unload some assets to Dish Network Corp., helping set up the satellite-TV provider as a new entrant to the wireless market. But Dish is years and multiple billions of dollars away from becoming a formidable rival that can fill the hole Sprint will leave behind. It’s a weak concession that Legere was more than happy to accept.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-11-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There are plenty of reasons Deutsche Telekom AG and Vodafone Group Plc make for uneasy bedfellows. But if Europe’s biggest telecommunications firms can overcome their differences, they would benefit from forging a strong alliance for one of their biggest cost centers: towers.The structures on which mobile operators install their antennas have generated a flurry of dealmaking as valuations soar and European carriers sense an opportunity to reduce debt and costs. By some estimates, towers account for a third of total capital expenditures. Since July, more than $8 billion of deals have been announced in Europe.Sexy they are not. Yet towers are critical vertebrae for wireless networks, and are ever more in demand with the advent of 5G networks. The new technology, which promises to transmit bigger gobs of data at faster speeds, will depend on antennas with a shorter range than previous generations because of the spectrum of bandwidth being used. That means more towers will be needed to post more antennas at closer intervals to power a network, making it increasingly attractive for operators to share them.With that in mind, Vodafone is already separating out its towers arm. An umbrella company will hold the stakes in its U.K. joint venture with the local unit of Madrid-based Telefonica SA, as well as a combination in Italy with Telecom Italia SpA’s Inwit subsidiary, pending regulatory approval. Options are being evaluated for Vodafone’s similar assets across the rest of Europe. Germany is at the top of the list.Just last week, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica agreed to work together to build as many as 6,000 mobile sites in a bid to cut costs. They could do more, and merging Vodafone’s towers with those of Deutsche Telekom, the larger rival, would make the most sense for both parties. The former German national carrier has intimated it’s open to “possible scenarios,” especially given the German government’s ambitious target of having 98% of German homes, every highway and all federal roads equipped with download speeds of 100 megabits per second by the end of 2022.The timing isn’t perfect. The two firms’ rivalry is intensifying in Germany after the British firm agreed to buy Liberty Global Plc’s local cable assets for 19 billion euros ($16.5 billion). In trying to stymie the deal, Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges questioned the implications that foreign ownership of major television assets would have for German democracy.But a towers tie-up could yield three major benefits: It would reduce debt, underpin an improved sum-of-the-parts valuation, and cut exposure to major capital expenditures over the next decade. Hoettges teased the idea at a conference in Barcelona last week, saying, “I’m ready for an IPO, I’m ready for a partnership — if we find one.”Mimicking Vodafone’s Italian deal would be sensible. There, Vodafone had the more valuable assets, so it received a 2.1 billion-euro cash payment and a 37.5% stake in the firm, Inwit. Telecom Italia has a holding of the same size, with the remaining 30% publicly traded.In Germany, Deutsche Telekom would expect to receive the cash payment. It has 9,000 towers, and Vodafone just 4,000. And since towers companies can sustain higher levels of debt, that money needn’t come from Vodafone itself. The new firm’s higher leverage capacity might be able to fund the deal.With the cash, Deutsche Telekom could reduce its net debt, which is set to jump significantly when U.S. subsidiary T-Mobile U.S. Inc. seals the $58 billion acquisition of Sprint Corp., expected early next year. That will push debt above Deutsche Telekom’s target ratio, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Aidan Cheslin estimates.The value of the new towers company could approach 15 billion euros, based on earnings estimates and peer valuations. By selling a minority stake to the public market, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom would be able to raise more capital and highlight value of the towers businessThe main reason not to merge the operations — being able to brag your network is better than someone else’s — is meanwhile eroding, given the network-sharing agreement reached last week.The biggest hurdle to a deal might be antitrust concerns. But other deals that seemed a gamble — such as Deutsche Telekom merging its Dutch business with the that of Swedish rival Tele2 AB — have been cleared. The pace of towers combinations is accelerating. France’s Orange SA has hinted it’s also evaluating its infrastructure assets, and will reveal more details Dec. 4. Europe’s two biggest telecoms giants should do so too, and together.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s been a lot of drama lately in the wireless world concerning 5G and something called C-band. To most people, all the news headlines have probably looked like a foreign language. But allow me to translate for you, because it’s a fascinating situation that has sparked a transnational fight over some $50 billion, while presenting advocates of President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy with a catch-22. The outcome may have far-reaching implications for the U.S. in the global race to 5G, and it certainly does for a pair of beaten-down European stocks. At the root of the drama is spectrum, the invisible airwaves sought after by U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint — and others to construct ultra-fast 5G data networks, the kind that will enable a smartphone to download a movie in mere seconds and support driverless car technology. The Federal Communications Commission has been working to free up spectrum being used by other institutions so that it can be auctioned off to the 5G builders and repurposed for their networks, a high priority for the Trump administration.But there have been some hiccups along the way. Take one case, in which scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) raised concerns that a particular slice of spectrum auctioned by the FCC could interfere with weather sensors and limit their ability to forecast hurricanes. That’s quite a quandary.The recent spectrum controversy, a separate matter from the hurricane one, has involved a swath referred to as the C-band. In the 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz frequency range, these midband airwaves are highly desirable for 5G because they can both carry large amounts of data and travel long distances (some spectrum can only do one or the other). Here’s where it gets complicated: Most of the C-band is controlled by two Luxembourg-based companies, Intelsat SA and SES SA, which use it to beam TV shows to U.S. households from their satellite fleets. Telesat of Ottawa also owns some of the C-band rights. These three foreign companies make up what’s called the C-Band Alliance (CBA).The good news it that the CBA members are willing sellers, and the auction could raise $50 billion or more, according to an estimate by New Street Research. It would be one of the biggest spectrum auctions ever. But who gets the money: the CBA, or the U.S. Treasury? These are U.S. assets, after all. The CBA had been pushing for a private auction run by, of course, the CBA, arguing that it would make the process much faster. For those who see America’s buildout of 5G as an important geopolitical race against China, time is of the essence. FCC Chair Ajit Pai — who is already a controversial figure for repealing net neutrality and for backing the potentially harmful merger of T-Mobile and Sprint — originally seemed to be leaning toward the CBA plan. His Republican colleague, Commissioner Michael O’Rielly, was in strong support of it: “In the grand scheme of things, if it is a contest between speed and the government trying to extract a significant piece of the transaction through a lengthy process, I’ll take the speedy resolution,” O’Rielly said at a conference in September. But in the CBA auction scenario, only a portion of the proceeds would go to the U.S., while the rest would be pocketed by the CBA. That sounded like nails on a chalkboard to at least one member of Congress: “They’re thinking about giving our spectrum to three foreign companies and letting them keep the $60 billion,” Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana said during an impassioned speech on the Senate floor last month. “Talk about swampy,” he said, adding that the funds should go to the American taxpayer. But to put America first, is it better to hold a quicker auction or a more lucrative one? Kennedy has led the charge against the CBA’s plan (seemingly a charge of one because, hey, it’s hard getting folks excited about radio waves), pushing instead for a public auction run by the FCC. Though he may have a point, it was somewhat diluted by his supplemental remark that proceeds from the auction “would solve all of the president’s [border] wall problems.” Perhaps a coincidence, after Kennedy stumped at a Trump rally in his home state last week in support of Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone, the FCC changed its tune. On Monday, Pai Tweeted that he supports a public auction, citing that it would “afford all parties a fair opportunity to compete for this 5G spectrum,” limiting the litigation risk that a private auction may have presented. This is bad news mostly for the CBA crew. The U.S. wireless carriers would obviously like to get their hands on this spectrum sooner rather than later and have a bigger say over the process (Verizon especially, given that it’s focused so far on finicky millimeter wave spectrum). But for the heavily indebted Intelsat, it’s a far bigger inconvenience. The company’s stock has plummeted more than 50% this week, while SES dropped 24%.There’s more to come on this matter, but so far the supposed race to 5G looks more like an exhausting obstacle course. To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-12-05,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The merger floodgates broke open five years ago, and now U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to close the hatch. Her proposed bill to substantially restrict big corporate tie-ups is more a presidential campaign statement than viable legislation — and it certainly won’t score her any more points with the Wall Street crowd — but she is calling attention to the maniacal pace of dealmaking in corporate America and the need to modernize antitrust laws that have permitted some recent problematic transactions.More than $7 trillion of takeovers of U.S. companies have been announced since this day in 2014 — 52,694 companies to be exact.(1) That compares with just $4.4 trillion of deals in the previous five-year period. The transactions grew over time as balance sheets flush with cash and income statements desperate for growth created a perfect storm, which more often than not was stoked by pliable regulators. The Walt Disney Co. acquired 21st Century Fox Inc.; Charter Communications Inc. bought Time Warner Cable Inc.; CVS Health Corp. took over Aetna Inc.; Marriott International Inc. merged with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.; and T-Mobile US Inc. is trying to buy Sprint Corp. Those are just some of the more recognizable names. Warren, one of the top-polling candidates heading into the Democratic primaries, wants to ban deals in which one company has annual revenue of more than $40 billion, or both businesses generate more than $15 billion in sales, according to a draft of the bill reviewed by Bloomberg News. (A notable exception would be companies facing insolvency.) That could effectively prevent every top airline, insurer, manufacturer, oil producer, retailer, technology platform and other conglomerates — perhaps even Warren Buffett’s M&A vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — from making any acquisitions. It would sound the M&A death knell. The idea, however, is unlikely to gain broad support among lawmakers.Even so, it’s hard not to notice the rising drumbeat of politicians concerned about overreach by corporate giants, particularly those in the tech field. Senator Amy Klobuchar, another Democratic presidential candidate, plans to introduce separate antitrust legislation soon, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. (Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Opinion, is also campaigning for president.)For the Trump administration’s part, the U.S. Justice Department is already investigating whether tech giants — namely Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google — are using their unchecked power to engage in harmful business practices. But as I wrote in July, if regulators are so concerned about protecting consumers from tech overreach, their glowing endorsement of T-Mobile’s takeover of Sprint is a funny way of showing it; it will shrink the U.S. wireless market from four to three major carriers and remove a company that’s helped to keep customer prices in check.Antitrust regulation under President Donald Trump has at times created questionable optics. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s top antitrust enforcer, seemed to switch his stance on AT&T Inc.’s takeover of Time Warner Inc. as Trump railed against the deal. Time Warner was the parent of CNN, which Trump views as his personal nemesis. (I’ve argued that whatever the case, scrutiny of the megamerger was warranted considering the broad market power it gave to AT&T as media companies without such scale struggle to compete.) By comparison, Disney and Fox, which was controlled by Trump pal Rupert Murdoch, closed their megadeal with few regulatory hiccups. Warren has criticized other giant deals, such as the merger of SunTrust Banks Inc. and BB&T Corp. and the combination of seed makers Bayer AG and Monsanto Co. Given that they aren’t household names, though, most Americans are unfazed by or unaware of such deals, even though they may feel the effects later. Her bill would direct the government to take into account not just whether a merger will lead to higher prices but also what the impact might be on workers, privacy and industry innovation. To justify the cost of buying another large company, dealmakers tend to come up with ambitious estimates of synergies, a euphemism for layoffs. It’s clear that the meaning of “harm” needs to be expanded in the antitrust sense, and laws need to take a more holistic view of the potential consequences of M&A as the lines between industries continue to blur. The Big Tech factor also needs to be weighed, as some deals are being done in part to respond to companies like Amazon that are spreading their tentacles into new areas. On Wednesday, TV-network operators CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. completed their own merger, a bid to cut costs and create more scale to compete against a new roster of even more powerful media giants: Amazon, Apple, AT&T and Disney. Even then, ViacomCBS Inc., as the merged entity is now called, may not be big enough, and so it may be only a matter of time before it gets swallowed. Warren’s overly broad proposal likely isn’t the answer. But Democrats do seem ready to at least try to rein in a market that’s gotten out of hand. For dealmakers, this may be last call at the M&A party.(1) Data compiled by Bloomberg as of Thursday morning.

2019-12-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. are in court dueling with a group of state attorneys general over whether their merger will be harmful to consumers, even though it shouldn’t even be a debate. In what possible scenario would removing a low-cost rival from an already highly concentrated industry not have a negative effect on competition?The wireless carriers are contorting themselves into a pretzel trying to make the illogical argument that their merger will instead benefit customers — and somehow it’s working. Antitrust authorities appointed by President Donald Trump accepted this rationale with a straight face: The U.S. Federal Communications Commission, led by Ajit Pai, and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, led by Makan Delrahim, each gave its blessing to the deal in recent months on the condition that the two companies make some painless concessions. Now, in a last line of legal defense and an unusual turn for such transactions, the matter is being tried in a case brought by plaintiffs Letitia James of New York and 13 other attorneys general. They are arguing that the remedies don’t go far enough to address the antitrust violations. They don’t, and yet there’s no telling which way this trial will go. Competition between T-Mobile and Sprint during the last few years resulted in lower plan prices for wireless customers, even putting pressure on industry leaders Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. It’s how unlimited data offerings came about. Without Sprint in the mix, this healthy competitive spirit is diminished. No acrobatics of economic modeling can camouflage this fact, and still the facts are in dispute. How very 2019.Text messages from 2017 between Roger Sole, Sprint’s head of marketing, and its then-CEO Marcelo Claure (who is now executive chairman) were revealed on Monday, the first day of the trial. As the two companies were negotiating the deal, Sole wrote to Claure that the combined entity could generate $5 more from each subscriber per month, and that the consolidation would even provide a boon to AT&T and Verizon. Sole may have been just spit-balling, and the state attorneys have a stronger case than to put too much stock in some gotcha private texts. Still, the conversation strongly suggests that greater pricing power was absolutely a motivation for the transaction, and it’s naive of anyone to think otherwise. T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed not to raise prices for three years, which is the blink of an eye in the business world and further demonstrates that the company’s goal is to eventually do so. Three years also conveniently brings the company to the point at which there may be little room left for cost-cutting, and so it will need to look to other ways to boost growth and margins. That’s if there aren’t loopholes in the agreement that it can exploit sooner. As well-liked as the gregarious T-Mobile CEO John Legere is — and as admirable as his track record is in fostering industry innovation — his personal promise that the company won’t take advantage of newfound pricing power should carry little weight. He won’t even be there to see it through. There are other business benefits beyond the ability to raise prices. For one, Sprint is a financially challenged company with a tarnished brand that is struggling to compete against its larger rivals. Selling to T-Mobile, which is on far healthier footing, would be good news for frustrated shareholders, such as Masayoshi Son of SoftBank Group Corp., the Japanese conglomerate that controls Sprint. The companies would also get to combine their spectrum assets and join forces on building a nationwide 5G wireless network.The U.S. needs to be competitive in 5G, but waving the American flag and trying to put the fear of China into regulators isn’t a legitimate defense against antitrust enforcement. Plus, it’s hard to see how blocking the merger would set the nation back — both companies are investing in 5G regardless. As for the notion that T-Mobile is preserving competition by rescuing Sprint before it potentially goes belly-up, it just doesn’t hold water because other bidders are probably out there. While companies like Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. may be seen as the Big Bad Cable Guys, either one owning Sprint would still maintain a four-carrier market, whereas T-Mobile’s deal wouldn’t.One of the remedies sought by the DOJ was to allow satellite-TV provider Dish Network Corp. access to the T-Mobile network while Dish builds its own. But Dish is a long, long ways from ever replacing Sprint. The DOJ’s lax stance on this deal would also seem to contradict the concerns it recently raised about anti-competitive business practices in the tech world, where immense market power is wielded by so few players.In the book “The Myth of Capitalism: Monopolies and the Death of Competition,” Jonathan Tepper and Denise Hearn make the case that the U.S. has an oligopoly problem — that is, industries have become too concentrated to the detriment of consumers and workers, in large thanks to anti-competitive mergers. My colleague John Authers, who runs the Bloomberg book club, and I will be discussing this with the authors in a live chat on Wednesday at 11 a.m. New York time. It’s a timely conversation as the T-Mobile-Sprint situation plays out. Terminal subscribers can join us at TLIV and send comments or questions to authersnotes@bloomberg.net.There’s more to come in the trials and tribulations of Sprint’s unending quest to merge with T-Mobile. But whatever headlines emerge from the courtroom, this fact won’t change: A merger means market power will be concentrated in fewer hands.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-12-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Small-cap esports companies can benefit as more advertisers find value in the industry’s ability to attract a younger, richer audience and as the industry builds out infrastructure, according to Stephens Inc.The firm initiated coverage of two esports companies, rating Allied Esports Entertainment Inc. as a buy-equivalent and Super League Gaming Inc. as a hold-equivalent and setting their price targets at $5 and $3, respectively. The combined market value of the two southern California companies is less than $90 million.Shares of Allied Esports rose 3.3% to $2.84 at 1:14 p.m. in New York, paring earlier gains of as much as 9.1%. The company’s arenas are well positioned to capitalize on demand for in-person esports events, Stephens said. Super League Gaming, which runs an esports community and content platform, rose 6.4% to $2.81.Gaming has an “enviable position” due to its main audience being young, digitally native and affluent, analyst Jeff Cohen said in a research note. While esports is still in its nascent stages and currently under-monetizes on a per-viewer basis compared to traditional sports, advertisers have started to look at the industry as a way of connecting with an increasingly tough-to-reach demographic.“Esports leagues and tournaments have begun to see an influx of non-endemic sponsorship money,” Cohen said. He highlighted T-Mobile US Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Sour Patch Kids as sponsors of Activision Blizzard Inc.’s Overwatch League.The industry’s revenue streams are largely the same as those for traditional sports, including sponsorships and advertising, merchandise and tickets sales, and media rights. Stephens sees those revenue streams continuing to grow as brands not linked to gaming recognize the return on investment of marketing to the audience that esports attracts.To contact the reporter on this story: Andres Guerra Luz in New York at aluz8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Even Small Esports Names Gain as Industry Matures

And analysts think the pace of stock buybacks will slow.&quot;We believe the U.S. economy will muddle through in 2020, but expect EPS growth to disappoint,&quot; Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Michael Wilson writes. &quot;We prefer value over growth, with a slight defensive bias.&quot;Other pros are a little more optimistic. For instance, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, tells investors that better economic data is on the way, possibly lifting the S&P; 500 by 10% by year's end.With that mixed outlook in mind, here are the analysts' top stock picks for 2020. We used TipRanks' analyst-tracking data to discover the best of the bunch - stocks that have loads of upside potential from current share prices. And all of these picks have amassed so many bullish recommendations from top-performing analysts that they've earned a Strong Buy consensus rating. Read on to learn more about what makes these stocks stand out. SEE ALSO: The 20 Best Stocks to Buy for 2020",20 Top Stock Picks the Analysts Love for 2020
2019-12-23,"In 2019, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock finally started to reward investors who had patience. From 2014 through 2018, QCOM stock was largely treading water, with the stock hitting a 30-month low as the tech wreck at the end of 2018 continued into 2019.Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com The semiconductor industry has been stuck in neutral because of the U.S.-China trade war. But in 2019, the industry and Qualcomm stock caught the first part of the 5G wave. As it specifically relates to QCOM stock, the company was finally able to put its legal dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the rearview mirror. And while the resolution may be more of an uneasy status quo, it does give Qualcomm a predictable revenue stream for the next several years.That revenue got a pleasant surprise as sales of the iPhone 11 have surpassed initial projections. But just like all semiconductor stocks, QCOM investors are waiting on the release of 5G phones because of their need for 5G modem chips.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Qualcomm May Get More Revenue Per SmartphoneIn addition to new modem chips, 5G smartphones will require upgraded radio frequency front-end (RFFE) modules. However not all RFFE modules are created equally. It depends on a range of outcomes. One of those outcomes is the choice of which parts of the frequency spectrum telecom carriers will use.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Qualcomm would prefer that carriers use mmWave. This covers the high-frequency spectrum. The other alternative is Sub-6. This covers between low-band and mid-band spectrum. So, what's the difference?All things being equal, mmWave offers higher data transfer speeds. But they are more expensive. This is a pro and a con for Qualcomm stock. The good news is that mmWave devices require multiple antennas as opposed to Sub-6 devices, which require only one.More parts equal more revenue for Qualcomm. The U.S. Is the Only Country That Supports Both Sub-6 and mmWaveAt their recent Analyst Day, Qualcomm emphasized that at this stage in its development, 5G is off to a much faster start than 4G. While this is largely seen as a benefit to Qualcomm (and it probably will be), it may also be a tide that rises all boats. Right now, there are ten times more operators offering 5G service than there were at the same point in the launch of 4G. And that number is only expected to rise.But the United States is to date the only country that supports mmWave. Qualcomm believes that Japan and South Korea will also adopt mmWave in 2020. And the company is also optimistic that a large number of European countries, plus Brazil and Russia will also launch networks that support mmWave.But what if they're wrong? If countries decide that mmWave is not a cost-effective solution, it can dramatically reduce Qualcomm's expected revenue. Could this happen? The answer is yes, particularly since mmWave requires a much higher infrastructure cost. But Is Support for mmWave Waning in the U.S. as Well?The larger problem is that some U.S. carriers, specifically T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are even having some doubts about mmWave. That's because the benefits of 5G, notably the faster data speeds, while obvious to Qualcomm are not as obvious to the carriers who are on the hook for building out the infrastructure.An executive at T-Mobile said that &quot;millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum has great potential in terms of speed and capacity, but it doesn't travel far from the cell site and doesn't penetrate materials at all. It will never materially scale between small pockets of 5G hotspots in dense urban environments.&quot; Is Qualcomm Stock a Buy?I believe QCOM stock is a buy in the short term. The 5G rollout is creating too big of an opportunity.But investors need to closely watch to see if other countries, including the U.S., &quot;catch the wave.&quot; If they do, the stock will have a unique catalyst that should launch it higher. However, if they don't, more muted expectations for Qualcomm stock are in order.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-23,"The new decade is set to open with the widespread deployment of 5G networks. The rollout of the 5th generation of wireless technology will improve many available services as well as support a million devices in the radius of a single kilometer. From downloading 4K movies on our smartphones in seconds, to remote surgery aided by VR headsets, to cars being able to talk to each other - all will reap the benefits of 5G networks.As with any new technology, it can be hard at first to imagine the changes it will bring. Market incentives are sure to play their part in accelerating adoption and driving innovations that most aren’t able to fathom yet. Therefore, well positioned companies are set to make the most of the opportunity the new technology affords.With the information about the lightning fast technology in hand, then, we opened TipRanks’ Stock Screener to get the scoop on 3 companies ready for the oncoming 5G onslaught. Coincidentally, right now, all 3 have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street. Let’s take a closer look.Broadcom (AVGO)As a developer and designer of semiconductor products, Broadcom is ideally positioned to benefit from the roll out of 5G networks. Apart from a core business which includes serving data centers, wired infrastructure and enterprise storage systems, Broadcom’s smartphone clients include Apple and Samsung. With Apple expected to launch a 5G-enabled phone in 2020, naturally, the semiconductor manufacturer stands to benefit.As one of the decade’s best market performers, Broadcom’s 2019 has landed just shy of the S&P 500’s performance, adding over 25% to its share price. The company’s latest earnings report was in line with Street expectations, too. Strong quarter-over-quarter growth in its wireless sector and year-over-year growth in other segments both contributed to solid revenues of $5.78 billion, alongside EPS of $5.39.RBC’s Mitch Steves thinks Broadcom is “an attractive asset.” The 5-star analyst highlights the company’s “potential for multiple expansion” and believes long-term EPS can easily grow into double digits.“We see M&A integration, stock buybacks, and margin expansion driving EPS growth. We see the Symantec integration and margin expansion driving EPS upside in 2020/2021. On an annual basis, we see stable to slightly positive revenue trajectories for AVGO’s key businesses,” Steves said.To this end, the 5-star analyst reiterated a Outperform on AVGO, alongside a price target of $360, indicating upside potential of 13%. (To watch Steves’ track record, click here)A flurry of analysts have recently been reiterating Buy ratings on this tech giant. Put together, the rest of the Street appears to be reading from the same hymn sheet as Steves. A Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 16 Buys and 4 Holds. The average price target almost matches Steves’ to a T, coming in at $359.29, and implying 12% upside. (See Broadcom stock analysis on TipRanks) T-Mobile US (TMUS)One of the companies already benefitting from 5G technology is communications giant T Mobile. The wireless network operator recently launched a nationwide 5G network that according to the company, already provides coverage to 200 million people in 5,000 cities and across rural areas. The large swathes of coverage can be enabled due to the network’s low-band spectrum, which isn’t as fast as other 5G millimeter wave-based networks. Nevertheless, the newly launched network also works indoors, a feat not possible so far, to a meaningful extent, with millimeter wave-based 5G counterparts.A problem still facing 5G networks is the relative lack of 5G smartphones. Of course, this is all set to change as the new decade kicks into gear, and T-Mobile stands to benefit from the technology’s widespread adoption.RBC’s Jonathan Atkin thinks so, too. The 5-star analyst expects T-Mobile to “outperform its peers based on favorable risk/reward characteristics” and believes “uncarrier initiatives have positioned T-Mobile as the ‘customer-friendly carrier’, attracting millennials.” Atkin also notes that, “Faster-than-anticipated postpaid growth could lead to greater out-year cash flow growth.”“We expect continued subscriber momentum and churn improvement on the back of greater enterprise/SMB/public-sector penetration, network improvement, and retail expansion,” the analyst concluded.The 5G rollout has the analyst betting on T-Mobile. Atkin reiterated an Outperform rating on the telecom leader, while also bumping up the price target from $87 to $94. If attained, investors could be lining their pockets with gains of 21% in the new year. (To watch Atkin’s track record, click here)And where does the Street’s coverage of T-Mobile extend to? As it happens, to a Strong Buy consensus rating, formed of 9 Buys and 2 Holds. An average price target of $92.90 indicates upside potential of 20% over the next 12 months. (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks) Keysight Technologies (KEYS)As the name implies, Keysight unlocks &quot;critical or key insights”. The electronic measurement leader has outrun the market in 2019 and is up by over 67% year-to-date. The company has consistently outperformed financial targets, including core revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin. In the last three quarters, Keysight’s reported EPS has left estimates in the dust.Among the company’s arsenal of software and tools are 5G solutions. With 5G rollout in its initial phase, Keysight is already benefiting, with the company’s software order book increasing 19% year-over-year in 2019 to reach $853 million.Deutsche Bank’s Brian Yun thinks the company’s software is what separates Keysight from other test and measurement peers, due to the “depth of the software portfolio, design wins, industry partnerships.”The analyst said, “KEYS continues to execute in the midst of an uncertain macro backdrop and a dynamic competitive environment. We highlight ongoing robust long-term demand trends across KEYS' test and measurement end markets: 5G, 400G, IOT, connected cars, military modernization, etc. The company continues to win new customers and projects, which is driven by KEYS' competitively differentiated portfolio in these secular growth themes and operational excellence across product and end market segments.”Yun, therefore, kept his Buy rating on KEYS and raised his price target from $115 to $125, implying upside potential of 21%. (To watch Yun’s track record, click here)It looks like Yun’s upbeat take on the measurement solutions wiz is backed by the rest of the Street. With 6 Buys and a single Hold from the analysts over the last three months, the consensus is that Keysight is a Strong Buy. The average price target comes in a touch below Yun’s, at $122, indicating an increase of 18%, should the target be reached over the coming year.

2019-12-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s been my habit, as the year draws in the day, to offer my predictions for the coming year, but only after doing what every commentator should do — assessing my predictions for the year just ending. So before I get to my predictions for 2020, in the second half of this column, let’s see how I did in 2019.Let’s put one of last year’s prediction right up top:“The Washington Nationals will overcome the loss of superstar Bryce Harper in free agency and win the World Series over the Houston Astros.”Nailed it precisely! If you need end-of-the-year help, Las Vegas or ESPN, give me a call.The 2019 ScorecardNow, as to the others, I predicted:That Amazon would react to bad publicity during its 2018 HQ2 search by promising to put another headquarters in an economically distressed part of the country. Instead, the company is donating millions of dollars for “affordable housing” in Northern Virginia, where its new campus is planned. Mostly false, but I did get Amazon’s motive right.(1) That President Donald Trump would achieve neither his border wall nor a Fed hewing more closely to his views. True. That the level of CO2 in the atmosphere would continue to rise. Although final figures for 2019 are not in, this one will almost certainly wind up in the “true” column. That the melting Arctic ice cap would continue to pour thousands of gallons of water per second into the oceans. True, and true again. That significant numbers of U.S. armed forces would remain in both Afghanistan and Syria. True, despite the president’s efforts in Syria. That the New England Patriots would win Super Bowl LIII. True. Not a hard prediction but still true. That allegations of fraud in the settlement fund established to pay former professional football players who have suffered neurocognitive damage would turn out to be a big story. Sadly, true. This month’s federal indictments were big news. That despite investigations of Trump’s conduct, no resolution of impeachment would reach the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote in 2019. False, but so, so close. If they had but waited two more weeks! That special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report would find no clear evidence that Trump committed a crime (true) and that NeverTrumpers would try to raise $1 billion to pay the president to resign. (I was mostly kidding but I wasn’t wrong.(2)) That homeschoolers would turn to virtual reality as a principal educational tool, and that over time others would embrace the idea. Still feels inevitable, but much too early to tell. That during the summer of 2019, Marvel would finally announce a release date for the second “Black Panther” movie (true, right down to the time of year); that the highest-grossing film of the year would be “Avengers: Endgame,” if we count actual revenues during calendar 2019 (true, both worldwide and domestic); and that if we were instead to count all revenues for the movie’s run, the late-December-premiering “Star Wars:  Episode IX” would win (I thought this was a slam dunk, but between tepid reviews and fissures in the fan base, I now believe this one may not work out.) That despite the openly expressed skepticism of the federal judge overseeing the case, the $69 billion merger of CVS and Aetna would go forward. True. That wealthy progressives who continue to sneer at the Republican tax cut as a giveaway to the rich would not offer the U.S. Treasury their gains from the rate reductions. True — and now members of Congress from high-tax blue states are demanding that their well-heeled supporters get an even bigger cut. And that — sorry, but I can’t resist repeating — the Washington Nationals would win the World Series over the Houston Astros!2020’s PredictionsNow we come to my predictions for 2020. As always, not all are seriously meant but some are meant more seriously meant than they might appear. I will leave it to the reader to figure out which are which.1&#92;. Except for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidates will condemn the Secure Act’s new limits on the ability of non-spouses who inherit retirement accounts to stretch their disbursements over a long period of time. In particular, the candidates will agree that adult children who inherit should be able to leave the money invested for as long as they like. (Those who voted for the new rules will say they didn’t understand the implications.) Most of the candidates will stop short of promising repeal, however, and will instead promise unspecified adjustments.2&#92;. Due less to government spying than to the growing popularity of Amazon’s Ring and similar devices, the number of surveillance cameras in the world will blow swiftly past recent estimates of one billion. By the end of 2020, all but a fraction of the outdoor spaces in most cities around the world will be recorded on video somewhere, and significant inroads will have been made in suburbs and towns. (Say goodbye to the “shadow map.”)3&#92;. Speaking of technology, for the second year in a row, the final appropriation for NASA will be insufficient to allow any significant progress on its goal of returning to the Moon by 2024. Rather than surrender the dream, proponents will push the realization a couple of years further down the road.4&#92;. Despite concerns by consumer activists, the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint will survive judicial scrutiny.5&#92;. The New England Patriots will win Super Bowl LIV in February.  No, I’m not a particular Patriots fan. But I pick them every year anyway, because ... well, come on. Even if you’re a Patriot hater, you know I’m right.6&#92;. Due to global warming, the rate at which the Arctic ice cap is melting will continue to increase. (This has become an even easier prediction than picking the Patriots.) Meanwhile, such innovative ideas for mitigation as pumping river water southward instead of letting it flow north will be rejected by climate change skeptics as too expensive and by climate change activists as a distraction from the urgent need to sign lots of treaties.7&#92;. Swirling rumors that Russia might annex its longtime ally Belarus will drive dictator Alexander Lukashenko to seek rapprochement with the U.S. and the West. Already Belarus imports nearly half a billion dollars worth of goods from the U.S. annually, with fertilizer leading the way.  Russian boss Vladimir Putin will view closer ties between Washington and Minsk as a strategic threat and begin to rattle his sabers. President Donald Trump will assure everyone that his “good friend” Putin will “allow Belarus to go its own way.” Pundits will jump not only on “good friend” but also on “allow.”8&#92;. The highest grossing film of the year will be Warner Brothers’ “Wonder Woman 1984.” People will look around and say, “Wait, this intellectual property isn’t owned by Disney? Is that even allowed?” Disney, wondering the same thing, will take swift measures to fix the problem.9&#92;. A congressional near-ban on vaping products will pass and be signed into law by President Trump, well in advance of serious clinical studies about potential health hazards.10&#92;. Despite news reports to the contrary, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, accused of rape by two black women, will announce unequivocally that he will not be seeking the governorship of the state, or even another term in office.11&#92;. The U.S. stock market will continue to rise through the first half of the year, bringing several new highs. As the political conventions approach during the summer, the market will begin to stutter. When the election season reaches full swing, we will see a significant drop, which the left will call a collapse and the right will call a correction. After the election, the markets will rise sharply.12&#92;. The Los Angeles Angels will be the surprise team of the baseball season, but will lose in the playoffs to the Houston Astros, who will go on to defeat the Atlanta Braves (the other surprise team) in the World Series. (Bonus prediction: If Braves star Josh Donaldson jumps to the Washington Nationals, then the Nationals will reach the World Series once again, where the Astros will get revenge for 2019.)13&#92;. Speaking of sports, nobody in the news media will offer any but the most half-hearted apology for the cravenness and stupidity of running all those photos of the Army-Navy game and asking whether the cadets who circled thumbs and forefingers were flashing white power signs.14&#92;. Despite concerns raised in other countries, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will adhere to its position that there is no scientific evidence of any health problem from the trace amounts of nitrosamines in some prescription medications.15&#92;. In the presidential election, the Democrats will flip Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin but the Republicans will flip New Hampshire.  The result will be a tie in the electoral college. Under Article II, section 1, of the Constitution, the choice must then be made by the House of Representatives. Democrats cheer the perspicacity of the Framers until they realize that when the House sits to break an electoral tie, each state gets one vote. At that point Democrats remember that the Framers were white supremacists trying to protect slavery, and that the opinions of such monsters should play no role in contemporary governance.The 26 states that have a majority red House delegation will vote Republican; the 22 states that have a majority blue delegation vote Democratic. The other two states, where the delegations are divided, will cast no vote, resulting in another tie.The issue will be thrown to the courts. A letter signed by several hundred law professors will argue that all judges and justices appointed by President Donald Trump should recuse themselves, as they are likely to be biased. Television commentators will take up the cry. Conservative bloggers will reply that the argument is “another” attempted coup d’état.Before the courts can rule, the political parties will agree to hold a new presidential election in February of 2021. Under the agreement, Trump will remains in office until that time but can take no action without the concurrence of Congress. Lawsuits will immediately be filed to block the plan, including by Trump himself, who will claim that not having been defeated in the election, he should win by default.Alas, we don’t know how the lawsuits will come out, because my crystal ball runs only through 2020.Those are my predictions for 2020.  For you, my loyal readers, I wish a new year full of awe, joy, rationality, civility, and love.(1) The company is sensitive to criticism that its highly paid workforce will drive up housing prices, and is pledging millions for affordable units. Still, you can count me as a skeptic of the proposition that there isn’t more affordable housing because nobody wants to build any. Prices for lumber and gypsum, the main inputs for home construction, continue to fall. One suspects that the principal bottleneck is elsewhere ... regulatory, for instance.(2) The GoFundMe campaign that started with much fanfare in 2017 doesn’t seem to have gotten much traction, although new, smaller ones keep popping up.To contact the author of this story: Stephen L.

2020-01-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is increasingly pessimistic that T-Mobile US Inc. will complete its $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp., with the spread on the deal at the highest point since it was announced in 2018.The spread between T-Mobile’s offer price for Sprint and the trading price, an indication of the deal’s risk, has swelled to $2.85 a share on Thursday from a low of 53 cents in May 2018.The key impediment to the transaction, which the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission have already OK’d, is a court challenge brought by Democratic attorneys general from 13 states and the District of Columbia. They maintain that the combination would harm consumers through higher prices and weaker service.Based on two weeks of court testimony last month and the nature of the questions U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero asked during the proceedings, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant sees a 60% chance the ruling will favor the states, according to a note Thursday.Shares of T-Mobile and Sprint were little changed Thursday, but Sprint has slumped 35% since a recent peak in July, while T-Mobile is down less than 7% over the same period.Industry’s FateThe case will help determine the fate of the U.S. wireless industry as the two smaller national carriers seek to combine into a more effective competitor to Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.The pivotal question is whether the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint would simply shrink the playing field to three national carriers, or if, under a plan approved by U.S. regulators, Dish Network Corp. would set up an effective new wireless carrier with assets bought from Sprint and T-Mobile.The attorneys general may have successfully framed the issue as too much industry concentration, said Gallant, a former legal adviser to the FCC. “Both the parties’ private texts and Marrero’s own questions repeatedly referred to this as a ‘four to three merger,’” Gallant wrote. If so, that “probably met their initial burden of proof.”The companies have tried to address the concerns about higher prices. To win approval of the merger, T-Mobile has pledged to freeze prices for three years, offer free wireless broadband access to 10 million underserved students and roll out a new $15-a-month data plan capped at 2 gigabytes.It’s not clear if Judge Marrero views consolidation as necessarily translating to higher prices, and he expressed doubts about unilateral price increases.Carl Shapiro, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, testified as a expert witness for the states, saying the merger would cost consumers as much as $8.7 billion more. After his testimony, Marrero asked him if the wireless companies would “be so bold” as to raise prices after the merger without also offering better services.Closing arguments are expected later this month, and a ruling could come as early as February.&#92;--With assistance from Erik Larson.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, John J.

2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is chiming in on what’s likely to ensue in the aftermath of T-Mobile U.S. Inc.’s long-sought purchase of Sprint Corp., now that most analysts are saying that “the deal is more likely to break.”Although an approved merger would allow T-Mobile to reap significant synergies, Nomura Instinet’s Jeffrey Kvaal says investors backing the nation’s third-largest wireless service provider are “winners in either scenario.” The equity research firm upgraded T-Mobile to a buy rating from neutral as “a broken deal could remove a sizeable multiple impediment” and restore a modest premium.Shares of T-Mobile gained 0.6% early Tuesday, reversing a decline of as much as 0.6%. The outcome of the offer to buy Sprint has clouded T-Mobile’s growth profile ever since it announced the deal in April 2018. Nomura’s Kvaal predicts a court decision is likely to be come down by early February, and pegs the odds of approval at 45%. According to United First Partners, lawyers representing both companies performed “somewhat better” than state attorneys general’s legal team. Still, analyst Anna Pavlik says not much was seen during the trial last month that would “fundamentally change” the view that AGs will prevail. UFP still figures there’s only a 30% chance the companies beat regulators.Cowen too believes T-Mobile “will experience greater upside” this year if the deal is blocked instead of going through. And while a failed merger would send T-Mobile in search of more spectrum, a denial “would prove a buying opportunity as we estimate the stock is currently worth $96 on a standalone basis,” Colby Synesael, a senior research analyst at Cowen, wrote Monday.

2020-01-08,"The seemingly never-ending ordeal involving the merger of T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) may finally be nearing a resolution. In a rare instance of good fortune, however way you look at it, says Nomura’s Jeff Kvaal, investors in T-Mobile stand to gain from both outcomes of the forthcoming legal decision.The merger between the US’s third and fourth largest mobile carriers has been an ongoing process since it was first announced almost two years ago, in April 2018. The transaction has already gained approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), seemingly the highest obstacle standing in the merger’s path. Arguing the merger is anticompetitive, 14 state attorneys general, including the D.C. attorney general, are suing to block the deal from taking place. On January 15, closing arguments will be presented, following which U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero will decide the outcome, expected to be announced by mid-February.Kvaal’s both sides win scenario is based on a simple analysis. Should the merger gain approval, the deal, according to Kvall could send TMUS stock up to $104 as it fulfills T-Mobile’s objective of obtaining Sprint's mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum and would allow the communications giant “to realize significant synergies.” Not to mention, the new size will allow it to up the competition with the larger AT&T and Verizon.And the downside? There is no downside, argues Kvaal. A rejection of the deal would finally bring resolution to the saga and “could remove a sizeable multiple impediment and restore T-Mobile’s modest premium.” The analyst expects the stock to rise following a rejection, too; Up to $93 by his estimates. The deal has a 45% chance of approval, concludes the analyst.In addition to the imminent solution, Kvall further bolsters the bullish case for TMUS through its higher 4Q net adds. The analyst expounded further, “We expect strong 4Q net add figures from TMobile; we lift our 800,000 postpaid phone estimate just above consensus to 925,000. We are comfortable with our churn (0.90%) and ARPU ($45.76) estimates. This suggests T-Mobile is able to execute crisply through recent price reductions from Verizon and AT&T and mounting cable competition.”In conclusion, the 4-star analyst said, “We believe T-Mobile’s faster sales, EBITDA and FCF growth rates should command a multiple premium to its closest peers.”Unsurprisingly, then, Kvall upgraded his rating on TMUS from Neutral to Buy. The upgrade comes with a new price target of $96, up from $88. Should the target be met, investors pockets will be ringing from gains of 22%. (To watch Kvall’s track record, click here)Kvall’s analysis is reflected in the Street’s confidence in T-Mobile’s prospects, too. 10 Buys and a single Hold coalesce into a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $94.60, the average price target could provide 20% upside. (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks)",T-Mobile (TMUS) Stock Gets a Thumbs Up Ahead of Sprint Merger Decision

2020-01-09,"(Bloomberg) -- States suing to block T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed acquisition of Sprint Corp. urged the federal judge overseeing the landmark antitrust trial not to defer to the Trump administration’s approval of the $26.5 billion deal.Lawyers for New York and California, which are leading the lawsuit for the states, said in a filing late Wednesday in Manhattan that the deal’s approval by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission doesn’t carry any special weight and should be ignored by the judge.“The federal government approved the merger with what appears to be only a cursory examination of the approval conditions,” the states said, and the decision was “inconsistent” with its past opposition to consolidation in the wireless market.The government had asked in a Dec. 20 filing that its approvals be given deference. The response comes as T-Mobile and the states are preparing for closing arguments in the lawsuit next week before U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero. The closings will follow two weeks of testimony in December in which the states tried to show that the combination of the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers would lead to higher prices.The Justice Department’s antitrust division and the FCC signed off on the merger after the companies agreed to sell assets to Dish Network Corp. to set up a new wireless competitor. That remedy is central to T-Mobile’s argument to Marrero.Read MoreT-Mobile’s Sprint Deal Looks Iffy to Traders as Skepticism GrowsTexts Show DOJ Effort to Enlist Senators in T-Mobile DealDish Would Compete With Giants ‘From Day One,’ Ergen SaysSprint Judge Questions Claim That Deal Would Hurt CustomersDuring the trial, the states showed that the head of the antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, took unusual steps to get the deal done, exchanging text messages with Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen. At one point during negotiations, Delrahim suggested Ergen ask his “Senator friends” to contact FCC Chairman Ajit Pai about the deal.Delrahim has been a harsh critic of approving mergers with conditions that impose rules on how companies conduct business. Yet he approved the Sprint deal with just those kind of conditions, the states said in their filing.“DOJ’s antitrust chief previously stated that he does not ‘think [he’s] smart enough’ to design remedies ‘that distort competitive incentives just enough to undo the damage done by a merger, for years to come,’” the states said. “It is unclear what has changed.”Wall Street is increasingly skeptical of the companies’ chances of prevailing. The spread between T-Mobile’s offer price for Sprint and the trading price, an indication of the deal’s risk, swelled to an all-time high Thursday of $3.17 at 2:27 p.m. in New York. Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant sees a 60% chance the judge will rule in favor of the states.Read More: U.S. Sides With T-Mobile in Fight Against States Over SprintIn separate filings Wednesday night, the states and T-Mobile outlined their evidence.The states say the deal would give T-Mobile the power to raise prices by eliminating competition between the two companies and leaving just three major carriers -- AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile. The enlarged company would have a national market share of 34% by revenue, making the deal “presumptively illegal” under antitrust law, they said. And Dish -- a satellite-TV provider with no experience in the wireless market -- won’t be a real competitor, they said.T-Mobile and Sprint countered that the tie-up would actually lead to more competition. By combining the two networks, T-Mobile will have more capacity and lower costs, which in turn will lead to lower prices for consumers. Without the deal, Sprint won’t be unable to upgrade its network infrastructure to remain competitive, they said.“There is no realistic way, aside from the merger, to break the ‘vicious cycle’ of poor network quality leading to subscriber losses and reduced network investment, leading to even worse network quality,” the carrier said. “Sprint is increasing prices, and without the merger it will continue to do so and will retreat from nationwide service.”The case is New York v.

2020-01-10,"In spite all of the uncertainties that have hit the headlines, the stock markets refuse to die. Case in point is this week's recovery from the war incident with Iran. Hours after rockets were falling on American troops in Iraq, stocks made new all-time highs. So, the bulls are in charge until we get a black swan event, and today, we're taking a look at Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock to see if it is a good bet at these levels.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The question of timing is almost never a straightforward answer. Finding perfect entry points into Verizon stock depends on the individual investor time frame. For someone who is looking to stay long far into the future, it is futile to try and time a few dollars above or below current price.Just buy the VZ shares and manage the risk from a long-term perspective. Starting with a partial position makes sense, as this leaves room to average down if price goes against it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, most traders would rather get started on the right foot. No one ever plans on buying a stock knowing it's going to fall first before it rallies. In this case, the Verizon stock chart suggests that there are important levels here that could help with that decision. But first, let's check on its state as of now.  * The Top 15 Stocks to Buy in 2020 Fundamentally, VZ is cheap. It sells at a reasonable 15 price-to-earnings ratio and 1.9 time sales. Furthermore, it pays a 4% dividend, which is much more than what anyone can get from bank deposits these days. Nonetheless, Verizon stock is almost flat in 12 months while T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are up 18% and 29%, respectively, over the same period. Clearly, VZ has some catching up to do. The Particulars of Verizon StockSource: Charts by TradingView For the past 12 months, VZ has tried in vain to break out from the $61 zone. It failed in late March, and then again in May -- which led to a 9% correction to around $54 per share. Verizon stock did rebound sharply from it only to fall back to it again within two months. However, this time and in early September, Verizon stock finally sprang off a double bottom and rallied 14% into the December highs.Since then, VZ gave back about 5% of that rally, but therein lies the actual opportunity here. We already know that it needs to catch up with its competitors, so this is the dip to buy even if it won't turn out to be perfect. Verizon stock has fallen back into an area of proven support.For the last 3 months, it has successfully tested the area around $58.50 per share several times -- so the bulls can rely on it as a proven platform until it fails. Even then, though, Verizon has stronger support above $56 dollars per share. Since they don't ring bells at perfect trade times, this level in Verizon presents a reasonable starting point for anyone looking to invest in the stock. This works for midterm, as well as long-term prospects. Verizon Stock Has History With This LevelSource: Charts by TradingView While Verizon has an excellent reputation, its clients are hardcore fans of it and therefore are loyal. And, unlike AT&T and T-Mobile, VZ is not a slave to the heavy-promotions game. Nonetheless, there is low-odds danger lurking, but with potentially grave consequences that are worth mentioning.Taking a look back to the dot-com bubble era, we see that Verizon stock tripped hard from these levels here. However, the same chart also shows that $52 is a very long-term level in contention -- so it will lend support. Meaning, there is no chasm awaiting investors and there will be plenty of time to gather protection if needed. So, I expect that the recent lows will serve as a base for future higher prices.The other blatant risk here is the fact that the entire stock market is at all-time highs while there are a lot of potential threats still looming. So from that perspective, if the whole stock market corrects from a black swan event, then so will Verizon stock. However, this is not the assumption today. The buyers are in charge inside the current macroeconomic conditions! So, owning Verizon stock makes a world of sense.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-01-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Sprint Corp. bondholders have long bet that the wireless company’s acquisition by T-Mobile US Inc. will be allowed to go through, but by at least one measure, they’re growing more worried about the deal’s potential to get done.The cost to protect Sprint’s debt against default for five years has nearly doubled since September to around 333 basis points, according to ICE Data Services. Credit traders have been digesting court testimony from a takeover challenge brought by Democratic attorneys general. The attorneys, who hail from 13 states and the District of Columbia, say the merger could lead to higher prices and poorer service for consumers. Closing arguments in the case are scheduled for Wednesday.A victory for Sprint could be a boon to bondholders, potentially sending risk premiums on the debt tumbling as much as 200 basis points, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephen Flynn wrote in a note. But if the deal falls apart, the consequences for Sprint could be dire. Flynn said in a separate note Tuesday that Sprint could face ratings downgrades and require a liquidity injection from backer SoftBank Group Corp. To some investors, the debt still looks too risky to buy.“What we try to look at is, ‘Are we being compensated for the risks?’” said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, which doesn’t own Sprint debt. “With Sprint, you absolutely are not.”A spokeswoman for Sprint declined to comment.Analysts are split on the potential outcome of the case. Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant put the odds of a ruling favoring the states at 60% in a note earlier this month, while LightShed Partners’ Walt Piecyk sees a higher likelihood of a decision tipped toward the companies. The spread between T-Mobile’s offer price for Sprint and the trading price rose to around $3.29 a share on Tuesday from a low of 53 cents in May 2018. The higher the gap, the more uncertain the market is of a deal happening.Either outcome would have broad implications for the $1.3 trillion U.S. junk-bond market. With more than $35 billion of long-term debt outstanding, Sprint is the second-largest issuer of speculative-grade notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. T-Mobile is seeking a split debt structure for the combined company, with about 55% of the obligations carrying investment-grade ratings.Sprint, which carries single B range ratings from the three major credit ratings companies, has seen its debt surge since it agreed to combine with higher-rated T-Mobile. Its 7.785% bonds due in 2023 change hands for more than 108 cents on the dollar, up from a low of around 60 cents in early 2016.If the deal fails to close, Sprint will be left to contend with some $25 billion of debt that matures in the next five years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Flynn said in a note that SoftBank may need to invest $3 billion to $5 billion to help the wireless company deal with its upcoming maturities.“If it doesn’t go through, Sprint is on its own,” said Dave Novosel, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit. “At some point over the next year or two years, Sprint is going to need to consider coming to market to refinance some of that debt, which could pressure the market on the whole.&#92;--With assistance from Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Olivia Raimonde in New York at oraimonde@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Natalie Harrison at nharrison73@bloomberg.net, Claire BostonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Sprint Swaps Flash Market Doubts Over Fate of T-Mobile Tie-Up

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Traders who make a living betting on mergers still won’t touch T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp.’s deal with a 10-foot pole. The wireless carriers may have been able to butter up two federal regulatory authorities by using the wonders of a 5G-powered America to distract from their deal’s likely competitive harm. Even so, merger-arbitrage traders live in a world of mathematical probabilities informed by laws and legal precedents, and on that basis, it’s hard to imagine that the judge presiding over a case brought by a group of state attorneys general opposing the deal will rule in the companies’ favor. Lawyers for both sides each delivered closing arguments Wednesday, with a decision from U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero expected to come some time in February. Analysts largely view the odds as a toss-up, if not slightly tipped in T-Mobile and Sprint’s favor. But the equity market paints a meaningfully different picture: The per-share value of T-Mobile's offer is 67% higher than where Sprint's shares are trading, by far the biggest spread of any pending U.S. deal. The wide gap implies that traders see an extremely low likelihood that the transaction gets done, and Sprint options activity is sending the same signal.Of course, this also means that if the companies do win in court, some traders popping antacids right now stand to make a substantial return. But for the most part, arbitrageurs have chosen to stay away. “This is one of those seminal situations in merger arb history,” said Roy Behren, a portfolio manager for the Merger Fund at Westchester Capital Management, which oversees $4 billion of assets. He found T-Mobile and Sprint’s arguments persuasive — that together the companies will be able to build out a nationwide 5G service faster, and that Sprint doesn't have the capital or scale it needs to compete. But the potential downside is painfully large, and so it’s simply too hard to make a bet on what will happen. “We like the case, but that doesn’t mean we want to risk shareholders’ money on something where we don’t have a huge conviction,” Behren said in a phone interview. The case may come down to Dish Network Corp. and its assigned role in ensuring the U.S. wireless market remains competitive. Makan Delrahim, the head antitrust enforcer at the Department of Justice, is placing incredible faith in Dish that it can fill the hole Sprint leaves behind and become a formidable new competitor to T-Mobile, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., even though it will most likely take years for Dish to live up to those expectations.T-Mobile has relied heavily on the argument that its brand as the customer-first “Un-carrier” means it can be trusted not to raise prices in the meantime, Blair Levin, an analyst for New Street Research, wrote in a report this week. The idea is that with Sprint, it will be able to spread out its network costs across a larger subscriber base and thus keep plan rates low. But as the state attorneys general have noted, AT&T and Verizon have greater scale and higher prices. Judges look at facts and precedent. Just as there was a compelling case to make against AT&T acquiring Time Warner last year in what amounted to a massive vertical consolidation of market power, it was hard to articulate this with facts and not just speculation about what might happen, because of the lack of precedent. The judge in that matter said early on, “I guess I have to get a crystal ball,” which judges do not like to do, and sure enough, he opted to stick with the facts as they were. The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission have already given their blessing, which carries weight and could mean Judge Marrero will, too. But then if they could look in a crystal ball and see the consequence of doing so, they may not like what they see. Even the stock market knows that the deal shouldn’t go through.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-02-04,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 6 and no one cares.Source: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com Analysts expect earnings of about $750 million, 83 cents per share, on revenue of $11.8 billion. They're hoping for 88 cents.But none of it matters so long as the merger with Sprint (NYSE:S) remains in question. The deal, announced nearly two years ago, is now before U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, although the U.S. Federal Communication Commission gave the companies its blessing in October.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBeyond the court decision, the California Public Utility Commission has yet to give its blessing. The merger could drag on until summer, and some analysts now think it may not happen at all. Failure Is Now an OptionWhat happens if the merger fails? Most analysts expect T-Mobile to come out OK.T-Mobile shares were trading Feb. 4 near $80, a market capitalization of $69 billion and a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 20.7. That's for a company with expected 2019 revenue of $44.5 billion, bringing about 7.5 cents of each dollar to the net income line. The company has lost just 3% of its value since the Sprint deal was announced.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy For Insulation From Volatility The balance sheet shows about $11 billion in long-term debt on $86 billion in assets. Those are better numbers than Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), although Verizon has a fat dividend yielding 4.1% and T-Mobile has none. T-Mobile could launch a dividend if the deal dies, or resume stock buybacks.T-Mobile could also put itself up for sale. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), for instance, has a re-sale deal with both T-Mobile and Sprint. Its Google Fi is what's called a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). I use it, and it's a bargain.It's far more likely that Sprint would be picked apart, and this could provide some big opportunities for speculators.That's because Sprint stock is down about 40% since the T-Mobile deal was announced. Sprint, which is controlled by SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY), decided to skip a recent 5G spectrum auction, assuming it would be acquired.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was reportedly sniffing around Boost Mobile, a Sprint MVNO, before Sprint agreed to sell it, and other assets, to Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) to get the deal done.Yes, there are many moving parts here. What About 5G?The biggest problem, in the event of merger failure, would be T-Mobile's plans for 5G service, which would have to evolve very quickly.  It would be forced, for now, to deploy on high- and low-band spectrum, foregoing Sprint's mid-band holdings.But it has already lit up a 600 MHz 5G network and has been advertising it to customers. T-Mobile also has the cash to be a bidder on the so-called C-Band auction, with frequencies between 3.7-4.2 GHz, later this year. The Bottom Line on T-Mobile StockSpeculators might want to step in now and grab some Sprint shares, while investors can step up to T-Mobile with confidence.T-Mobile is a relative bargain among telecom stocks and should continue churning out profits even without Sprint. Sprint, meanwhile, is subject to being bought in pieces, and this provides an opportunity.If the FCC really wants to provide competition in this space, what would be more competitive than letting Amazon or Google in? Both are now worth about $1 trillion, while Sprint's market cap is down to $18.6 billion. Google is already a Sprint MVNO. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which has been trying to sell itself as a wireless carrier under the Xfinity brand, could also be a bidder.New deals, in short, are guaranteed if the old deals fail to happen. Buying now puts you in the frame to profit from them.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2020-02-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A messy situation risked becoming irreversibly messier.The $35 billion(1)fight over fifth-generation mobile spectrum involves the Federal Communications Commission; a handful of foreign-domiciled satellite operators that think they deserve the bulk of the proceeds (at least one of which desperately needs the money); the U.S. national wireless services providers that want the bandwidth as soon as possible; and a host of politicians keen for American taxpayers to get what they see as their rightful due. Then, just before FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s Thursday announcement on how things should go down, one of those players appeared to threaten to throw a temper tantrum if it didn’t get its way. Luxembourg-based Intelsat SA was considering a possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing if the regulators doesn’t increase the compensation it receives for giving up some of its airwaves, according to a Wednesday report by my Bloomberg News colleague Todd Shields.If it was a negotiating ploy, it seemed to work. It placed the burden on the FCC to settle the situation quickly or risk putting the U.S. behind other leading nations in getting 5G off the ground, with all of the rewards that promises. Shields reported on Thursday, that the FCC had reached a settlement with the satellite firms. The details will reveal whether Intelsat’s gambit paid off.QuicktakeHow Race to 5G in U.S. Hit Speed Bump Called C-BandIntelsat and rival SES, also based in Luxembourg, currently hold the licenses for about 90% of what’s known as the C-Band, a tranche of mobile spectrum that’s ideally suited for 5G networks. They were granted these licences decades ago, and have been using them to transmit programming to TV and radio stations around the U.S.When the FCC’s Pai said two years ago that he planned to make the C-Band available for 5G, shareholders in the satellite peers sensed a bonanza from selling the spectrum licences. Intelstat’s stock climbed ninefold over the next seven months, although the increase in enterprise value was more muted due to its considerable debt pile, of which more later.But then came the complications. The satellite companies have been pushing for a private auction, which they said would be faster, and one that ensured as the current license holders they’d be the main beneficiaries. The FCC wants to hold a public auction, which could take years, with most of the proceeds going directly into public coffers. But because the satellite firms would have to replace billions of dollars worth of equipment, which might otherwise interfere with 5G, the FCC will have to reimburse them for those costs, while also giving them a strong enough financial incentive to carry out the work quickly.Intelsat needs the money more than the others. Its $14 billion net debt pile represents a staggering 12 times Ebitda — largely a legacy of its ownership by private equity firms before its 2013 initial public offering. SES’s debt is just three times Ebitda. On the other side of the equation, carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc. want access to the C-Band as quickly as possible in order to accelerate the pace of the 5G rollout. They don’t particularly care who receives the lion’s share of the proceeds, though they do want to keep costs down. And they might stomach higher costs if they get access sooner. Any move toward a Chapter 11 filing by Intelsat would significantly slow down the process by tying up its assets.And so while the FCC certainly doesn’t exist to enrich companies based on foreign soil, it’s been in a position of needing to carefully consider its important role of setting the best playing field for American businesses and consumers alike. And where 5G is concerned, speed is of the essence. At any rate, while both SES and Intelsat are technically domiciled in Luxembourg, their headquarters, management teams and most of their investors are in the U.S.To keep all stakeholders happy, the FCC probably needs to hand more of the proceeds to the satellite firms. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephen Flynn estimates that Intelsat needs at least $6 billion to reduce its debt to manageable levels. The FCC has privately indicated the total pot available to the satellite firms would be less than $10 billion, of which Intelsat would get no more than 45%, Bloomberg News reported last month. Frankly, a private auction would have been the most expedient option. Political pressure means the FCC won’t follow that route. It’s a catch-22 situation, as my colleague Tara Lachapelle wrote in November.But given that the FCC has already done the U.S. telecommunications industry a huge favor by clearing the acquisition of Sprint Corp. by T-Mobile US Inc. and thereby reducing the competition, it should probably be prepared to seek greater 5G proceeds and hand more over to the satellite companies. Is that fair? Not really. But in the interests of a faster auction, and thereby a faster 5G rollout, Intelsat seems to have given it little alternative.(Updates to reflect reports that the satellite providers have reached a deal with federal regulators.)(1) Some have estimated the proceeds could reach $77 billionTo contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-02-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Sprint Corp., meant to be acquired by T-Mobile US Inc. in a pending $26.5 billion takeover, spent the past year in a steady swoon -- and that was fine with Deutsche Telekom AG, T-Mobile’s parent company.Federal regulators have approved the combination of the two smallest national wireless carriers, but a group of state attorneys general has sued to block the deal, saying it could reduce competition and harm consumers. A federal judge has heard testimony from both sides and is expected to return with a decision within weeks.Sprint’s value has eroded as the deal hangs in limbo. The carrier’s market capitalization has fallen to about $20 billion from last July’s peak of $33 billion, putting it back where it was on April 9, 2018, a day before reports that the companies had resumed talks. The stock fell as much as 3.7% on Monday.Two factors are weighing on the stock: concerns about the deal’s completion, and the absence of a guaranteed price if the deal is approved. T-Mobile and Sprint haven’t renewed the merger agreement since it expired Nov. 1. And while there have been “not hostile” discussions of several issues, including price, Deutsche Telekom appears to be in no rush to stop Sprint’s free fall by drawing up a new agreement.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere was still optimistic that the deal would get final clearance, he said on an earnings conference call Thursday. Once it’s approved and the deal closes, the terms of the merger could change, he said. If the agreement needs to be amended, “including possibly price, we would handle that very swiftly after the deal was approved,” Legere said.As far as negotiation leverage goes, Sprint’s in a tough spot, said Walt Piecyk, an analyst with LightShed Partners.“Sprint has no alternative but to take whatever DT and T-Mobile offers them,” Piecyk said. “There’s really nothing else they can do.”Third TimeThis is the third time T-Mobile and Sprint have made a run at a merger. The current attempt gained momentum after T-Mobile convinced antitrust officials at the Justice Department and regulators at the Federal Communications Commission that a combination with Sprint would make a more formidable competitor to larger rivals AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.The nod came after the companies agreed to divest Sprint’s Boost prepaid business as part of a package of assets that Dish Network Corp. would use to enter the wireless-service business as a new competitor.For Sprint, the buyout is a lifeline. The company has said it would be unable to compete effectively on its own. Sprint has about $40 billion in debt and faces a costly network upgrade to catch up with rivals on service quality and next-generation 5G wireless technology.It’s unclear whether the company can fund itself in the long run without help from its parent SoftBank Group Corp. or T-Mobile, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephen Flynn.Sprint continues to slide on the uncertainty of a merger, potentially improving the takeover terms for Deutsche Telekom, and yet the alternative for Sprint -- no deal -- is worse, Piecyk said.“The downside for Sprint,” he said, “is that the stock goes to zero.”(Updates with shares in third paragraph.

2020-02-11,"The record rally in Sprint Corp.'s stock  after a federal judge approved its merger with fellow wireless company T-Mobile US Inc.  has lifted prices way above levels seen after previous merger hurdles were cleared, but was well below current valuations under the original deal's terms. Sprint's stock raced up 73.1% to $8.31, topping the previous record one-day rally of 27.7% seen on July 25, 2016. When the merger was originally announced on Sunday, April 29, 2018, the deal terms, based on the April 27 closing prices of $6.50 for Sprint and $64.52 for T-Mobile US, valued Sprint's stock at $6.62, or 20.3% below current levels. After the Department of Justice approved the deal on July 26, 2019, Sprint shares hiked up 7.4% to $7.99. But under the same deal terms and based on T-Mobile US's current stock price--the stock is up 11.6% at $94.35--Sprint would be valued at $9.68, or 16.5% above current levels. Sprint's stock has rallied 40% over the past 12 months and T-Mobile US shares have climbed 38%, while the S&P 500  has gained 24%.",Sprint stock's record rally sends prices well above valuations of original deal's terms

2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The merger of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. is an abomination. It reduces the number of wireless companies to three from four, defies decades of legal precedents and all but assures higher prices for consumers. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Tara Lachapelle lays out all the sorry details here.I’d like to aim my focus on the deal’s investment banker: Makan Delrahim. True, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust department wasn’t officially the investment banker.(1)But unofficially, the man responsible for deciding whether the deal would proceed worked hard behind the scenes to make it happen. He ought to get a fee.The Obama administration had rejected the deal earlier, and most analysts thought President Donald Trump’s Justice Department would turn it down as well. One of the big issues was what the deal would mean for the next-generation wireless network, known as 5G. If T-Mobile and Sprint merged, another company that was willing and able to build its own 5G network to compete with the other wireless carriers would have to come to the fore.According to texts that were made public as part of a lawsuit, Delrahim “played a crucial role in bringing together top executives of T-Mobile, Sprint and another company, Dish Network LLC, for negotiations,” as the New York Times put it. He coached executives of the three companies on how to approach legislators and persuade them to put pressure on Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, which also had to approve the deal. He gave his personal email address to Dish Chairman Charles Ergen so they could communicate behind the scenes.In the end, T-Mobile agreed to give Dish access to its network while the latter company — which has plenty of spectrum but has never been in the phone business — built its 5G competitor. (T-Mobile also made the somewhat unlikely promise that it would cover 97% of the U.S. with its own 5G network within three years.) Having brokered the Dish deal, Delrahim then approved T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint.In an article about Delrahim’s involvement, the Times said that “it is not unusual for a law enforcement official to work behind the scenes to help companies overcoming antitrust concerns.” In fact, it is extremely unusual — or at least it was before the Trump administration came along. Government regulators aren’t supposed to broker deals; they’re supposed to judge whether they pass antitrust muster.Usually, state attorneys general and the Justice Department are aligned on whether or not a deal should be approved. Not this time. When 13 states (plus the District of Columbia) sued to block the merger, Delrahim didn’t leave it to the companies to defend their deal. The Justice Department filed a brief on the side of the companies.If the states prevailed, he told the court, it would create chaos in the merger market because companies could no longer be sure that federal approval was all they needed to make a deal. He said that his division had expertise that the states lacked and therefore the court should defer to federal antitrust officials. Earlier, he told the Wall Street Journal that he “worries the merger market could suffer if the states prevail”— as if that’s his job.Why was Delrahim so gung-ho to push through the T-Mobile-Sprint deal? Because his boss, President Trump, wants to see the U.S. beat China in the race to establish 5G as the standard network — and that’s what T-Mobile was essentially promising. As regular readers know, the antitrust chief has consistently carried Trump’s water, opposing deals proposed by companies the president wanted to punish, like AT&T-Time Warner, while waving through deals proposed by his allies, like Disney-21st Century Fox. Most absurd of all, Delrahim’s division even sued the auto companies — on antitrust grounds — that sided with California over Washington in a fight over emissions standards. (The suit was dropped late last week.)Delrahim is one of the more public members of the Trump administration. He regularly gives high-minded speeches before groups that have an interest in antitrust law. He often harks back to old Supreme Court decisions, to important moments in antitrust, to the importance of protecting consumer welfare. To hear him talk, you’d think he was just as concerned with the rule of law as any of his predecessors.But to watch him act — as he just did during the T-Mobile-Sprint deal — is to realize that he’s just another Trump lackey putting the president before the people he’s supposed to serve.(1) The real bankers, interestingly, were two relatively new players: PJT Partners Inc., which advised T-Mobile US Inc., and the Raine Group, which counts Sprint’s parent Softbank Group Corp. among its clients.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On Tuesday, U.S. antitrust officials began digging into whether past acquisitions made by technology giants such as Google and Facebook hurt competition and left them with too much power. On Tuesday, the U.S. also approved one of the most anticompetitive megadeals ever in the tech sphere. Yes, that’s whiplash you feel. And it’s antitrust enforcement in the era of President Donald Trump. The Federal Trade Commission said it ordered Google’s parent Alphabet Inc., as well as Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp., to turn over information “on the terms, scope, structure, and purpose” of deals the companies did between 2010 and 2019. It’s taking a particular interest in smaller, more discreet transactions that, because of their size, may have slid past regulatory scrutiny at the time, but still might have set off red flags. Last summer, the Justice Department also began its own investigation into overreach by Big Tech.The FTC’s latest move came just hours after a federal judge gave his blessing to T-Mobile US Inc.’s takeover of Sprint Corp., a deal that will consolidate the U.S. wireless market down to three national carriers by eliminating one of its lower-cost providers. The merger, when contemplated in years past, was considered dead on arrival because of the harm it might cause consumers. But last year, Ajit Pai, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, and Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, went ahead and approved the transaction.Not only that, text messages revealed during the recent trial showed Delrahim was encouraging Charlie Ergen — a billionaire key to T-Mobile and Sprint getting their done — to lobby the FCC for help by telling him to ask his “senator friends” to contact Pai. Ergen’s Dish Network Corp. was Delrahim’s solution, albeit a weak one, to the antitrust concerns raised by the merger. The companies have agreed to give Dish access to their network while the satellite-TV provider builds its own 5G wireless service over the next few years, though by the time Dish wireless is up and running the damage of T-Mobile’s newfound pricing power may be done. The two matters — Big Tech and T-Mobile-Sprint — provide a glimpse into the Trump administration’s contradictory view of antitrust regulation. The tech giants do probably need to be reined in, have been irresponsible with consumer data and have likely stifled competition by swallowing nascent rivals along the way. But they also happen to be companies Trump sees as unfriendly to his presidency, and at times it’s hard to untangle his administration’s efforts from the capricious reality-TV-show persona that’s out for personal vengeance. He's railed against Amazon and the low taxes it pays while also often voicing irritation at critical coverage of the White House by the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.When AT&T Inc. was trying to buy Time Warner, the parent of Trump’s perceived nemesis CNN, he repeatedly ordered Gary Cohn, then-director of the National Economic Council, to ensure the deal was stopped, according to a New Yorker article last March. Delrahim did sue to block the transaction, but the judge sided with the companies.That makes Delrahim’s support of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger — which unlike the AT&T-Time Warner deal involves two direct competitors in an already highly concentrated market — all the more curious. My colleague Joe Nocera has labeled him the deal’s unofficial investment banker. With Trump, the rationale is less of a mystery: Proponents of the deal have argued that it will help the U.S. beat China in the race to 5G (although it’s unclear how blocking the deal would have the opposite effect).Over at the FCC, the review of T-Mobile-Sprint was unusual as well and became fiercely divided along party lines. Pai, a Republican, broke with tradition by voicing his support for the transaction and securing concessions with the companies before his own agency colleagues (and counterparts at the DOJ) had the chance to complete their analyses. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, had said it looked “like some backroom dealing” and was “the worst of what people expect from Washington.” And as the FTC and DOJ now crack down on Big Tech, Pai is the figure responsible for repealing net neutrality. It’s good that regulators are taking a closer look at tech deals, but mixed messages with political overtones aren’t helping the administration’s efforts. If it was truly interested in policing harmful deals, why did T-Mobile’s Sprint merger get such a glowing endorsement? To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile US Inc. is poised to close its long-sought merger with Sprint Corp., a deal that will reshape the U.S. wireless industry, after winning approval from a federal judge who rejected a state lawsuit against the tie-up.The two companies said Tuesday they expect to close as soon as April 1 after U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan said the states failed to persuade him that a merger of the No. 3 and 4 carriers would harm consumers.“Today was a huge victory for this merger,” T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere said in a statement. “We are finally able to focus on the last steps to get this merger done!”The ruling comes almost two years after the merger was announced. The companies had bet on a favorable reception from the Trump administration, which signed on to the deal last year. Regulators under President Barack Obama in 2014 rebuffed an earlier merger proposal out of fear that consolidating the market would lead to higher prices.Now the tie-up will give T-Mobile added heft to take on industry leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. The new T-Mobile will overtake AT&T in total number of regular monthly subscribers.For T-Mobile’s parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG, the deal reduces the German company’s reliance on Europe, where carriers are struggling to grow amid fierce competition and where its biggest rival -- Vodafone Group Plc -- bolstered its position by buying continental cable assets from Liberty Global Plc. T-Mobile’s importance for Deutsche Telekom has grown steadily in recent years and currently accounts for about half of group sales, up from about a third in 2014.Approval of the deal will come as a huge relief for Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp. and its chairman, Masayoshi Son, who had faced the prospect of having to bail out Sprint if the deal were blocked. Now, the entrepreneur can better plug SoftBank as a technology investment powerhouse, allowing him to focus his energies on the $100 billion Vision Fund.Shares of Sprint soared 74% to $8.33 at 9:56 a.m. in New York from Monday’s closing price of $4.80. T-Mobile gained 11% to $94.13.T-Mobile and Sprint haven’t renewed the merger agreement since it lapsed on Nov. 1. T-Mobile has suggested there could be new terms, including on the price. Before the merger can close, it still needs approvals from California’s utility board and a federal judge in Washington who must sign off on the Justice Department’s settlement allowing the deal.In his decision, Marrero rejected key arguments from the states: that the merged company would raise prices for lower quality service and that Sprint could remain as a viable competitor without the merger.“T-Mobile has redefined itself over the past decade as a maverick that has spurred the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes,” the judge wrote. “The proposed merger would allow the merged company to continue T-Mobile’s undeniably successful business strategy for the foreseeable future.”Consumer advocates blasted the decision as dangerous for wireless subscribers even with a settlement approved by federal regulators that envision Dish Network Corp. entering the market as a new wireless competitor. With the core satellite-TV business in decline, Charlie Ergen, the Dish co-founder and chairman, has amassed a trove of airwaves to build a state-of-the-art wireless network.“Going from four established nationwide wireless networks to only three -- with the possibility that we might someday, eventually, get some version of a fourth network added back into the mix -- will be extremely damaging to competition,” George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports, said.Marrero’s ruling is a major setback for New York Attorney General Letitia James and her California counterpart, Xavier Becerra, who led the litigation for states representing more than 40% of the U.S. population. James said in a statement her office is considering an appeal.“From the start, this merger has been about massive corporate profits over all else, and despite the companies’ false claims, this deal will endanger wireless subscribers where it hurts most: their wallets,” she said.The states argued without success that the merger would lead to billions of dollars in extra costs for consumers, with wireless customers in urban areas being hit particularly hard. They also said the deal wouldn’t work out as planned because Dish was unlikely to be able to follow through on its commitments to become a viable wireless competitor.During the two-week trial, Marrero at one point expressed doubt that the new T-Mobile would “be so bold” as to raise prices after the merger without also offering better service, pushing back on testimony by an expert hired by the states who predicted that customers of the four biggest providers could see combined increases of as much as $8.7 billion, with $4.6 billion from T-Mobile alone.The defense also presented evidence that Sprint couldn’t survive without the deal. Legere had testified that Sprint would be “sold for parts” if the merger didn’t go through.The states’ lawsuit was the last major hurdle to the deal after it was approved by regulators at the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department’s antitrust division. The states that sued had urged Marrero after the trial not to give any extra weight to the federal government’s decision, calling the government’s review of the deal “cursory.”&#92;--With assistance from Chris Dolmetsch and Stefan Nicola.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net;Erik Larson in New York at elarson4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, ;Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Joe Schneider, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",T-Mobile Ready to Close Sprint Deal After Defeating State Suit

2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile US Inc. won court approval for its $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp., defeating a state-led lawsuit that sought to block the industry-altering wireless deal.The decision by a district judge in Manhattan is a huge win for T-Mobile and its owner Deutsche Telekom AG, as well as SoftBank Group Corp., Sprint’s parent. The combined company, which will operate under the T-Mobile name, will have a regular monthly subscriber base of about 80 million -- in the same league as AT&T Inc., which has 75 million subscribers, and Verizon Communications Inc., which has 114 million.After the merger, T-Mobile will have more spectrum -- the frequencies through which wireless signals are transmitted -- than any other carrier. This larger capacity will give the combined company an advantage as the industry transitions to the next generation of wireless technology, the much-faster 5G standard.The ruling comes almost two years after the deal was first announced. The states’ lawsuit was the last major hurdle to the deal after it secured the blessing of regulators at the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department’s antitrust division. It still needs approvals from California’s utility board and a federal judge in Washington who must sign off on the Justice Department settlement.Deutsche Telekom shares rose as much as 3.6% to 15.40 euros in Frankfurt. Shares of Sprint soared 66% to $7.95 in pre-market trading in New York after closing at $4.80 Monday in New York. T-Mobile extended gains to as much as 8.4% to $91.88.The ruling is also a victory for Dish Network Corp. co-founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen, who is buying assets from the two carriers to set up a new wireless network. With his company’s core satellite TV business in decline, Ergen has amassed a trove of airwaves to build a state-of-the-art network.ConcessionsTo win federal approval, T-Mobile and Sprint had agreed to sell multiple assets to Dish in order to create a new fourth competitor. The new Dish wireless network will start life with about 9 million subscribers.T-Mobile and Sprint haven’t renewed the merger agreement since it lapsed on Nov. 1. And while there have been “not hostile” discussions of several issues, including price, T-Mobile has suggested there could be new terms.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere said last week he was still optimistic that the deal would go through, though the terms could change. If the agreement needs to be amended, “including possibly price, we would handle that very swiftly after the deal was approved,” he said.As far as negotiation leverage goes, Sprint’s in a tough spot, said Walt Piecyk, an analyst with LightShed Partners. “Sprint has no alternative but to take whatever DT and T-Mobile offers them,” he said. “There’s really nothing else they can do.”T-Mobile and Sprint had been the most aggressive U.S. wireless companies in terms of price competition in recent years, forcing AT&T and Verizon to follow moves like ending service contracts and adopting unlimited data plans. The proposed combination came under fire from lawmakers and consumer advocates who said it would lead to higher prices and fewer services, especially for poor and rural consumers.The companies had pursued a combination for several years, but a proposed deal was twice rejected as anti-competitive under the previous administration. After the FCC approved the deal, the all-Democratic group of attorneys general filed suit. The Justice Department then gave its approval, leading to a rare split between states and the federal government over antitrust enforcement.“This is exactly the sort of consumer-harming, job-killing mega-merger our antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the time.Tackling ConcernsLegere tried to address these concerns by promising to not raise prices for three years. He is credited with helping to remake T-Mobile into an industry maverick, and pitched the Sprint takeover as a way to compete against industry leaders Verizon and AT&T.Legere announced in November that he will be handing off the job to Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert in May, but plans to remain on the combined company’s board.One of their central pitches was that the deal would advance the introduction of 5G. The companies pledged to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in May that they would deploy a 5G network covering 97% of the U.S. population within three years and 99% within six.(Updates share prices in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Stefan Nicola, Chris Dolmetsch and Courtney Dentch.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Erik Larson in New York at elarson4@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob Golum, Jennifer RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",T-Mobile Wins Court Approval for $26.5 Billion Sprint Deal

2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A U.S. judge has ruled in favor of T-Mobile US Inc.’s deal for Sprint Corp., joining President Donald Trump’s competition regulators in their perplexing move to approve a merger that has the potential to go down in history as among the most harmful to American consumers.  District Court Judge Victor Marrero issued his decision Tuesday morning, handing a surprise victory to T-Mobile and Sprint. News reports will call it a blow to the group of state attorneys general who brought the lawsuit to try to stop the merger, but it’s a bigger blow to wireless-phone customers. They  may see plan prices creep up as a consequence of a more concentrated industry to be dominated by the new T-Mobile, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., even though the judge wasn’t convinced that would be the case. The companies’ triumph comes as a shock to investors, who rightly saw all legal precedent and conventional wisdom about antitrust regulation pointing to the deal getting blocked. Indeed, previous government administrations did deem a T-Mobile-Sprint deal off limits for the same reasons. In recent weeks, shares of Sprint traded at a massive discount to the value of T-Mobile’s offer — some days a spread as wide as 80% — in a sign of traders’ apprehension about the deal’s fate. Sprint’s stock price shot up Tuesday on word of the ruling.The deal will give T-Mobile a level of market power it’s never had by removing its fiercest and cut-rate competitor, Sprint. It effectively calls off the industry price wars that their own rivalry sparked in recent years. These skirmishes benefited consumers who were presented with affordable unlimited-data plans as smartphones became the center of communication.In court, the state lawyers, led by Letitia James of New York, argued that allowing T-Mobile to buy Sprint would result in costlier service. “No, it won’t, just trust us,” was essentially the companies’ response, with T-Mobile CEO John Legere figuratively waving a 5G-embossed American flag in one hand, his other fingers crossed behind his back.The companies pushed the notion that a combined T-Mobile-Sprint will be better-equipped to deliver the ultra-fast next generation of wireless networks to Americans, creating the illusion that without the deal, the country’s 5G ambitions would be somehow diminished. And yet the biggest beneficiary of this deal’s approval is a Japanese billionaire by the name of Masayoshi Son, whose telecommunications conglomerate, SoftBank Group Corp. of WeWork investment-disaster fame, is also Sprint’s controlling shareholder. Selling to T-Mobile bails him out of a bet gone wrong on the U.S. wireless market’s weakest player and instead hands him a stake in the fastest-growing player. (To be sure, the terms of the all-stock deal are likely to be renegotiated to account for Sprint’s shrinking value since the transaction was initially struck in April 2018.)It all proved to be a persuasive enough argument for Ajit Pai, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, and Makan Delrahim, the Department of Justice’s antitrust chief, who each approved the transaction in exchange for mild concessions. Both were appointed by Trump, who has been cheerleading for the U.S. to lead in the so-called 5G race, namely against China. The states emerged as an unusual last line of legal defense, and their defeat could embolden more companies operating as direct competitors in similarly highly concentrated industries to pursue tie-ups. Ironically, the Trump administration this week asked Congress for more funds to expand its antitrust oversight. “Because God has a terrific sense of humor, yesterday was the day the DOJ announced it was adding 87 new staffers and a 71% budget increase for the antitrust division,” Blair Levin, a U.S. policy and regulation analyst for New Street Research, wrote in a report Tuesday morning. “Is it to deal with all the new cases that, based on this precedent, will now be viable?”Regulators have placed incredible faith in Dish Network Corp. and its wily chairman, Charlie Ergen, to help maintain competition in the wireless market by putting the satellite-TV billionaire on the receiving end of T-Mobile and Sprint’s concessions. Dish, a wireless wannabe, will have access to T-Mobile’s network while it constructs its own using the spectrum licenses Ergen has stockpiled over the years. But Dish has a long way to go to ever fill the hole that Sprint will leave behind. Some say Sprint would be gone soon anyway because of its financial distress, and therefore T-Mobile should be allowed to acquire it before Verizon and AT&T get to dance on its grave. But if the only options are a) allow a merger that makes the market leaders even more powerful, or b) block the merger, allow Sprint to die and open the door for concentration to happen another way, then that right there signals too much market power is already held in too few hands. It’s also hard to imagine that Sprint, a willing seller that has 42 million retail wireless subscribers and a boatload of valuable spectrum, wouldn’t attract other acquirers if a T-Mobile deal were blocked. Now we’ll never know. When the FCC, DOJ and a federal judge all agree that a merger should get the A-OK, the decision may be presumed justified. But fascination with 5G and Dish’s maybe-someday entry doesn’t change this: reducing the market from four to three national carriers can’t possibly be good for consumers. As for Sprint shareholders, it's a good day to buy a lotto ticket.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-02-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- SoftBank Group Corp.’s chairman took to the stage Wednesday afternoon to gloat about the company’s return to profit in a horrible year and to name drop some of the wonderful companies in his orbit. But the most important name of all was missing: Paul Elliott Singer. Getting top billing in Masayoshi Son’s earnings presentation was Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which netted the Japanese company a 331.9 billion yen ($3 billion) paper gain for the fourth quarter, and telecom arm SoftBank Corp., contributor of 244 billion yen in operating profit. Sprint Corp. also added to the bottom line, though investors were more excited Wednesday about the long-awaited approval of its merger with T-Mobile US Inc.Son couldn’t escape mentioning WeWork, formally know as The We Co., because it’s the elephant in the room weighing down the Vision Fund and by extension all of SoftBank. The $100 billion fund now has 88 portfolio companies. But Elliott Management Corp., the investment firm founded by Singer, was conspicuous by its absence in Son’s vocabulary. As a result, his evasion became an unintended key feature of his entire live performance.The famous activist investor was still there, writ large in a statement titled “SoftBank Group Adopts Enhanced Governance Standards for Investments.” Just last week, Elliott confirmed it had taken a nearly $3 billion stake in SoftBank because it saw room to close the gap between the value ascribed by equity investors and what its own balance sheet indicates. That news helped drive SoftBank’s share price up 8% for the largest gain in a year, a jump that was topped just a few days later when  the merger of the two U.S. telecom firms passed the final hurdle.Elliott has three key strategies that it hopes SoftBank can implement to boost the stock: a $20 billion share buyback, more independent directors, and better corporate governance, especially with regard to its investments.SoftBank’s press release on the governance, though, looks to be lip service rather than any kind of deep-seated reform. The four paragraph statement used the term standards eight times, but doesn’t actually detail what they are. We’re required to have faith that they exist and are robust. This new corporate governance policy wasn’t mentioned in the 83-page financial statement, and Son didn’t provide any details during two hours on stage. It wasn’t until two minutes from the end of Son’s set remarks that he even acknowledged Elliott, and then not by name but merely as “an activist investor.” He used the reference simply as proof that his pet peeve — that SoftBank’s share price severely lags its book value — was shared by others.Only during the Q&A session did Elliott’s name first get mentioned  — by a reporter. Son’s response, and many that followed, were consistent in dodging not only Elliott’s core demands but in recognizing that the U.S. fund even had a valid point. He demurred on the topic of buybacks, noting that they'd been done in the past. He claimed to have had plans to appoint more independent directors even before Elliott brought it up. He indicated that improving standards was already on the radar.Investors hoping for some contrition after the WeWork disaster — which saw SoftBank bail out the office rental company after an aborted IPO — would be sorely disappointed. Anyone believing that Son might suddenly discover the importance of enhanced management standards is naive. In his own words, corporate governance of startups is exercised by simply not investing in a problematic company.About the closest Son got to acknowledging any weaknesses in his strategy of making huge bets on unprofitable companies in the hope they’ll come good was to admit that he’d dialed back the size of the planned $108 billion SoftBank Vision Fund 2  — a possibility I foreshadowed last month. Smaller and more circumspect bets may now be on the table.Even before this second act, investors will need to contend with the more immediate fact that the Alibaba IPO was a one-time bonus, while the rest of SoftBank’s portfolio is at the mercy of stock markets at a time when the coronavirus epidemic is sending share prices on a roller-coaster ride.So while people may have high hopes about the role Elliott could play in spurring SoftBank to change its ways, they ought to take note of the fact that Son barely utters the name.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-02-12,"T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) won clearance to merge from a federal judge Tuesday, sending T-Mobile shares up 12%, and Sprint shares up 77.5% by close of trading yesterday.Rejecting arguments by a group of state attorneys general that allowing the companies to merge would encourage anticompetitive behavior, U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero demurred that to the contrary, T-Mobile's &quot;maverick&quot; ways have historically forced &quot;the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes&quot; to compete with it. In the judge's view, allowing the merger will in fact help &quot;to continue T-Mobile's undeniably successful business strategy for the foreseeable future.&quot;To that end, T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert promised to press ahead and try to complete his company's acquisition of Sprint by April 1. With the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission already having given the deal their blessing, this merger should finally happen -- two years after it was first announced.Or not.Not all analysts are convinced this story is over just yet. In a note released immediately after the judge's verdict, Nomura analyst Jeff Kvaal warned that &quot;we expect the state AGs to appeal.&quot; RBC Capital analyst Jonathan Atkin noted that such an appeal, if filed, could delay closing of the merger by &quot;an additional 4-5&quot; months -- potentially delaying closure until September 2020.Delay or no delay, Kvaal believes T-Mobile/Sprint have the advantage at this point, and puts the likelihood of the merger closing eventually at about 80%. (And accordingly, Kvaal raised his price target on T-Mobile stock today to $102 per share, implying there's a further 8% upside to be gained.Even if he's wrong about that, though, Kvaal argues that if the merger is dashed on appeal, a &quot;standalone&quot; T-Mobile would still be worth $93 on its own. And that means that even after Tuesday's price rise, there's little downside in the stock. (And again, potentially 8% upside).Over the last three months, TMUS stock has received a whopping 8 Buy ratings and just 2 Hold ratings. As a result, the stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus rating. (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks)But what about T-Mobile's rivals AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ)? Where does the judge's decision leave them?In the short term, Kvaal argues that disruption from T-Mobile's efforts to integrate its and Sprint's customers is likely to spike &quot;churn&quot; at the latter company, and predicts at least some Sprint customers will jump ship for AT&T or Verizon -- the more so as both these companies are expected to &quot;exploit&quot; the situation by offering promotional deals to entice customers away from T-Mobile. In the longer term, though, Kvaal sees a merged T-Mobile/Sprint as a strong rival to the telecom giants, boasting &quot;more subscribers, more spectrum, a better network, and broader distribution.&quot;And Dish? Isn't T-Mobile supposed to give Dish access to its network as a condition of the DOJ and FCC signing off on this deal. Well, yes, it is, and Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan chimes in on this point to predict that Dish may partner with one or more cable companies to sell wireless service. Still, Kvaal isn't at all optimistic that Dish will be able to compete effectively in mobile. Neither, for that matter, is Atkin, who worries that Dish will have &quot;to compete in a highly mature and competitive market fraught with execution risk and significant capital requirements.&quot;Heavily leveraged Dish may discover it's bitten off more than it can chew.To find good ideas for tech stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.",What the T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Means for AT&T and Verizon?

2020-02-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is finally getting some good news.After a punishing year, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp. won approval for the sale of his Sprint Corp. to T-Mobile US Inc., a long-delayed acquisition that had been fiercely opposed by states including New York and California. The deal would extract the Japanese billionaire from the cash-draining U.S. wireless business and remove about $40 billion in net debt from his balance sheet. Sprint shares rose 78% in U.S. trading Tuesday after a federal court approved the deal, while SoftBank’s stock surged 14% in Tokyo.Son has been struggling to regain his footing after the meltdown at WeWork last year. Following the co-working startup’s failed initial public offering, he suffered setbacks at portfolio companies, including Wag Labs, Zume Pizza and Brandless Inc. The U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp. just took a stake in SoftBank, arguing its shares are undervalued.The Sprint sale helps Son in several ways. SoftBank will no longer face the risk of having to fund the wireless operator, a huge debt load will move off its balance sheet and Son will have more flexibility in raising capital for a share buyback or for his planned second $100 billion investment fund. Son will also have something to talk up to investors when he reports financial results on Wednesday.“This is obviously great news for Sprint,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings who writes for Smartkarma. “It is better news for SoftBank.”SoftBank shares’ jump is the most in a year on an intraday basis, pushing the company’s market value to more than $110 billion. Son’s net worth rose more than $2 billion to $18.9 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaries Index calculations.The stock has gained about 20% this year including today’s increase.The terms of the T-Mobile deal are likely to be revised because the original deal has expired, Boodry said, which means SoftBank may end up with a smaller stake in the combined company. But SoftBank won’t be on the hook for what Boodry estimates would be a potential $5 billion to $10 billion in capital investments. The two companies said they plan to close as soon as April 1.SoftBank Group is expected to return to profitability in the December quarter after reporting a loss of more than 700 billion yen ($6.4 billion) in the previous quarter, including the writedown at WeWork. Still, operating profit is projected to fall about 20% to 345 million yen, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.In recent years, Son has overhauled his company to focus on startup investments and shift away from the more traditional telecom business. He set up the $100 billion Vision Fund in 2017 with the goal of becoming the biggest investor in technology. He even sold a stake in his Japanese wireless operation to public shareholders so he could focus on deals. For several quarters, his performance seemed strong as startup valuations rose and SoftBank regularly booked gains.But Uber Technologies Inc., one of SoftBank’s biggest bets, stumbled as it went public last year. Then WeWork’s valuation crashed from $47 billion to less than $8 billion. Public investors suddenly turned their backs on the fast-growing, money-losing startups that SoftBank had favored.In taking its stake, Elliott has urged SoftBank to buy back its shares because of their discount, arguing it could spend as much as $20 billion by trimming investments in companies like Sprint and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The New York hedge fund also wants SoftBank to boost the independence and diversity on its board and bring more transparency to its investment approach.Son is still determined to raise a second Vision Fund, originally targeting at least $100 billion. His early backers are reconsidering their commitments. But SoftBank has weighed contributing $40 billion to $50 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.With the Sprint sale heading for completion, Son would have more flexibility with his finances. The deal won’t bring in capital because SoftBank’s Sprint shares will be converted into stock in the combined entity. But he will be able to borrow against the equity, which is likely to be worth more given the early share reaction.“It certainly changes the conversation,” said Chris Lane, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. “This is the first piece of good news in quite a while.”(Updates with share price from second paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Pei Yi Mak and Andrew Heathcote.To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Stock Surges 14% After Sprint Sale Wins Approval

2020-02-13,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son opened the door to making at least some of the changes championed by activist investor Paul Singer, after the Japanese company reported a second quarter of losses from its startup investing.Son called Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. an “important partner” and said he is in broad agreement with the investor about SoftBank buybacks and share value. Son said he is on the side of shareholders, especially since he is the largest stockholder at the company. The two billionaires held discussions a couple weeks ago, he said.Son is adopting a more conciliatory stance just as he’s stumbling with his signature effort -- the $100 billion Vision Fund, which made him the biggest investor in technology. The fund lost money in the three months ended in December, one quarter after the meltdown at WeWork triggered a record loss for the Japanese company. On Wednesday, Son said he is no longer targeting $108 billion for a second fund and SoftBank may finance the effort on its own.“We are thankful that such a distinguished investor has joined us as a friend,” Son said at a press conference in Tokyo to discuss earnings. “We are basically in agreement on carrying out large buybacks when the finances allow it.”Elliott disclosed a stake of almost $3 billion in SoftBank this month, arguing the company’s shares are substantially undervalued compared with its assets. It has advocated for a share buyback of as much as $20 billion, along with governance changes and more transparency about its investments.The Vision Fund lost 225.1 billion yen ($2.05 billion) for the three months ended in December. SoftBank Group reported a slim operating profit of 2.6 billion yen, compared with the 344.7 billion yen average of analyst estimates.The past 12 months have been a roller coaster for Son and SoftBank investors alike. A year ago, the company unveiled a record buyback, sparking a rally that pushed shares to the highest since its dot-com peak in 2000. Uber Technologies Inc.’s disappointing public debut and the implosion of WeWork wiped out the gains over the next few months. But SoftBank surged again in the past week after Singer disclosed his stake and Son won approval to sell his Sprint Corp. to T-Mobile US Inc.SoftBank shares are up about 21% this year. They were little changed in Tokyo trading Thursday.Son focused on the positive in the presentation to shareholders and the media in Tokyo. He said the Vision Fund is on track to return to profit in the current quarter. The eight portfolio companies that are publicly trading, including Uber, Slack Technologies Inc. and Guardant Health Inc., have added $3 billion in paper profit in the current three months, he said.“At the last earnings briefing I used the words ‘I regret’ 20 times. But after a difficult winter always comes spring,” Son said. “The tide is turning,” he added, standing in front of a slide with the same words and a crashing wave.The most dramatic change in portfolio value since the quarter closed was Uber, whose shares have climbed more than 35% this year. That, Son said, means the Vision Fund’s stake is now worth $1.5 billion more than its investment, compared with $1 billion less at the end of December.The Vision Fund’s overall performance was murkier. SoftBank said the fund’s portfolio remained unchanged from the previous quarter at 88 investments. It reported a gain in valuation for 29 companies in the December quarter, while 31 saw their worth decline. The unrealized gain on the investments, or the difference between the cost at which it acquired the stakes and their present fair value, shrunk to $5.2 billion. That’s less than a third of the paper profit SoftBank reported six months ago.Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group, pointed out that the losses at Vision Fund essentially wiped out profits created by the rest of the company.“These results validate our concerns that most other things that SBG does outside of Alibaba have led to distractions or value destruction,” he wrote in a research note.Vision Fund 2 Is Risk to SoftBank Investors, Analyst Says (Video)SoftBank said it is introducing new governance standards for its portfolio companies, including the composition of the board of directors, founder and management rights, rights of shareholders, and mitigation of potential conflicts of interest. The new rules will “enhance value creation and liquidity” at portfolio companies, it said in a statement.Elliott wants SoftBank to set up a special committee to review the investment process at the Vision Fund, which it thinks has dragged on the share price despite making up a small portion of assets under management, people familiar with the matter have said.Son’s best bet to date is still the investment he made in Alibaba two decades ago. In the latest quarter, SoftBank said it booked a 331.9 billion yen gain from the e-commerce giant’s listing in Hong Kong.That deal turned Son’s $20 million into a stake worth over $130 billion, a spectacular return that cemented his reputation as an investor and helped him raise the original $100 billion Vision Fund. But the track record since then has been spotty. In addition to the WeWork fiasco, he suffered setbacks at portfolio companies, including Wag Labs, Zume Pizza and Brandless Inc.Son, asked repeatedly about the second Vision Fund at the conference in Tokyo, said he still wants to raise the money but acknowledged the WeWork troubles have set back those plans. Major backers of the first fund, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co., have remained on the sidelines so far. He said SoftBank may start with a smaller, bridge fund so it can keep doing deals.“A lot of our planned investors have been worried by the trouble at WeWork and Uber and we heard their feedback,” Son said. “It’s fully possible for us to carry on investing entirely with our own funds.”He wasn’t precise about what the size of the fund would be, and said that it “seems right that the scale is somewhat reduced this time.”At a Milken Institute conference in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, Vision Fund head Rajeev Misra said that the second fund has already made seven investments and another six are in the pipeline. About a dozen companies from the first fund are expected to list in the next 18 months, he said.“There’s no rush, they don’t need capital,” Misra said. “A lot of them won’t even raise capital through an IPO, it will be a direct listing.”SoftBank has weighed contributing $40 billion to $50 billion for the second fund, people familiar with the matter have said.“The company will struggle to fund both Vision Fund II and buybacks unless they get a large outside commitment to VF II,” Chris Lane, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said prior to the announcement.SoftBank’s last share re-purchase was announced about a year ago, a record 600 billion yen.The company’s own sum-of-parts calculation puts its total value at more than 12,000 yen a share. That’s more than double SoftBank’s actual share price, which values the company at about $110 billion. Elliott thinks SoftBank’s net asset value could be about $230 billion, people familiar with the discussions have said.Son urged investors to focus on SoftBank’s shareholder value, which would include its stake in Alibaba, rather than operating profit, which is swayed by share price fluctuation in investments like Uber. To illustrate, he showed a slide with a famous visual illusion that can look like a duck or a rabbit depending on perspective.“The only measure by which SoftBank, an investment company, should be evaluated by is whether shareholder value rises or falls,” he said.(Updates with shares in eighth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Nicolas Parasie.To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Founder Son Says He’s Open to Working With Elliott

2020-02-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Telekom AG wants to renegotiate the terms for the sale of Sprint Corp. to its U.S. wireless unit T-Mobile US Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.The German carrier, the majority owner of T-Mobile, is seeking a lower price because Sprint’s shares have been trading below their level when the deal was proposed in 2018, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the deliberations are private.Getting one of the biggest U.S. wireless mergers ever over the finish line would be a boon to both companies. For Deutsche Telekom, the deal reduces its reliance on Europe, where carriers are struggling to grow amid fierce competition. For the chairman of Sprint owner SoftBank Group Corp., Masayoshi Son, it allows him to better focus on his technology investments and the $100 billion Vision Fund. The renegotiation talks are expected to start soon, the people said. They would follow a victory for the companies in a U.S. court this week, when a federal judge rejected a state lawsuit against the tie-up. Now the deal is in the home stretch, with only minor approvals left to secure and final financial terms to be ironed out. SoftBank declined to comment. Deutsche Telekom didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.Deutsche Telekom shares fell 1.4% in Frankfurt as of 12:58 p.m. on Thursday. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Deutsche Telekom has limited leverage to renegotiate the terms of its Sprint acquisition, we think, even as the valuation of the latter jumped to $75 billion from $60 billion in 2018 under the deal terms, despite worsening operational performance.

T-Mobile and Sprint haven’t renewed the merger agreement since it lapsed on Nov. 1, and there have been discussions regarding several issues that T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere described as “not hostile” that month on an investor call. T-Mobile has suggested there could be new terms.The combined company, which will operate under the T-Mobile name, will have a regular monthly subscriber base of about 80 million -- in the same league as AT&T Inc., which has 75 million subscribers, and Verizon Communications Inc., which has 114 million. T-Mobile will have more wireless frequencies than any other U.S. carrier, giving it an advantage as the industry transitions to the next generation of wireless technology, the much-faster 5G standard.Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Sprint and SoftBank would likely have to accept a lower price than when the merger agreement was first forged in April 2018. Sprint’s monthly churn -- a closely watched measure of how many customers leave -- has risen to nearly 2%, which means roughly a quarter of its subscriber base is quitting the carrier each year.The German company is likely to leverage that to negotiate a lower price, but Sprint also has valuable radio frequency spectrum without which T-Mobile US will face serious bottlenecks, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on Wednesday.The Financial Times previously reported that Deutsche Telekom is pushing to renegotiate terms of the deal, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.(Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Stefan Nicola.To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, Thomas Pfeiffer, Jennifer RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",T-Mobile Parent Is Said to Seek New Terms for Sprint Deal

2020-02-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Is Sprint Corp. a duck or a rabbit?Bear with us. Earlier this week, SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son showed investors a bemusing slide with an ambiguous image of a duck and rabbit. If you look at the picture from the right, you see a different critter than the view from the left.In his characteristically gnomic fashion, he was trying to suggest that there were two ways of evaluating SoftBank, and investors were doing so from the wrong perspective. But the analogy could also hold true for Sprint, the U.S. carrier in which SoftBank is the biggest shareholder, and whose planned merger with rival T-Mobile US Inc. finally secured the regulatory green light on Tuesday.When it was agreed back in April 2018, the all-stock deal gave Sprint an equity value of $27 billion. Since then, the two firms’ trajectories have diverged. Prior to Tuesday’s decision, T-Mobile stock had gained 31%, while Sprint had fallen 26%. Because Sprint shareholders are set to get T-Mobile shares in exchange for their existing stock, the value of the deal had therefore climbed to $36 billion, while the market only valued Sprint at $20 billion.So you can see why Deutsche Telekom AG, which owns 63% of T-Mobile, is now seeking to renegotiate the terms of the deal, whose existing terms lapsed in November. It looks like it might now be overpaying, so Tim Hoettges, the German firm’s CEO, has a fiduciary duty to his shareholders to at least give it a try.Here’s the metaphorical duck. Son is more vulnerable than he might have been just a week ago. That’s because the activist investor Elliott Management Corp. has built a stake in SoftBank, seeking governance improvements and a $20 billion buyback. SoftBank is meanwhile trying to find the capital for its new, reduced Vision Fund, the follow-up to the $100 billion pot of venture capital cash that Son used to make outsize bets on Uber Technologies Inc., WeWork parent We Co. and some 80 other firms over the past three years. The deconsolidation of Sprint reduces its debt exposure, while selling the remaining stake could free up capital to invest in the new fund or buybacks. The current deal terms value its stake at about $30 billion.What’s more, Sprint needs the merger more than T-Mobile. The declining share price has been driven by lackluster earnings and falling subscriber numbers. In the almost two years since the deal was agreed, Sprint’s number of subscribers has fallen by 460,000 to 54 million at the end of December. T-Mobile has meanwhile added 12 million customers for a total of 86 million.Now for the rabbit. A major renegotiation only becomes realistic if Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile are prepared to walk away from the deal. T-Mobile stock’s 13% jump after the takeover was approved on Tuesday suggests that shareholders are happy with the deal even under the current terms. It will create value by reducing the cost of new 5G networks; giving the new company more pricing power over its customers; and letting the German-controlled firm get hold of Sprint’s valuable wireless frequencies.Ultimately, the deal remains in both firms’ interests. Deutsche Telekom would probably prefer an expensive takeover to no deal at all. Were the terms to be reevaluated based on the diverging stock prices, then T-Mobile could expect a swap ratio of at least 12 Sprint shares for each of its own (assuming a $27 billion valuation), up from the 9.75 shares agreed two years ago. Is such a drastic change likely? No. But given SoftBank’s need for cash, there’s a good chance it will be open to concessions to get the deal done.To contact the authors of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-02-14,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. raised the stakes in its battle with Huawei Technologies Co., using a law historically associated with prosecuting mafia figures to claim the Chinese company engaged in decades of intellectual property theft.Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment, and Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou had already faced criminal charges. The fresh allegations, announced Thursday, up the ante by including racketeering conspiracy, increasing the potential punishment. They come as the global battle for supremacy in fifth-generation wireless technology, or 5G, is joined.Huawei broke the law “to drastically cut its research and development costs and associated delays, giving the company a significant and unfair competitive advantage,” the Justice Department said in a statement. The company even launched a bonus program to reward employees who got their hands on confidential information from competitors, prosecutors said.The new charges depict a company that won international standing by stealing trade secrets, evading U.S sanctions and lying to authorities. They are likely to increase tensions between Beijing and Washington, which has accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government, even as Huawei won a brief reprieve from a proposed ban on buying parts.The indictment doesn’t name the businesses from which Huawei allegedly stole intellectual property, but details of the allegations match descriptions of companies including Cisco Systems Inc., Motorola Inc. and Cnex Labs Inc.“The indictment paints a damning portrait of an illegitimate organization that lacks any regard for the law,” Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel’s Democratic vice-chairman, said in an emailed statement. “Intellectual property theft, corporate sabotage and market manipulation are part of Huawei’s core ethos and reflected in every aspect of how it conducts business.”Huawei doesn’t “abide by Western business practices,” Rob Spalding, a Washington-based technology and security expert at the Hudson Institute who served on the National Security Council, said in an email. “Which is why many U.S. companies are no longer competitive in the global marketplace.”Read More: Why 5G Mobile Arrives With a Subplot of EspionageHuawei, in turn, has accused the U.S. of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyberattacks to infiltrate its internal network. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged the U.S to “stop unreasonably targeting Huawei and other Chinese enterprises.”The new indictment “is part of the Justice Department’s attempt to irrevocably damage Huawei’s reputation and its business for reasons related to competition rather than law enforcement,” a representative of the company said Thursday. “These new charges are without merit and are based largely on recycled civil disputes” from the last 20 years “that have been previously settled, litigated and, in some cases, rejected by federal judges and juries.”Huawei was previously accused of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Meng, the CFO, was charged with fraud last year, with the case rippling into Canada, where she is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. Meng’s lawyers have argued in court that their client did nothing wrong.The U.S. said Huawei stole trade secrets, including copyrighted works, source code and user manuals for internet routers, to “grow and operate” its business. The company swiped antenna and robot testing technology, prosecutors said.Then, they said, it doubled down.“When confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, the defendants allegedly made repeated misstatements to U.S. officials, including FBI agents and representatives from the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, regarding their efforts to misappropriate trade secrets,” they said.Read More: U.S. Ramps Up Huawei Fight With Iran, Trade-Secret ChargesThe U.S. dates the thefts to 2002. But the government has also linked the 2016 alleged theft of a computer chip from a California tech company for Huawei with the latest charges.Bo Mao, a Xiamen University professor, was charged in September with stealing trade secrets. His lawyers said in a court filing Thursday that the prosecution is related to the Huawei case.In the new indictment, the government is wielding some prior allegations of wrongdoing, like Huawei’s alleged theft of a phone-testing robot developed by T-Mobile US Inc., to build a more muscular case. The U.S. alleged that a Huawei engineer secretly took photos of T-Mobile’s robot, Tappy, took measurements of parts and even stole a piece of it. When T-Mobile threatened to sue, the U.S. said, Huawei blamed “rogue actors” within the company.Intellectual property theft “explains a lot of Huawei’s success,” said Jim Lewis, of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Huawei is the poster child for China’s commercial spying.”The case is U.S. v.

2020-02-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The anything-goes world of megamergers under President Donald Trump has encountered new resistance. More than a dozen U.S. states sued to stop T-Mobile US Inc.’s takeover of Sprint Corp. and failed when a judge ruled against them this week. But their unusual effort to step in as de facto antitrust regulators in the era of a lax Trump administration — and the fact that the case was seen as such a close call — is sure to unnerve other dealmakers who may be contemplating their own controversial mergers and acquisitions. The Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission are the main regulatory bodies that deal-hungry telecommunications CEOs must appease to get their transactions over the antitrust hurdle. (Other industries may have to answer to the Federal Trade Commission.) But the states have emerged as one more powerful group to worry about. In the T-Mobile-Sprint matter, state attorneys general from around the country, led by New York and California, demonstrated a willingness to go beyond the convention of securing one-off concessions for their own constituents when a deal raises concerns. Instead, if regulators drop the ball, the states are prepared to team up and take companies to court, with proceedings that could potentially stretch on for months — and time is money. With the DOJ, FCC and now the states, it’s become “a three-headed monster,” said John Stephens, AT&T Inc.’s chief financial officer. “Or maybe a 52-headed monster, I should say,” he added, speaking during a post-earnings phone interview on Jan. 29, before the Sprint ruling.District Judge Victor Marrero ultimately ruled in favor of the wireless carriers this week, rejecting the states’ arguments that the merger will lead to higher prices for consumers and that wireless newbie Dish Network Corp. won’t become a viable competitor capable of replacing Sprint. The deal, which the companies expect to close by April, will shrink the number of U.S. national wireless carriers from four to three, a level of market concentration that was taboo under previous administrations.On the one hand, the ruling has the potential to open the floodgates for other megamergers that traditionally would have been considered off-limits. To use a hypohetical, take Dish and AT&T’s DirecTV: They compete in providing satellite-TV service to U.S. households, and both parties have said in the past that there would, in theory, be benefits to putting the businesses together, if not for the regulatory hurdles. (AT&T executives have since said they aren’t planning to sell DirecTV.) But just as T-Mobile and Sprint successfully argued that their industry is different now thanks to changing technologies, satellite providers could make that claim, too. Even so, the states’ persistence in the Sprint matter may make some would-be dealmakers think twice about how far they’re willing to go to get a transaction across the finish line. Keeping with the Dish-DirecTV example, those are precisely the kinds of well-known brands that the states could go after in a merger fight. And if it weren’t for the states, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had the major regulatory approvals they needed wrapped up months ago; FCC Chairman Ajit Pai gave his blessing back in May, and the Justice Department cleared the deal in July. As the battle with the states dragged on, Sprint’s market value shrank, its business deteriorated, and now T-Mobile wants to renegotiate the price it pays Sprint’s shareholders. In a bit of irony, the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday that it’s looking into whether past purchases by U.S. technology giants such as Amazon.com Inc., Google and Facebook Inc. that slipped by regulators’ radars were, in fact, anticompetitive. The FTC’s announcement — part of the ongoing scrutiny of the power wielded by Big Tech — came hours after the ruling for T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint, one of the most anticompetitive megadeals in the tech sphere.Letitia James, the New York attorney general who led the T-Mobile-Sprint opposition, said in response to Tuesday’s court decision that while she disagrees with the outcome, the states “will continue to fight the kind of consumer-harming megamergers our antitrust laws were designed to prevent.” Think she means it?To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-02-18,"If you look at its fundamentals, Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) may seem a dumb place to park new money.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com A few months ago, so was Sprint (NYSE:S).By that I mean that, if you want to buy DISH stock, you buy it as an arbitrage play. While Dish is a dying business, facing mammoth capital requirements, it could easily be bought by this time next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDISH stock opened for trade Feb. 18 at $39.89 per share. That's a year-to-date gain of 16%. It has a market capitalization of $21.5 billion. But it's 6% below its most recent peak -- one it hit in July 2019. Five years ago, Dish was trading at $75 per share. What's the Deal?Dish Network began life in the 1980s as EchoStar Communications. It was one of two direct satellite broadcasters. The other is DirecTV, now part of AT&T (NYSE:T).As consumers began rejecting satellite, and other forms of cable, for streaming services, Dish rolled out Sling TV, a &quot;cable-lite&quot; package delivered online, in 2015. Since 2015, Dish has continued to shed customers, but Sling has hung in there, gaining 214,000 subscribers in the third quarter of 2019.  * 9 Food and Restaurant Stocks to Dine In On But that's not the point, my friend. Dish has been a regular entrant in the Federal Communications Commission spectrum auctions throughout the decade. It has put $20 billion into wireless spectrum now estimated to be worth $30 billion.For years, however, Dish has been a &quot;spectrum hoarder,&quot; refusing to build out services on what it owns. Early in its fight to buy Sprint, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) even urged the FCC to take the spectrum away from Dish for that reason.But the two companies are now on better terms. That's because in July, Dish agreed to pay $5 billion for key T-Mobile assets, including Boost, Sprint's re-sale business. The deal helped pave the way for T-Mobile's merger with Sprint to be completed. Is Dish for Sale?Dish Network CEO Charles Ergen may be the richest man you never heard of. His stake in Dish was estimated to be worth $10.5 billion last year.Ergen is litigious, and often gets into arguments with his union. He may have also bit off more than he can chew with T-Mobile.Dish still hasn't built out its spectrum, which will cost $10 billion. If it doesn't get that done by 2025 it faces fines of $2.2 billion. Ergen is also 66 years old, young for a presidential candidate but old for a CEO. Which is why many feel the next step for Dish should be its sale.Who would buy it? Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has gotten nowhere with its Xfinity wireless service, which is based on the side bands of its own customers' WiFi signals. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a re-seller of T-Mobile and Sprint services with its Google Fi. It could buy Dish for what amounts to seat cushion money. So could Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).As wireless services continue to consolidate around AT&T, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and the T-Mobile and Sprint tie-up, many expect prices, for customers and re-sellers, to deteriorate.This is the last mile for the major cloud companies, the key connection they need with customers during this coming decade. They won't let the sun go down on it. The Bottom Line on Dish StockDish Network hasn't said it's for sale. But it is.Dish lacks the financial strength to compete in the wireless business. But there are buyers who would see AT&T and Verizon not just as peers, but as mere irritations. Comcast is nearly as valuable as they are. Google is worth about twice what the two wireless giants are, put together. Apple's worth $400 billion more than that.One of these companies is likely to make Charles Ergen a very rich man in the next few years.

2020-02-19,"It has been just over a week since the merger between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) passed one of its last legal hurdles. The third and fourth-largest mobile carriers in the U.S. are set to combine, after a federal judge ruled against 14 state attorneys general who had sued to stop the deal.Source: Michael Candelori / Shutterstock.com When the ruling was announced on Feb. 11, Sprint stock skyrocketed, gaining 77.5% on the day. It has continued to climb since, closing at $9.17 on Tuesday to notch another 5.5% gain. The merger is expected to close on April 1, however it is still not a done deal. There is one remaining legal obstacle: the California Public Utilities Commission. In addition, T-Mobile is pushing for more favorable terms.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Big Legal Win Means Big Boost for Sprint SharesThe original deal between T-Mobile and Sprint expired on Nov. 1, 2019. At that time, the merger between the mobile carriers was in limbo. Fourteen state attorneys general -- led by New York -- had sued to prevent the merger, claiming the deal would end up harming consumers. While the court case dragged on, it was reported that T-Mobile was in talks with Sprint to renew terms of the deal.The federal court's Feb. 11 ruling in favor of Sprint and T-Mobile caught many by surprise. And it lit a match under Sprint's stock price which rose from $4.80 the day before to $8.52, for a 77.5% one-day gain.   * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks With Over 50% Upside Potential However, Sprint's pricing does not reflect its performance. Bloomberg reports that the mobile carrier's churn rate has increased to nearly 2%, with roughly one quarter of its subscribers quitting every year. That gives T-Mobile leverage to push for better terms in a new deal, despite the big jump in Sprint's valuation.  California Public Utilities CommissionBesides the need to come to terms on a new deal, the merger still has to get past the California Public Utilities Commission. According to the New York Times, the commission has the power to block the merger, but is more likely to approve it based on conditions. These might include service guarantees and fee freezes for California residents, as well as protection for workers whose jobs could be at risk.Either way, the California Public Utilities Commission should issue a conditional ruling within several weeks. Bottom Line for Sprint StockAt its current price near $9.50, much of the potential gain may already be priced into Sprint stock. After Sprint's performance on Feb. 11, Barron's calculated the stock's value under the existing deal at approximately $9.75 per share.   However, because of the lawsuit filed by the state attorneys general, the deal's original deadline for completion has passed. That opens the door to renegotiation of terms, and T-Mobile is reportedly pushing to do just that. There is speculation that T-Mobile will leverage Sprint's poor operational performance to squeeze a lower price than had originally been agreed upon.As InvestorPlace's Dana Blankenhorn points out, if you bought Sprint shares before Feb. 11, you are sitting pretty. Assuming this merger gets past the California Public Utilities Commission intact, and the two companies come to terms, you should do very well. But at the current price of Sprint stock, an investment now has a lot less potential upside.Plus, there is still some risk the deal could fall through, which would be catastrophic. That's especially true considering Sprint shares were trading at less than half their current value just two weeks ago.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-20,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp.’s stock climbed after it unveiled plans to borrow as much as 500 billion yen ($4.5 billion) by putting up shares of its Japanese telecom unit as collateral, raising capital for the investment giant’s operations.The money for the two-year loan, which will have a one-year extension option, will come from 16 financial institutions, SoftBank said in a statement. It pledged as much as 953 million shares of SoftBank Corp. and said the money will be used to fund operations. SoftBank Group’s stock rose as much as 3.6% in Tokyo, while the unit’s was little changed.Activist investor Paul Singer this month revealed his firm had acquired a stake of as much as $3 billion in SoftBank and has advocated for a share buyback of as much as $20 billion, along with governance changes and more transparency about its investments. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son called Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. an “important partner” and said he is in broad agreement with the investor about SoftBank buybacks and share value.SoftBank will need to raise cash to meet those demands. Son is adopting a more conciliatory stance just as he’s struggling with the $100 billion Vision Fund, which made him the biggest investor in technology. The fund lost money in the three months ended in December, one quarter after the meltdown at WeWork triggered a record loss for the Japanese company. Son is trying to raise capital for a second fund, but last week said he is no longer targeting $108 billion and SoftBank may finance the effort on its own.“We sense that the stars are now aligned for the firm to conduct a buyback,” Citigroup Global Markets analyst Mitsunobu Tsuruo wrote. SoftBank “will be in a position to flexibly implement a buyback amounting to” about 5% of its market capitalization.Read more: SoftBank’s Son Considers a ‘Bridge’ Fund Before Vision Fund 2The past 12 months have been tumultuous for Son and SoftBank.

That’s an increase from a ratio of 9.75 previously and is more favorable for T-Mobile’s German owner Deutsche Telekom AG.The equity value of the amended deal is about $37 billion compared with the original agreement of $26.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Erhan Gurses. The higher valuation partly reflects the 62% gain in T-Mobile shares since the all-stock transaction was announced almost two years ago, despite the deterioration in Sprint’s business.Getting one of the biggest U.S. wireless mergers ever over the finish line would be a boon for Deutsche Telekom as it will reduce its reliance on Europe, where carriers are struggling to grow amid fierce competition. T-Mobile makes up more than half of Deutsche Telekom’s sales, up from about a third in 2014. A completed deal will also benefit Sprint owner SoftBank Group Corp. by allowing its chairman, Masayoshi Son, to better focus on his technology investments and the $100 billion Vision Fund.The combined company, which will operate under the T-Mobile name, will have a regular monthly subscriber base of about 80 million -- in the same league as AT&T Inc., which has 75 million subscribers, and Verizon Communications Inc., which has 114 million.When the transaction closes, which could happen as soon as April 1, Deutsche Telekom is expected to keep 43% of the merged entity, while SoftBank has 24%. The rest will be held by public shareholders.Deutsche Telekom shares fell 1.3% to trade at 16.41 euros in Frankfurt. Sprint shares were up 5% to $9.96 at 11:01 a.m. in New York, while T-Mobile was down 1.8% to $97.73.The original accord, which united the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, was forged in April 2018. That pact lapsed on Nov. 1, and the companies didn’t initially renew the terms while they fought for government approval. When a federal judge rejected a state lawsuit to block the transaction earlier this month, that put the talks on the front burner.Along the way, Sprint’s condition has worsened. That added pressure to redraw the agreement so that it was more favorable to Deutsche Telekom.SoftBank agreed to surrender 48.8 million T-Mobile shares that it will acquire in the merger to the combined company immediately after the transaction closes. But those shares could be reissued to SoftBank by 2025 if the new company’s stock stays above $150 for a period of time.That arrangement -- having SoftBank relinquish the stock after the deal closes -- was structured so that the deal wouldn’t have to go before another shareholder vote.Sprint investors other than SoftBank will still get the original ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share -- the equivalent of about 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share.Sprint’s monthly churn -- a closely watched measure of how many customers leave -- has risen to nearly 2%. That means roughly a quarter of its subscriber base is quitting the carrier each year. And the company isn’t making up for the decline by charging more: Average revenue per customer has fallen 5% since the deal was announced.Analysts such as LightShed Partners’ Walt Piecyk said the merger’s exchange ratio should be closer to 12, given Sprint’s deteriorated business.(Updates with valuation detail in third paragraph, updates share prices.)To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net;Stefan Nicola in Berlin at snicola2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Jennifer RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","T-Mobile, Sprint Revise Deal Terms After Regulatory Approval"

2020-02-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son will head to New York next month for the first time since the implosion of WeWork, seeking to persuade hedge funds and institutional investors that the fortunes of SoftBank Group Corp. have turned since the disastrous investment.The Japanese billionaire is scheduled to address investors on March 2. There, he could point to the approved sale of Sprint Corp., a rally in Uber Technologies Inc. shares and Elliott Management Corp.’s purchase of SoftBank stock as signs of progress at his company, said people familiar with the plans. It’s unclear where WeWork will fit into the agenda.Within SoftBank, there’s disagreement about how to convey the company’s strategy. Son, 62, is known for his eccentric financial presentations, which have included a “hypothetical illustration” of WeWork profitability and stock photos of ocean waves and calm waters. One memorable slide from 2014 contained only a drawing of a goose and the words: “SoftBank = Goose.” Many staff at headquarters in Tokyo love the founder’s showmanship, but some senior executives are exasperated and argue a clearer and more sober message is needed, said people familiar with internal discussions who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.Ultimately, Son will decide. He has downplayed any pressure from Elliott, a New York-based activist investor that disclosed a nearly $3 billion stake in SoftBank this month. Son called Elliott an “important partner” and said he’s in broad agreement with the investor’s arguments for buybacks and increasing the stock price. Son has signaled less receptiveness to Elliott’s other suggestions: selling more of the stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and reining in the Vision Fund, a $100 billion investment vehicle that accounted for more than $10 billion of losses in the past two quarters.In private meetings with SoftBank, Elliott raised issues over the clarity of SoftBank’s strategy, people familiar with the talks said. SoftBank is planning to make hires within its investor relations department to help shape the message to shareholders. SoftBank declined to comment. A spokesperson for Elliott declined to comment.“Right now, serious heat is being applied on Son,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “Son has to be seen actually doing something.”Son’s heading into the meeting with one win under his belt: T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint have agreed to new terms for their pending merger, a key step toward completing a transaction that will unload the loss-making carrier and unlock new capital for SoftBank. Its shares rose as much as 3.3% in Tokyo Friday.T-Mobile, Sprint Renew Deal as Merger Clears Regulatory HurdlesAlthough next month’s event was scheduled before Elliott disclosed its stake and is not designed to specifically address the activist investor’s involvement, it will be a focus for attendees, said people familiar with the preparations. Executives are bracing for questions about Elliott’s intentions and how far the shareholder will go to boost the stock’s value.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is organizing the March event, the people said. The firm, which helped Japan’s Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp. in their dealings with activist investors, is vying for the job of advising SoftBank on Elliott, said a different person said. However, SoftBank is likely to manage the relationship in-house, another person said. The job may fall to Marcelo Claure, the chief operating officer who’s helping oversee the WeWork debacle; Katsunori Sago, the chief strategy officer and a former Goldman Sachs executive; or Ron Fisher, a director and trusted adviser to Son. A Goldman representative declined to comment on SoftBank.Dogs and PizzaSoftBank is recovering from a series of stumbles in recent months. WeWork’s plan to go public last year imploded, forcing SoftBank to arrange a rescue financing of $9.5 billion in October. Uber, despite a two-month surge, is still trading about 10% below last year’s offering price. The Vision Fund has suffered other high-profile setbacks, including investments in failed online retailer Brandless Inc., dog-walking app Wag Labs Inc. and pizza robot company Zume Pizza Inc.Elliott has said it took the stake in SoftBank because the Japanese company’s shares are woefully undervalued compared with its assets. Son himself has been pleading the case with increasing frequency. SoftBank’s own sum-of-parts calculation puts its total value at 12,300 yen a share ($111). That’s more than double SoftBank’s actual share price, which values the company at about $104 billion. Elliott has pegged SoftBank’s net asset value at about $230 billion, people familiar with the discussions have said.The disconnect between what SoftBank and Elliott say the company is worth and the market value can be explained by several quirks of how the business is run, according to a report from Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research. Many shareholders would like the company to return more capital and improve its governance, he wrote. Risks associated with the Vision Fund and a lack of details about tax liabilities associated with cashing out its investments are other factors.SoftBank recognized the need for more oversight as early as 2018, when it charged Claure with a broad review of operations across SoftBank companies. Claure, the former head of Sprint, spent months assembling a team of about 40 executives. In the end, he was forced to cede control of the so-called SoftBank Operating Group to the man it was supposed to be overseeing: Rajeev Misra, the head of the Vision Fund.Elliott wants SoftBank to set up a special committee to review investment processes at the Vision Fund. Elliott argues the fund has dragged down the share price despite making up a small portion of assets under management, said people familiar with the discussions.Some at SoftBank are resistant to the idea of an oversight committee. Instead, SoftBank is seeking to resolve issues at the Vision Fund with new governance standards for the companies it invests in. The new rules will encompass how the fund approaches the composition of the board of directors, founder and management rights, rights of shareholders, and mitigation of potential conflicts of interest.Son has conceded that missteps with the original fund is making it difficult to raise money for a successor. He said last week that SoftBank may need to invest in startups using solely its own capital for a year or two.‘Black Swan’Elliott is also calling for a buyback of as much as $20 billion. A repurchase of that scale could boost SoftBank’s shares by 40%, Ferragu estimated. SoftBank’s last share repurchase was announced about a year ago, a record 600 billion yen. It sparked a rally that pushed the stock to its highest price in about two decades.Selling Alibaba shares to pay for a buyback, as Elliott has proposed, could be a point of contention with Son. In the past, Son has used the shares as collateral to borrow money for big acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of chip designer ARM Holdings. Son said last week during a quarterly financial briefing that he’d prefer to sell as little as possible and that there’s “no rush” to do so.SoftBank said on Wednesday it plans to borrow as much as $4.5 billion against shares of its Japanese telecom unit. The company, which had 3.8 trillion yen of cash and equivalents at the end of December, said it was raising capital for operations. SoftBank’s debt load exceeds $120 billion.Son’s reliance on debt is raising alarms, said Tang, the financial analyst. “He’s going to get wiped out if there is some black swan event,” Tang said. “SoftBank needs to de-leverage, and the best way to do it is to sell the Alibaba stake.”Elliott has a tradition of using strong-arm tactics to get its way with target companies, but there’s little chance of that happening with SoftBank. Elliott’s stake enables it to call an emergency shareholder meeting, but pushing through a proposal without the founder’s backing is a long shot. Son, who often goes by the nickname Masa, controls more than a quarter of SoftBank stock through various vehicles, and the company bylaws require two-thirds of votes to pass any proposal made through the board, according to a person with knowledge of the rules.“Unless everyone is against him,” said Tang, “it’s not possible to dislodge Masa.”(Updates with share action in the seventh paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Scott Deveau.To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Giles Turner in London at gturner35@bloomberg.net;Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Mark Milian, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank’s Son to Pitch U.S. Investors Under Cloud of WeWork

2020-02-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce.com Inc. Co-Chief Executive Officer Keith Block stepped down Tuesday after revamping the software maker’s growth strategy, helping fuel a fourfold increase in revenue during his tenure.Block garnered less public attention than founder and Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff during his seven years at the market leader for customer-relations software, but took command of day-to-day operations behind the scenes. Block, promoted from president to chief operating officer to co-CEO with Benioff in August 2018, professionalized the sales organization, taking lessons from his 26-year stint at Oracle Corp. He persuaded Benioff the company should tailor software for different industries, which expanded the universe of customers. And, as co-CEO, Block allowed Benioff time to focus on his many political and philanthropic initiatives.“Keith has really inspired us to be much more committed to verticals and vertical solutions than ever before,” Benioff said on a conference call with analysts. “It’s going to be a huge part of his legacy here.”Benioff said he would partner with Block in his undisclosed “next chapter.” The former co-CEO will remain an adviser, the company said.“Keith Block’s departure as Salesforce.com CEO dims enthusiasm over a strong 4Q, as he’s been critical to successes over the past seven years and leaves a short-term vacuum,” Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a research note. Salesforce shares declined about 2.5% in extended trading after the announcement.Despite Block’s departure, Benioff tried to reassure investors that Salesforce has a deep leadership bench. The company recently promoted Bret Taylor, the former product head, to chief operating officer and gave him additional responsibilities, suggesting he will become even more consequential in Block’s absence.Block’s focus on selling industry-specific software will remain prominent at the company, which also Tuesday announced a $1.3 billion acquisition of Vlocity Inc. to bolster that effort. Vlocity’s apps focus on six specific industries and help subscribers manage relationships with their customers, including T-Mobile US Inc. and TELUS Corp.Salesforce was an investor in the San Francisco-based startup founded by former Oracle executive David Schmaier. Vlocity’s software is built on Salesforce’s platform and Schmaier consulted Benioff and other Salesforce executives before starting the business, he said in a 2018 interview. Vlocity had a habit of locating its offices in Salesforce-occupied buildings, ensuring it would remain visible to the cloud-software pioneer.Vlocity’s current headquarters is in the Salesforce Tower, suggesting a relocation won’t be necessary if the deal closes as expected in the fiscal second quarter.Though Block was known for his sales acumen, he wanted to broaden his duties, which was part of the reason he took on a more diversified co-CEO role, Benioff said.Benioff and Block had sought to maintain Salesforce’s annual growth rates of about 25% through frequent acquisitions and international expansion. By the end of the fiscal year, the company is on target to have doubled its annual revenue over the past three years, spurred by snapping up MuleSoft Inc. in 2018 and Tableau Software Inc. in 2019.Sales will be as much as $21.1 billion in fiscal 2021, the San Francisco-based company said. Analysts projected $20.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which is at the top end of what the company had forecast in early December.In the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce reported Tuesday that revenue gained 35% to $4.85 billion, marking the second consecutive period of more than 30% year-over-year growth. Analysts, on average, projected $4.75 billion. Earnings, excluding some items, were 66 cents a share, topping analysts’ estimates of 56 cents.Revenue from Sales Cloud, the company’s flagship product, grew about 17% to $1.23 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 31. The company leads the market for sales-tracking software, but growth rates have slowed down, prompting Salesforce to diversify its business.Service Cloud sales increased 26% to $1.22 billion. The software maker offers this tool so companies can communicate with field employees and customers, a space where it faces competition from ServiceNow Inc., Zendesk Inc. and others.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Salesforce Loses Co-CEO Block Who Propelled Growth Strategy

2020-02-28,"Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock got off to an encouraging start this year, with the price going from $3.80 to $4.47. But the gains have since faded. Note that the year-to-date return for NOK stock is about 6%. And yes, when you look back at the past 12 months, it is -33%.Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com For NOK stock, the fortunes are tied to the 5G opportunity. The technology offers much greater speed and performance, which should lead to more innovative applications. No doubt, companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) are investing heavily in 5G to boost their competitiveness.Now for NOK stock, there have been some positive developments. For example, the regulatory approval for the merger of T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) should be a boost. Keep in mind that - in the summer of 2018 - NOK and TMUS entered a strategic partnership for 5G. So, with Sprint, there will be access to critical wireless radio licenses. This should help expand the 5G opportunity for NOK.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the meantime, the company has been making progress with snagging customer contracts. As of the end of the latest quarter, NOK had 66 commercial 5G engagements and 19 have been finished.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip While all this is certainly good, there are some headwinds, though. The fact is that overall growth for 5G has been sluggish. Part of this is that the carriers are taking a wait-and-see approach with the initial rollouts. But at the same time, there is lots of uncertainty regarding how things will ultimately play out with the U.S.'s battle against Huawei, which is China's mega telecom equipment developer. The U.S. believes that the company is essentially a spy for the government and poses serious national security risks.Regardless, there are many customers that are far from clear on how to proceed. And yes, this has muted demand.But there are other nagging issues for NOK stock. Note that the competitive environment remains intense. For the most part, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) has proven to be a formidable rival. There has also been more price cutting and discounting to snag deals.For NOK, it also does not help that the company blundered with its technology choices. Initially the company focused on using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) but this was too expensive. As a result, NOK has been transitioning to system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrated circuits. But this will take time to make a difference.And finally, there is the impact of the coronavirus from China. For NOK, the company is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. What's more, the slowing of the global economy will likely mean delays in purchasing decisions for 5G equipment. Bottom Line on NOK StockRecently the U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, gave a speech where he expressed the idea of taking a controlling interest in NOK or ERIC (or both). Yes, if this winds up happening, it would be a nice driver for the stock price.But wagering on this is very risky. A deal for NOK may face political blowback in the U.S. as well as Finland. The U.S. also has little experience with state-sponsored ownership with private entities.Actually, regarding NOK stock, perhaps the biggest attraction is the valuation. Consider that the company's forward price-earnings ratio is about 11.5 times. The sentiment is also fairly negative.But based on the company's own guidance, the top-line growth is expected to be essentially zero for this year. Interestingly enough, this could be too optimistic because of the slowing global economy and tough competitive environment.  Thus, there may be few catalysts to get NOK stock back on track.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

2020-03-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In Finland’s epic national poem, the Kalevala, a hero is tasked with retrieving the mythical sampo, a mill capable of producing salt, meal and gold that is a talisman of happiness and prosperity.It’s a task that now befalls Pekka Lundmark, the executive appointed chief of Nokia Oyj on Monday with a mandate to return the troubled Finnish network-equipment maker to more prosperous times.The time is right for his predecessor Rajeev Suri to hand over the reins. Appointed head of Nokia’s networks division in 2009, Suri became CEO in 2014 as that business became the firm’s main operation after the sale of the handset arm to Microsoft Corp. He has overseen the reshaping of a company that at the dawn of the millennium was one of the world’s biggest, with a market capitalization peaking at $290 billion in 2000, and the pride of Finnish industry.By acquiring French rival Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, he ensured that Nokia remained one of the top three suppliers of telecoms equipment, even as China’s Huawei Technologies Co. spent aggressively to leapfrog it and Sweden’s Ericsson AB to become the biggest player.But that takeover also caused problems for which Suri now seems to be paying the price. Nokia’s revenue grew more slowly than either of its two biggest competitors last year. Difficulties integrating the French company proved a distraction as the telecommunications industry started developing fifth-generation network technology. Carriers complain that Nokia now lags Ericsson and Huawei technologically, and the Finnish firm has struggled to compete on cost. Suri will hand over the reins in September. Chairman Risto Siilasmaa said Nokia aims to resolve shortcomings in the semiconductors used in its base stations this year, which ought remedy some of the tech concerns. Siilasmaa already planned to step down, to be replaced in April by Sari Baldauf.All of those missteps had helped drive shares of Nokia in its current form close to their all-time lows as a multiple of expected earnings. The stock was trading at less than 14 times forward earnings before the management change was announced. It traded as high as 29 times earnings on that basis in Suri’s first year at the helm.That downward trajectory makes Nokia vulnerable to an approach from an activist investor who could seek a breakup of the company. Replacing the CEO might help the company get ahead of the problem. And it surely can’t be a coincidence that Lundmark’s appointment follows that of Baldauf as chair of Nokia’s board: While in the same role at Fortum Oyj, she appointed Lundmark to his current job as CEO of the Finnish utility. Under his leadership, the firm has outperformed its European peers, generating an 80% return for shareholders.One recent event will give Lundmark some breathing space: U.S. regulators’ decision to approve the acquisition of Sprint Corp. by rival carrier T-Mobile US Inc. The delayed deal, which was first agreed two years ago, has meant that some spending decisions have also been pushed back. Both companies are big Nokia customers, which might help earnings this year.But Lundmark might also learn from the Kalevala. In the poem, the quest results in a fight that sees the sampo smashed into little pieces. Lundmark has been made responsible for determining Nokia’s strategy, which will include deciding whether Suri’s approach to offering an “end-to-end” network solution still makes sense, or whether some businesses are worth divesting. If he dithers, then activists might take the decision out of his hands and lead Nokia to a sampo-like fate.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-03-02,"(Bloomberg) -- TurboTax has long been the leader in do-it-yourself tax-filing software. But it has faced increasing competition from a nimble startup, Credit Karma Inc., which has become one of the preferred financial apps for young people by giving out free credit scores and helping them find auto loans and credit cards. And since 2017, it has offered a completely free tax-filing service. Intuit Inc., the parent company of TurboTax, took note and agreed to spend $7.1 billion to buy Credit Karma last week. Several legal experts say the deal raises serious antitrust concerns, and see parallels to a 2011 attempt by H&R Block Inc. to acquire another DIY tax software company that regulators blocked.The prospect for tech deals may be even weaker now, amid calls for greater federal scrutiny. Increasingly, legal experts are flagging concerns about the harms posed by large companies buying smaller ones before they develop into serious threats.Intuit is the biggest provider of DIY tax filing software in the U.S., splitting about 80% of the market with H&R Block, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Julie Chariell. Credit Karma’s market share is only 3%, but it’s growing fast. Founded in 2007, the San Francisco-based company has attracted more than 100 million users, including about half of all U.S. millennials. That’s twice as many as Intuit. Credit Karma’s free tax-preparing business grew by about 50% last year, according to the company.“There's no question the acquisition could and should face scrutiny,” said Aaron Edlin, a law and economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. “There's a huge concern when the leading firm in an industry such as tax software buys another firm that is competitive, particularly that's offering free tax software.”Eleanor Fox, a law professor at New York University, said regulators wouldn’t just be looking at the companies’ size, but could also be concerned about whether the deal is “cornering a market.”Intuit has told investors the Credit Karma deal should be finalized by the second half of the year, a sign that it’s optimistic it can pass an antitrust review. The company argues that taxes are only one part of Credit Karma’s offerings, which mostly revolve around selling financial products based on the data it collects from free services, including tax filings. Intuit says the deal isn’t about stifling competition and that the two companies would operate separately. When asked on a conference call about market consolidation, Chief Executive Officer Sasan Goodarzi said, “This is all about playing offense and delivering for customers.”Representatives for the Justice Department, Intuit and Credit Karma declined to comment.In Intuit’s latest annual financial report, it lists Credit Karma as a primary U.S. competitor. Some customers certainly see it that way. One person complained on Twitter about TurboTax’s charges. “My kids make like 2k last year but because she made 401k contributions she has to pay $80 to get a $200 refund. No thanks, @creditkarma to the rescue.”Matt Stoller, the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, called it “embarrassing” that Intuit even proposed the merger. “These kinds of mergers are obviously illegal and enforcers just don't uphold the law,” he said.In 2011, a court sided with the Justice Department and prevented H&R Block, the second largest player in digital do-it-yourself tax preparation software, from buying its third-place rival, the creator the software “TaxAct.” In that case, Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the proposed merger would give H&R Block and Intuit a combined 90% control over the tax market.Barak Orbach, a law professor at the University of Arizona, said he believes the Credit Karma acquisition will be approved since it could help create competition with the tech giants, who are moving further into financial products. And, despite the tough stance taken by regulators against big tech companies, T-Mobile US Inc. recently won approval for its $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp. after a state-led lawsuit that sought to block the deal. Even before the Credit Karma acquisition, the government was scrutinizing Intuit’s actions. The company is facing lawsuits and regulatory inquiries into its approach to the Internal Revenue Service’s Free File tax program. That federal program -- not to be confused with software that’s advertised as free -- is meant to provide low-income people truly free tax software. ProPublica has reported that Intuit hid its federal free file program in search results and redirected people to its commercial service. Intuit subsequently agreed to stop the practice.The antitrust review of Credit Karma will likely hinge on a few points, said James Tierney, who supervised the case against H&R Block at the Justice Department: &quot;Is this company restraining Intuit's pricing? If you got rid of Credit Karma, could Intuit raise prices? That's one question and the other question might be, is Credit Karma driving innovation in the market?&quot;Tierney, now an attorney at Orrick, said the Justice Department was unlikely to take Intuit by its word that Credit Karma would operate independently. &quot;The fact of the matter is that Intuit will control Credit Karma and they have the ability to do whatever they want with it,&quot; he said. (Updates with comments from law professor in sixth paragraph.

2020-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son’s Midas touch has been wearing off lately. The SoftBank Group Corp. chief executive officer is seeing some of the company's largest investments crumble while struggling to raise a new technology fund and keep an activist investor at bay. On Wednesday, he made a rare appearance on Twitter to propose a solution to the shortage of coronavirus tests. The plan was immediately panned, and Son quickly walked it back.However, there’s one part of Son’s team where the charm offensive looks like it’s working: SoftBank’s Washington lobbying operation. The Japanese conglomerate known for flooding the world of technology startups with cash—sometimes billions of dollars in a single funding round—is now wielding its wallet in D.C. The company’s lobbying bill climbed to $1.94 million in 2019, a step up from $225,000 in 2018, according to filings with Congress. That spending, which doesn’t include lobbying by its subsidiaries, is far lower than that of American tech giants like Amazon.com Inc. or Facebook Inc., but is more than double the amounts for Netflix Inc. or PayPal Holdings Inc. Of the 10,000 or so organizations that report lobbying every year, the Center for Responsive Politics says, SoftBank ranks among the top 4% of spenders. “Two million is a lot in Washington,” said Dan Auble, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, even though that can look like a small sum for the tech industry. In D.C., he said, &quot;a relatively modest expenditure can have a big return.&quot;SoftBank’s Washington push represents a new interest in politics for the company. For the three years prior to 2018, it had virtually zero U.S. lobbying expenditure. Now, as the company grapples on other fronts with activist investor Elliott Management and under-performing investments in companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and WeWork, it also has plenty of reasons to be in D.C. SoftBank’s recently assembled team of seasoned lobbyists is advocating for both the parent company, as well as the dozens of startups that it's invested in, a roster whose policy wish lists encompass topics ranging from self-driving cars to commercial spacecraft. SoftBank started staffing up in D.C. two years ago when it hired Ziad Ojakli away from his post as the chief lobbyist at Ford Motor Co., and began contracting with lobbying firm Carmen Group. Last year, SoftBank registered four in-house staffers as lobbyists, and added two respected shops, Fierce Government Relations and Subject Matter, to its roster of outside firms.Today, SoftBank is on the cusp of a major victory. The hotly contested $26 billion sale of SoftBank-owned Sprint Corp. to T-Mobile US Inc. had been mired in regulatory and legal challenges. Now, after approval last year by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department, along with defeating a lawsuit brought by more than a dozen states, the deal is set to close. The clearance required substantial legal resources, separate from lobbying, devoted to the lawsuit. Ojakli, SoftBank’s global government affairs officer, said his staff had advocated for the merger over the course of months of conversations with members of Congress, FCC officials and representatives for the Justice Department. “We helped make the case to the government that it was going to be incredible for the U.S. in terms of 5G,” Ojakli said, referring to the next generation of mobile broadband. “The spadework was what allowed us to succeed ultimately in court.” SoftBank’s efforts helped along those of T-Mobile, which spent an additional $8.92 million on lobbying last year, according to filings, and Sprint itself, which spent $3.49 million. And as with all lobbying spending disclosures, the official figures rarely encompass all of a company’s expenditures in Washington, including legal fees, advertising and other forms of soft influence.Beyond megamergers, Ojakli said the bulk of SoftBank’s lobbying is spent advocating for its portfolio of startup investments. “Really, most of the time in our lobbying work, we have to deal with the smaller ones,” he said. Typically, younger companies have neither the connections nor resources to argue their interests in Washington. Startup executives are often “triple-hatting” in different jobs, Ojakli noted, leaving them little time to ponder how to navigate D.C.Starting last year, SoftBank’s disclosure filings showed lobbying activity around autonomous vehicles, where the company has made several investments via its $100 billion Vision Fund. Those investments include Uber and General Motors’ Cruise LLC. But one of the smaller companies it has backed, Nuro Inc., recently won a significant regulatory greenlight. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration granted Nuro an exemption from a rule requiring features such as windshields for a new fleet of low-speed delivery vehicles that Nuro calls R2s. Now, Nuro is rolling out R2 testing in Houston that will soon include Domino's pizza deliveries.The victory stemmed not so much from traditional lobbying as from a &quot;technocratic process,&quot; said Matthew Lipka, Nuro's Washington-based head of autonomous vehicle policy. Ojakli celebrated the victory, calling the exemption a &quot;terrific, terrific outcome.&quot; Nuro and SoftBank staff are focused on updating autonomous-vehicle rule-making overall at the federal level, Lipka said, a process that can take eight to 10 years per rule, and which involves members of Congress as well as Transportation Department officials. A spokesman for the NHTSA said the agency’s decision-making hinges on a “safety equivalence evaluation, performed by safety engineers and attorneys,” and “is based on objective standards and legal requirements.” The process ignores &quot;non-relevant factors,&quot; he added.It’s been helpful for Nuro to work with SoftBank in Washington, Lipka said. “SoftBank is a partner with us,” he said. “They have a lot of expertise.” The company’s Washington team can augment Nuro’s strategy, for example by tapping existing relationships with different members of Congress, Lipka added, “It’s helpful to have another voice.” Nuro spent $120,000 on lobbying last year, via outside firm Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas Inc.Another beneficiary of SoftBank’s work in Washington: Plenty Unlimited Inc., an indoor farming company that raised its profile considerably in 2017 when the Vision Fund led its $200 million funding round. At the time, it was an extraordinarily large investment for an agricultural technology startup, but a relatively modest sum for the fund. Last year, “we arranged for Sonny Perdue to come out and see Plenty first-hand,” Ojakli said about the secretary of agriculture. SoftBank lists the Agriculture Department as a target agency on its lobbying disclosure forms, and Ojakli said he was pleased when in January this year, after intense efforts by industry groups, the department won $5 million in congressional funding to set up a new office for Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production. The office’s mission includes promoting urban and indoor agriculture, which could help Plenty. Plenty declined to comment.SoftBank is also hoping for wins in a few other areas. Like space, for example. SoftBank put in the lion’s share of the $3.4 billion raised by OneWeb, a British satellite maker, and has listed “commercial space issues” as a topic of interest on each of its three lobbying disclosure forms for last year.OneWeb could benefit if the FCC signs off on a plan to allow it to provide U.S. internet access from more satellites. However, Ojakli said his team has advised OneWeb from a broad strategic perspective rather than work on any single issue. “We are grateful to SoftBank for providing guidance and support as we look to share the OneWeb story across the government,” said a spokeswoman for the startup. SoftBank also lobbied last year on financial technology, an area where it holds investments including Lemonade and Kabbage; life sciences, where its bets include Zymergen Inc.; workplace technology, where it has backed Automation Anywhere Inc.; and artificial intelligence, an industry that undergirds Son’s investing thesis, and where it has funded companies including Mapbox Inc. and SoftBank Robotics Group. Not all of SoftBank’s efforts go the way it hoped. Take its work on renewable-energy tax credits, which it says would benefit portfolio company View Inc., in which the Vision Fund has invested $1.1 billion. The startup makes glass walls that automatically darken and lighten to keep sunlight in or out as required, saving on heating and cooling bills. Congress didn't include tax credits for dynamic glass in its December spending legislation. “It was a bummer we didn’t get it across the finish line,” said Ojakli. “We ran out of time more than anything.” View has also worked with Washington lobbyist Cassidy & Associates over the last five years. View declined to comment.Besides its varied startup investments, Ojakli and his team also advocate on behalf of SoftBank itself, which as a Japanese company is subject to additional rules and restrictions on its U.S. activities. Ojakli’s staff must contend with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency body with authority to review foreign investments in American companies. CFIUS isn’t listed on official forms as an agency that lobbyists can try to influence, unlike its component agencies such as the Treasury Department. The group is tasked with making sure foreign acquisitions of American businesses don’t hurt national security, and has final say over many SoftBank deals, including its bailout package of WeWork parent We Co. last year.“We’re the most frequent customer of CFIUS by far,” quips Ojakli, whose team works alongside SoftBank’s legal team on fielding CFIUS inquiries and meeting with its staff. “We’re coming at it from the perspective of being a U.S. ally that wants to invest in some of the most innovative companies in the U.S.”CFIUS has become more powerful since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, but that’s a person Son has done a little lobbying with on his own. A month before Trump’s inauguration, Son met with him at Trump Tower in New York, and announced SoftBank would invest $50 billion in U.S. businesses over an undisclosed time frame. “We’re well on our way to meeting that commitment,” Ojakli said.To contact the authors of this story: Sarah McBride in San Francisco at smcbride24@bloomberg.netBen Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackMark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Ratchets Up D.C.

2020-03-13,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. plans to spend up to 500 billion yen ($4.8 billion) buying back as much as 7% of its shares, taking a step advocated by activist investor Elliott Management Corp. to boost stockholder value.The re-purchases will run from March 16 through March 15, 2021 and the shares will be retired, the company said Friday. SoftBank’s shares fell despite the announcement, dropping as much as 9.2% along with the broad market decline.The scale however falls far short of Elliott’s envisioned amount. The activist investor disclosed a stake of almost $3 billion in SoftBank in February, arguing the company’s shares were substantially undervalued given assets including a stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Elliott advocated for a share buyback of as much as $20 billion, along with governance changes and more transparency about its investments.Elliott said in a statement Friday it supported the move and called the initial buyback an “important first step in addressing the company’s undervaluation.” It said SoftBank should have opportunities to pursue additional buybacks after the merger between SoftBank-backed Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. is completed.“Elliott trusts that SoftBank’s leadership will continue to build upon today’s progress and its demonstrated commitment to value creation,” it said.Founder Masayoshi Son has also argued his shares are undervalued, and SoftBank itself calculates its stock may be worth more than double the current price. But the Japanese company’s portfolio of startups -- which includes struggling names like WeWork and Oyo Hotels -- remains particularly vulnerable to economic and market shocks from the coronavirus pandemic. The investment giant’s five-year senior credit default swaps -- a hedging tool that indicates the risk of a company going under -- spiked on Thursday to their highest levels since 2016.“The buyback continues SoftBank’s practice of re-purchases following large drops in the share price,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “Given the long drawn-out acquisition period, it is unlikely to provide much support in the market driven by emotions.”Read more: SoftBank Falls Most in 7 Years After Virus Erases Elliott GainsThe past 12 months have been tumultuous for Son and SoftBank. The company unveiled a record buyback in February 2019, sparking a rally that pushed shares to the highest since its dot-com peak in 2000. Uber Technologies Inc.’s disappointing public debut and the implosion of WeWork wiped out the gains over the next few months. But SoftBank surged again after Elliott disclosed its stake and Son won approval to sell his Sprint Corp. to T-Mobile US Inc. The latest buyback comes as all of the gains from the activist’s involvement have been wiped out by the growing fears around the coronavirus pandemic.“Given the spread between what we consider to be the fair value of our company and growing market volatility, we decided on this policy for shareholder return,” SoftBank spokesman Kenichi Yuasa said. “The amount reflects consideration of liquidity on hand and financial stability.”Investors have grown increasingly wary about SoftBank’s and the Vision Fund’s holdings in startups that have enjoyed abundant liquidity in past years. Son met with fund managers and financial institutions in New York City this month, arguing that recent market declines were an opportunity to invest at discounted valuations. But global economic uncertainty has strained fundraising and stoked worries that startup valuations are stretched -- particularly in sectors vulnerable to the outbreak such as ride-hailing and travel.Read more: SoftBank Ratchets Up D.C. Lobbying to Boost Its StartupsElliott wants SoftBank to set up a special committee to review processes at the Vision Fund, the world’s largest single investment pool for tech startups. Investor Paul Singer’s firm argues the fund has dragged down the share price despite making up a small portion of assets under management, people familiar with the discussions have said.The activist has also pushed SoftBank to sell some of its stake in Alibaba to pay for a buyback. But Son said during SoftBank’s latest quarterly financial briefing he’d prefer to sell as little as possible and that there’s “no rush” to do so.Instead, SoftBank last month announced plans to borrow as much as 500 billion yen by putting up shares of its Japanese telecom unit as collateral, renewing questions about the Japanese conglomerate’s massive debt pile. SoftBank said the money will come from 16 financial institutions and pledged as much as 953 million shares of SoftBank Corp.SoftBank had 19.25 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt as of Dec. 31, a 23% increase since the start of the fiscal year in April. Sprint’s imminent merger with T-Mobile will lighten the load by about 4.9 trillion yen. Still, SoftBank may find it a challenge to balance shareholder returns with big-ticket investments in technology companies. The company had 3.8 trillion yen of cash and equivalents, while more than 2.6 trillion yen of bonds are coming due in the next three years.“Son is sending a message that the stock in cheap,” said Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. Considering how much the overall market has plunged, “you could say that investors have received Son’s signal.”(Updates with Elliott comment in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Takahiko Hyuga, Yuki Furukawa and Scott Deveau.To contact the reporter on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Plans $4.8 Billion Buyback After Elliott’s Call

2020-03-16,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest school system in the U.S. is closing. California is confining the elderly to their homes. Bars, restaurants, resorts and several retail chains are closing shop. Welcome to the Great Shutdown, as wide swaths of the American economy enter suspended animation to combat the spread of the coronavirus.On Sunday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city’s public schools -- encompassing some 1.1 million students -- will close until at least April 20. California Governor Gavin Newsom called for all of the state’s bars and wineries to close and for restaurants to cut capacity by half, while advising the state’s 5.3 million citizens above 65 to isolate themselves in their homes.“This crisis is growing intensely,” De Blasio said when announcing the schools decision. “This is something I could not in a million years imagine having to do.”Late Sunday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to cancel or postpone gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks -- its most sweeping recommendation yet.Soon after, New York City officials said that starting March 17 they would shut nightclubs, theaters and concert venues while limiting restaurants and bars to takeout and delivery. Los Angeles extended the same measures further to also close bars and gyms by the end of Sunday -- and encouraged houses of worship to not open.“To some it may feel wrong,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said of the restrictions. “I would say it’s exactly when things feel wrong that it’s the right time to do them. And when things feel right it’s too late.”Those announcements capped a steady barrage on Sunday that included decisions by the governors of Ohio and Illinois to close bars and prohibit dining in restaurants.The unprecedented moves are intended to help contain the highly contagious virus that’s infected more than 160,000 people worldwide and led to 6,000 deaths, including more than 60 in the U.S. They followed the sweeping restrictions on crowded venues and gatherings imposed earlier by Italy, Spain and France -- dramatic measures for nations known for their out-and-about lifestyles.While only a small share of those infected end up needing hospital care for the respiratory illness caused by the virus, the speed and magnitude of its spread can overwhelm hospitals, as happened in Italy and China, where the virus first emerged.NYC SchoolsDe Blasio said the city plans to begin online instruction starting March 23, with teachers receiving training this week on software to help them convert their classwork for the Internet. While the goal is to try to reopen April 20, he acknowledged that classes might be done for the year. The city now has 329 cases of coronavirus and five deaths.Apple Inc. has sold iPads to the city at a discount, schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said, so that 300,000 students who need devices could receive loaners connected to the Internet through programs offered by T-Mobile, Verizon, Spectrum and Google.In Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine ordered all bars and restaurants to close starting at 9 p.m. Sunday, adding that venues can stay open for carry-out and delivery. “What we can’t have is people congregating and seated,” he wrote on Twitter.One small bar was a couple of days ahead of DeWine, telling its patrons on March 13 that it was closing while the virus spreads.“We made the decision to shut it down for public safety, knowing that our governor hadn’t imposed any restrictions yet, but we felt it was the right thing to do,” said Mark Altemeier, who along with wife Amy owns the Monkey Bar & Grille in the Cincinnati suburb of Mainesville, Ohio. The pub, set along the Little Miami River and named for an infamous cigarette-smoking chimp called Sam who entertained bar-dwellers there decades ago, can pack in 400 to 500 people on weekends. Amy Altemeier said Sunday she had expected as many as 2,000 revelers to filter through for this week’s St. Patrick’s Day festivities.In Illinois, Governor J.B. Pritzker imposed an order similar to Ohio’s, to run from March 16 to March 30. In the nation’s capital, leaders put an end to bar seating, ordered tables to be pushed 6 feet apart, and shut down nightclubs.“I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and bars,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Sunday. “Whatever it takes to do that, that’s what I’d like to see.”Sorry, We’re ClosedFew types of venue are being spared -- including outdoor spaces. Miami and Fort Lauderdale, which at this time of year are filled with college students on spring break, have closed some beaches to the public, suspended concerts and ordered bars and restaurants to operate at 50% capacity, according to local news reports.Starbucks Corp. said Sunday it would pause all in-store seating in the U.S. and Canada, and shutter stores in high-traffic area like university campuses and malls. It will still offer customers to pick up coffee to-go.In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis ordered the shutdown of all ski areas for a week, shortly after Vail Resorts Inc. suspended operations of its North American mountain resorts and retail stores through March 22. In Arizona, Grand Canyon National Park remains open but South Rim restaurants were far emptier than usual, and ranger programs and showings of the park film were canceled.Also on Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo urged businesses to voluntarily shutter or have people work from home, and said the school closings are necessary to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.Many businesses are heeding such calls. Urban Outfitters Inc. said Saturday it would close all stores until at least March 28. On Sunday, Abercrombie & Fitch followed, but said its stores in the Asia-Pacific region will remain open. On Monday, Nike Inc. will close all its shops in the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand through March 27.Wynn Resorts is temporarily closing Wynn Las Vegas and Encore effective March 17 for two weeks.Open, for NowWhile large national or global businesses may have the resources to temporarily close stores, some small businesses are trying novel approaches to stay afloat.Modo Yoga, with 70 studios North America, Europe and Australia, has begun streaming free classes over Instagram, encouraging users to support them by chipping in a few dollars via Venmo or PayPal.“We’re hanging on for dear life,” said Steve Vernetti, owner of Vernetti, a self-financed mom-and-pop Italian restaurant on Larchmont Boulevard in Los Angeles that counts Garcetti among its regulars. “Next week I’m going to write a letter to my landlord begging him to reduce the rent. We have exorbitant costs. Business is down 75%.”The Los Angeles mayor said he’s also ordering a moratorium on evictions for renters, and has asked the city’s attorney to explore whether he could legally prevent commercial evictions as well.And creative workarounds aren’t just happening in the secular world: In Sugar Land, Texas, The Bridge church closed its doors, asking worshipers to participate in services online through March 29. Sugar Land is in Fort Bend County, which has nine confirmed or presumed cases of coronavirus.ORead more: Online Mass and Suspended Pilgrimages—How the Faithful ManageFor now, the shutdowns in the U.S. are less severe than in parts of Europe. Italy began a nationwide lockdown Monday. This weekend, Spanish authorities banned citizens from leaving their homes except for work or to buy essential supplies or medicines. And the French government shut down all restaurants, cafes, cinemas and nonessential retail shops.Yet even Americans who shy away from cable news, Twitter or newspapers likely won’t be able to escape the myriad encouragements to avoid their fellow humans.“Hands clean 2 beat Covid-19,” read an electronic message board next to State Highway 288 in Houston.

2020-03-18,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. shares fell the most since 2012 after S&P Global Ratings cut its outlook to negative, as investors grow increasingly skittish about the company’s prospects with global markets in tumult.The credit-rating agency said the Japanese conglomerate’s plan to spend up to 500 billion yen ($4.7 billion) buying back shares amid plummeting markets raises questions about its commitment to sound financial practices. The company’s shares dropped as much as 12%, the most intraday since October 2012. The agency did affirm the company’s long-term issuer BB+ rating.SoftBank said it would buy back as much as 7% of its shares last week, taking a step advocated by activist investor Elliott Management Corp. to boost stockholder value. But the move has done little to reassure investors, with the stock down more than 15% since the announcement.“The buyback plan is likely to weigh on SoftBank Group’s credit quality because it strongly underscores its aggressive financial management,” S&P’s Hiroyuki Nishikawa and Makiko Yoshimura wrote in a research note. “Under normal circumstances, the current rating would likely tolerate the impact of a share buyback of this scale. But the buyback follows a plan announced in October 2019 to provide extensive financial support to U.S.-based investee WeWork Companies LLC. It also comes amid large falls in stock prices.”SoftBank Group’s market value has tumbled to about 6.98 trillion yen, about the same as SoftBank Corp., the domestic telecom operation that sold stock to the public last year. SoftBank Group still owns about two-thirds of the unit.“The company may struggle to maintain a level of financial soundness that is commensurate with the rating if stock prices remain volatile and result in a sharp drop in the value of its investment assets,” the S&P analysts wrote. Just after the S&P move, news emerged that SoftBank has told shareholders of WeWork that it could withdraw from an agreement to buy $3 billion of stock in the embattled co-working business, casting doubt on a deal that had been set to close in about two weeks.In a message to stockholders reviewed by Bloomberg News, the Japanese conglomerate cited numerous government inquiries into WeWork, including those from U.S. attorneys, the Securities and Exchange Commission, attorneys general in California and New York and the Manhattan district attorney.The WeWork stock purchase was part of a rescue financing from SoftBank after WeWork’s failed initial public offering last year. SoftBank already invested $1.5 billion as part of the bailout in October and is looking to arrange billions of dollars more in debt.S&P’s BB+ rating on SoftBank put it at the highest non-investment grade, same as Moody’s Ba1. Japan Credit Rating Agency ranks it at A-, or four levels above junk. Both Moody’s and JCR have a stable outlook on the company.SoftBank had 19.25 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt as of Dec. 31, a 23% increase since the start of the fiscal year in April. Sprint Corp.’s imminent merger with T-Mobile will lighten the load by about 4.9 trillion yen. The company had 3.8 trillion yen of cash and equivalents, while more than 2.6 trillion yen of bonds are coming due in the next three years.(Updates with SoftBank market value in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Group Falls Most Since 2012 After S&P Cuts Outlook

2020-03-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is making his biggest play yet to silence doubters. On Monday, the Japanese billionaire unveiled an unprecedented $41 billion plan to sell off assets and shore up SoftBank Group Corp.’s crumbling market value in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.SoftBank aims to sell assets to raise as much as 4.5 trillion yen ($41 billion) over the coming year to buy back stock and slash debt -- an amount equivalent to almost its entire market value last week. The scale of the endeavor surprised investors, sending the Japanese firm’s stock up 19%. Yet that’s a fraction of the capitalization the investment house has lost since its 2020 peak, underscoring persistent concerns that tumbling technology sector valuations will damage Son’s debt-laden company.The Japanese conglomerate, which also operates the $100 billion Vision Fund, is considered especially vulnerable to economic shocks given its enormous debt load and ties to unprofitable startups across the world. After Monday’s rally, it’s still down more than 40% from this year’s peak in February.The coronavirus-triggered rout has also spread to credit markets and sparked a surge in the cost of insuring debt against default -- including that of SoftBank, whose credit-default swaps touched their highest level in about a decade.Monday’s announcement appeared intended to underscore a point Son himself has made repeatedly: that SoftBank is worth far more than its current stock price thanks to holdings in industry leaders from e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to British chip designer Arm Holdings Plc and Japanese carrier arm SoftBank Corp. Its slice of Alibaba alone is worth more than $120 billion.“Son is finally doing what his investors have been asking for years and unfortunately it took an unprecedented sequence of events for him to do so,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “His Vision Fund ambition will have to take a backseat for now, but he will be back.”It’s unclear what SoftBank intends to sell, however. Alibaba represents its single biggest chunk of unrealized value, but Arm -- which SoftBank bought for $32 billion in 2016 -- is a worldwide leader in the chip architecture that underpins modern smartphones. SoftBank Corp., on the other hand, is a steady if unspectacular leader that generates cash to help fund Son’s global ambitions, and the group likes to use its stock as collateral for loans.“Arm is a golden egg for SoftBank, and the business will attract U.S. firms like Intel once it starts a bidding process,” said Koji Hirai, the head of M&A at advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo.Part of the sale proceeds would go toward a new share buyback program of as much as 2 trillion yen that comes on top of previously announced repurchases. Alibaba’s stock was down more than 5% in the afternoon in Hong Kong. The Japanese firm’s domestic telecom arm, ended 3.4% lower. SoftBank spokeswoman Hiroe Kotera declined to comment on whether it would sell shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant.“There is institutional memory at SoftBank of these kinds of shocks, first dating back to the dot-com bubble,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings who writes for Smartkarma. “There is no doubt that there will be much more bad news coming from the Vision Fund, bankruptcies and falling valuations. This is one way SoftBank can get ahead of that.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSoftBank may sell some of its 26% Alibaba stake, which we believe accounts for about half its net asset value, to fulfill a $41 billion divestment pledge. The pending deconsolidation of its U.S. telecom subsidiary Sprint won’t generate any cash proceeds for SoftBank, as the transaction is an all-stock merger with T-Mobile.&#92;- Anthea Lai, analystClick here for the researchRead more: Son’s Empire Wobbles as Credit Rout Hits SoftBank Debt LoadSon is trying to salvage his reputation as one of the world’s foremost tech investors, a name based largely on a prescient early bet on Alibaba, which grew to dominate e-commerce in the world’s No. 2 economy. But he’s struggled since to match that success, after sinking money into a string of struggling startups from Uber Technologies Inc. to WeWork and Oyo Hotels.Even before the global outbreak, WeWork’s spectacular implosion served as a catalyst for Son to temper SoftBank’s and the Vision Fund’s aggressive global bets. He urged founders to rein in excesses and focus on the bottom line, wary of a repeat of WeWork’s uninhibited expansion.Son has reason to worry. SoftBank’s exposure to cash-burning startups partly prompted S&P Global Ratings to cut its outlook on SoftBank to negative, citing also the broader market declines and the conglomerate’s initial plans for a buyback. The stock repurchase program announced Monday comes on top of a 500 billion yen plan announced just over a week ago, after activist shareholder Elliott Management Corp. called on the Japanese investment firm to boost returns.SoftBank’s Son to Pitch U.S. Investors Under Cloud of WeWork (1)SoftBank has said its financial policy is to have enough liquidity on hand to cover two years of bond repayments and focus on its loan-to-value ratio, a metric for balancing net interest-bearing debt against the value of investments. SoftBank has also said it’s curbing new investments to match the current environment and acknowledged that fundraising costs are likely to rise.It keeps a running tally of what it calculates is the value of its shares, excluding its debt. Despite Monday’s rally, that figure remains more than three times its closing price of 3,187 yen.While SoftBank’s newly unveiled asset sale and buyback plan would go some way toward assuaging concerns about its situation, the big question remains the spread of Covid-19 and its ultimate impact on both investment activity and the broader economy.“SoftBank is now trying to sell its assets as the values for those are cheap,” said Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Japan. “Investment companies are supposed to purchase assets when they are cheap and sell them when they are expensive. It looks like SoftBank is doing the opposite, when they have to invest more money.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Masa Son Unveils a $41 Billion Asset Sale to Silence His Critics
2020-03-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- While the U.S. government and telecommunications industry have been engrossed in the race to 5G, much of the country is still in a slow crawl to regular home internet service. It’s a mistake with economic consequences, and unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic could provide the harshest evidence of that. Americans all around the country are being advised to stay home to slow the spread of the disease. That means adults and children are powering up their computers, laptops and tablets to work and study remotely for the time being, if they can. It’s part of a nationwide social-distancing effort that could go on for weeks or even months, as experts aren’t sure how the health crisis will progress from here. What may be more certain is that the near shutdown of the country’s economy will expose and perhaps exacerbate the digital divide that exists between wealthier cities that have reliable internet access and the many rural towns that don’t. Only 63% of rural Americans have a broadband internet connection at home, compared with 75% of Americans overall, according to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center early last year. That gap is only a slight improvement on the 16-percentage-point difference that existed 13 years ago. In a separate Pew study in 2018, about a quarter of rural respondents cited access to high-speed internet as a major problem, a far higher proportion than people living in urban areas or suburbs.The digital divide tends to be talked about in terms of being a wealth divide, which it absolutely is. But in rural communities, frustration over internet access is also notably shared across different income and education levels, Pew has found. So even as parts of the country are given no choice but to work from home, many that should have the ability don’t. In a similar vein, suburban kids using iPads to attend digital classes or learn from online tutors won’t have the same interruption to their education as children in rural or less well-off areas, where a greater burden may in turn be placed on parents.There’s also a problem within the problem: Nobody really knows exactly how many rural Americans are without high-speed internet, leaving it to guesswork through surveys. That’s due to a lack of useful coverage maps showing what areas have broadband access. During a panel last July about rural broadband challenges, Eric Koch, a Republican state senator from Indiana, said that when a broadband provider “serves” an area, that might mean one customer or a thousand. There’s also a disagreement over what “access” even means. The Federal Communications Commission measures it in terms of those with minimum internet download speeds of 25 megabits per second and at least 3 megabits per second for uploads. About 21 million Americans couldn’t access such connections as of 2017, the latest data available from the FCC. Faster speeds of 100 Mbps — which is what households using multiple devices really need — were deployed to only 58.6% of the rural population, compared with 88.5% of the U.S. overall.What makes this all the more maddening is that the country’s broadband problem has been willfully overshadowed by the fascination of late with 5G, the faster next generation of wireless networks that is being rolled out by carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. FCC Chairman Aji Pai was giddy in throwing his support behind T-Mobile’s takeover of Sprint Corp. last year, citing the 5G possibilities and asking for weak concessions in return. The deal brings together the two low-cost carriers in an already highly concentrated market that’s trying to regain pricing power over consumers. “Carriers and the FCC are so obsessed with the next thing (5G), they’ve not ensured that everyone who needs access to the network can get it or afford it,” Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow with the Georgetown Institute for Technology Law & Policy and a former FCC official, said in an email Thursday.Even with 5G, more densely populated areas are being prioritized, where there are more structures upon which to affix the boxes that serve as mini cellular towers. Delivering 5G to smaller towns is more costly and cumbersome relative to the amount of customers that would be served, which means there’s little incentive to build there.The FCC will say there has been much progress made in closing the digital divide and that lots more work is being done. But it hasn’t been happening nearly quickly enough, and now a pandemic has paralyzed the country. Where you live could determine how you come out on the other side of it. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-03-24,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. plans to sell about $14 billion of shares in Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as part of an effort to raise $41 billion to shore up businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The Japanese conglomerate is considering raising the remainder of the money by selling a stake in SoftBank Corp., its domestic telecommunications arm, as well as part of Sprint Corp. following its merger with T-Mobile US Inc., said one of the people, who requested anonymity discussing private transactions. The Alibaba stake sale could range from $12 billion to as much as $15 billion, the people said.SoftBank’s shares surged as much as 21% in Tokyo Tuesday in their biggest intraday gain since listing, just days after marking a drop of roughly the same magnitude. The reversal comes as founder Masayoshi Son is finally doing what investors have been urging for years -- using his stake in Alibaba for shareholder returns and to pay down debt.Son has set in motion his biggest play yet to silence critics, unveiling the unprecedented plan Monday to unload 4.5 trillion yen ($41 billion) of stock and alleviate investor concerns that at one point shaved more than 40% off SoftBank’s value from a February peak. The company, which also operates the $100 billion Vision Fund, is vulnerable to economic shocks given its enormous debt load and ties to unprofitable startups from WeWork to Oyo Hotels. Many of the Vision Fund’s biggest bets lie in what’s known as the sharing economy, which has been particularly hard-hit by a virus that’s causing millions of people to stay indoors and slash travel spending.“The market sent a strong message and SoftBank has heeded it,” Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings who writes for Smartkarma, said after Monday’s announcement. “What’s changed is that this will entail a meaningful sale of Alibaba stake with much of the proceeds going to shareholders,” he added. “SoftBank has never done that before.”Read more: Masa Son Unveils a $41 Billion Asset Sale to Silence His CriticsWhile SoftBank didn’t specify which assets would be sold, its Alibaba stake is worth more than $120 billion and makes up the largest chunk of unrealized value. It’s unclear what timeframe SoftBank’s looking at -- its stock in Sprint and Hong Kong shares of Alibaba may be subject to lockup periods: one year from listing in Alibaba’s case and up to several years for Sprint, though certain conditions may allow earlier transfers and the company could employ special vehicles to get a deal done.

Yet even after Monday’s and Tuesday’s combined gain, the stock remains down about 33% from its 2020 peak, underscoring persistent concerns that tumbling technology sector valuations will damage Son’s debt-laden company.The coronavirus-triggered rout has spread to credit markets and sparked a surge in the cost of insuring debt against default -- including that of SoftBank, whose credit-default swaps touched their highest level in about a decade. Apollo Global Management, the alternative asset management house co-founded by Leon Black, has placed a short bet against bonds issued by SoftBank because of its tech exposure, according to the Financial Times.Alibaba, Sprint and SoftBank Corp. are worth as much as $190 billion combined, estimates Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. But Son will want to keep at least a 50% stake in the domestic telecom unit because it’s the only cash-generating asset and its dividends help pay for SoftBank’s interest on debt, he wrote. And since Sprint is going through a merger with T-Mobile, most of the funds will initially have to come from Alibaba, he said.“This buyback is music to our ears,” Goyal said. “But the timing of this announcement is not ideal. We would have ideally preferred such an announcement from a position of strength and not because the SBG stock came under tremendous pressure.”(Updates with Alibaba’s shares from the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Plans to Sell $14 Billion in Alibaba Shares

2020-03-26,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. lashed out at Moody’s Corp. after its debt was downgraded by two notches, accusing the ratings company of “bias” and “creating substantial misunderstanding” days after the investment group announced a $41 billion asset sale program intended to shore up confidence.SoftBank’s shares slid as much as 8.4% early in Tokyo trade. The Moody’s downgrade -- lowering SoftBank’s corporate family rating and senior unsecured rating to Ba3 from Ba1 -- pushed the company deeper into junk territory. It comes at a critical time for founder Masayoshi Son, who this week set in motion his biggest play yet to silence critics and shore up his company’s crumbling shares and bonds.“Such a downgrade, which deviates substantially from Moody’s stated rating criteria, will cause substantial misunderstanding among investors who rely on ratings in making investment decisions,” SoftBank said in a statement, which also asked Moody’s to withdraw the rating.While SoftBank had 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion) of cash and equivalents on hand at the end of December, it also has a huge debt load: The firm faces 1.68 trillion yen of bonds and loans coming due over the next two fiscal years and a total of about 3.6 trillion over the following four-year period.Read more: Masa Son Unveils a $41 Billion Asset Sale to Silence His CriticsThe company, which also operates the $100 billion Vision Fund, is vulnerable to economic shocks given that debt, and its ties to unprofitable startups from WeWork to Oyo Hotels.

2020-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of sixteen banks will have to provide $23 billion of loans to T-Mobile US Inc. in order to allow the mobile carrier to close its planned acquisition of Sprint Corp., after the Covid-19 outbreak disrupted plans to sell the debt to third-party investors.The banks were formally notified Monday that they will need to make the funds available on April 1, so that the two companies can finalize their long-awaited merger, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the conversations are private.The banks will have to come up with the loan at a time when they’re already being hit by requests from companies to draw billions of dollars from revolving credit facilities. Companies in the Americas have tapped lenders for more than $190 billion through existing revolvers or new short-term loans since March 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Read more: Wall Street is quietly telling companies not to draw their loansEven though T-Mobile and Sprint are junk-rated, the financing for the merger has been structured in a way to receive investment-grade ratings, the people said. As such, it’s considered less risky than debt arranged by banks to finance leveraged buyouts and other corporate takeovers by high-yield companies. Still, it’s the largest acquisition financing deal to get stuck on banks’ balance sheets since the 2008 financial crisis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Among the sixteen banks, Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada are those with the largest exposure, according to a company filing.Representatives for the six banks declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for T-Mobile declined to comment and referred to a March 19 statement in which the company said it was financially prepared to close the merger based on commitments it had previously obtained.Banks will provide $19 billion through a 364-day bridge loan that is expected to be refinanced by investment-grade bonds and a $4 billion seven-year term loan that is also expected to be rated high-grade, the people said.The investment-grade bond market has sprung back to life after being shut for most of February and following sporadic issuance in early March due to volatility. Last week, U.S. companies borrowed a record $109 billion, while Oracle Corp. is wrapping up a $20 billion deal Monday, the biggest since November.T-Mobile has indicated that it plans to refinance the bridge loan in the bond market soon, once financing conditions have further improved, one of the people added.Below is the full list of banks participating in the financing with their share of the total.(Updates with allocation list at end of story.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Banks Stuck With $23 Billion of Loans for T-Mobile’s Sprint Deal

2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If exchange-traded funds are the fast food of investing, then private equity is the private kitchen. As the world spirals into a recession and the coronavirus pandemic batters your retirement accounts, wealthy investors who bought into assets from unicorns to paintings can hide in an elite bubble that isn’t subject to brutal mark-to-market fair value writedowns.But once in a while, a high-profile unicorn hunter can blow the lid off that opaque world, giving us a glimpse of just how much pain private equity is in. Sometimes, private kitchens churn out terrible dishes, too.Investors are fleeing as SoftBank Group Corp., which runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, scrambles to shore up its balance sheet, as well as those of its portfolio companies. SoftBank gives a good feel for the landscape, because it behaves more like a private equity firm than an angel investor: Its capital is really debt, and it likes to invest in rivals and force them to merge. SoftBank is seeking to raise billions to support its unicorns battered by the coronavirus outbreak, saving those that still show potential and cutting loose the ones that bleed too much cash. On the one hand, it’s in talks to lead a fresh $100 million funding round for Plenty Inc., perhaps because the indoor farming startup can benefit from panic buying of fresh produce. On the other, OneWeb, a satellite operator, has filed for bankruptcy.SoftBank’s desperate scramble must resonate with many private equity firms out there, whose portfolio companies will inevitably need their patrons’ help. By early March, industry titans Blackstone Group Inc. and Carlyle Group Inc. already urged businesses they’ve invested in to do whatever it takes to stave off a credit crunch. But with blue chips drawing at least $124 billion from their credit lines in the first three weeks of March, and dollar funding this tight, will lenders have the bandwidth to aid smaller companies? Banks certainly have much bigger deals to digest: They’ll need to come up with $23 billion of loans soon for T-Mobile USA Inc. to close its merger with Sprint Corp.Granted, for private equity firms, cash levels are at a record high. Last year, capital committed to this sector grew 20% to $1.3 trillion, estimates Pitchbook, a Morningstar company. But instead of buying new assets, firms may have to earmark a good chunk of that money for existing investments, either recapitalizing — like what Softbank has done for basket case WeWork — or leading unplanned funding rounds.Meanwhile, making capital calls to investors can’t be much fun right now. Even the best of them — pension funds and sovereign wealth funds — are dealing with their own crises and may not want to pick up your calls right away, especially if it means selling other assets at deep discounts just to come up with your money. Plus, we now all have the convenient excuse of working from home: Some of us are hiding in the woods (or the Hamptons), away from the raging virus, and may not have good cellphone reception.Just look at SoftBank. As of December, only about 75% of the Vision Fund’s committed capital is with the fund, and the company still needs to call $17.5 billion from third-party investors, its latest filing shows. Since then, Saudi Arabia, a major investor, has started an oil price war, further diminishing its fiscal power. So forget about Vision Fund 2; founder Masayoshi Son needs to fill up 1.0 first. In the last decade, private equity firms piled vast amount of debt onto their portfolio companies to boost returns. More than 75% of deals in the sector included debt multiples greater than six times Ebitda in 2019, compared with 25% after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to Pitchbook. When liquidity recedes, these investments are in trouble.To make matters worse, portfolio companies’ ability to service debt is even worse than it looks on paper, because Wall Street lawyers and bankers often juice earnings to make purchase prices look more reasonable, and so underwriters can originate more loans and earn more fees. In 2016, businesses involved in a merger or leveraged buyout missed their own earnings projections by an average of 35% in the first year after the deal, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in December.So imagine the coronavirus world, where any prior earnings projections feel as outdated as “Sex and the City” stars prancing around Central Park in Manolo Blahniks. Just as social distancing is becoming the norm, so too will corporate defaults. The global rate could climb to 16.1% if the pandemic brings economic conditions that mirror the Great Recession, Moody’s Investors Services warned last week.In private equity, fancy terms like total addressable market or adjusted Ebitda are often used to make a company look more profitable than it is. But the coronavirus is unraveling all that. Just like the rest of world, private markets are also suffering.

2020-04-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Amid all the economic despair in the age of coronavirus, there is still something about the promise of sky-high returns that the American investor finds irresistible.Cruise line operator Carnival Corp. proved that Wednesday when investors clamored to buy a new $4 billion bond sale that pays interest of 11.5%, one of the highest coupons ever offered, particularly by an investment-grade rated company. Demand was so frenzied -- as high as around $17 billion -- that Carnival was able to cut the coupon and increase the original size of the offering by an extra $1 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.Even with the economy spinning down, corporations around the globe have been able to tap the bond market to raise record amounts from investors in recent weeks. While executives are looking to stay liquid, investors’ confidence was buoyed by the trillions of dollars the Federal Reserve and other central banks are spending to buttress their economies.The demand for Carnival’s bonds was especially notable because investors have largely shunned riskier firms. Its business has been ravaged by the virus and investors still can’t be sure when the company will sail again. Appropriately enough, the majority of orders for Carnival’s offering are from junk-bond accounts.Yields that approach Carnival’s heights are usually seen only on the riskiest types of junk bonds, such as those issued from holding companies that are further removed from real assets or those that give borrowers the option to delay cash interest payments.A flurry of other bond deals Wednesday continued a strong performance for much of March, with 11 new investment-grade dollar deals, and T-Mobile US Inc. is marketing a potential $10 billion offering for its acquisition of Sprint Corp. Europe had 17 new deals, its busiest day since January, including Tiffany buyer LVMH and Absolut Vodka maker Pernod Ricard SA.Overall in March, U.S. investment-grade issuance topped $259 billion for a new monthly record, while European supply passed 135 billion euros ($148 billion), the most since 2016. Asia’s dollar market was quiet for most of the month, though Chinese internet search giant Baidu Inc. announced a deal to start April.Still, returns were dismal. Even with the Fed’s help fueling a late stage rally, March was still the worst month for returns since the end of 2008, with U.S. high-yield down 11.5% and investment grade dropping 7.1%. The European index lost 6.9% in March, its biggest loss ever. Spreads on top-rated Asian dollar bonds ended the first quarter 146 basis points wider, the worst blowout since 2009.“We expect issuance to continue as corporates look to bolster liquidity,” said Henrik Johnsson, co-head of capital markets at Deutsche Bank AG. “The long term effect of all this debt is hard to quantify.”U.S.Credit markets weakened with stocks on Wednesday as President Donald Trump told the U.S. to brace for one of its toughest stretches as a nation, with the death toll from the virus projected to potentially top 200,000.

2020-04-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A headline from three days ago read “Banks Stuck With $23 Billion of Loans for T-Mobile’s Sprint Deal.” A group of 16 banks would have to provide money to T-Mobile US Inc. to close its planned acquisition of Sprint Corp. because they couldn’t sell debt to third-party investors. T-Mobile would refinance the bridge loan in the bond market as soon as financing conditions improved.Well, that was quick.The mobile carrier plans to tap the corporate-bond market Thursday with a deal of about $10 billion, with proceeds helping repay that $19 billion bridge credit agreement (it signed a new $4 billion term loan on Wednesday as well). Even though it’s one of the biggest debt sales of the year, financial markets still remain highly volatile and T-Mobile’s credit rating was cut this week deeper into speculative grade, the company received more than $30 billion of orders from investors, Bloomberg News’s Molly Smith reported.That’s impressive, considering that the initial pricing levels for this investment-grade offering were already favorable for the company. T-Mobile’s 10-year bonds are expected to yield around 375 basis points more than benchmark Treasuries, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. By comparison, a Bloomberg Barclays index of triple-B corporate bonds with an average maturity of 11.75 years has a spread of 359 basis points, near the lowest since March 18. That’s close enough — and it’s likely that T-Mobile’s gap will narrow with such a large order book.It’s even more interesting to compare this new deal, with the lowest investment grades of Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by S&P Global Ratings, and T-Mobile’s last offering in January 2018, which is speculative grade. The company priced 10-year bonds at the time at a spread of 209 basis points more than Treasuries, to yield 4.75%. T-Mobile’s spreads are now much wider, even though this new debt is “senior-secured,” but 10-year U.S. yields are more than 200 basis points lower than they were 26 months ago. That means the all-in 10-year yield for T-Mobile will probably be about 4.35% — a good deal lower than the previous rate.This is important context to remember for both companies and bond buyers. The rapid price swings across markets in the past month and the focus on yield spreads have somewhat masked the fact that whenever the outlook starts to stabilize, borrowing costs will once again be as low as ever for creditworthy corporations. The benchmark 10-year yield is a mere 0.6%, near the all-time low closing level of 0.54% set on March 9. Bank of America Corp. technical strategists said in a report Thursday that the benchmark could reach 0% this quarter and potentially even turn negative if governments struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak.With so much uncertainty, it’s understandable that T-Mobile seized on this window to get on with its plans. It formally completed its merger with Sprint on Wednesday morning. Mike Sievert, who was named chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that the timing of the bond sale relative to the bridge loan was “coincidental.” The fact that the group of banks was ready to help get the acquisition over the finish line was the most prudent first step, he said. Then the company deemed the market had thawed enough to borrow.“We’ve been watching the markets over the past few days and seeing an improving condition for us to go to the market with this investment-grade offer. Today looked like the right day,” Sievert said. “The last couple of days, obviously we were in the process of taking down the bridge and we had the merger news that made the last couple of days the wrong time to be in the market.”Obviously, T-Mobile would have had a better borrowing backdrop a few months ago. But large companies are rarely in position to perfectly time the market. In most cases, good reception is enough. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-04-02,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped an agreement to spend $3 billion to buy WeWork stock from former Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann and other shareholders, despite threats of legal action from some members of the company’s board.SoftBank had agreed to buy the shares from Neumann, Benchmark Capital and others as part of a bailout package last year, but notified stockholders in mid-March that conditions for the deal hadn’t been met. On Thursday, after the deal’s deadline passed, SoftBank confirmed it would end the offer, citing five conditions that were not satisfied by the closing date.“SoftBank remains fully committed to the success of WeWork and has taken significant steps to strengthen the company since October, including newly committed capital, the development of a new strategic plan for WeWork and the hiring of a new, world-class management team,” said Rob Townsend, chief legal officer at the company. “The tender offer was an offer to buy shares directly from other major stockholders and its termination has no impact on WeWork’s operations or customers.”SoftBank shares rose 2.5% while the broader Japan market fell.A WeWork committee of two independent directors voiced disagreement over SoftBank’s decision and suggested there may be legal action.“The Special Committee is surprised and disappointed at this development, and remains committed to reaching a resolution that is in the best interest of WeWork and its minority shareholders, including WeWork’s employees and former employees. The Special Committee will evaluate all of its legal options, including litigation,” the committee, made up of Benchmark’s Bruce Dunlevie and another director, Lew Frankfort, said in an emailed statement.The share purchase was hammered out in October as part of SoftBank’s rescue of WeWork, after the co-working company’s failed initial public offering left it weeks away from running out of money. In the deal, the Japanese conglomerate would have taken a stake of almost 80% in the company and buy $3 billion in shares from investors as well as current and former employees. Neumann, ousted in the deal, was set to sell up to $970 million in shares. The generous exit package angered many of his employees, thousands of whom had their jobs eliminated in the following months as WeWork parent We Co. tried to cut its expenses.WeWork signs long-term leases with landlords around the world and then rents that space to smaller companies and freelance workers, a business that has been particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus and economic slowdown. In a letter to bondholders, the company warned it didn’t expect to hit its financial targets for 2020.“Given our fiduciary duty to our shareholders, it would be irresponsible of SoftBank to ignore the fact that the conditions were not satisfied and to nevertheless consummate the tender offer,” Townsend said.In the past few weeks, the shareholder buyout deal has become increasingly contentious. SoftBank sent the letter to WeWork investors saying it could withdraw from the agreement if certain conditions weren’t met by the deadline. SoftBank cited regulatory concerns and a handful of government investigations into WeWork, including from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.The two WeWork independent board directors responded, saying they would consider legal action if SoftBank pulled out. “Its excuses for not trying to close are inappropriate and dishonest,” a spokeswoman for the directors had said in a statement.The latest deal is separate from SoftBank’s bailout of WeWork itself, a package that included $5 billion in new financing and the acceleration of an earlier $1.5 billion commitment. Most of the money would have gone to five shareholders, including Neumann and the venture capital firm Benchmark, which was looking to sell $600 million in shares, Bloomberg has reported. Less than 10% of the proceeds would have gone to current WeWork employees, SoftBank has said.Still, the transaction has repercussions for WeWork. As part of the deal, the company would have gotten $1.1 billion in debt financing from SoftBank if the share purchase was completed. The Japanese company has decided it is not legally obligated to provide that capital, although it may yet do so, according to a person familiar with the matter.SoftBank and its affiliates have committed more than $14.25 billion to WeWork to date, including $5.45 billion since October, the company said in its statement. WeWork had $4.4 billion in pro forma cash and cash commitments at the end of 2019, SoftBank said.Separately, SoftBank said it completed the sale of its U.S. unit Sprint Corp. to T-Mobile US Inc. The deal removes about $40 billion in net debt from the Japanese conglomerate’s balance sheet.(Updates with details on financing in 13th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Abandons $3 Billion Deal With WeWork Investors

2020-04-02,"Following a two-year struggle, Sprint and T-Mobile (TMUS) have finally completed their merger to create a new super-sized T-Mobile.The announcement described the new company as “a supercharged Un-carrier that will deliver a transformative 5G network.” Indeed, the new company will have 14 times more capacity in the next six years than T-Mobile alone has today, which according to the statement should allow the company to “leapfrog the competition.”What’s more, the new T-Mobile aims to offer customers access to average 5G speeds up to eight times faster than current LTE in just a few years and 15 times faster over the next six years.Within six years, the New T-Mobile plans to provide 5G to 99% of the U.S. population and average 5G speeds in excess of 100 Mbps to 90% of the U.S. population.“New T-Mobile’s wireless in-home broadband service will overcome the obstacles to extending traditional wireline access by blanketing high-capacity coverage over previously difficult to serve areas. Its network will deliver 100+ Mbps speeds for wireless broadband to 90% of the population and offer in-home service to millions of the country’s households in the next six years” explains the announcement.T-Mobile US, Inc. is the parent of the combined company and its shares will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TMUS”. The stock has a bullish Strong Buy analyst consensus on TipRanks, with an average analyst price target of $102 (20% upside potential). (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks)The company also announced that with close of the merger, the CEO role has transitioned from John Legere to Mike Sievert ahead of schedule. Sievert, who has served as CEO of T-Mobile since 2012, commented “During this extraordinary time, it has become abundantly clear how vital a strong and reliable network is to the world we live in. The New T-Mobile’s commitment to delivering a transformative broad and deep nationwide 5G network is more important and more needed than ever.”Under the terms of the transaction, Sprint shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of approximately 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share.Related News:  Xerox Pulls Out of $35 Billion Hostile Bid For HP  Tower Semiconductor Bucks Downhill Trend By Reaffirming Q1 Guidance and Growth Rate  Judge’s Record Looks Unpromising for Amarin’s Appeal; Analyst Remains Bullish More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Covid-19: Could Bellerphon Therapeutics’ INOpulse Help Address Hospital Ventilator Shortage?   * From Cancer to COVID-19, Aim ImmunoTech’s Ampligen Shows Promise   * 3 High-Powered Dividends Stocks With Over 7% Dividend Yield   * Inovio Advances COVID-19 Vaccine to Phase 1 Testing; Analyst Reiterates 'Buy'","Sprint, T-Mobile Finally Complete Merger"
2020-04-02,"(Bloomberg) -- After closing an industry-altering U.S. wireless deal, Deutsche Telekom AG’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges now wants to change telecommunication markets closer to home. Europe’s phone industry needs mergers if it wants to build the kind of superior infrastructure needed to compete with bigger rivals in Asia and the U.S., Hoettges said Wednesday. He indicated he’s willing to get the German carrier involved in M&A to achieve that goal. “Europe is too fragmented,” Hoettges said in a phone interview. “Wherever I see a deal or an opportunity for European market consolidation that’s convincing, then I would always look at that with the partners.”Deutsche Telekom’s U.S. unit T-Mobile US Inc. on Wednesday completed its $26.5 billion acquisition of Sprint Corp. after a years-long saga that included a standoff with antitrust officials and a court battle with U.S. states. Hoettges pushed for the combination for years to give the company a stronger vehicle to expand in the profitable U.S. market. T-Mobile’s importance for Deutsche Telekom has grown steadily and it now accounts for about half of sales, up from around a third in 2014.“Our goal is to become the number-one in the U.S. market,” Hoettges said.T-Mobile and Sprint scrapped a previous plan to merge in 2014 after meeting resistance in Washington. Their second attempt failed in late 2017 when Hoettges and Masayoshi Son, the chairman of Sprint’s parent company SoftBank Group Corp., couldn’t agree on how to structure control of the combined entity, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Hoettges brought the merger back from the dead a few months later. On Jan. 1, 2018, he took out his phone and tapped out an SMS to Son, wishing him a happy New Year and expressing regret that the merger hadn’t happened. It reignited a conversation that culminated in Wednesday’s deal.It frees Hoettges to focus on markets in Europe, where more than 100 wireless carriers vie for airwaves and customers. Outside Deutsche Telekom’s business in Germany, where it competes with Vodafone Group Plc and Telefonica SA, Deutsche Telekom has units in countries from Poland to the Netherlands and Romania.“Of course I was very much focused on America,” Hoettges said. “But I will work with verve on changing the regulatory and antitrust-law framework” in Europe to help bring about the consolidation the region needs, he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Deutsche Telekom Ponders European M&A After $26.5 Billion Deal

2020-04-03,"There's no doubt that the market is getting brutalized with regularity these days.Much of it is the economic implications of the novel coronavirus and how the U.S. economy recovers from the lockdowns, market losses and credit issues. Some of it has to do with the end of a bull market without significant corrections.That had a lot to do with central banks managing the major economies around the world, which gave business a solid platform of support so companies could grow consistently, if not grandly.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA predictable market is what Wall Street likes, and it had it for a long time.But things have changed. Yes, the Federal Reserve and other central banks are stepping in with unprecedented measures, but managing a pandemic is hardly predictable.That why it pays to have solid, reliable stocks in your portfolio that will be there through it all -- and certainly after it all shakes out. The seven telecom stocks worth a look here are just those types of stocks. * 7 Dividend Stocks at Risk of Slashing Payouts All that telecommuting and streaming going on now -- many of these telecom stocks benefit from that and from massive future growth opportunities in the industry. And all are A or B rated by my Portfolio Grader. Telecom Stocks to Buy: T-Mobile (TMUS)Source: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is working hard to become the No. 3 mobile carrier in the U.S. And now that its merger with former rival Sprint (NYSE:S) has received all the necessary approvals, that goal is much closer.It has taken a long time for this merger to work out. But its $75 billion market capitalization makes it a significant player in the U.S. telecom market now.Having been the underdog for so long, and being led by the unconventional John Legere -- who stepped down as CEO on April 1, a date likely consciously chosen for its irony -- it has already proven that corporate titans in telecom have a challenge on their hands.TMUS stock doesn't pay a dividend, but the stock is up 25% in the past 12 months. It's up 11.2% in the past 3 months, which shows this is where a lot of money is moving in the down market. Cogent Communications (CCOI)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Cogent Communications (NASDAQ:CCOI) is a Tier 1 internet service provider (ISP) that is one of the top 5 networks in the world. Basically, it provides internet access to companies from large to small as well as carriers, service providers and other businesses that need internet access.It was built on the concept of treating bandwidth like a commodity, so it bills its customers by usage, rather than a set fee structure. And it operates outside of the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs) -- like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) -- so it doesn't depend on negotiating contracts with rivals for accessing bandwidth.That also allows it significant flexibility in building out its offerings. And given the fact that much of the world is on lockdown right now, that means all those telecommuting office workers and all those streaming services are filling CCOI's pockets.Because it's a very focused company, it's not huge -- it has a $3.8 billion market cap -- but it does have 54 internet data centers around the world, and provides service to more than 205 major markets and more than 6,950 other networks. * 7 Strong Stocks to Buy to Survive the Coronavirus Crisis The stock is up 51% in the past year and nearly 24% in the past 3 months. And, when it comes to future prospects, the growth story here is much larger than any one stock. Telecom Stocks to Buy: BCE (BCE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com BCE (NYSE:BCE) is the Canada version of the Bell companies in the U.S. As a matter of fact, it was launched in Canada in 1880 as the Canadian spinoff of the old Ma Bell.But over the years it has developed its own identity in the Great White North. And it is a dominant player in the Canadian telecom sector. It offers the same broad list of services offered by its U.S. Bell brethren and should see a growth in usage during these Covid-19 times.But it's rock solid and has a firm foothold on its business.While the stock is off 13% in the past 12 months, most of that has happened in the past 3 months. And at this point, it delivers a very attractive 6.3% dividend. Iridium Communications (IRDM)Source: Shutterstock Next on my list of telecom stocks is Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM). It has a product you have likely seen in any number of military or spy movies when the protagonist is out in the middle of nowhere and grabs a phone to call in a strike and request support.It makes those satellite phones that work anywhere -- like the top of Mount Everest, the jungles of the Amazon or the middle of the Gobi Desert or Indian Ocean.The company did not have an auspicious start in 1998, at the height of the dot-com bubble. It declared bankruptcy by 1999. Its grand idea of having 77 satellites circling the Earth, connecting people everywhere was bold -- and expensive. And the money dried up.But it was revived after the crash, and now launching satellites is much cheaper and easier. And it has created a large network of 66 satellites that circle the globe, connecting ocean-going vessels, aviators and far-flung land-based people with reliable communications to anywhere -- and from anywhere -- in the world.The company has a reliable market, but its goal is to bring on consumers at some point. But that takes lots of money, especially to make it available for reasonable rates. This market is tough for that, but the stock is off just 22% in the past 12 months, all of that in the last month.Since it has no dividend, this is a growth stock play. I do, however, have a growth and income opportunity available for you in my investment report, The Netflix of 5G. AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock AT&T (NYSE:T) is the original Ma Bell -- the telephone company of America. It's also one of the key telecom stocks in the U.S. And that means it's big. If anything is happening in telecom that's worth being involved in, T is there.And it can afford to do that because it has a market cap of more than $200 billion. While it used to be the home to one of the most innovative research and development organizations in the world -- Bell Labs -- it now has a different approach.When the new, disruptive technologies hit, T waits to see the best of the new companies and then buys them. That was the strategy with mobile, which was a game changer for T stock.And now it's in the content business with its acquisition of TimeWarner.The fact is, it's hard to imagine the U.S. without T. But that certainly isn't the reason to own it. The reason for that is T knows how to run its business and do it profitably in good times and bad.And its content acquisition means it can also diversify its revenue stream. And as I said before, there's a lot of content streaming going on. Also, T is very involved in rolling out 5G, which will also be a huge opportunity.The stock is off 11% for the year and 27% in the past 3 months. However, it's well valued here and is delivering a solid 7.1% dividend to pay for your patience. Vonage (VG)Source: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.com Vonage (NASDAQ:VG) was one of the pioneers of voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) for consumers in the early 2000s. As mobile phones were still catching on, the new disruptive technology at the time was to use the internet to make phone calls.The problem was connectivity was challenging -- some places it was faster than others and service may be impossible in others. It was a gamble, but it paid off.Since then, VG has moved into business services as well. And operations have moved to the cloud for even more service options. Ultrafast 5G wireless may provide further opportunities for this and many, many other companies (and their investors).While the company only has a $1.6 billion market cap, it has a solid group of customers and remains a well-run business. Analysts are currently upgrading their ratings on the stock and it would also be a good buy for a larger telecom looking to expand its user base. * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem The stock is off 33% in the past 12 months and only 10% in the past 3 months. It's a tempting takeover here. Shenandoah Telecommunications (SHEN)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com The last of my telecom stocks to buy is Shenandoah Telecommunications (NASDAQ:SHEN). It has been around since 1902, serving the rural communities of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia.It remains a relatively small firm, with a $2.4 billion market cap. But its service area now includes two large colleges and all the telecom needs -- land based, broadband and mobile -- for the students and the expanding communities and businesses. It has also expanded broadband into West Virginia, Maryland and Kentucky. And it owns 225 mobile towers in its service area, which is another great source of revenue, especially as 5G becomes more broadly deployed.It will benefit from the Great Lockdowns that are now happening as well as population growth as people from the DC metropolitan area move out to exurbia and telecommute.The stock is up 5% in the past 12 months, and up 13% in the past 3 months, showing that it's a rock-solid stock when things get crazy. It has a 0.6% dividend.Once those lockdowns lift, of course, it'll be time to look at the big picture. And for telecom stocks -- and many, many related names -- the big picture is the 5G revolution. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is a favorite on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it a &quot;Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my new stock report, The Netflix of 5G, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great investment.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-04-06,"Last month, the S&P 500 hit bottom at 2,192 and has staged a mild rally since. The index closed out last week at 2,488. These numbers are important – if they hold, they’ll give traders a degree of confidence that the worst is past, at least in the stock market.JPMorgan strategist Jason Hunter is making the case for just that: &quot;The number of states with above 20% COVID-19 confirmed daily case growth already saw a sharp drop from 40 to below 10 into early April. We are interested to see if that deceleration continues and starts to impact the number of states with growth rates above 10%. Based on the recent correlation, case growth deceleration in that group can help put further downward pressure on implied equity volatility and blunt the nature of a retest of the March equity price low.”Hunter sees 2,100 serving as a floor to the S&P 500 moving forward in April, with a ceiling in the range of 2,750 to 2,850. The strategist expects the index to level out at or near its current level, as volatility dampens in response to slowdown in the spread of coronavirus. In New York and New Jersey, the hardest-hit states in the US, Sunday saw the first declines in the daily report of COVID-19 deaths. Hunter sees it as hopeful, saying, “As NYC marked one of the earlier major outbreaks in the U.S., we suspect further growth rate deceleration over the next week or so could help improve market sentiment.”There’s hope that improving sentiment may mark the beginning a virtuous cycle, and perhaps the turn of the tide for the markets. In the meantime, JPMorgan stock analysts are scrutinizing the market, looking the for the right stocks to get that kickstarted.We’ve pulled up three of the investment bank's recent calls, and run them through the TipRanks database. It turns out that two of the firm’s bullish picks have received significant support from other members of the Street. That being said, one name stands out as being an investment to avoid, falling out of favor with JPMorgan as well as the broader analyst community. Let’s take a closer look.Cabot Corporation (CBT)We’ll start in the chemical industry, where Cabot provides a wide variety of products, including carbon and carbon compounds, ink colorants, rare elements such as tantalum, niobium, ad germanium, and a range of specialty fluids. The company’s products have applications in adhesives, air, water, and chemical purification, construction, coatings, light industry, oil drilling – and even in the food and beverage niche.Cabot reported its fiscal Q1 earnings early in February, for the period ending in December, and the results were disappointing. Revenues were down 11% year-over-year, to $727 million, while the 69 cents EPS missed the forecast by 9% and was down 20% year-over-year. It was not a good footing for the company as the coronavirus epidemic was ramping up.Nevertheless, there were some high points. The company’s cash flow exceeded capex by $37 million, and Cabot ended the quarter with $173 million in cash on hand – a 22% increase from year before. Looking forward, management is guiding toward full year earnings of $3.60 to $3.90 per share, in line with previous estimates.The solid cash position underlies the company’s dividend, which Cabot has been paying out reliably for the last 19 years. The current quarterly payment, after three increases in the past three years, is 35 cents, and the annualized payment of $1.40 gives a yield of 5.4%. The average yield among peer companies in the consumer goods sector is 2.5%, making Cabot’s more than double. The payout ratio, at 50%, shows both a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders, and plenty of room for additional increases.Reviewing Cabot for JPMorgan, analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas saw fit to upgrade the stock from Neutral to Buy. He wrote, “The likely strength of Cabot’s cash flows gives us confidence that Cabot will pay its dividend, which now represents a 5.4% yield in a longer-term interest rate environment close to 1%... We believe that Cabot is likely to return to its 2019 level of value and earnings over a three year period (by F2022), and so we think that the returns to the equity holder will approach a doubling of value over that period.”Zekauskas also raised his price target by 19%, to $31, indicating his confidence in a 19% upside for the stock. (To watch Zekauskas’ track record, click here)Over the past 3 months, four other analysts have thrown the hat in with a view on the chemicals and materials maker. The three additional Buy ratings provide Cabot with a Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $35.25, investors stand to take home an 36% gain, should the target be met over the next 12 months. (See Cabotvstock analysis on TipRanks)T-Mobile US (TMUS)It’s been a memorable spring for T-Mobile, for more than just the obvious reasons. The company on April 1 completed its long merger process with Sprint, making Sprint a wholly owned subsidiary company. The companies were the third and fourth largest wireless carriers in the US market, and together boasted 140 million subscribers at the end of 2019, along with a combined $77.5 billion in top-line revenue. The merger process has taken two years to complete.T-Mobile started the merger process in 2018, with an eye ahead toward 5G. The company sought to increase its customer base, infrastructure, and available capital resources for the rollout of the new networks. That rollout got started this past December, before the merger was complete, when T-Mobile launched 5G digital in over 5,000 cities and towns, covering some 200 million people.The good news for TMUS did not end there. The company saw positive results in the fourth quarter, reporting 87 cents EPS and $11.9 billion in top-line quarterly revenue. The EPS was 4.8% above the estimates, and up 16% year-over-year. The revenue number also beat the forecast, and gained 3.4% yoy.5-star JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick looks at the implications of the completed Sprint merger for TMUS, and writes, “We believe that T-Mobile will continue to offer a solid product for a lower price than peers AT&T and Verizon, and that the combined company’s network in a few years will be closer to parity with larger peers than it is today, offering more relative value to customers over time.”&quot;Trading at 7.3x 2021E core EBITDA (or 6.0x including full EBITDA synergies) vs 6.6x Verizon and 6.3x AT&T we see T-Mobile as attractive,&quot; Cusick concluded.Cusick is impressed enough by the possibilities to initiate coverage of the stock with a Buy rating. His $110 price target suggests an impressive 34% upside potential. (To watch Cusick’s track record, click here.)T-Mobile’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 11 Buys that overbalance the single Hold. Shares are selling for $81.98, and the average price target of $103.36 implies a 26% premium. (See T-Mobile’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)Tesla has had its ups and downs, and Elon Musk’s genius for generating headlines has made sure that everyone knows about it. In recent weeks, the company has met the COVID-19 crisis with a ventilator prototype made from electric car parts, which is good, and not just as a possible aid in meeting a serious public health need.The electric car giant is facing an automotive production shortfall, as its Shanghai Gigafactory, part of Tesla’s battery supply chain, is unlikely to meet the supply needs of the company’s US, UK, and Australian operations. And in the US, Tesla has been forced to shut down production at its Fremont, California plant since March 23. The shutdown comes just as the company was intending to scale up Model Y SUV production to meet increased demand.Production shortfalls are meeting increased demand, as Tesla earlier this month boasted high electric vehicle sales in Q1. The company reported over 88,000 vehicle deliveries in the quarter, with 76,200 of those being the lower-priced Model Y and Model 3. Quarterly production reached over 102,000 units, and marked the company’s best ever Q1 performance. This was, simply put, a bad time for the COVID-19 epidemic to hit the production lines.Investors have taken notice. TSLA shares are down 47% in the current market slump, a severe underperformance compared to the broader markets.JPMorgan’s 5-star analyst Ryan Brinkman believes &quot;2Q will prove much more challenging (we forecast deliveries -36% q/q to just 57,000), including of course because of COVID-19 but possibly also as a result of the stronger than expected 1Q figures which may have left [production] channels full.”As a result, Brinkman maintains his Sell rating on TSLA shares, with a price target that, at $240, suggests a 50% downside in the coming year. (To watch Brinkman’s track record, click here)Wall Street agrees that Tesla is a risky play. The stock gets a Hold from the analyst consensus, based on a mix of reviews including 4 Buys, 14 Holds, and 10 Sells. The stock is not cheap, and even now sells for $480, while the $505 average price target implies a modest upside of 5.24%.

2020-04-14,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. forecast a record 1.35 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) operating loss for the fiscal year ended in March, a sign of how badly Masayoshi Son’s bets on technology startups have been battered in recent months.The Japanese company expects to record a 1.8 trillion yen loss from its Vision Fund and another 800 billion yen in losses from SoftBank’s own investments. It has written down the value of investments in companies, including office-rental startup WeWork and satellite operator OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy last month. SoftBank’s shares fell as much as 4.2% to 4,025 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.Son’s conglomerate has taken one blow after another since the implosion of WeWork’s initial public offering last year and SoftBank’s subsequent bailout. It bet heavily on sharing-economy startups, which allow people to split the use of offices or cars, but those investments have been particularly hard hit as the coronavirus pandemic curbs unnecessary human interaction.“This is looking more and more like the perfect storm for SoftBank,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian Research at United First Partners. “The question is whether there is more to come.”The Vision Fund probably wrote down about 1 trillion yen in assets in the March quarter, based on its earlier earnings reports. SoftBank didn’t detail all the startups that took hits.Investors have become increasingly spooked about the stability of Son’s empire and its $100 billion Vision Fund amid the virus outbreak. Shares tumbled at one point more than 50% from their peak this year, and SoftBank’s credit default swaps -- the cost of insuring debt against default -- spiked to their highest levels in about decade.Son has also drawn unusual pressure from some investors. The U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp. took a substantial stake in the company, advocating for changes in governance and investing practices.The billionaire responded with a strategy to part with some of his precious holdings, unloading about $41 billion in assets to buy back shares and pay off debts. SoftBank plans to sell about $14 billion of shares in Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as part of an effort, Bloomberg News has reported.“This will only make asset sales even more urgent for SoftBank,” said Koji Hirai, the head of M&A at advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo.It’s a dramatic turnaround for the 62-year-old Son. Just two months ago, he declared on stage in Tokyo that SoftBank’s fortunes were turning around after the WeWork meltdown.“After a difficult winter always comes spring,” Son said at the time.He highlighted a big surge in the shares of Uber Technologies Inc., one of SoftBank’s bigger holdings, explaining that his company would likely be able to book a profit on the stake. He also declared WeWork poised for a comeback.But the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on those plans. With fear of contagion, people stopped sharing offices from Beijing to New York. Ride-hailing companies -- SoftBank has stakes in four of the biggest worldwide -- saw business evaporate. Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive officer of Uber, publicly declared “I wouldn’t put my kids in an Uber.”Another sign of the troubles is Oyo, a hotel-booking service into which SoftBank invested about $1.5 billion. Its business model has been slammed as global travel screeched to a halt. This month, Ritesh Agarwal, founder and chief executive officer, said the company would furlough employees in countries outside India as it struggles to survive the virus.Complicating the situation is that Agarwal, 26, borrowed about $2 billion to buy more shares in his own company. Son personally guaranteed the loans, Bloomberg News has reported.SoftBank’s controversial accounting practices have aggravated the volatility of its earnings. The Vision Fund booked profits on startups as their valuations rose, even if the gains were only on paper and no shares were sold. WeWork and Oyo both contributed to profits early on in the fund’s lifetime.Now the Vision Fund, which Son has declared is the future of his company, is piling up losses as valuations are written down again. The fund has lost a cumulative 240 billion yen since SoftBank began breaking out its results, including the most recent quarter forecast, according to Bloomberg calculations.SoftBank’s operating loss for the current fiscal year is the most ever for the company, which Son took public in 1994. Its projected net loss of 750 billion yen would also be a record and compares with a 1.41 trillion yen profit the year earlier.Sales for the fiscal year are expected to fall about 36% to 6.15 trillion yen after SoftBank removed U.S. unit Sprint Corp. from its balance sheet to account for its merger with T-Mobile US Inc.“The coronavirus was the final blow, but bad investments and misjudgments were the start,” said Hirai of Kachitas.(Updates with share reaction in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Forecasts Record Losses as Startup Bets Backfire

2020-04-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Verizon Wireless Inc. will sell and distribute OnePlus’s flagship smartphone model in hundreds of stores across the U.S. for the first time, a big boost for a Chinese company with a cult international following.The deal to market the $699 OnePlus 8 is a significant win for the mobile device maker at a time Chinese smartphone names such as Huawei come under scrutiny. Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. account for well over two-thirds of the U.S. phone market, and now that Android manufacturers like LG Electronics Inc. and Sony Corp. are receding from the top tier, carriers need competition to avoid an over-reliance on iPhones and Galaxy devices.From its outset in 2014, OnePlus has fashioned itself as a niche player with global ambitions. Like fellow Chinese brands Oppo and Vivo, it’s affiliated with BBK Electronics Corp., but neither has made as much progress with U.S. audiences as OnePlus.The Verizon tie-up builds on OnePlus’s partnership with T-Mobile US Inc. from last year and is the closest any Chinese manufacturer has yet come to accessing the country’s premium phone market.

2020-04-17,Verizon Communications Inc. might have a big advantage in 5G marketing after all at least in the near term.,"‘The stars are aligning’ for Verizon to be a big 5G winner this fall, analyst says"
2020-04-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When T-Mobile US Inc. was trying to buy Sprint Corp., Colorado billionaire Charlie Ergen became the deal’s saving grace. Ergen had big plans to build a 5G wireless business, and U.S. antitrust authorities looked to that as the competitive antidote to allowing the industry’s two biggest discount carriers to merge. Sprint would be gone, but Ergen’s de novo network would take its spot. It was a regulatory rubber stamp for the ages.Next, Ergen would just need $10 billion and a willing partner. No one figured a pandemic would shut down the economy and roil financial markets.Pandemic or not, the U.S. Justice Department’s thinking at the time and the remedy it devised for the Sprint deal — which was also backed by the Federal Communications Commission — had flaws that were bound to come to light. Perhaps no one expected that to happen so soon, though: T-Mobile’s takeover of Sprint won final approval in February, defeating a group of states that sued to block it, and the deal was completed on April 1. Barely three weeks later, with the country in a recession amid an unforeseen public-health crisis, Ergen’s already ambitious plan is looking like an even bigger stretch. If that plan gets waylaid, T-Mobile’s market power and that of its only two remaining national competitors — Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. — would be left unchecked, creating more of an opportunity for the industry to raise prices after this pandemic. The company at the center of all this is Dish Network Corp., Ergen’s satellite-TV service that he’s trying to morph into a 5G wireless company using valuable spectrum licenses he’s collected over the years. Yields on Dish’s debt spiked in March, and they’re still at the highest level in seven months. Assuming Ergen needs only $10 billion to build his network, “the interest costs alone would consume 60% of Dish’s pre-recession free cash flow forecast,” Craig Moffett, an analyst for MoffettNathanson LLC, wrote in an April 14 report. (Moffett estimates $10 billion won’t be enough.)There had been speculation that Amazon.com Inc. and Google might want to team up with Ergen. But now, it’s not only costlier for Dish to raise money to build the network, it may be that much riskier for other companies to get involved. Dish gets to rent access to T-Mobile’s network for the next seven years, so any partners would need to be confident that Dish could have its own network ready by that point. It doesn’t need the $10 billion all at once, but it will have to offer 5G service to 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023 or face a hefty fine. Its stock price is signaling doubt:Dish has $3 billion of cash and equivalents and $1.1 billion of bonds coming due in May. It had planned to spend as much as $500 million this year on its wireless initiatives. It’s also expected to close soon on a $1.4 billion acquisition of Boost Mobile, a prepaid wireless brand that Sprint was forced to divest as a condition of the T-Mobile deal. Boost serves mainly lower-income consumers in urban areas, making it particularly vulnerable during the economic downturn.It’s baffling that the Justice Department and the FCC would give their blessing to the Sprint deal and leave consumer protections riding on an industry newbie. Even so, Ergen, 67, has made a career of waving off skeptics. As a former professional poker player, he holds his cards close, leaving others in and around the industry constantly wondering whether he knows something advantageous that they don’t, or if he’s bluffing — or simply brash. That mystery is partly why a shrinking satellite-TV business hoarding unused spectrum is still valued north of $11 billion.Some way, somehow, Ergen may still get his network. But maybe the government’s idea to trade one wireless carrier for another was as hare-brained as it sounds.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-05-01,"Since reporting its earnings last week, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) stock has not done much. But then again, there was already a nice rally ahead of the announcement. Note that the shares went from $6.17 in mid-March to $8.35.Source: Shutterstock For the first quarter, Ericsson's revenues increased by 2% to $4.93 billion. While there was considerable weakness in the digital services business, there was strength in other segments like for networks. Given that the contracts tend to be large, there are often timing issues. And yes, with the novel coronavirus pandemic, there has been some more delays with deals.But despite this, I think the long-term does look bright for Ericsson, especially with the megatrend of 5G rollouts. The fact is that the company is positioned nicely, in terms of its global infrastructure, IP (Intellectual Property) portfolio and end-to-end technologies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Issues Looming Over Disney Stock Ahead of Earnings So let's take a deeper look at why Ericsson stock is a good play right now: CoronavirusEricsson acted swiftly to make its workforce remote. This was no easy feat as the company has about 85,000 employees. But Ericsson has set up a Crisis Management Council and has also been able to put in processes to maintain the performance of its networks. Another benefit has been that the company has a diversified sourcing infrastructure and various production sites across the worldWhile the coronavirus will weigh on growth, it is likely to be temporary. Keep in mind that the company has reiterated its financial targets for 2020 to 2022. In fact, in the second half of this year, there is likely be an increase in momentum because of the merger between T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint. This should lead to more spending on rollouts.Ericsson also continues to report strong margins. In the latest quarter, the gross margin rose from 43.2% to 44.4%. As a result, the company continues to generate strong cash flows.Note that there is $3.81 billion in the bank. In other words, there appears to be enough liquidity for dividends, buybacks of Ericsson stock, R&D investments and acquisitions. StrategyEven though Borje Ekholm has been CEO only for a couple years, he has wasted little time in putting in place a solid strategy. He has not only been disciplined with costs but also wise in nixing low-margin contracts.But Ekholm has been effective in focusing on the right technologies to capitalize on the 5G opportunities. For example, the Digital Services segment has benefited from software sales and cloud platforms, which have provided higher margins. And as for the Managed Services unit, there have been nice gains from AI and automation systems. 5G Opportunity for Ericsson StockThe 5G market is intensely competitive, with many large operators like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Huawei. Yet Ericsson has been able to fare pretty well, especially when it comes to winning business. For the first quarter, the company announced 86 commercial 5G contracts and completed 29 live networksWhat's more, the 5G opportunity is enormous for Ericsson stock. According ResearchAndMarkets.com, the spending is forecasted to go from $12.6 billion in 2020 to $44.9 billion by 2025, for a compound annual growth rate of nearly 29% (consider that this accounts for the estimated negative impact from the Covid-19 virus). Just some of the drivers for the growth include the adoption of IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices, the rise in automation and the continued growth in data traffic.In the Ericsson annual report, Ekholm writes: &quot;But 5G is much more than enhanced mobility for consumers. This is an innovation platform so powerful that it will be the driving force behind the next big shift in society - the fourth industrial revolution. By 2025, we expect the number of cellular IoT connections to reach 5 billion. This shift will impact all sectors, potentially increasing the addressable opportunity for telecom operators by up to 30% by 2030.&quot;Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

2020-05-08,"The 5G revolution is coming, and that means it's time to look for the best 5G stocks to buy to play this revolution.First, let's take a step back. What exactly is 5G?5G is simply the 5th Generation (hence 5G) mobile network. It naturally follows 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G, and represents the new global wireless standard for internet connectivity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd what will 5G do?It will usher in a new era of unprecedented internet communications. Relative to 4G, 5G is way faster, with way more network capacity, far lower latency, way more capability, and better spectrum technology. That may sound like a mouthful. If so, just think this: 5G is new wireless technology that will make every internet-connected device faster, allow more devices to be connected to the internet at the same time, and allow all those devices to do more advanced things.And why is 5G is a big deal?Because, as a world, we've essentially ""maxed out"" 4G technology. We are at full capacity when it comes to how fast our phones can go, how many devices we can connect to the internet, and how many things those devices can do. As such, things like autonomous driving, the Internet-of-Things, and advanced cloud computing cannot reach their full potential until 5G is everywhere.Accordingly, the widespread deployment of 5G technology over the next few years will have huge economic implications. The coming 5G revolution is expected to equate to $13.2 trillion dollars of global economic output by 2035. That is essentially an entire China's worth of economic output.  * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months Now that you understand that the 5G revolution will lead to some huge investment opportunities over the next few years, let's take a deeper look at the best 5G stocks to buy right now: Verizon (VZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Perhaps the most obvious of 5G stocks to buy is Verizon, since this is the U.S. wireless provider which will actually deploy 5G technology to end-market and end-devices.Why pick Verizon over AT&T (NYSE:T) or T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)? A few reasons.First, Verizon has forever been the unchallenged leader in this market, offering the highest quality wireless 3G and 4G coverage. It reasons that the company is best positioned to extend that leadership with best-in-market 5G coverage.Second, T-Mobile has complicated itself with the acquisition of Sprint. While this acquisition has long-term benefits, it also has near-term complications, which may prevent the company from fully capitalizing on its 5G opportunity.Third, AT&T is burdened by a ton of debt. All of this debt could provide operational and investment challenges over the next few quarters.Among U.S. wireless providers, Verizon is the best way to play the 5G boom. MACOM Technologies (MTSI)Source: Shutterstock A small-cap 5G stock to buy for potentially explosive returns is MACOM Technologies. Investors should look at MACOM as an ""infrastructure play"" on the 5G boom.In order for 5G to work effectively, wireless network infrastructure has to change to support 5G tech. This include rejigging base stations with something called ""Massive MIMO,"" or massive multiple-in, multiple-out architecture. The science here is fairly complex, but in a nutshell, Massive MIMO involves putting a bunch of extra, 5G-enabled RF antennas on each base station to enable better wireless performance without maxing out individual antenna power (faster speeds with more network density).Who makes the brand-new 5G RF technology which enables these base station infrastructure upgrades? MACOM Technologies.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now The small, $1.9 billion developer of RF, microwave, and millimeter wave semiconductor devices and components should see demand for its 5G product portfolio soar over the next few years. As that happens, MACOM's revenues, profits, and stock price could all roar higher. Apple (AAPL)Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com Back in the large-cap world, another way to play 5G stocks is through buying Apple.Apple is the world's largest and arguably most important smartphone, smartwatch, and tablet maker. 5G coverage will result in breakthrough smart device improvements.But, because 5G is a new technology, it doesn't work with old smart devices. It only fully works with new, 5G-enabled smart devices. Thus, the 5G boom will spark an enormous hardware smart device upgrade cycle to 5G-enabled smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets.From this perspective, Apple should sell a lot of 5G-capable iPhones, Apple Watches, and iPads over the next few years, starting with its big 5G iPhone launch in late 2020.Amid this surge in hardware sales, Apple's software business will boom, too, because smart device software services (like mobile video games, or streaming services) will rapidly improve with better connectivity, resulting in consumers spending more money on those services.Big picture: Apple's hardware and software businesses will both grow significantly over the next few years. Amid this big growth, AAPL stock will climb higher. Boingo (WIFI)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Next to MACOM, another small-cap stock of the 5G stocks to buy for potentially explosive returns in the early 2020s is Boingo.Investors should look at Boingo as a company which could help 5G solve its biggest problem: that it doesn't work well indoors.America's biggest wireless service providers - Verizon and AT&T - have built their 5G networks using millimeter wave spectrum. Testing has shown that millimeter waves enable lightening quick over-the-air transmissions. But, for all their speed, millimeter waves have really poor propagation techniques, i.e. 5G millimeter waves can't penetrate buildings.That's a big deal. Americans spend 90% of their day inside, and where 5G coverage is needed to work most - in offices and in homes - it currently doesn't work all that well.Insert Boingo. As one of the largest providers of indoor wireless networks in the world, Boingo is expert at using things like distributed antenna systems to optimize indoor wireless reception. Over the next few years, the company will leverage this expertise to help wireless service providers solve the indoor 5G problem.Indeed, this is already happening. In August of 2019, Verizon announced a partnership with Boingo to build hyper-dense 5G networks which will leverage Boingo's distributed antenna systems to amplify Verizon's 5G millimeter waves in Boingo's venues.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades More of these partnerships will roll in over the next few quarters. As they do, they will lay the groundwork for explosive revenue and profit growth over the next few years -- the likes of which will push WIFI stock materially higher. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.com Because chip giant Qualcomm is at the epicenter of all things smartphones, QCOM stock is one of the best 5G stocks to buy right now.The company makes the chips that power smartphones. They are the best in the world at doing that. Just ask Apple, who tried hard to fight against Qualcomm's smartphone chip business, but ultimately caved because they realized they couldn't do a 5G iPhone without them.Extrapolate that out.Over the next few years, every company out there is going to launch new 5G smartphones and devices. All of these new 5G smartphones and devices are going to need new 5G chips to power them. Qualcomm makes those chips. Demand for Qualcomm products will consequently soar over the next few years, which will push both revenues higher (they will sell more chips) and margins higher (they will sell these chips at more favorable price points).Big profit growth will follow. So will big gains in QCOM stock.In summation, here the key 5G stocks to consider for your portfolio:  * Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  * MACOM Technologies (NASDAQ:MTSI)  * Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  * Boingo (NASDAQ:WIFI)  * Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-05-18,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. said its Vision Fund business lost 1.9 trillion yen ($17.7 billion) last fiscal year after writing down the value of investments, including WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.The company posted an overall operating loss of 1.36 trillion yen in the 12 months ended March and a net loss of 961.6 billion yen, according to a statement on Monday. The Tokyo-based conglomerate released figures in two preliminary earnings statements last month. The losses are the worst ever in the company’s 39-year history.SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son’s $100 billion Vision Fund went from the group’s main contributor to profit a year ago to its biggest drag on earnings. Uber’s disappointing public debut last May was followed by the implosion of WeWork in September and its subsequent rescue by SoftBank. Now Son is struggling with the impact of the coronavirus on the portfolio of startups weighted heavily toward the sharing economy.“The situation is exceedingly difficult,” Son said at a briefing discussing the results on Monday. “Our unicorns have fallen into this sudden coronavirus ravine. But some of them will use this crisis to grow wings.”The drop in Uber’s share price was responsible for about $5.2 billion of Vision Fund’s losses in the period, while WeWork contributed $4.6 billion and another $7.5 billion came from the rest of the portfolio, SoftBank said. The $75 billion the Vision Fund has spent to invest in 88 companies as of March 31 is now worth $69.6 billion.SoftBank also recorded losses from its own investments, including WeWork and satellite operator OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy in March.Last year, after WeWork’s effort to go public fell apart, SoftBank stepped in to organize a bailout and put its own chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, in charge of turning around the business. But the pandemic has hammered its operations as workers shy away from gathering in shared office spaces.WeWork’s valuation is now $2.9 billion, down more than 90% from its peak. SoftBank has invested more than $10 billion in the company.Son’s investments in hotel-booking service Oyo Hotels & Homes and Uber, among the biggest in his portfolio, have also fared poorly. Oyo, in which SoftBank invested about $1.5 billion, last month furloughed employees in countries outside its home market of India as it struggles to survive the virus. Uber’s shares are trading about 28% below its IPO price.As the concerns about investments mounted, Son responded with two share buybacks in rapid succession. The first 500 billion yen repurchase announced in mid-March initially failed to lift SoftBank’s stock. When the shares plunged more than 30% in the week that followed, Son unveiled a 2 trillion yen follow-up.SoftBank has already used roughly half of the first allotment. The company said on Friday that it had bought 250.6 billion yen of its own stock since March 13 under the original re-purchase plan.Before the earnings were announced on Monday, the company said it plans to spend up to 500 billion yen more to buy back shares through next March. The announcement is part of a broader plan to sell assets to raise as much as 4.5 trillion yen over the coming year to buy shares and slash debt. SoftBank is likely to raise the funds by selling its stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Japanese telecom unit SoftBank Corp. and the company that results from the merger of Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc.SoftBank said on Monday that it entered into several prepaid forward contracts with banks in April and May using Alibaba shares to procure a total of $11.5 billion. That includes a $1.5 billion forward contract with settlement in April 2024, a $1.5 billion floor contract with settlement in Dec. 2023 and Jan. 2024, and a $8.5 billion collar contract with settlement from Jan. to Sept. 2022.Separately, SoftBank said that Jack Ma, co-founder of Alibaba, will step down after 13 years as a director, part of several board changes subject to approval at the general shareholder meeting in June. Three new directors have been nominated. In addition to SoftBank Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, Lip-Bu Tan and Yuko Kawamoto will join, bringing the total of external board members to four. Kawamoto will be the first female director.Son’s increasingly risky bets over the past few years coincided with departures from SoftBank’s board of some of it most outspoken members. Shigenobu Nagamori, the founder of motor maker Nidec Corp., stepped down in 2017, while Fast Retailing Co. Chief Executive Officer Tadashi Yanai left last December. When Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. disclosed in February that is has built a stake of close to $3 billion in SoftBank, one of its requests was to increase the number of independent directors.“Activist investors might choose to stay in the background for now, given all the sensitivity around the Covid-19 impact. So these new independent director appointments and the buybacks are clearly a small win for Elliott,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners. “But once the Covid-19 fallout is behind us, I am certain they can and will push for more change.”(Updates with Son quote in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","SoftBank Vision Fund Posts $17.7 Billion Loss on WeWork, Uber"
2020-05-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- SoftBank Group Corp.’s flagship, $98.6 billion Vision Fund is almost tapped out. Its holdings of unicorn startups aren’t likely to deliver cash to investors anytime soon.Yet SoftBank needs liquidity, and there’s talk that the Saudi government’s Public Investment Fund may be looking to monetize its stake through a margin loan. (The PIF denied a Bloomberg News report that it has such plans). An answer to both problems would be to list shares in the Vision Fund itself, a topic that has been given scant regard as people focus on the underlying investments.Hear me out, though.The fund’s two biggest holdings right now are Chinese content-platform Bytedance Inc. and ride-hailing leader Didi Chuxing. There’s slim chance that either will have an initial public offering this year, and probably not in the U.S., where the mood toward Chinese companies has soured after the Luckin Coffee Inc. scandal. Too bad for them: All the dollars printed by Washington to tackle the Covid-19 economic crisis might mean there’s plenty of money sitting around waiting for a big new share sale. Of the 88 investments in the Vision Fund’s portfolio, 50 had a cut in valuation during the 12 months to March 31, and 19 were unchanged. SoftBank told investors Monday that its startups are facing varying degrees of impact from the pandemic, which means it’s probably not an opportune time to try to sell any individual company in public markets.But as a collective, the portfolio makes as good an asset as anything else SoftBank has on hand. It’s possible that SoftBank will be able to offload some of the T-Mobile US Inc. shares that replaced its stake in Sprint Corp. after the operators merged. According to the Wall Street Journal, T-Mobile’s parent, Deutsche Telekom AG, is considering a purchase. But there are various lockup clauses and share price incentives built into the deal that probably limit the size of any such transaction.I talked before about the need for SoftBank to sell down its $137 billion stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. after it said that it would monetize as much as $41 billion in assets. Let’s be clear: “Monetizing” doesn’t necessarily mean selling. SoftBank’s strategy has largely been to take out loans backed by its assets, some of which are non-recourse.(1)There’s also British semiconductor maker Arm, which we already know is slated for an eventual IPO. The current state of SoftBank’s finances make it likely this listing will be fast-tracked.But these holdings — T-Mobile, Alibaba, Arm(2) — are SoftBank assets. Selling them doesn’t necessarily solve the Vision Fund’s cash needs. And they don’t much help the fund’s sugar daddy, the Saudi government. As my colleague David Fickling wrote recently, the net financial assets held by Saudi Arabia’s government have declined to just 0.1% of gross domestic product, from 50% in the four years through 2018. Being one of the world’s biggest oil producers helps only so much when a global pandemic grounds aircraft, sends economies into decline, and results in sliding crude prices. Even if the PIF denies plans to take out loans against its Vision Fund stake, the kingdom’s rulers will be keen that it raise cash any way possible. The Vision Fund itself needs money. It’s on the hook for at least $3 billion in preferred equity dividend payments every year, as well as the cash it needs just to operate, and in theory to service debt it’s already taken out. It has already put some of the money raised aside to pay those dividends, but that won't last forever. With the book value of its assets dropping more than $17 billion in the past year, the fund’s ability to keep borrowing to cover those requirements will diminish.There are bound to be investors who believe in founder Masayoshi Son’s long-term plan to build a stable of companies that will change the world and provide  huge profits in the process. After all, many have already bought into SoftBank Group itself, which counts the Vision Fund as a key earnings driver (or drag).Given how illiquid the assets are, and the volatile nature of its earnings, a listing of the Vision Fund would certainly be seen as a bizarre move. But to Son and his acolytes, it may well be seen as visionary.(1) Non-recourse means that if the debt can't be paid, or other clauses are triggered, the creditor may take ownership of the pledged asset rather than forcing the debtor to pay up.(2) A portion of Arm shares are held by the Vision Fund, transferred from SoftBank as an in-kind payment to cover SB's obligations to the Fund.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

That’s on top of an equally sized repurchase it had announced in mid-March.The Tokyo-based company also announced several changes to its board, including the departure of Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Three new directors have been nominated, including Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto. SoftBank shares rose as much as 3%.SoftBank, led by founder Masayoshi Son, is buying back shares to bolster its stock price after its portfolio of startup investments lost value. The company expects to book a record 1.35 trillion yen operating loss for the year ended March 31 when it reports financial results Monday afternoon in Tokyo. After aggressively investing in startups in recent years, SoftBank is marking down the value of stakes in companies such as WeWork, Oyo Hotels and Uber Technologies Inc.“The buyback announcement is a surprise, given the slew of low expectations and bad news,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners.SoftBank plans to fund the buybacks in part through the sale of stakes in Alibaba and T-Mobile US Inc., Bloomberg News has reported.

The latest announcement is part of that broader plan.“Son is also sending a message that he is serious about funding that 2 trillion yen buyback he announced in March,” Tang said.The stock gained almost 70% since SoftBank said it plans to sell assets to raise as much as 4.5 trillion yen over the coming year to buy shares and slash debt.Read more: SoftBank Heads for Record Loss After $80 Billion Startup SpreeThe company’s Vision Fund business, focused on technology investments that contributed more than half of its reported profit a year ago, has swung to a projected 1.8 trillion yen loss.

2020-05-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Before the meltdown at WeWork and the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Masayoshi Son said he would like to raise a new Vision Fund every two to three years after his initial $100 billion fund. Now the first Vision Fund looks like it could be the last.SoftBank Group Corp. said Monday the Vision Fund lost $17.7 billion in the most recent fiscal year, triggering the worst loss ever in the Japanese company’s 39-year history. SoftBank had to write down the valuations of companies like WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. because of business missteps and the coronavirus fallout. Its return on the fund is negative 6%, compared with 62% just a year ago, he said.Son conceded he is unlikely to be able to draw outside investors for another Vision Fund, an initiative that he once proclaimed the future of SoftBank as it moved away from the telecom business. The Tokyo-based company will keep making startup investments with its own money, albeit more cautiously than in the past. About 15 of the fund’s startups will likely go bankrupt, he said, while another 15 are likely to thrive.“Vision Fund’s results are not something to be proud of,” Son said at an unusual press conference in Tokyo, with reporters and analysts calling in remotely because of the pandemic. “If the results are bad, you can’t raise money from investors. Things aren’t good, that’s why we are investing with our own money.”Son also announced Jack Ma, co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., will leave the SoftBank board after 13 years and that his company may not pay a dividend this year to preserve cash.The 62-year-old billionaire, dressed formally for the occasion in a dark suit, white-striped shirt and blue tie, was far more somber than in the previous earnings conference. In March, he declared the tide was turning for SoftBank after the setbacks at WeWork.On Monday, Son conceded he had not anticipated how the global economy would be affected by the fallout from Covid-19.“At that time many people could not see that the coronavirus pandemic would spread that far,” he said. His presentation was full of dark slides that highlighted comparisons between now and the Great Depression, when it took years for economic activity to recover. SoftBank wrote WeWork’s valuation down again, this time to $2.9 billion or more than 90% less than its peak.Son is racing to put his house in order to withstand the challenges. On Monday, SoftBank also detailed plans to shore up its balance sheet and its stock price, part of a plan to sell 4.5 trillion yen in assets.The company raised $11.5 billion from contracts to sell shares in Alibaba, its most valuable holding. SoftBank is likely to sell stock in its Japanese telecom unit SoftBank Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. SoftBank Group plans to seek buyers for shares of T-Mobile US worth about $20 billion, Dow Jones reported.The Japanese company also said on Monday it plans to spend up to 500 billion yen to buy back shares through next March, on top of an existing repurchase plan of the same size. That has helped SoftBank shares stabilize, rising more than 75% from their low in March. The stock climbed 2.2% in Tokyo on Tuesday, as Japan’s indexes rose.”SoftBank Group’s massive buyback remains the most important source of good news and tailwind for” the shares, Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote in a report.SoftBank did not give a dividend forecast for the first in its history, saying it may not pay one this year. “Just in case we need more financing,” Son says.Separately, SoftBank said Ma will step down as a director as part of several planned board changes. Three new directors have been nominated, including SoftBank Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto. Lip-Bu Tan and Yuko Kawamoto will join, bringing the total of external board members to four. Kawamoto will be the first female director.Son’s increasingly risky bets over the past few years coincided with departures from SoftBank’s board of some of it smost outspoken members. Shigenobu Nagamori, the founder of motor maker Nidec Corp., stepped down in 2017, while Fast Retailing Co. Chief Executive Officer Tadashi Yanai left last December.“With no famous outside directors left on SoftBank’s board, it’s not clear who is going to hold Son responsible anymore,” said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.Son did not back away from continuing to make startup investments, although it will be with his own money for the foreseeable future. He said he believes that the economic shock of the coronavirus could end up helping technology companies in fields from ride-hailing to artificial intelligence.“I believe this shock will only accelerate the paradigm shift,” he said.Son famously lost about $70 billion during the dot-com bust, as startups cratered and his stock price crashed. He said the current downturn is nothing compared to that, when he was holding on by two fingers. Now, he has a more stable balance sheet and billions in assets he could sell if need be.“Compared to the past crisis, this time I am just looking down on the bottom of the valley from above,” he said.Indeed, he encouraged investors to think through the implications of the Vision Fund’s end. Even if the fund is worth zero, SoftBank has stakes in Alibaba, SoftBank Corp., T-Mobile US and others that are worth about double its market value.“Even in the worst case scenario, the risks Son has taken will not sink his company,” said Jusuke Ikegami, a professor at Waseda Business School in Tokyo.He offered no assurances that his startups will recover. In fact, he reckons Vision Fund company valuations are more likely to go down than up.Still, Son didn’t concede that the Vision Fund is a bust. He said SoftBank anticipates it will be able to pay a 7% return to limited partners who hold about $40 billion in preferred stock.Pressed for some view of the future, Son said that he still thinks he could see a 20% internal rate of return on Vision Fund investments. Now is the worst possible time but in five or ten years, things may look different. He could even approach outside investors about future funds.“The situation is exceedingly difficult,” Son said. “Our unicorns have fallen into this sudden coronavirus ravine. But some of them will use this crisis to grow wings.”(Updates with share price in 11th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank’s First Vision Fund May Be Its Last After $18 Billion Loss
2020-05-19,"If the proposed sale goes through, its proceeds could help offset SoftBank’s heavy investment losses over the past year.  According to its first-quarter earnings report yesterday, SoftBank’s Vision Fund lost $17.4 billion in value for the year ended March 31, obliterating the $12.8 billion gain the fund recorded a year ago.  T-Mobile’s  merger with SoftBank-controlled Sprint, which was officially completed last month, gave SoftBank ownership of about 25% of T-Mobile’s shares.",SoftBank reportedly plans to sell about $20 billion of its T-Mobile shares
2020-05-19,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is closing in on a deal to sell about $20 billion of its stock in T-Mobile US Inc., accelerating efforts to raise capital after record losses in its investment business, according to people familiar with the matter.The Tokyo-based company, which owns about 25% of T-Mobile US, plans to sell a slice of that stake to Deutsche Telekom AG so the German parent can own a majority and consolidate the unit’s financial results, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. SoftBank would then sell shares in a secondary offering to other investors and retain a smaller stake itself, one of the people said. The deal could be announced this week, the person said.Talks are still ongoing and the deal could change or fall apart. T-Mobile US’s market value is about $126 billion, while SoftBank’s stake is about $31 billion.SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son landed the stake in T-Mobile US just this year, after U.S. regulators approved the sale of his Sprint Corp. to its wireless rival. He is in the midst of selling 4.5 trillion yen ($42 billion) of assets to raise cash so he can buy back shares and pay down debt. Among his other prime assets are Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and SoftBank Corp., the Japanese wireless business.“If SoftBank Group can renegotiate that sale, it will reduce pressure on SoftBank Group to sell its stakes in Alibaba or SoftBank Corp.,” Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote in a report.The company already raised $11.5 billion from contracts to sell shares in Alibaba, its most valuable holding. Son said at an earnings briefing on Monday that the sale is the first tranche in a broader unwinding of assets.Dow Jones, which reported the T-Mobile US sale earlier, said Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are working to draw investors for the deal.Long-term ControlAny potential sale could tip Deutsche Telekom’s stake in T-Mobile over 50%. The German carrier currently holds 43.6% and is already the controlling shareholder due to how voting rights were structured following the Sprint deal. A 7% stake in T-Mobile would be worth about $8.2 billion, according to New Street Research analyst James Ratzer.“Another buyer might be willing to pay a higher price than Deutsche Telekom, so going to 50% now would secure longer-term control,” Ratzer said in a note.T-Mobile completed its $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint on April 1, making it the second-largest mobile carrier in the U.S. based on the number of regular monthly subscribers. T-Mobile is the nation’s fastest-growing wireless company, and Deutsche Telekom’s largest source of revenue.On a Deutsche Telekom earnings call last week, Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges was asked if the company would be interested in buying a larger stake in T-Mobile from SoftBank.“It’s a great business to have, big attractive opportunities going forward -- we believe in the stock,” he said, adding that he could not “speculate on anything around these M&A talks.”Deutsche Telekom’s shares rose 1.5% in early trading on Tuesday.SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom are in the first months of a four-year lockup period that restricts the sale of T-Mobile shares. But the merger agreement doesn’t stop the companies from transferring stock between SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom. Even though Deutsche Telekom has a controlling stake in T-Mobile, it doesn’t have a majority stake. An outsider could purchase SoftBank’s shares when the lockup expires in 2024.SoftBank Group said on Monday that its Vision Fund lost 1.9 trillion yen in the most recent fiscal year, triggering the worst loss ever in the Japanese company’s 39-year history. SoftBank had to write down the valuations of companies like WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. because of business missteps and the coronavirus fallout.The Japanese company also said on Monday it plans to spend up to 500 billion yen to buy back shares through next March, on top of an existing repurchase plan of the same size.

2020-05-21,"(Bloomberg) -- In early March, before the coronavirus pandemic triggered a global economic lockdown, SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son paid tribute to Rajeev Misra, the man who runs his $100 billion technology investment fund. Wearing a $70 Uniqlo down jacket, the Japanese billionaire put his arm around Misra’s shoulders at a town hall meeting in San Carlos, California. He said he would never forget the help Misra provided when he was at Deutsche Bank AG more than a decade earlier and spoke of the trust and respect they had developed since, according to a summary shared internally. “We are family,” Son said. But behind the smiles and talk of kinship, another story is unfolding, one about the perplexing relationship at the top of SoftBank. The Vision Fund this week reported a loss for the latest fiscal year of $17.7 billion as it wrote down the value of portfolio companies including WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. That triggered the biggest loss in SoftBank’s 39-year history. Its shares have been hammered as investors fret that the virus will batter the company’s holdings even more, and Son has said he will sell $42 billion in assets.Misra is at the heart of the problem in ways that go beyond how the fund’s companies are performing, people familiar with the matter say. He has come under fire for alleged efforts to tarnish internal rivals, including a previously undisclosed clash with SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure. The company has acknowledged that it’s conducting an internal review. At the same time, Elliott Management Corp., the activist investment fund that built up an almost $3 billion stake in the company, has asked SoftBank to name three independent directors and create a new board committee to improve the Vision Fund’s investment process, according to correspondence reviewed by Bloomberg News.“Misra and Masa go back a long way, but gratitude should only last so long,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “If Misra is not the problem, he’s at least a big part of it.”The corporate intrigue involving Claure began in 2018, when the Bolivian entrepreneur was under consideration to join the Vision Fund’s board and investment committee, according to six people with first-hand knowledge of the matter and a review of emails and documents. The fund — run by Misra as an affiliate of the Japanese company — hired a Swiss firm called Heptagone to conduct a background check on Claure’s possible ties to money laundering and drug cartels, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they feared retaliation. The report cleared him, but its focus opened a rift between the two men that kept Claure off the fund’s board and solidified Misra’s control, the people said.A Vision Fund spokesman said one of the fund’s limited partners, not Misra, requested the background check and Misra wasn’t involved in determining its focus. SoftBank has been told the same thing and doesn’t have evidence otherwise, people familiar with the matter say. But current and former executives across the SoftBank empire remain convinced that Misra played a role since the report was commissioned by his team and follows a pattern of similar accusations about undermining internal rivals. In March, days after the Wall Street Journal reported that Misra had allegedly orchestrated a campaign to sabotage two former SoftBank executives beginning in 2015, Son ducked questions about the story from investors at a meeting at the Lotte New York Palace hotel, according to two people who were present. One of them, a SoftBank shareholder, told Bloomberg News afterward that the company needs a Vision Fund leader more focused on tight operations than turf battles. Son has remained steadfast in his support. “Rajeev has been instrumental in the company’s growth and success,” Son said in a statement to Bloomberg. “He’s also been a very trusted senior executive and friend, and will continue to have my full support and confidence.” The Vision Fund spokesman denied that Misra was involved in any campaigns to undermine company executives. “The claims underpinning this story are untrue, and have been fully denied,” he said.But some SoftBank insiders are wondering how Misra has managed to survive. It may be, they said, that Son needs his financial expertise to navigate the next few months of asset sales, share buybacks and loan repayments as the coronavirus weakens portfolio companies, hurting SoftBank’s ability to borrow. Misra helped Son finance difficult deals before joining the company in 2014 and played a crucial role in raising capital for the Vision Fund. He has also established his own power base at the fund’s London headquarters, surrounded by a coterie of former Deutsche Bank colleagues.Still, there are long-term risks for Son in tolerating what many see as a divisive culture and chaotic infighting that have plagued the Vision Fund since its inception. “Misra personifies what Vision Fund is about — a bunch of dealmakers obsessed with leverage who have no business running a venture capital fund,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore, who has been covering the company since it went public in 1994. “But it would be naïve to put all of their problems at Misra’s feet. Son has the ultimate word.” Son and Misra share a bond as outsiders who left their native lands to study abroad and ended up finding wealth and prestige. Son, 62,  went to the University of California, Berkeley and launched businesses in the U.S. before founding SoftBank in Japan in 1981. Misra, 58 and born in India, earned degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before embarking on a career in banking at Merrill Lynch.But while Son never worked for anyone else, Misra always operated within large organizations, navigating their power structures. He moved to Deutsche Bank in 1997, where he eventually became global head of credit trading, turning it into one of the biggest traders of credit-default swaps — instruments at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. One of his traders, Greg Lippmann, featured in Michael Lewis’s The Big Short, bet on a crash in the U.S. housing market, even as Deutsche Bank was a leading player in creating and selling mortgage-backed securities to investors. With slicked-back hair and a thicket of woven bracelets around his wrist, Misra speaks with an intimacy that suggests he’s confiding in a listener as he races from one subject to the next with a burning urgency. He wears his eccentricities proudly: He often padded around the office in stockinged feet, incessantly smoking, vaping or chewing nicotine gum.Misra joined SoftBank after stints at UBS Group AG and Fortress Investment Group. He started as head of strategic finance, reporting directly to Son, but his connections to the boss preceded his appointment. In 2006, Deutsche Bank helped SoftBank finance the acquisition of the Japanese wireless operations of Vodafone Group Plc, one of the most consequential deals of Son’s career. The $15 billion purchase was the largest leveraged buyout ever in Asia at the time and faced skepticism because Vodafone had struggled against the country’s top wireless players. Son succeeded in turning the business into a viable competitor, in part by persuading Steve Jobs to give him exclusive rights to the iPhone in Japan, and completing SoftBank’s transformation from software distributor to telecom conglomerate.Misra proved his worth at SoftBank as well. Son had acquired the troubled No. 3 wireless operator in the U.S., Sprint Corp., but the turnaround had proven far more difficult than the one at Vodafone. Misra put together a novel loan package secured by Sprint’s wireless licenses that helped it avoid bankruptcy.From the start, Misra clashed with Nikesh Arora, a hotshot former Google executive Son recruited in 2014 to oversee SoftBank’s startup investing, according to people with direct knowledge of their relationship. Arora would openly question Misra’s judgment, even on financial issues, leaving him fuming, the people said.In early 2015, Misra set out to undermine Arora and one of his allies at SoftBank, Alok Sama, the Wall Street Journal reported in February. The newspaper said Misra worked through intermediaries to plant negative stories about the executives, concocted a shareholder campaign against them and attempted unsuccessfully to lure Arora into a sexual tryst. “These are old allegations which contain a series of falsehoods that have been consistently denied,” a spokesman for Misra told Bloomberg News, adding that Misra thinks highly of Arora and that the two men worked together productively on many deals. “Mr. Misra did not orchestrate a campaign against his former colleagues.” A spokesman for the Wall Street Journal said the paper stands by its reporting.Arora was cleared of wrongdoing by SoftBank, but he left in 2016 and is now chief executive officer of Palo Alto Networks Inc. Sama, who had been in charge of SoftBank’s investments and inked many of its early startup deals, seemed a logical candidate to play a leading role at the Vision Fund. But some of the limited partners expressed reservations about him, people familiar with the matter said. Arora didn’t respond to requests for comment, and an attorney for Sama declined to comment.Meanwhile, Misra solidified his ties to Son. He spent time in Tokyo in early 2017 as Son worked on the acquisition of Fortress. He also used his former Deutsche Bank connections to help close a deal for Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to become the Vision Fund’s cornerstone investor, chipping in $45 billion, almost half of the capital. That May, Misra was named head of the Vision Fund. The clash with Claure began after Sama was sidelined, according to SoftBank executives familiar with the matter. Son hit it off with Claure in 2013, when SoftBank took a majority stake in Brightstar, a Miami-based mobile phone distributor he founded that became one of Latin America’s fastest-growing startups. The 6-foot-6 executive quickly demonstrated how SoftBank could save millions on its purchases, winning respect from his new boss. A year later, Son tapped him to replace Sprint’s CEO. Claure made enough progress fixing the wireless operator that Son rewarded him with a seat on SoftBank’s board in 2017 and named him chief operating officer the following year. Then, Son gave Claure a new challenge: building teams in government affairs, legal services and operations to support the company’s expanding portfolio. Part of the mission was to assemble and lead a task force that would help startups fine-tune their strategies to improve execution and speed their path to profitability. The mandate would place him at the center of the action as SoftBank transformed itself into a technology investment conglomerate. It also apparently put Claure on a collision course with Misra.The first hint that this might not be a typical corporate rivalry came months before the Heptagone investigation, according to a person close to Claure. In the summer of 2018, Stephen Bye, a former Sprint executive, reached out to Claure with unsettling news. Bye, Sprint’s chief technology officer until 2015, was approached by a private investigator trying to dig up dirt on his former boss, the person said. Bye declined to talk to the investigator and immediately called Claure. Claure, 49, was used to people poking into his past because he was often approached about joining corporate boards. But he had also heard speculation about Misra’s role in the campaigns against Arora and Sama, and he expressed concern that he was next, the person said. The Vision Fund spokesman said neither Misra nor anyone else from the fund was involved in the approach to Claure’s former employee. Bye declined to comment.In October 2018, after the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents, Son and Misra traveled to Riyadh to meet with officials of the sovereign wealth fund, their biggest investor. They made the trip during the Saudi fund’s annual investment conference, even as other global executives canceled their travel plans. While the two men didn’t attend the conference, Son met with the head of the Public Investment Fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, and laid out the new role he envisioned for Claure. He would join the Vision Fund board and its investment committee, and manage the group of operations specialists when it was embedded within the fund, according to a proposal reviewed by Bloomberg News. The changes, if implemented, would give Claure broad authority at the fund.Later that year the Vision Fund commissioned the Heptagone report. What made it different from routine due diligence, according to the people directly involved, was that the sleuths were asked to answer three specific questions: Was Claure or any company under his control ever involved in money laundering, tax evasion or fraud? Was he ever in a relationship with individuals charged with or convicted of money laundering, drug trafficking or other crimes? Had he been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or elsewhere? Claure’s company, Brightstar, generated enormous amounts of cash selling used phones in Latin America in the 1990s, exactly the kind of business that could be used for money laundering, Heptagone’s report said. But the report found no evidence Brightstar or Claure were involved in such activities, people who saw it said.Heptagone went on to say that Claure had a long-standing friendship with Carlos Becerra, a San Diego businessman whose name had appeared in U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency reports for possible involvement in cocaine distribution and money laundering. After Becerra sold a unit of his company to Brightstar, in 2007, the two men remained friendly. A photo on Becerra’s Instagram account from June 2015 showed him posing on a boat dock with Claure. Becerra, who hadn’t been charged with a drug-related crime, told Bloomberg News that his relationship with Claure was cordial, not close. He denied any involvement in money laundering or drug dealing and said he has held a California liquor license since 2001, which requires a background check and isn’t available to anyone with a criminal record. The closest Claure came to a crime, the Heptagone report found, was his involvement in a Miami bar fight in the 1990s in which no one was hurt and he wasn’t charged. Heptagone co-founder and managing partner Alexis Pfefferlé said he couldn’t confirm or deny his firm’s involvement in any report but added that Heptagone “has always been able to fully complete its assignments.”The Vision Fund spokesman said the fund often runs background checks on employees, so it wasn’t abnormal to conduct one on Claure, given his potential involvement in operations. The only thing atypical, he said, was that it came at the request of a limited partner. While the Heptagone report cleared Claure, its underlying premise appeared to be that a Latin American entrepreneur must have built his business through unsavory means, according to the people who reviewed the document. Claure was furious. He went to Son, outraged at what he saw as an attempt to damage his reputation, the people said. SoftBank took over the due diligence from the Vision Fund and gave the job to Kroll, a more established security firm, the people said. Kroll, which declined to comment, found no problems in Claure’s past. But suspicious that Misra was behind the campaign, Claure told Son he wanted no formal part of the Vision Fund, the people said. Son ultimately decided to keep the two out of each other’s way. In February 2019, about 40 employees Claure had hired were shifted over to work for Misra. Claure, who had moved his wife and four youngest daughters to Tokyo less than two months earlier, headed back to Miami. He has since helped close Sprint’s merger with T-Mobile US Inc. and is leading the effort to turn around WeWork. He also oversees a Latin American investment fund for SoftBank and co-owns a Major League Soccer team, Inter Miami, with former British star David Beckham. SoftBank denied that Claure and Misra clashed over the operations group and said both men agreed that folding it into the Vision Fund was in the best interests of the business. “While we have had our occasional differences,” Claure said in a statement, “I have a close and collaborative relationship with Rajeev, including my involvement with many of the Vision Fund’s largest portfolio companies.” The relationships Misra forged at Deutsche Bank continue to underpin his power and influence. Colin Fan, a former co-head of the investment bank, moved to SoftBank in 2017, joining more than half a dozen former bankers and traders from the German lender. But arguably the most important connection forged at Deutsche Bank is Misra’s relationship with London-based merchant bank Centricus, founded by three former Misra colleagues: Michele Faissola, Dalinc Ariburnu and Nizar Al-Bassam. The firm, originally called FAB Partners for the principals’ last names, began working with SoftBank in 2016, when Misra asked it to help find financing for the Vision Fund. Centricus advised on the creation and structure of the fund, suggested employees and helped cement the investment by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — a deal hashed out in October of that year when Mohammed bin Salman, then the country’s deputy crown prince, met with Son in Tokyo.For its work, Centricus negotiated a payment of more than $100 million, people familiar with the arrangement said. And the fees kept coming. Centricus advised SoftBank on its $3.3 billion deal for Fortress and teamed up with Son on a failed bid to start a 24-team soccer tournament with FIFA. The firm also was brought in to help raise capital for a second Vision Fund, Bloomberg reported in mid-2019.Some SoftBank and Vision Fund executives have questioned the amount paid to Centricus, the people with knowledge of the arrangement said. Although fees for helping companies raise capital are often about 1%, making the sum paid to Centricus a good deal for SoftBank, executives critical of Misra’s leadership were piqued that the recipients were former Deutsche Bank colleagues, the people said. Centricus and SoftBank both declined to comment about fees or any other aspect of their relationship.Faissola left the firm after his connections with the Qatari government created tension with the Saudis. But Centricus hired another former Deutsche Bank colleague of Misra’s as a consultant: London-based hedge fund manager Bertrand Des Pallieres, a senior trader at the bank from 2005 to 2007 who reported directly to Misra. Des Pallieres was under consideration for a job at the Vision Fund in 2018, the people said, but that all changed after the Wall Street Journal reported that Misra had recruited Italian businessman Alessandro Benedetti to undermine Arora and Sama. Benedetti, who denied through a spokesman that he had anything to do with those efforts, was a business associate of Des Pallieres. A year later, Des Pallieres became a Centricus consultant.SoftBank’s relationship with Centricus began fraying last year, according to people familiar with the matter. Misra argued that SoftBank had no further need for the firm, as Son had developed ties of his own with MBS, the people said. And Misra had his own relationship with Al-Rumayyan, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund head. In October 2019, Misra and Son attended a party for Al-Rumayyan and MBS on a yacht in the Red Sea, people with knowledge of the event said, confirming a Wall Street Journal account.By then, SoftBank had hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Cantor Fitzgerald LP to help search for new investors. Some SoftBank executives were surprised by Cantor’s involvement, as the New York-based bank had little experience sourcing investments for initiatives like the Vision Fund. But Cantor’s president since 2017 has been former Deutsche Bank co-CEO Anshu Jain, a onetime boss and childhood friend of Misra’s.The Saudis have held off committing capital to a second Vision Fund, and Son this week said he had to stop raising money because of difficulties with WeWork and other investments. SoftBank stepped in to save WeWork last year after its failed initial public offering and put Claure in charge of turning the business around. But the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the challenges of drawing people to co-working spaces.“Vision Fund’s results are not something to be proud of,” Son said at somber press conference in Tokyo on Monday, with reporters and analysts calling in remotely because of the pandemic. “If the results are bad, you can’t raise money from investors.”Elliott, the fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, has pressed for changes, and Misra has been involved in those talks, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. He has met frequently with Singer’s son Gordon, the people said. But two people familiar with Elliott’s operations say the firm has asked SoftBank to get to the bottom of Misra’s alleged involvement in campaigns against his colleagues and has expressed dismay at the infighting among top managers and how much of that spills into the press. A spokeswoman for Elliott denies that the company is pushing for an investigation, and a SoftBank spokesman said Son hasn’t received such a request.SoftBank’s board probed who was behind the campaigns against Arora and Sama but didn’t uncover any definitive evidence, people with knowledge of the matter said. While the company has said it’s looking into the most recent Wall Street Journal allegations, several senior executives have downplayed their significance. Ron Fisher, a SoftBank director, called the February story “another example of people anonymously spreading misinformation and innuendo about our executives,” according to an email to Vision Fund managing partners.SoftBank's board has lost several of its most independent voices in recent years, the kind of directors who could question his decisions. Shigenobu Nagamori, the outspoken founder of motor maker Nidec Corp., stepped down in 2017. Fast Retailing Co. CEO Tadashi Yanai, who had been on the board since 2001 and was a rare voice of dissent, left at the end of 2019. On the same day SoftBank announced its record losses this week, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma announced he would leave the board too, after 13 years. Two new independent directors were nominated — Cadence Design Systems Inc. CEO Lip-Bu Tan and Waseda University professor Yuko Kawamoto.Misra’s fate is ultimately intertwined with the Vision Fund, which Son once declared would be the foundation of a new SoftBank but now risks becoming one of his worst missteps. The fund declared quarter after quarter of profit after its inception in 2017, as it marked up the value of startups and booked paper profits. But since the WeWork fiasco, it has lost all of that money and more. The structure of the fund — Misra’s invention — will create another squeeze. About $40 billion of the money raised from outside investors is in the form of preferred shares that pay about 7% a year. The idea is that SoftBank would see extra profits if the Vision Fund hit it big, but it also means losses are amplified. Venture capital funds typically don’t have such liabilities to avoid the risks of such a volatile business. Misra has been on something of a publicity tour recently to defend his reputation, although he declined to comment for this story. In an interview with CNBC published in March, he said that the Vision Fund’s mistakes are surfacing early and its portfolio will be redeemed in 18 to 24 months. “I’m so, so positive I’ll prove people wrong,” he said. He also vowed he wouldn’t leave the fund. “I owe it to my stakeholders, my LPs, my employees to be here for the journey,” he said. The Vision Fund spokesman denied Misra said the portfolio would recover that quickly. In the end, what SoftBank decides to do about Misra, if anything, depends on Son. His business is under intense pressure, putting even his deepest loyalties to the test. “At a company like SoftBank, where the founder runs the business, that person has to take responsibility for the ethics and the standards for behavior within the company,” said Parissa Haghirian, a professor of international management at Sophia University in Tokyo who specializes in Japanese corporate culture. “If you are not clear about this, then everybody sets their own rules.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","SoftBank’s Masa-Misra Partnership Strained by Losses, Infighting"

2020-05-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Intelsat SA said it filed a commitment with the Federal Communications Commission to give up airwaves that are to be auctioned for use by mobile broadband, preserving its positioning for a payout from the sale.The action follows a similar commitment earlier Tuesday by fellow satellite communications provider SES SA, the other major holder of rights to the so-called C-band airwaves that are to be sold as the FCC pushes for more frequencies for fast 5G networks.The satellite companies will retain some airwaves to serve current customers. The companies are in line for a share of as much as $9.7 billion for leaving airwaves coveted by wireless providers. The FCC set a May 29 deadline for providers to say whether they will participate.Stephen Spengler, chief executive officer of Intelsat, said in an emailed news release that the company was “committed to advancing – at an accelerated pace – America’s position in the race to 5G.”“We understand what’s required to successfully and quickly transition current users, while maintaining high-quality, uninterrupted broadcast to more than 100 million American homes and businesses,” Spengler added.Bidders at the auction that’s to begin Dec. 8 are expected to include large mobile broadband providers such as AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.Intelsat, weighed down by almost $15 billion of debt, filed for bankruptcy protection May 14 as part of efforts to raise cash needed to prepare its spectrum for the auction.The FCC’s plan would provide $9.7 billion in compensation to satellite providers if they hit deadlines for leaving the airwaves quickly. Separately, the companies could share in another $3.3 billion to $5.2 billion to reimburse them for costs of making the switch.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Intelsat Joins SES in Committing to C-Band Auction of Airwaves

2020-05-28,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund is planning deep cuts in staffing after reporting about $18 billion in losses from the declining value of its startups, according to people familiar with the matter.The reductions could affect about 10% of the fund’s workforce of roughly 500, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing personnel decisions. The Vision Fund’s headquarters are in London, with additional operations in Tokyo and California. The cuts will be across all levels of staff, said one person.A spokesman for the Vision Fund declined to comment.SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son and his $100 billion Vision Fund changed the tech industry by handing out enormous checks to relatively unproven startups. But the fund went from SoftBank’s main profit contributor a year ago to its biggest drag on earnings. It lost 1.9 trillion yen ($17.7 billion) last fiscal year after writing down the value of investments, including WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.Son originally said he hoped to raise a new Vision Fund every two to three years, but he has conceded he can’t attract money now because of the poor performance. The fund, led by Rajeev Misra, operates as a SoftBank affiliate with most of the money coming from limited partners, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co.“It makes sense that SoftBank is cutting positions at the Vision Fund as they are in an extremely difficult situation, and they may start targeting highly paid workers to cut costs,” said Koji Hirai, head of M&A advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo.The Vision Fund grew rapidly after launch three years ago as Misra recruited scores of people from the finance industry, including many of his former colleagues from Deutsche Bank. Among its managing partners are several of the German bank’s ex-employees, including Colin Fan, former co-head of its investment banking division.The fund also set up an unusual compensation structure that includes a $5 billion loan to employees. The debt is swapped for equity in the fund and generates profit when deals make money -- and losses when they don’t, scaled by seniority, people familiar with the matter have said. The poor performance so far, along with the layoffs, may prompt some employees to look for other positions.“One side effect is that the best people at SoftBank may exit to find better funds,” said Hirai. “If so, their fund business may become even worse, sliding down from a slope.”The Vision Fund has struggled since WeWork botched its efforts to go public last year and SoftBank stepped in to bail the company out. The Vision Fund currently manages more than 80 portfolio companies, but Son expects about 15 of the fund’s startups will likely go bankrupt while predicting another 15 will thrive.“Vision Fund’s results are not something to be proud of,” Son said earlier this month as he announced record losses. “If the results are bad, you can’t raise money from investors. Things aren’t good, that’s why we are investing with our own money.”The fund has already unwound some investments, including selling a nearly 50% stake in dog-walking startup Wag Labs back to the company last year. Son has said he plans to sell off about $42 billion in assets to finance stock buybacks and pay down debt.SoftBank disclosed it’s unloading some shares in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and is in talks to sell about $20 billion of T-Mobile US Inc., Bloomberg News reported. It’s also exploring a deal for its minority stake in industrial software maker OSIsoft LLC that could be worth $1.5 billion.SoftBank shares, after plummeting in March, have recovered and are little changed for the year. The stock rose just more than 1% in Tokyo trading.One emerging question is how Alibaba -- SoftBank’s most valuable holding -- will be affected by the clash between the U.S. and China. A bill just approved by the U.S. Senate could force Chinese companies like Alibaba to stop trading their shares on U.S. exchanges.“The big picture is SoftBank is caught up with U.S.-China conflict right now, and SoftBank may need to conduct a drastic restructuring if Alibaba was delisted from New York,” said Hirai. “Its main banks and the capital markets are anxiously awaiting an outcome for the situation.”(Updates with additional details starting in the first paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank’s Vision Fund Is Planning to Cut 10% of Staff

2020-05-29,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. has named Akshay Naheta senior vice president, moving the Vision Fund managing partner to a new role as the company looks for ways to improve its governance and stem losses, according to people familiar with the matter.Abu Dhabi-based Naheta will assist SoftBank founder and Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son in managing the conglomerate’s investments function and will provide strategic advice to its global management team, said some of the people, who asked not to be identified because the appointment isn’t yet public. Naheta will start his new role in June, one of them said.Another Vision Fund managing partner, Tokyo-based Kentaro Matsui, will transition to a senior advisory role at SoftBank Group, one of the people said. The moves were mutual decisions and part of an effort to refine the originally $100 billion fund’s operating model, the person added. Both Matsui and Naheta -- whose previous roles were focused on Asia and the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, respectively -- are expected to continue to work on select Vision Fund activities.A spokeswoman for SoftBank and a spokesman for SoftBank’s Vision Fund declined to comment. The senior vice president title at SoftBank Group is held by the likes of its chief financial officer and chief legal officer.The executive reshuffle signals a heightened focus on SoftBank’s senior ranks in a period of turbulence for the Japanese conglomerate. The company reported the biggest annual loss in its history this month as Vision Fund portfolio companies lost value, and it’s been facing pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. to bolster governance and buy back stock.Read more: SoftBank’s Masa-Misra Partnership Strained by Losses, InfightingNaheta, who oversaw investments in the likes of chip designer Nvidia Corp., pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences Ltd. and German online car trader Auto1, is close to Middle Eastern investor Mubadala Investment Co. and had been working on raising funds for a second Vision Fund, according to a person familiar with the matter.Matsui, who focused on investments in China, oversaw the Vision Fund’s bets on companies including Full Truck Alliance and Ping An Good Doctor.Potential LayoffsSoftBank’s Vision Fund is weighing job cuts that could affect about 10% of the company’s workforce after reporting about $18 billion in losses from the declining value of its startups, people familiar with the matter have said. In recent weeks, a separate SoftBank unit, SoftBank Group International, cut roughly 10% of staff.SoftBank earlier this month said it plans to spend as much as 500 billion yen ($4.6 billion) to buy back shares through next March, on top of an existing repurchase plan of the same size. The conglomerate is accelerating efforts to raise cash and is closing in on a deal to sell about $20 billion of its stock in T-Mobile US Inc., people familiar with the matter said previously.Before joining the Vision Fund, Naheta was managing partner of investment firm Knight Assets & Co. and head of principal strategies at Deutsche Bank AG. Matsui previously worked for Mizuho Securities Co. where he advised on some of SoftBank’s largest bets, including Arm, Vodafone Japan and Sprint.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Hands New Roles to Two Vision Fund Managing Partners
2020-05-29,"(Bloomberg) -- The head of SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund received a substantial increase in compensation even as the investment business delivered a $17.7 billion loss.Rajeev Misra earned 1.61 billion yen ($15 million) in the year ended March 31, more than double his pay a year earlier, SoftBank said in a statement on Friday. The Vision Fund lost 1.9 trillion yen in the period, triggering the worst loss ever in the Japanese company’s 39-year history.SoftBank had to write down the valuations of companies like WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. because of business missteps and the coronavirus fallout. Its return on the fund was negative 6%, compared with 62% just a year ago. Still, Misra was SoftBank’s second-highest-paid executive last year after Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, even though Misra received no bonus and most of his compensation was in base pay. Founder Masayoshi Son took a 9% compensation cut, earning 209 million yen.“What kind of message is Son sending by giving Misra a raise despite the disastrous results he delivered?” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. “The optics is just not good.”The pay hike for Misra comes at a time when the Vision Fund is planning deep cuts in staffing. The reductions across all levels of staff could affect about 10% of the fund’s workforce of roughly 500, according to people familiar with the matter. The Vision Fund, which has stopped making new investments after spending 85% of its capital, lists 30 people as investors on its website, including all of its managing partners, partners and directors.The fund has struggled since WeWork botched its efforts to go public last year and SoftBank stepped in to bail the company out. The Vision Fund currently manages more than 80 portfolio companies, but Son expects about 15 of the fund’s startups will likely go bankrupt while predicting another 15 will thrive.Separately, SoftBank is moving two managing partners at the Vision Fund into new roles. Akshay Naheta will become senior vice president, assisting Son in investments and providing strategic advice. Kentaro Matsui will transition to a senior advisory role at SoftBank Group.Claure, who helped close Sprint Corp.’s merger with T-Mobile US Inc. and is leading the effort to turn around WeWork, made 2.11 billion yen, a 17% raise. He also oversees a Latin American investment fund for SoftBank.SoftBank declined to comment on the reasons for changes in pay.Chief Strategy Officer Katsunori Sago earned 1.11 billion yen, a 13% increase for the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive. Ken Miyauchi, head of SoftBank’s domestic telecom operation, made 699 million yen, a 43% drop. Simon Segars, head of its ARM Holdings Plc chip unit, did not make the list because his pay dropped below 100 million yen. Segars earned 1.1 billion yen the previous year.Ronald Fisher, Son’s long-time lieutenant and SoftBank Group vice chairman, saw his pay plunge 79% to 680 million yen. Fisher’s remuneration from the Vision Fund, where he runs the U.S. operations, totaled 1.27 billion yen, including a 767 million yen bonus. But he lost 701 million yen in compensation not related to the fund. SoftBank said the drop reflects a decline in stock price, but didn’t provide further details.SoftBank’s disastrous bet on WeWork has been viewed internally as Fisher’s project. Before SoftBank first invested in the company in 2017, Fisher met with executives at IWG Plc, a European competitor with a much lower valuation and many more sites, according to people familiar with the matter. Fisher interpreted the unfavorable metrics as a sign of growth potential. A month later, the Vision Fund led a $4.4 billion investment round into WeWork at a $20 billion valuation.Last year, after WeWork’s effort to go public fell apart, SoftBank stepped in to organize a bailout and put Claure in charge of turning around the business. But the pandemic has hammered its operations as workers shy away from gathering in shared office spaces. Earlier this month, SoftBank wrote down the value of its stake to $2.9 billion, more than 90% lower than its peak.(Updates with analyst comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Doubles Vision Fund Chief’s Pay Despite Record Loss

2020-06-01,"(Bloomberg) -- In his quest to expand U.S. mobile broadband capacity, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai hasn’t been afraid to anger colleagues in government.He’s taken on the Pentagon, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as well as the departments of Transportation and Energy. Those agencies have warned that his plans to reallocate spectrum could endanger national security, harm weather forecasts, loosen control of the electrical grid and degrade vehicle safety.So far, Pai has prevailed.“Pai is willing to get himself on the hot seat,” said Doug Brake, telecom policy director for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based policy group that works to accelerate innovation.The fights are worth billions of dollars as industries jockey for rights to airwaves, riding a boom in usage for such things as online shopping, streaming television and social media. Appetite for gadgets and the airwaves on which to run them is only growing: the U.S. will have 1.2 billion mobile connected devices by 2023, up from 560 million in 2018, according to a forecast by Cisco Systems Inc.Pai’s independence may be tested in coming months as President Donald Trump has ordered the FCC to draw up regulations to keep social media companies such as Twitter Inc. from censoring political speech.“This debate is an important one,” Pai said in a statement. “The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce.”Pai, whose office didn’t reply to requests for comment, has an insiders’ profile that doesn’t suggest a penchant for inter-agency skirmishing. He is a former FCC commissioner, agency staff lawyer and U.S. Senate aide, and before that an attorney for Verizon Communications Inc. President Donald Trump elevated him three years ago to chairman of the commission, which was created in 1934 to keep radio signals straight and now doing the same with wireless broadband.Pai, 47, presents a whimsical public face for an agency steeped in arcane technical policy making. He spices his remarks with pop-culture references, citing the TV sitcom “The Office” and the film “The Big Lebowski.” His Twitter feed branches from telecom policy into philosophy, architecture and sports teams from Kansas City, not far from his childhood home in Parsons, Kansas.As chairman, he has made priorities of pruning regulations and pushing for more mobile broadband to feed the nation’s insatiable appetite. With backing from the agency’s Republican majority, he’s compiled a series of victories for the wireless industry -- and at times setbacks for older uses of airwaves.NOAA, for example, said the FCC’s push to reallocate some spectrum would set back satellite-assisted weather forecasting decades. The Transportation Department warned about road safety when a patch of airwaves set aside for driverless cars was reassigned. The Energy Department opposed taking spectrum used by the power companies.Perhaps most memorably, the Defense Department raised alarms about the FCC’s April 20 approval of a mobile broadband network, saying the service will interfere with military and civilian GPS.Wins and losses are closely linked in airwaves policy because of the nature of spectrum -- the invisible electromagnetic waves that carry communications. Each slice of airwaves can carry one use; a second use on the same frequencies threatens interference, just as a shouted conversation in a room can drown out a quiet chat.To avoid conflicts, regulators including the FCC put different services on separate airwaves. Antennas listen for the chatter on their assigned channels, and don’t pick up signals at higher and lower frequencies, which in turn are left to other users.Assignments, including some set decades ago, have come under question as the mobile broadband revolution deepens, bringing fresh demand for airwaves to handle booming wireless traffic. Old services are being forced to move to different airwaves or share their frequencies with new arrivals.Pai’s FCC has worked to set up frequencies for more Wi-Fi and the high-speed gadgetry that will combine to form the 5G revolution of fast, ubiquitous wireless connections -- a priority for the White House and big tech and telephone companies. The changeover promises such wonders as remote surgery, autonomous cars, rich virtual reality video feeds, and factories humming with connected equipment.Pai takes credit for rearranging a dozen swaths of spectrum. The amount of airwaves affected is more those used by all U.S. mobile broadband providers, Pai said in a video posted on the agency website last year.Friction is inevitable as broadband and other wireless technologies vie for space in the crowded tableau of airwaves swaths, known as bands.“Finding new bands or new opportunities to reallocate for new purposes is more difficult than ever before,” said FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly, a Republican. “There’s no greenfields to pick from. And so finding new spectrum for a new purpose means reallocating someone who already exists there.”To others, the FCC’s airwaves fights show lax management by the Trump administration, leaving cabinet officers to push their own airwaves priorities.“This is a result of running the administration as if it were an episode of ‘The Apprentice,’” said Harold Feld, senior vice president with the policy group Public Knowledge. “The federal agencies have just stopped cooperating.”Space Force Commander General John Raymond said in a May 6 congressional hearing that Ligado Networks LLC’s plans for a mobile broadband network would interfere with GPS receivers, which rely on faint signals from satellites, and harm training.The FCC shot back that it wouldn’t be moved by “baseless fear mongering.”In a May 26 letter to Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Pai defended the Ligado decision, saying it “included strict conditions to ensure that GPS operations continue to be protected from harmful interference.”In a teleconference with lawmakers on May 19, Pai said “America needs to lead in 5G and that requires us to think creatively about a variety of different spectrum bands.”Changes keep coming. The FCC in April voted to allow Wi-Fi on the 6 gigahertz airwaves, despite an expression of concern from the Energy Department. Utilities said the change risks interference to electric, water, and gas transmission and distribution systems. Chipmaker Broadcom Inc. called the action “momentous” and “a definitive moment in U.S. wireless history.”Airwaves AuctionMobile providers will get more opportunities in an auction slated to begin in July. Another, potentially larger airwaves sale is to begin Dec. 8 as the FCC offers a wide swath of prime airwaves now used by satellite providers such as Intelsat SA and SES SA. The satellite providers will move aside, keeping enough frequencies to serve current customers; new users will offer mobile broadband.Bidders may include largest U.S. providers Verizon, AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., who all snapped up airwaves in earlier FCC auctions.“It isn’t easy to get the government to move quickly on anything,” Meredith Attwell Baker, president of CTIA, a wireless industry trade group with members including AT&T and Verizon, said in an email. Pai “deserves tremendous credit for making sure wireless providers have the spectrum they need to meet our nation’s 5G ambitions.”Not easy, and not without turmoil. The debate with NOAA concerned power levels for an airwaves swath that Verizon won in an FCC auction. The disagreement persisted for much of 2019 before agencies, working with the State Department, arrived at a unified position. The result was a lower power level than the FCC wanted, and more than NOAA preferred.Bipartisan leaders of both the House Science Committee and the Commerce Committee have asked the Government Accountability Office to probe how the NTIA and other federal agencies interact to resolve spectrum disputes.“‪Under the Trump administration, spectrum coordination efforts have repeatedly failed,” Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, the Commerce Committee chairman, said in an email.Representative Greg Walden, of Oregon, the Commerce Committee’s top Republican, in an email said that “not everyone will be satisfied all of the time” as spectrum allocations are made.Others see confusion.“In this administration, instead of having everyone pull in the same direction, we have disputes that are pulling us apart,” said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, the agency’s senior Democrat.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","FCC Chief Takes On the Pentagon...and DOT, and NOAA, and Energy"

2020-06-09,"Shares of T-Mobile US Inc.  are off 1.4% in premarket trading Tuesday after Guggenheim analyst Mike McCormack downgraded the stock to neutral from buy. He wrote that the pandemic will likely contribute to a ""tough subscriber quarter"" for T-Mobile as the company has benefitted from industry churn in the past but store closures have limited people's ability and willingness to switch between phone carriers. He views T-Mobile's postpaid subscriber outlook as conservative nonetheless, but he argued that there are a number of unknowns, including how subscriber counts will change due to the merger with Sprint and Sprint's sale of its Boost prepaid business to Dish Network Corp. . ""It is clear to us that the Street is already baking in significant synergy benefits, but discounting the risks that lie ahead,"" McCormack wrote.

2020-06-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Fifth-generation networking hype has been in full force since Qualcomm Inc. declared “5G is here, and it’s time to celebrate” in February of last year. The reality, however, has required patience from consumers due to the time needed to roll out the new networks and the dearth of applications to put additional speed to compelling use.A year after South Korea launched the world’s first full commercial 5G network and months after China opened the world’s biggest, Bloomberg News reporters tested the leading carriers in both countries to see how far 5G has gotten. Tests in Hong Kong and Tokyo showed similar results -- gaps in coverage that could leave most early adopters waiting for networks to reach full speed.Smartphone makers have swept in with a flood of 5G devices this year, with Samsung Electronics Co., Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. all pushing the new technology without asking for much higher prices or design compromises. Millions of 5G phones have already been sold, and for the billions of people not yet on the bandwagon, the new wireless standard will soon be the default option anyway.Carriers aren’t moving quite as fast. They’re investing billions of dollars to set up and expand their 5G networks, but the technical design of this new standard demands high network density to provide the advertised stratospheric speeds. Once they have enough masts in place, they aim to recoup the initial costs by offering more bandwidth-hungry add-ons, such as Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service, which SoftBank Corp. launched in Japan on June 10.Where it’s available, even without hitting its max theoretical speeds, 5G is an impressive upgrade for most consumer applications. For example, at a gigabit per second (1Gbps), a user could download a 9-hour audiobook in less than 1 second, according to Fastmetrics, a U.S.-based internet service provider. Even at 1/10 of that speed, 100 megabits per second, a 45-minute TV show takes only 16 seconds, Fastmetrics estimates.Carriers in North America, Europe and Australia have also set up 5G, with so far underwhelming results for consumers. In March tests conducted by RootMetrics in the U.S., the choice appeared to be between fast speed with negligible availability -- Verizon Wireless Inc. recorded a max speed of 846Mbps with 3.1% availability in Chicago -- or wider availability without much of a speed bump -- T-Mobile US Inc. covered 57% of Washington but at a less impressive 148Mbps.While 5G uptake has been incremental, companies that make parts for the phones are betting on a wave of upgrades to drive smartphone demand and help spur economies from Taiwan to South Korea.Read more: 5G Report Card: T-Mobile Has Widest Coverage, Verizon Is FastestTo test download speeds and coverage, we sent four reporters out into Seoul, Beijing, Tokyo and Hong Kong with 5G phones and speed-measuring apps. Here’s what those tests showed:SeoulKT, the No. 2 South Korean carrier, has improved 5G service since the commercial debut in April 2019, though it still lacks the high-frequency airwaves necessary to reach top download speeds in the range of 20Gbps. SK Telecom Co., the country’s largest carrier, achieves a download speed of 1.5Gbps inside its headquarters, which drops to 1Gbps in the same building’s lobby.KT’s average 5G data speed ranges between 800Mbps to 1Gbps, the company said in an email. “It is hard to simply compare data speeds in South Korea, which has nationwide services, with other countries that only have test services or have services in a few cities,” the company said.BeijingIn Beijing, tests using a Huawei P40 Pro phone showed 5G service was consistent enough to play high-definition (1080p) video while riding in a car. There was no 5G signal inside the subway and the shopping mall in Guomao, where luxury brands from Tiffany to Vacheron Constantin are sold. Most of the Zhongnanhai district, home of the central government, has no 5G coverage, according to a map provided by China Mobile.A China Mobile representative in Beijing emailed a video showing download speed exceeding 1.1Gbps at Beijing Daxing International Airport. The representative had no further comment.Hong KongTests using a Huawei P40 Pro showed streaming of high-resolution 4K video was smooth outdoors even in a moving vehicle. The fastest download speed was recorded in the carrier’s flagship store in the city’s central business district.The carrier expects its 5G network to “penetrate deeply” in Hong Kong, Alex Cheng, China Mobile principal engineer, said in an email.TokyoAt two locations in the city, the 5G signal was strong inside the Docomo shop but became unstable a short distance away from it, using a Samsung Galaxy S20 phone and Netflix’s speed test app. Both of Tokyo’s main airports, two Olympics facilities and Tokyo Sky Tree are among the covered spots. Two more waves of 5G network expansion are planned by the end of July and end of October, the carrier said.“The initial rollout is going as planned,” Docomo said in an email.(Adds that anticipated 5G smartphone demand is driving chipmakers in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",We Tested 5G Networks Across Asian Cities.

2020-06-15,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. said it is considering the sale of its T-Mobile US Inc. shares, confirming reports the Japanese company is nearing such a deal as part of its effort to sell about $41 billion in assets.SoftBank said it may sell some of its stake through private placements or public offerings, adding that there is no assurance a final deal will be reached. T-Mobile also confirmed SoftBank’s plan and wasn’t specific about the details, saying that SoftBank was exploring “one or more monetization transactions” involving the wireless carrier’s stock. People familiar with the matter said last month that SoftBank was closing in on an agreement to sell about $20 billion of its stock in T-Mobile, part of efforts to raise capital after record losses in its investment business.“These transactions may include one or more of: private placements or public offerings; privately negotiated transactions with T-Mobile or one or more stockholders of T-Mobile, including Deutsche Telekom, or third parties,” T-Mobile said Monday in a regulatory filing.SoftBank, which owns about 25% of T-Mobile US, is expected to sell a slice of that holding to Deutsche Telekom AG, giving the German co-owner a majority stake. SoftBank would then sell shares in a secondary offering to other investors and retain a smaller stake itself, a person familiar with the deliberations said previously.SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son acquired the stake in T-Mobile earlier this year, when U.S. regulators approved the sale of his Sprint Corp. to its wireless rival.He is currently selling tens of billions of dollars in assets to raise cash so he can buy back shares and pay down debt.

2020-06-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The T-Mobile US Inc. network went down for about 13 hours beginning Monday afternoon, and it wasn’t until almost a full day later that the company explained why. The interim provided plenty of time for baseless rampant speculation of a cyber attack — on a nation that’s already on edge — without any official source acting to dispel it. The series of events points to continued shortcomings by the industry and the Federal Communications Commission in providing reliable data, transparency and sufficient oversight when it comes to the health of America’s networks.Internet and phone connectivity has never been more important than it’s been in the last three months, with many Americans still working from home and social distancing to stem the spread of Covid-19, and yet so little information is ever disseminated about the status of the country’s networks. Helpful third-party websites track things like internet speeds around the U.S., but they all use different methodologies and there isn’t any official authority for such data — not even at the FCC. It’s often left up to the network operators to decide when and what to disclose publicly.T-Mobile is known for having a highly active Twitter presence and for communicating directly with customers in a way that most other companies don’t. That culture, which has earned it high regard with consumers, was created by former CEO John Legere, who stepped down in April as T-Mobile completed its acquisition of Sprint Corp. But when it came to Monday’s technological difficulties, which began just after noon New York time, the company was initially vague. Later that day, Neville Ray, T-Mobile’s president of technology, tweeted only that “engineers are working to resolve a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country.” Meanwhile, confused subscribers took to social media to complain about issues making and receiving calls and texts, including some AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. users who mistakenly thought the connection issues were on their end. Because sites like DownDetector.com scrape Twitter for these types of reports, it wasn’t long before a scary-looking map of a mass internet outage was circulating online, suggesting that it wasn’t just a T-Mobile problem. The map helped to inadvertently fuel false theories about a giant cyber attack on U.S. tech institutions broadly. And by Monday evening, Instagram feeds — where many young people get their news — were riddled with posts like this from meme accounts spreading misinformation:In a post to the news section of its website at around 9:30 p.m. New York time on Tuesday, T-Mobile explained that there was a circuit failure at one of its third-party fiber providers in the Southeast and that backup efforts failed, overloading the network. The situation “was then compounded by other factors,” Ray wrote. “Our engineers worked through the night to understand the root cause of yesterday’s issues, address it and prevent it from happening again.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai tweeted that the outage was “unacceptable” and that he’s “demanding answers,” vowing to launch an investigation into the matter.In some ways, it’s too little, too late, and that’s partly a result of Pai’s generally hands-off approach to regulation that entails asking questions later and giving slaps on the wrists after companies trip up. That can be seen in decisions such as repealing net neutrality — the concept of treating all web traffic equally — and, alongside Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s chief antitrust enforcer, approving T-Mobile’s takeover of Sprint with difficult-to-enforce concessions. It’s an administration that has prioritized the possibilities of faster 5G networks over the potential harm of market consolidation. It’s also been more concerned about content on the internet than the behavior of internet providers themselves, even though the whole of the U.S. economy is virtually dependent on their services.At the end of March and start of April, as the virus lockdowns were getting under way, Pai checked in with companies such as T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon and Comcast Corp. to see how their networks were holding up amid the sudden onslaught of demand. By March 21, BroadbandNow had found that 88 of the top 200 cities had “some degree of network degradation,” with places such as Austin, Texas, parts of California, Rochester, New York, and even Sprint’s home of Overland Park, Kansas, experiencing significant declines in internet speeds (they later improved). Still, the message from the carriers at the time was that everything’s all good, and Pai seemed comfortable taking their word for it, which he summarized in his own upbeat public statement.FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, an outspoken advocate for greater oversight of the telecommunications industry, has called for the agency to issue daily updates on network status amid the Covid-19 crisis, just as it would during a hurricane or other events that activate its Disaster Information Reporting System. “Getting a few reports using different methods from a handful of companies is useful, but it’s not enough,” Rosenworcel said in a statement in April responding to questions sent to her office.Things sometimes go wrong with technology, and that’s to be expected. But this week’s breakdown in communications — digital and verbal — shows why consumers would benefit from better industry oversight and a more formal system for reporting network failures with greater urgency and transparency.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-06-19,"Since completing its acquisition of Sprint on April 1, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock has been on fire.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com That's the way investment sites are spinning it. TMUS stock has broken out of its trading range and is at an all-time high.Things aren't that simple. It's true that T-Mobile shares are up 25%. But the average S&P 500 stock is up about 20.5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat seems to be happening is that T-Mobile's valuation is catching up to new peers, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). T-Mobile is also being bid up because it's a &quot;pure play&quot; in wireless, while its rivals have gone to the dog track. Verizon, recall, bought Yahoo and America Online. AT&T took even bigger plunges, buying DirecTv and Time Warner.Does that make T-Mobile a better stock pick? Today's T-MobileThe next few months may answer a question that has dogged me for some time. Should Verizon and AT&T have left well enough alone?T-Mobile is now part of a three-cornered duopoly that dominates America's wireless market. Each of the three has about one-third of all subscribers. As part of its acquisition, T-Mobile has to divest some assets that are supposed to make Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) a strong fourth player. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has also tried to sell plans, built on customer WiFi, as Xfinity Wireless. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is in the mix with its re-seller, Google Fi.But make no mistake. This is a shared monopoly. How can you tell? T-Mobile's once go-getter C-suite is emptying out like a Broadway theater after the curtain goes down. Former CEO John Legere has left the building. So have his chief lieutenants.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge Here is another tell. After promising it would add thousands of jobs if it won Sprint, T-Mobile is now cutting thousands of jobs. AT&T is doing the same thing. The T-Mobile layoffs are just more startling because they go against explicit pre-merger promises. Karl Bode, a long-time telecom analyst who predicted in February that layoffs were coming, has been proven right again. Buy Now?In normal times, wireless is a good business to be in. During the March quarter, for instance, T-Mobile brought 8.5% of its $11.1 billion in revenue to the net income line. That's $1.10 per share. With the layoffs, a dividend might be coming.There are also events putting pressure on the stock, making now a good time to consider a long-term investment.Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY), which was the controlling shareholder of Sprint, is looking to get out after its Vision Fund lost bagfuls of money backing such charmers as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and WeWork.Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS:DTEGY), which owns 43% of the new company, is currently able to vote Softbank's shares. It has a right of first refusal on the shares Softbank is selling, and is now negotiating a price to maintain control. Guggenheim recently downgraded TMUS stock to neutral, based partly on that selling pressure. The Bottom Line on TMUS StockYour best chance of getting into a pure wireless play may be now, as T-Mobile circles the wagons.The future looks promising. The company plans a fast build-out of its 600 MHz and 2.5 GHz spectrum for 5G service. T-Mobile now believes it could get up to 900,000 new postpaid subscriptions from the merger, six times its earlier projection. It's kicking Boost Mobile, the re-sale unit that's due to go to DISH, and cutting its value. It's selling $4 billion of new debt to make sure it has cash to execute its plans.All this while a leased fiber circuit failure resulted in a catastrophic network cascade June 15, after back-ups also failed. That puts even more pressure on TMUS stock. The current quarter, to be reported Aug. 5, may also be pressured by the pandemic.Yet the shares are rising. Some smart money is piling in.

2020-06-19,"So far in 2020, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock is up over 15%. Yet that number tells only half the story. On March 18, NOK stock hit a 52-week low of $2.34. Now, it is hovering at $4.3. Put another way, if you were brave enough to invest $1,000 in the shares in late March, your investment would have gove over $1,800.Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com Many investors are now wondering if they should chase the recent move up in the group. Therefore today, I'll take a closer look at whether Nokia stock should belong in a long-term portfolio.In the coming days, short-term profit-taking will likely push the stock toward or even $4. In case of such a potential price decline, market participants with a 2-3 year time horizon may consider investing in the Finnish technology group in the long run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nokia Stock May Become a 5G WinnerMany InvestorPlace readers will be familiar with how Finland-based company could not compete against the iPhone iOS and Android in the last decade. In the late 1990s, Nokia was the biggest phone manufacturer in the world. Yet, the company became a laggard in the transition to the smartphone market.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge In 2013, Nokia sold its mobile business to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Since then, it has been redefined itself as a networking company, and more recently, a 5G-equipment company.The group now divides revenue in four segments:  * Networks (around 77% of revenue)  * Software (around 12% of revenue)  * Technologies (around 7% of revenue)  * Group common and other (around 4% of revenue)Management is quite optimistic that going forward, 5G technology will likely drive Nokia's growth. Yet in 2019, Nokia stock price suffered from slower-than-expected 5G equipment sales. Nokia stock started 2019 at about $6 and finished shy of $4, losing over 35%.Although earnings in 2020 have not necessarily been cheerful, there has been an improvement over 2019. First-quarter results showed revenue of 5.36 billion euros. At the same time last year, revenue had been 5 billion euros. The reported loss came at €100 million compared with a loss of €442 million in Q1 2019.The year-over-year improvement was primarily thanks to higher gross profit in networks and software segments as well as cost savings.Nokia's P/S ratio currently stands at 0.93. The metric puts the company at a favorable long-term position from a risk/return perspective. Coupled with the 5G growth prospects, it also gives long-term investors reasonable hope that the stock does not have to be mired in single-digit status forever. Who Are Nokia's Customers?The group sells hardware to wireless carriers and licenses its patents to handset and chipset vendors. Its most valuable customers are communication service providers globally.In 2019, Nokia signed several vital deals with major providers across the globe to introduce 5G networks in various countries, including Austria, Egypt, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Switzerland.Also stateside, it has been in partnership with Sprint, which has now fully merged with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), which is currently expanding its 5G reach, too. Network equipment by Nokia, as well as by Sweden-based Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), is used widely in the U.S. market.In recent days, Nokia also won two separate contracts with China-headquartered Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Meanwhile, as we discuss the potential for growth in 5G for companies like Nokia, we'd need to pay attention to Chinese telecom giant Huawei, too.It is is the world's number one telecom supplier and number two phone manufacturer. The company started making headlines as it got caught in the trade war between the U.S. and China.At present Huawei's future in North America and Europe is not clear. In recent weeks, the U.K. has joined other western governments to announce that it will likely restrict access to Huawei. Therefore many analysts agree that Nokia can win more 5G contracts in these jurisdictions. And that would support Nokia stock in the new decade. Profit-Taking Could Derail NOK Stock in the Short RunIn early Jan. 2020, Nokia stock was hovering around $3.8. Then came the sell off in early 2020, which took the price down to $2.34. And since then shares are up about 85%. As I write, they are $4.3.Stockholders are understandably wondering if the share price can soon go back to January 2019 levels of about $6. However, as we get ready to finish the first half of the year, profit-taking may hit Nokia stock.In recent days, volatility has come back to the markets. The recent rally we've witnessed in broader markets, especially in tech stocks, for the most part, reflects the belief in a V-shaped recovery for our economy.However, if there were an upcoming change in investor sentiment on the rebound's prospects, then these stock valuations would come down fast, and tech stocks like Nokia would likely be hit the hardest.Are you an investor that also pays attention to technical charts? Then you may want to know that NOK shares have become overbought. Although a stock can stay overbought for quite some time, it is likely that some investors will soon hit the sell button in Nokia stock.In the coming weeks, a pull toward $4 or even below is likely. But such a drop would also give long-term investors a better entry into NOK shares. The Bottom Line on Nokia StockHave you been able to ride the recent wave up in Nokia stock? Then you may want to realize some of your paper profits. And if you believe that the share price may have become overvalued for now, you may want to look for opportunities in other reliable names in the market.Potential investors may consider investing in the Finnish technology group for the long run in case of a potential price decline in NOK shares.Tezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education, including a Ph.D. in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

2020-06-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. unloads about 200 million shares of T-Mobile US Inc., more investors get a chance to own a top-performing stock that had been hogged by insiders. SoftBank’s fire sale isn’t a knock on T-Mobile, but rather a reluctant move by billionaire Masayoshi Son to shore up his own troubled conglomerate. Indeed, his loss will be someone else’s gain. Son took control of Sprint Corp. in 2013 and then spent years pursuing a merger between the beleaguered wireless carrier and its stronger rival, T-Mobile. He finally got his way thanks to the Trump administration’s lax regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission. Their focus on America’s standing in the so-called race to 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity, overshadowed the antitrust concerns. Sprint officially became part of T-Mobile in April, handing SoftBank ownership of about 25% of the combined company; another 44% is owned by Deutsche Telekom AG. Until this week, that left only a small public float for a stock that’s long been the envy of its industry — and will likely continue to be.After the implosion of office-space rental company WeWork Cos. and the Covid-19 pandemic, SoftBank suffered record losses from its investments and is in need of cash. In turn, the company is undertaking a series of complex transactions to exit most of its T-Mobile stake, generating about $20 billion in proceeds. The deal involves a public equity offering, a rights offering to existing shareholders, a private trust vehicle and a call option for Deutsche Telekom to increase its ownership of T-Mobile down the road when its own balance sheet is in better shape. The transactions are structured so that even though more T-Mobile shares will be available to the public, the total number of shares outstanding won’t change. T-Mobile also gets $300 million for playing banker. T-Mobile’s stock price closed at an all-time high of $107.16 on Tuesday. After the market closed, the shares SoftBank is selling priced at $103 apiece, according to a CNBC report.T-Mobile’s subscriber base, revenue and stock price are all expected to continue growing for the foreseeable future at a faster clip than that of its two larger rivals, Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. Its consumer appeal comes from offering cheaper data plans on a network that has improved tremendously over the years, as well as a friendlier customer-service experience. Led by a larger-than-life CEO whose magenta wardrobe made him a walking T-Mobile billboard, the company was able to distinguish itself over time as a fun brand in an otherwise drab industry. That CEO, John Legere, left after sealing the Sprint deal and was replaced by Mike Sievert. The SoftBank share sale is also a farewell performance for Braxton Carter, T-Mobile’s pink cowboy hat-wearing chief financial officer, who retires next week. The Sprint merger fundamentally changed the industry by eliminating a low-cost rival that T-Mobile competed with most. T-Mobile’s own porting ratios, a measure of how many customers one carrier steals from another, showed that it was consistently taking a bigger bite out of Sprint’s subscriber base than either Verizon or AT&T’s. Now that the deal is done, T-Mobile would seem to have two options: 1) Given that there’s so much extra capacity on its network to handle more subscribers, it could cut prices even more. That would supercharge its own growth while putting pressure on AT&T and Verizon. 2) Instead, T-Mobile could keep prices flat or even raise them to improve profit margins more immediately, leaving competition more stagnant. The latter option is the less innovative, less consumer-friendly route that was feared by opponents of the Sprint takeover. (T-Mobile’s 13-hour outage on its network last week also doesn’t help to quell the fear that the industry is insufficiently regulated.) Here’s how different T-Mobile’s profitability might look if it were to adopt AT&T’s pricing:In either case, it may be a win-win for investors. T-Mobile executives predict that it will save more than $40 billion in costs due to the Sprint deal, much of which will come from job cuts and shutting stores in overlapping locations (another reason the transaction was criticized). Wireless carriers also rely on costly ad campaigns to promote their networks. The combined T-Mobile-Sprint will now be able to save about $700 million a year just from lower advertising expenses, according to a report earlier this month by Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst for New Street Research.Chaplin expects T-Mobile to pursue the less aggressive avenue of growth, but even then he sees its stock price doubling over the next three to five years. Analysts are generally less optimistic about AT&T and Verizon, as one undergoes a difficult transformation into a communications and entertainment colossus, while the other remains almost singularly focused on 5G with a less-than-ideal set of wireless spectrum. After buying Sprint, T-Mobile’s future looks to be either grow fast or grow faster. Still, this week’s news shows that for a merger pumped up on American 5G zeal and patriotism, the biggest beneficiary just might be a Japanese billionaire short on cash.(Adds pricing information in the fourth paragraph.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son ended his company’s annual shareholder meeting with a surprise Thursday by announcing he’s stepping down from the board of Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.The billionaire said his departure shouldn’t be interpreted as signifying any disagreements, even though Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma is quitting SoftBank’s board at the same time. Ma and Son have maintained a close friendship since the Japanese entrepreneur was an early investor in Alibaba and helped it along to its current value of roughly $600 billion, calling it the crown jewel of SoftBank’s portfolio.“It’s not like we had a fight,” Son said during the virtual shareholder meeting. “This was perfectly amicable.”While the mutual departures are unlikely to have an immediate impact on either company, they mark the end of an era. The two men are among the most successful entrepreneurs of their generation and have been able to rely on each other’s advice for decades. Son was on Alibaba’s board as it went public in 2014 in the largest initial public offering in history. When SoftBank ran into trouble with investment losses this year, Son was able to use his Alibaba stake to raise much-needed capital.Read more: Alibaba Co-Founder Jack Ma to Quit SoftBank’s Board in June“The joint board membership was a big positive for both companies because it gave them a way to benchmark their respective business models,” said Michiaki Tanaka, a business school professor at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. “Not having that board-level contact is a big loss.”Alibaba remains Son’s most successful investment by far and SoftBank’s most valuable asset. In early 2000, Son invested $20 million into the then-unknown web portal connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, a stake that is now worth more than $150 billion. That spectacular return cemented his reputation as an investor and later helped him raise the $100 billion Vision Fund. Son has previously spoken highly of Ma.“He had no business plan, zero revenue,” Son said about Ma on The David Rubenstein Show. “But his eyes were very strong. I could tell from the way he talked, he has charisma, he has leadership.”Son is known for anointing the entrepreneurs he finds particularly promising as “the next Jack Ma,” and Alibaba has long served as the standard against which he has judged SoftBank’s other startup investments. But that’s also made Son vulnerable to charismatic founders like WeWork’s Adam Neumann, whose many governance transgressions led to the office-sharing firm canceling its initial public offering last year. WeWork, once thought to be worth $47 billion, has lost more than 90% of its value.Son’s recent track record has been spotty. Starting with the WeWork fiasco, he has suffered a string of setbacks at portfolio companies including Wag Labs, Zume Pizza and Brandless Inc. SoftBank lost almost $18 billion writing down the value of its startup companies in the last fiscal year.Still, Son struck an optimistic note at the shareholder meeting Thursday.

2020-06-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s good that big brands like Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever NV are pulling ads from Facebook Inc.As my colleague Sarah Halzack has written, the way to make the adtech giant change its approach to tackling hate speech and misinformation is to target how it makes money. (A similar effort worked at Google’s YouTube unit.) But Mark Zuckerberg and co. will still make $77 billion this year from advertisers. If brands really believe in this crusade, they should get off Facebook entirely.On Thursday, Verizon became one of the biggest brands to announce it will pull ads from Facebook in July, joining the likes of Patagonia Inc. and Recreational Equipment Inc. in a month-long campaign called Stop Hate For Profit. The movement is being led by groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change, and is channeling momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement to realize real change. On Friday, Ben & Jerry’s, Hellman’s and Dove parent Unilever announced it would halt ads on Facebook and Twitter Inc. in the U.S. for the rest of 2020.It’s a commendable effort to force Facebook to remodel its practices, but there’s a business incentive too: An ad appearing alongside a conspiracy theory is not a good look, particularly if a slice of the revenue goes to the maker of the video. A group of brands with a combined advertising budget of $97 billion is already pushing for better controls. More of them should follow Verizon’s lead, not least the handful of other telecoms operators in the U.S.Arguably, the main reason Verizon even needs to advertise on Facebook is because its rivals AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile U.S. Inc. are both doing so too. Since competitive intensity has been significantly reduced by pandemic lockdowns, now seems a particularly good time for mobile operators to cut marketing spend.If firms are serious about upping the pressure on Zuckerberg, however, they should abandon their presence on the social network completely by deleting their Facebook pages. That might seem like a brand cutting off its nose to spite its face, but as long as it has a Facebook page, then the advertising boycott looks like an empty threat.That’s because the ad spend will ultimately return after the boycott. There’s little point in maintaining a corporate Facebook presence without paying to promote content, due to the limitations of what’s known as organic reach, or how many users see a post without a company or individual paying to get it in front of them. Without paid promotion, just 1% of a page’s followers are likely to see a given post, according to digital agency Jellyfish. It wasn’t always this way. In the early days, Facebook lured brands by showing how many customers they could reach by setting up a page. Then the Menlo Park, California-based firm changed its algorithm so that very few people would see a company’s posts if it didn’t pay for promotion. It was the classic Silicon Valley bait-and-switch. UniCredit SpA, Italy’s biggest bank, bit the bullet and ditched its Facebook presence a year ago. It had already stopped paying for Facebook ads, which meant that very few of the 546,000 followers of its UniCredit Italia page actually saw its content — perhaps just 5,500. Its resolve is so far holding: It hasn’t returned to the social network yet.Being on Facebook can also present more of a risk than an opportunity, especially for an incumbent brand like a bank or telecoms giant. UniCredit’s followers probably represented a significant cross-section of its consumer banking customers, which therefore served as a handy list of people for challenger banks like N26 or Revolut to target with ads and try to steal away. Plus, if a company has a Facebook page, it still has to regularly post new content and interact with customers — both of which cost money. If it doesn’t, the page will likely fill up with customer complaints, which would show up at the top of online search results. The business reasons for big-spending incumbents to leave Facebook might be almost as good as the ethical ones.Zuckerberg needs financial incentives to be more proactive about managing content effectively, partially because his lodestar has long been user engagement. And more polarizing content drives more user engagement. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that a report commissioned by Facebook in 2018 found the platform often did aggravate polarization and tribal behavior, yet the firm decided not to tackle the issue.Regulating content directly often means impinging on thorny free speech issues. It’s a troublesome affair. Far better to find market-based, commercial incentives that mean the issue must be taken seriously. Will enough brands use these to make a meaningful difference? Probably not, but they have the opportunity to give Facebook the firmer poke it needs.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-07-03,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. shares just reached a new high this year, propelled by a series of buybacks that have seen the stock recoup the losses suffered during the coronavirus market rout.The stock rose 2.6% on Friday to 5,778 yen ($54), the highest since July 2019. That’s more than double the level of a March low.The recovery is something of a vindication for CEO Masayoshi Son, who unveiled plans to sell 4.5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and bankroll record share buybacks. Son has frequently complained that SoftBank’s shares, even at their peak, trade at less than the value of its portfolio of investments.SoftBank has also had a series of wins over the same period, finally solving the puzzle of Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile Inc. with their merger completed in April, and seeing a welcome return to successful investment bets as online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc. surged as much as 86% in its U.S. IPO. Thursday.“The steps being taken to improve its balance sheet, such as repurchase of its debt, are being recognized,” said Tomoaki Kawasaki, a senior analyst at Iwaicosmo Securities Co.SoftBank shares have had a volatile run over the past year as portfolio companies such as WeWork ran into trouble and the coronavirus hammered many of its businesses. That triggered a record 1.36 trillion yen operating loss for the last fiscal year. Optimists believe the worst is over for the company.“After the trillion-yen level writedowns last quarter, it’s not possible that it’ll be worse than that,” said Kawasaki.Citigroup Global Markets analyst Mitsunobu Tsuruo raised his price target for the stock by 100 yen to 7,200 yen on Wednesday, lifting his expectations for the company’s forthcoming first-quarter earnings and noting that there is “still plenty of room for the shares to advance” given the buybacks and steps to clean up its balance sheet.SoftBank has already repurchased 500 billion yen of shares based on a resolution adopted March 13, separate to its 2 trillion yen pledge. Under that larger program, it has already formally announced plans to buy 1 trillion yen of buybacks through next March, with Son indicating he hoped to carry out the full amount. Investors can “feel confident” in buying and holding SoftBank shares until the buybacks are 90% done, according to Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. Whether the shares can continue their increase depends on future catalysts, Iwaicosmo’s Kawasaki said.“The shares will need another catalyst that boosts shareholder value, such as the second Vision Fund,” he added.Son said in May that SoftBank will use its own cash for the second Vision Fund for now, until an improved investment performance attracts outside partners.(Adds Jefferies comment in fourth-last paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Stock Bounces to 2020 Peak as Buyers Look Beyond WeWork

2020-07-05,"Up, up and away they go. Kicking off the second half of the year with a bang, the S&P 500 followed up its best quarter in over 20 years by extending its winning streak to four sessions. That said, given the current climate of uncertainty, predicting what the remainder of 2020 holds can feel like a guessing game.  So, maybe it’s time to look at what the insiders are doing. Company owners, presidents and other officers, board members – have a direct line to information that the rest of us don’t usually see. Their positions put them in place to know what is about to impact their companies, and they have access to better legal and regulatory advice than the general public. It’s only natural – and very human – for them to use this information in their personal trading activities. To keep the playing field a bit more level, these people in the know are required to disclose their inside trades quarterly. TipRanks collects that insider trading data, and puts it in the context of the larger markets. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool lets you follow the insiders, sorting the data by stock or by trading strategy. It’s a smart way to get an inside track, and to demonstrate, we’ve picked three stocks that have recently skewed strongly positive on the strength of insider trades. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) The first stock is a company you know. T-Mobile is the country’s third largest wireless carrier, by customer base, and the company started Q2 by taking ownership of competitor Sprint. This past quarter marked the first full quarter of activity by the combined entity, and TMUS shares rose an impressive 24% during the period. Along with strong share appreciation in Q1, TMUS posted unexpectedly solid earnings. The earnings, reported back in May, showed EPS coming in at $1.23, which beat the forecast by 23%. Looking forward, T-Mobile has strong prospects for growth due to its commitment to increasing 5G coverage. As part of the Sprint merger, the company had to commit to expanding rural coverage and making 5G service available to 97% of the US population within three years. In the wake of the successful Sprint merger, TMUS has seen a major insider buy. The purchase, by Director Ronald Fisher, was for 350,000 shares, for which he shelled out more than $36 million. It was a big move, and it swung the insider sentiment on the stock deep into positive territory. Writing on T-Mobile and its prospects, 5-star analyst from Wells Fargo, Jennifer Fritzsche, says, “…in our view the true value of Sprint’s platform is access to greater scale and a deeper spectrum portfolio. With the combined Sprint asset mix, we believe TMUS has a 1-2 year head start for 5G relative to its peers. And despite the recent outperformance, we believe the valuation is more than justified considering the significant growth opportunity ahead to expand margins and grow market share.” To this end, Fritzsche rates the stock a Buy, and her new $120 price target, up from $110, indicates a potential for 13% upside growth in the coming year. (To watch Fritzsche’s track record, click here) Do other analysts agree with Fritzsche? As it turns out, most do. With 10 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that TMUS is a Strong Buy. Its recent share appreciation has pushed the stock price close to the average price target in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $106.01, and the average price target of $111.61 implies room for another 5% growth this year. (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks) Arcimoto, Inc. (FUV) The next company on our list, Arcimoto, is an Oregon-based ‘green economy’ player. Arcimoto has developed, and is marketing, a series of low-weight, high-efficiency electric vehicles. The company’s name for the line, Fun Electric Vehicle, is also the source of its stock ticker, FUV. Over the past year, Arcimoto has expanded its EV designs to include delivery vehicles and rental fleet options. The company was forced to suspend manufacturing operations during the coronavirus crisis, but has since reopened its assembly facilities.  In a move to raise capital and expedite recovery from the pandemic’s impact, Arcimoto put 1.7 million shares of common stock on the market at the end of June. The move grossed $8.5 million, the proceeds of which will be used for general working capital, including acceleration of manufacture and delivery of pre-ordered vehicles. The offering was an opportunity for insiders, as well as the public, and three company officers made significant purchases in recent days. Mark Frohnmayer, company President, bought 78,531 shares for an estimated $334,000, and two board members, Jesse Grant Eisler and Joshua Scherer, also made six-figure purchases. These were informative buys, the first in a year, and have moved the company’s insider sentiment far more positive than its sector average. Amit Dayal, 4-star analyst with H.C. Wainwright, is bullish on Arcimoto, rating the stock a Buy and writing, “We once again reiterate the 'multiple shots on goal' aspect of the company's market positioning, where one vehicle platform has the flexibility to serve multiple applications and markets. Accordingly, pushouts in vacation oriented sales should, in our opinion, be compensated with pickup in delivery applications... The company's cash burn was lowered during the lockdown but should be expected to ramp with production picking up.” Dayal’s $7 price target suggests that FUV has room for 3% growth over the next 12 months. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here) Recent share appreciation – the stock rose an eye-opening 378% in Q2 – has pushed FUV above the average price target, too fast for most analysts to adjust their outlooks. Shares are currently selling for $6.82, so the $5.38 average price target puts the downside potential at 21%. The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is unanimous, based on 4 recent positive reviews. (See Arcimoto stock analysis on TipRanks) Principal Financial (PFG) Last on our list is Iowa-based Principal Financial Group, an $11 billion asset management and insurance company. PFG shares are still down 26% year-to-date, having only partially recovered from losses in February and March. One thing the ‘corona quarter’ could not do was derail the company’s dividend. PFG paid out a generous sum in both Q1 and Q2, giving an annualized payment of $2.18 per share and an impressive yield of 5.4%.  There has been one recent informative insider purchase of this stock in recent weeks. Board member Daniel Gelatt bought a block of 28,148 shares, paying a disclosed $999,823. His move pushed overall insider sentiment on PFG into positive territory, just above the sector average. Piper Sandler analyst John Barnidge covers this stock, and points out that PFG has so far managed to avoid a direct blow to its insurance operations from the COVID-19 epidemic – and in a curious way, its vision and dental policies have brought a benefit to the company. Barnidge writes, “As of 1Q20, the company has not yet experienced any known CV19 deaths in its life insurance products and only a limited amount of claims on benefit products, primarily short-term disability. PFG continues to benefit from dental & vision claim tailwinds from a lack of ability to make appointments… PFG could potentially see more of a benefit from a lack of claims in dental & vision than actual direct impact from CV19 claims.” Barnidge’s Buy rating on the stock is supported by his $43 price target, suggesting a one-year upside potential of 5%. (To watch Barnidge’s track record, click here) While Barnidge is bullish, Wall Street is still cautious here. The analyst consensus rating on PFG is a Hold, based on 7 reviews. The reviews break down as 2 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. Shares are currently priced at $40.79, and the average price target of $43.57 implies a modest 7% upside potential.

2020-07-07,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. shares touched their highest level in two decades as a series of buybacks helped the stock recoup losses suffered during the coronavirus market rout.The stock rose 4.6% to 6,190 yen ($58) on Tuesday, the highest since March 2000. That’s more than double the level in mid-March, which marked the virus-impacted low point for the company, whose market value has since surged by roughly $68 billion. The benchmark Topix index was little changed on the day.SoftBank’s recovery is something of a vindication for founder Masayoshi Son, who unveiled plans to sell 4.5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and bankroll record share buybacks. Son has frequently complained that SoftBank’s shares, even at their peak, have traded at less than the value of its portfolio of investments. Even after the recent gains, the stock still trades at a discount of about 50%, according to company’s own calculations.“It’s safe to assume part of today’s strong move was a result of buyback activity,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “A more positive global sentiment around tech also helped.”SoftBank has also had a series of wins over the same period, including merging its Sprint Corp. with T-Mobile US Inc. and seeing some bets pay off. Online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc. surged as much as 86% in its U.S. initial public offering Thursday.SoftBank’s Vision Fund, with close to 90 companies in its portfolio, lost almost $18 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31, as it wrote down the value of investments in WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc., among others. Son himself has said he expects about 15 of the fund’s startups to go bankrupt while predicting another 15 will thrive.“SoftBank’s business model has evolved over the past 20 years to match the times, from software to wireless service and now to an investment fund,” said Naoki Fujiwara, chief fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co. “The way the coronavirus is reshaping our society, the winners will be communications infrastructure, networks and AI -- all businesses that SoftBank invests in.”(Updates with closing shares in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Hits 20-Year High With $68 Billion Climb Out of Nadir

2020-07-10,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son has enjoyed a $12 billion renaissance the past three months, easing the pressure on his intricately engineered personal finances.With SoftBank Group’s shares surging to their highest price in two decades on Thursday, Son’s net worth hit $20 billion, more than doubling from $8.4 billion in March, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It is the first time the 62-year-old’s fortune has topped $20 billion since January 2013, when the ranking first started tracking his wealth.The calculation excludes about $13.3 billion of his SoftBank Group shares pledged as collateral, representing some 40% of his stake, according to regulatory filings. A further 26% of his holding is lent out for a fee to different entities, mostly brokerages, likely to add liquidity to the market. Those shares are included in Son’s net worth calculation because he retains control over them.“For those lending shares, it’s about creating incremental revenue,” said Andrew Dyson, chief executive officer of the International Securities Lending Association. He noted such transactions ease the execution of trades, while enabling hedging and shorting strategies. “Lending out securities generates hundreds of millions of dollars in fees a quarter.”SoftBank Group shares have surged 133% from a low in March, taking the Tokyo-based company’s market value to $123 billion. While its Vision Fund lost almost $18 billion in the latest fiscal year as it wrote down the value of investments in WeWork, Uber Technologies Inc. and others, record equity buybacks and a series of wins have helped the stock recover. SoftBank Group sold part of its stake in T-Mobile US Inc. last month, and an online home-insurance provider that it’s backing more than doubled on its U.S. debut earlier in July.While Son’s strategies are common among the wealthy, market volatility earlier this year showed that personal stock pledges, coupled with a heavy debt load, can bring risks. The pandemic-induced turmoil that sank equities resulted in some margin calls. Some individuals had to stump up collateral to avoid defaulting, and others had to liquidate at depressed prices. Chinese mogul Lu Zhengyao and Markus Braun of German fintech company Wirecard AG offer extreme examples of the risks of pledging shares.Even stock lending worries some. Japan’s largest pension fund said in December it would stop the practice because it creates a vacuum in ownership when equities change hands.SoftBank Group’s buoyant share price means such risks are remote for now. Son’s pledged stock is valued at almost triple the loan amount he said in a May earnings presentation he has received, according to calculations by Bloomberg.SoftBank Group declined to comment on Son’s personal finances.(Updates stock move and market cap in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","With SoftBank Rally, Masa Son Adds $12 Billion to Fortune"

2020-07-13,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank is exploring options for selling part or all of its stake in Arm Holdings Inc., either through a private deal or a public stock listing, according to people with knowledge of the matter.If it pursues a listing, the chip-design company could go public as soon as next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. That would accelerate a timeline SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son laid out in 2018, estimating an initial share sale for Arm some time around 2023, a goal repeated in October by Arm Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars.No decision has been made, and SoftBank could ultimately choose to hang onto the company, which is wholly owned by SoftBank Group and its Vision Fund. Son and his deputies began considering options in part because of the improving market for semiconductor companies, said two of the people. A deal would also fit into SoftBank’s current strategy to unload many of its holdings and boost the stock price through buybacks.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising on a potential deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported the news earlier Monday. Representatives for Arm, Goldman Sachs and SoftBank declined to comment.Arm was the U.K.’s largest listed technology company, receiving royalties from companies such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. for chip designs used in the world’s most popular mobile phones and tablets. When Son bought it for $32 billion in 2016, change came fast. The company added about 2,000 employees and made plans for a new 48 million pound ($60 million) U.K. office building.The chip designer is still currently valued by SoftBank at its acquisition price, according to the Japanese company’s latest quarterly filings. But semiconductor stocks have been on a tear. Nvidia Corp.’s market value topped Intel Corp.’s last week for the first time, powered by soaring demand for graphics chips in data centers and other fast-growing technology fields.Arm would need ample time to make preparations for a listing if it goes that route. Marcelo Claure, the chief operating officer at SoftBank, said in an interview with the Financial Times published Monday that he doesn’t expect Arm to be public in the next 12 months.If it pursues a listing, it’s unclear whether Arm would go public in the U.K. or the U.S., where it has been slowly shifting many of its key executives in recent years. If it does so in the U.K., the 25% free-float needed would make it one of the biggest tech IPOs in years.SoftBank’s shares have more than doubled from a low in March, taking the Tokyo-based company’s market value to $127 billion, with record equity buybacks and a series of wins helping the stock recover from setbacks in 2019 led by its investment in WeWork. SoftBank sold part of its stake in T-Mobile US Inc. last month, part of a broader $42 billion push to unload assets to finance stock buybacks and pay down debt.Arm, which is owned by SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund, is looking to cut costs and improve earnings, said one of the people familiar with the matter. The company lost 42.8 billion yen ($400 million) in the fiscal year that ended in March. It’s also planning to transfer its data and device-management business to parent SoftBank to focus on its main semiconductor operations. The Internet of Things Services Group was billed by Arm as a key initiative to expand into managing information from millions of new devices being connected to the internet.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Explores a Sale or IPO of Chip Company Arm

2020-07-17,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. quietly sold an additional $2.2 billion of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as part of the Japanese conglomerate’s fund-raising effort to pay down debt and buy back its own shares.The deal, which includes a collar contract and call spread, is expected to be settled between May 2024 and June 2024. The details were disclosed on page 276 of SoftBank’s year-end financial filing released on June 25, but have not been previously reported. A SoftBank Group spokesman confirmed the details of the sale.This step is the latest in an unwinding of a relationship between the two companies that spans two decades. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son was an early backer of Jack Ma’s Alibaba and the Chinese e-commerce giant remains his most successful investment by far. In early 2000, Son invested $20 million into the then-unknown web portal connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, a stake that is now worth more than $150 billion. Son and Ma stepped down from each other’s boards last month.The deal brings the total of Alibaba stock sold by the Tokyo-based company this year to $13.7 billion. SoftBank in May said that it entered into several prepaid forward contracts with banks in April and May using Alibaba shares to procure a total of $11.5 billion. That includes a $1.5 billion forward contract with settlement in April 2024, a $1.5 billion floor contract with settlement in Dec. 2023 and Jan. 2024, and a $8.5 billion collar contract with settlement from Jan. to Sept. 2022.SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen ($42 billion) of assets to bankroll stock buybacks and slash debt to reassure investors after a swoon in its shares earlier this year. In addition to Alibaba, the company is selling a stake in T-Mobile US Inc. for as much as $20 billion and stock in its domestic telecom unit.SoftBank shares have recovered as the company has sold assets and bought back stock. The stock has climbed about 140% from their low in March and hit the highest level in two decades this month.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Quietly Sells Another $2.2 Billion of Its Alibaba Stake

2020-07-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is moving into the new era of fast 5G wireless internet and the Muscatine Power & Water utility in Iowa wants to join the ride. So does the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative Inc. that serves Kaktovik and Atqasuk in remote northern Alaska.They are among more than 200 companies registered to bid in an unusual government auction set to begin July 23. At stake is potentially $10 billion worth of lucrative spectrum that can be used for wireless internet and is assigned by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission through competitive bidding.The number of registered bidders makes it one of the biggest auctions of its type in history. Combined with another sale scheduled for December, it represents a giant leap toward a future of super fast internet and connected cars, appliances and mobile devices.Past sales offered licenses covering entire metropolitan areas at prices that only wealthy corporations such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. could afford. This one offers smaller licenses -- seven in each county in the country for a total of 22,631.That means companies with modest finances -- such as Muscatine Power and the Alaskan co-op -- can get rights to spectrum in just their area. The FCC designed it that way to assure the next generation of wireless service isn’t limited to a handful of telecom behemoths, and to give companies with new uses for the technology a shot.“It’s really a game-changer for all of these non-traditional users,” said Kurt Schaubach, chief technology officer with Federated Wireless, a company based in Arlington, Virginia, that helps coordinate use of the airwaves being auctioned.It is the first offering by the FCC in recent years of airwaves suitable for the advanced 5G systems. Proceeds will go to the U.S. Treasury and estimates range to as much as $10 billion by Raymond James.“We’ve never had an auction of this size,” said Michael O’Rielly, an FCC commissioner who guided the auction’s design. In an interview he ticked off participants -- the big national wireless providers, cable companies “of all shapes and sizes,” electric utilities and companies beaming broadband over the air.The frequencies are in the so-called midband range of airwaves, where signals travel well and also can carry abundant data. Both features suit the 5G networks that will link billions of devices in automated factories, homes and elsewhere. Auction winners can only buy four of the seven licenses available in each county, ensuring that no single user can snap up all of an area’s airwaves. Each of the seven licenses provides rights to use the airwaves across an entire county.The Muscatine municipal utility, which offers internet service and runs an electrical grid and water system, could buy airwaves covering just Muscatine County, where there are fewer than 17,000 households.Utilities and electricity distributors could use their winnings to expand wireless broadband networks, manage electricity distribution, and install remote meter-reading.Tractor maker Deere & Co. is poised to take part. Its products include tractors and combines that link with mobile internet service.The airwaves can be used for more rural broadband coverage, enhancing what farmers can do in the field, and supporting manufacturing operations, said Jennifer Hartmann, a spokeswoman for Deere, which is based in Moline, Illinois.A cohort of petroleum companies and utilities have registered to bid.“Utilities for decades have struggled to acquire the amount of spectrum they need” because they lack the capital available to big telecom providers, said Rob Thormeyer, spokesman for the Utilities Technology Council that advocates for utilities’ communications systems.National mobile carriers enrolled in the sale including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. may be most interested in airwaves to supplement urban coverage.Largest U.S. cable providers Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. are also registered to bid. Each has seen a swell of subscribers who buy wireless service that rides on Verizon’s airwaves. If the cable providers can buy airwaves and set up nodes for their customers’ use, they could pay Verizon less.It’s the first big sally into airwaves auctions by cable companies in over a decade.“This is the only good 5G spectrum they could get their hands on for awhile,” said Gregory Williams, an analyst with Cowen & Co.The airwaves to be sold are in the so-called CBRS band. The acronym stands for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. It’s located in the 3.5 gigahertz band. The auction runs as long as bidders are competing, a process that typically takes weeks to unfold.An auction in December is expected to produce even higher bids for spectrum in the so-called C-Band. It will offer swathes of airwaves congenial to mobile broadband, and to allow higher power transmissions that can send signals farther.The FCC bars participants from publicly signaling bidding strategies, and many declined to discuss the sale. Verizon, Comcast, Charter, AT&T, the Muscatine utility and the Arctic Slope cooperative all declined to comment or didn’t respond to queries.A robust sale with high total bids would bode well for 5G auctions to follow, including the C-band sale on Dec. 8 of airwaves to be surrendered by satellite providers, said Harold Feld, senior vice president for the Washington-based policy group Public Knowledge.“We’re going to see how much are companies willing to pay for this kind of 5G spectrum,” Feld said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Giant Wireless Sale Offers 5G Spectrum Sliced Into 22,631 Pieces"

2020-07-20,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. hired Goldman Sachs to sell data-and-device-management unit Treasure Data and is seeking a price of about $1 billion, according to people familiar with the process.SoftBank earlier this month said it will separate the business from its chipmaking company Arm Ltd. While part of Arm, Treasure Data grew but required a level of investment that limited Arm’s ability to spend on its own growth initiatives.A $1 billion sale would be roughly 66% more than Arm paid for Treasure Data in 2018. SoftBank thinks that price is achievable, according to the people, who asked not to be identified speaking on a private deal process. SoftBank’s plans could change and it may still decide to keep the asset.SoftBank, led by billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, reported a record operating loss in May after writing down investments in companies such as WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. SoftBank stock plunged in March, but rebounded sharply after share repurchases and wins on other bets.

2020-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Arm Ltd., the chip designer that’s one of SoftBank Group Corp.’s most prized holdings, is attracting takeover interest from Nvidia Corp. in what could become the biggest-ever semiconductor deal, people with knowledge of the matter said.Nvidia, the world’s largest graphics chipmaker, made an approach in recent weeks about a potential deal for Cambridge, England-based Arm, according to the people. SoftBank has been exploring options to exit part or all of its stake in the business, which it acquired for $32 billion in 2016, Bloomberg News has reported.Other potential bidders could also emerge, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Nvidia’s interest may not lead to a deal, and SoftBank could opt to pursue a listing of the business instead, the people said. Representatives for SoftBank, Arm and Nvidia declined to comment.Arm’s technology underpins chips in everything from Apple Inc. devices to connected appliances. It’s becoming more valuable as the company pushes for its architecture to be used in more smart cars, data centers and networking gear. The company could be worth $44 billion if it pursues an initial public offering next year, a valuation that may rise to $68 billion by 2025, according to New Street Research LLP.Trophy AssetsTechnology billionaire Masayoshi Son has been selling off some of the trophy assets that he’s collected under his company, SoftBank, and its $100 billion Vision Fund. In recent months SoftBank offloaded part of its stake in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and a large chunk of its holdings in wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc.Son has spoken in exalted terms about his hopes for Arm, a key building block of his vision to profit from a connected world where more and more everyday gadgets are linked up to the internet. Arm will be “the center of the center of SoftBank” and play a key role in bringing about advanced artificial intelligence, Son said in 2016, calling the purchase of Arm “one of the most important acquisitions” he’d ever made.Read more: SoftBank May Not Want Nvidia to Bite Off Its Arm: Webb & KimSoftBank has since dialed back some of its ambitions as it seeks to pay down debt and fend off pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Corp. In May, the company reported a record operating loss after writing down investments in companies such as WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.Shares of Nvidia have surged more than twentyfold over the past five years, giving it a market value of $257 billion at Wednesday’s close. The Santa Clara, California-based company has segued its dominance of graphics chips used by gamers into new areas such as data center AI processing. It’s also taken a foothold in the nascent market for systems that will run self-driving cars.Apple ApproachThose moves have made Nvidia a bigger threat to a broader range of companies, including Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. -- all of which license Arm’s technology. Earlier in July, Nvidia briefly surpassed Intel in market value.SoftBank previously owned a stake in Nvidia, having quietly amassed $4 billion of shares in 2017, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. The Japanese firm said in early 2019 that the Vision Fund had sold off all of its Nvidia holding.Arm sells semiconductor designs and also licenses the fundamentals of how chips communicate with software, known as an instruction set. That blueprint underpins much of modern electronics and is the core value of the company. Even some companies that design their own chips, such as Apple, do so using Arm’s instruction set.As part of the sale process, SoftBank approached Apple to gauge its interest in acquiring Arm, according to people familiar with the matter. While the two firms had preliminary discussions, Apple isn’t planning to pursue a bid, the people said.Regulatory ScrutinyThat’s because Arm’s licensing operation would fit poorly with Apple’s hardware and software business model, the people said. There may also be regulatory concerns about Apple owning a key licensee that supplies so many rivals. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Still, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant has a vested interest in the fate of Arm. The chip designer’s technology is an important component of the more than 2 billion custom processors that Apple has shipped in iPhones and other devices over the past decade. Mac computers will start relying on the technology later this year.When SoftBank bought Arm, the two unveiled a strategy to rapidly increase the chip technology company’s reach by going on a hiring binge and increasing its chip-design efforts. The plan, according to Arm Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars, was to prioritize expansion and investment before eventually reining in costs in preparation for a return to the public markets.Any customer trying to acquire Arm would trigger regulatory scrutiny. Other companies using its technology would likely oppose a deal and demand assurances that a new owner would continue to provide equal access to Arm’s instruction set. Such concerns resulted in a neutral company -- SoftBank -- buying Arm the last time it was for sale.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Nvidia Eyes Biggest-Ever Chip Deal in Pursuit of SoftBank’s Arm

2020-07-29,"Shares of T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $105.67.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $95.00  * Volume: 400  * Open Interest: 2913 Ways Options Activity is 'Unusual'Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual option activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another gauge of unusual option activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual option activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments   * Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price  * Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask priceThese observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish option activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 29, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-29,"Shares of wireless carrier T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) received contrasting recommendations from two Wall Street firms this week as the mobile carrier completes its merger with Sprint. The T-Mobile Analysts:  RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin  downgraded shares of T-Mobile  from Outperform to Sector Perform and maintained the price target at $110.Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft initiated coverage of T-Mobile with a Buy rating and $140 price target.3 Reasons For RBC's T-Mobile Downgrade: RBC's downgrade is based on the relatively full valuation of T-Mobile shares relative to the sell-side firm's price target and the presence of few identifiable near-term catalysts, RBC's Atkins said in a Tuesday downgrade note. Substantial spending on integrating Sprint  is likely to pressure near-term cash flow, the analyst said. &quot;We think investors have already priced into TMUS shares the potential longer-term synergies (including possible upside), though expect sentiment could moderate as the $15B of costs to achieve over 3-4 years start to pressure cash flows.&quot;Third, the analyst said mobile promotions could drive customers onto lower-price plans.Although T-Mobile remains RBC's preferred pick among wireless operators, the firm said it is recommending diversification into tower stocks that stand to benefit from the ramp in T-Mobile-Sprint integration spending. T-Mobile Has Massive Growth Opportunity, Deutsche Bank Says:  T-Mobile, has a massive EBITDA and free cash flow growth opportunity driven by merger synergies, improved scale, an industry-leading spectrum position and a turnaround of the legacy Sprint operations, Deutsche Bank analyst Kraft said in a note. Additionally, the company is expected to benefit from continued subscriber momentum in pre-existing T-Mobile operations, the analyst said. TMUS Price Action:  At last check, T-Mobile shares were rising 1.17% to $105.74.

2020-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talks to acquire Arm Ltd., the chip designer that SoftBank Group Corp. bought for $32 billion four years ago, according to people familiar with the matter.The two parties aim to reach a deal in the next few weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Nvidia is the only suitor in concrete discussions with SoftBank, according to the people.A deal for Arm could be the largest ever in the semiconductor industry, which has been consolidating in recent years as companies seek to diversify and add scale. But any deal with Nvidia, which is a customer of Arm, would likely trigger regulatory scrutiny as well as a wave of opposition from other users.Cambridge, England-based Arm’s technology underpins chips that are crucial to most modern electronics, including those that dominate the smartphone market, an area in which Nvidia has failed to gain a foothold. Customers including Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp., could demand assurances that a new owner would continue providing equal access to Arm’s instruction set. Such concerns resulted in SoftBank, a neutral company, buying Arm the last time it was for sale.No final decisions have been made, and the negotiations could drag on longer or fall apart, the people said. SoftBank may gauge interest from other suitors if it can’t reach an agreement with Nvidia, the people said. Representatives for Nvidia, SoftBank and Arm declined to comment.Divestment Drive“With Nvidia’s low-cost fabless model enabling it to focus on R&D, engineering and programming, the fit with Arm would be perfect,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities.Nvidia is the largest maker of graphics processors and it’s spreading the use of the gaming component into new areas such as artificial intelligence processing in data centers and self-driving cars. Marrying its own capabilities with central processor units designed by Arm may enable it to take on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices in a more comprehensive way, according to Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann. He estimates Nvidia would have to pay about $55 billion for Arm.“You need control of BOTH CPU and GPU roadmaps and this, of course, includes data centers,” he wrote in a note Friday, referring to central processing units and graphic processing units. “Strategically, Nvidia needs a scalable CPU that can be integrated into its GPU roadmap, as is the case with AMD and Intel.”Billionaire Masayoshi Son has been selling some of SoftBank’s trophy assets as the company seeks to pay down debt at the Japanese conglomerate. SoftBank has offloaded part of its stake in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and a chunk of its holdings in wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc.SoftBank has been exploring options to exit part or all of its stake in Arm through a sale or public stock listing, Bloomberg News has reported. The chip-design company could go public as soon as next year if SoftBank decides to proceed with that option, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Arm has become more valuable as it pushes its architecture into smart cars, data centers and networking gear. The company could be worth $44 billion if it pursues an initial public offering next year, a valuation that may rise to $68 billion by 2025, according to New Street Research LLP.Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, is the world’s largest graphics chipmaker. The stock has surged more than twenty-fold in the past five years, giving the company more firepower to do large deals. Nvidia’s market value has increased to more than $260 billion in that time, surpassing Intel.

2020-08-03,"We’re living in interesting times, as the cliché goes, but that’s hardly a curse for investors. Stocks are climbing, despite the ongoing corona crisis and the shaky economic restart. By now, we all know that Q2 GDP fell badly; the 39.2% contraction was the worst since record keeping began. It would appear that the really bad news was already baked into investors’ expectation.One way to gauge the quality of the markets is to watch the corporate officers. These execs and board members are charged with guiding their companies through good times and bad – and they are privy to more information than the general public. Since it’s only human nature for them to use that info in their personal stock purchases, regulators require that they publish those purchases. It helps to level the playing field; we get to see what the insiders bought, and how much of their own money they put down.TipRanks collects that insider trading data, and puts it in the context of the larger markets. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool lets you follow the insiders, sorting the data by stock or by trading strategy. It’s a smart way to get an inside track, and to demonstrate, we’ve picked three stocks that have recently skewed strongly positive on the strength of insider trades. T-Mobile US (TMUS)The third largest wireless provider in the US markets has had a good year. It completed its merger with Sprint (previously the fourth-largest wireless provider) on April 1, and has not only recovered from the February/March market crash, but surpassed its February peak share value.Looking ahead, T-Mobile expects to see rapid gains from absorbing Sprint’s customer base and from its own heavy investment in 5G. T-Mobile rolled out the service on a limited basis in 2018, and has since expanded to cover most major urban centers. The union with Sprint added that company’s 5G service to the mix, and T-Mobile launched a 5G network on 600 MHz (the primary band for the service) in December.All of this has supported the stock price, and three members of the Board of Directors bought up blocks of shares recently. Board member Raul Marcelo Claure spent $16.57 million to pick up over 302,000 shares on July 21, in the largest insider purchase, while two other Board members made lesser purchases. Kelvin Westbrook and Teresa Taylor spent $69K and $124K on TMUS shares, respectively. All of these transactions pushed the insider sentiment on T-Mobile strongly positive, and Wall Street has been impressed. Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Kraft commented, &quot;We believe T-Mobile has a massive EBITDA and FCF growth opportunity in front of it; driven by merger synergies, improved scale, an industry-leading spectrum position, a turnaround of the legacy Sprint operations, and continued subscriber momentum in the preexisting T-Mobile operations.&quot;To this end, Kraft rates TMUS a Buy along with a $140 price target, which implies nearly 30% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Kraft’s track record, click here)Overall, T-Mobile shares get a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 13 Buys against just 3 Holds. The stock is selling for $108, and the average price target of $116.68 suggests its still has room for 7.5% upward growth this year. (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks)Kinder Morgan (KMI)Next up, Kinder Morgan, is a major player in the North American energy infrastructure. The company owns and operates natural gas and petroleum product pipelines, totaling over 83,000 miles. Kinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in the US, and also operates over 150 pipeline terminals.Depressed demand for oil and gas during the economic shutdown put serious presser on KMI shares, which have still not fully recovered. The company’s earnings slipped in Q1, and fell further in Q2, down to just 17 cents per share. But EPS remained in positive numbers, and the guidance for Q3 is better, at 20 cents. Despite the low earnings, the company announced earlier this month that it will pay out the Q2 regular dividend at 26.25 cents per share. That represents a 5% year-over-year increase, and gives a strong yield of 7.45%.A few days after the earnings release and dividend declaration, Richard Kinder, EC and Director, laid down $4.24 million to add another 300,000 shares to his holdings. After the purchase, Kinder owns more than $3.7 billion worth of KMI. Justin Jenkins, writing for Raymond James, agrees that there is plenty to like about KMI stock. He writes, “[We] still like Kinder Morgan's (KMI) relative positioning. Given lower relative variability in base cash flow, similarly solid/stable leverage, and broad diversification, we think shares of KMI should Outperform... Longer-term, we believe the themes of conservative dividend growth, insider ownership, C-Corp. tax status, and steady progress towards lower leverage should place KMI ahead of most of the rest of the midstream group…”In line with his comments, Jenkins reiterates his Buy rating on the stock, and his $17 price target implies an upside potential of 22% for the coming year. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here)Overall, KMI's Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 10 reviews, including 4 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. Shares are trading at $14, and the $17.60 average price target suggests a 26% upside. (See KMI's stock analysis at TipRanks)FB Financial Corporation (FBK)Nashville-based FB Financial, last on today’s list, is a bank holding company and owner of First Bank, with 73 branches in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Kentucky offering both full-service banking and mortgage services to individual and commercial customers. FBK boasts over $6.4 billion in assets.Earlier this month, FBK gave investors a pleasant surprise, reporting strong EPS gains in Q2. The earnings, which came in at 74 cents per share, indicated a profound turnaround from Q1, more than tripling sequentially. The EPS was also up 5% year-over-year. At the top line, quarterly revenues reached $136.8 million, beating the forecast by 39% and growing a stunning 52% from the year-ago quarter.On the insider front, Executive Chairman James Ayers bought more than 15,000 shares, paying over $383,000 for the block. His move is the first insider trade here in three months, and swung the sentiment needle strongly positive.SunTrust Robinson analyst Jennifer Demba sees reason for optimism in FBK’s near-term future. She writes, “Mortgage banking momentum should continue in 3Q20 and help offset the likely additional credit mark needed for the FSB acquisition scheduled to close in August. The LLR of 2.51% of total loans, ex PPP seems adequate, in our view, relative to peers given FBK's loan exposures. At 10.3x 2021E EPS/1.34x TBV versus the peer median of 15.0x/1.13x, the shares remain attractive, in our view.&quot;Demba gives the stock a price target of $30, suggesting a one-year upside of 19% and fully supporting her Buy rating. (To watch Demba’s track record, click here)Not all analysts on the Street voice Demba's bullish forecast. 2 other analysts rate FBK a Hold, and the 12-month average price target implies a modest upside of nearly 8%.

2020-08-06,"(Bloomberg) -- After reporting record losses in May and warning the coronavirus outbreak could be as devastating as the Great Depression, SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is already poised to declare a recovery.When it announces results next week, the Tokyo-based company is projected to report operating income of more than $1 billion for the quarter ended in June, according to analyst estimates. The Vision Fund is likely to post a profit, three months after a $17.7 billion loss on tumbling valuations for its portfolio companies.Son, who suffered disaster on top of fiasco in the months through March, has had almost everything go his way since then. A global rally in tech shares has lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The initial public offering market has turned red-hot, boosting the prospects for his portfolio of about 90 startups. SoftBank’s shares have climbed to a two-decade high with the help of record buybacks.“For the next few years, valuations will continue to rise and Son will look like a genius investor again,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. “Considering how much the overall stock markets have climbed recently, it’s only natural that private valuations at the Vision Fund should rise too.”SoftBank uses a number of approaches to value its stakes in private companies, including taking cues from their latest financing rounds and the valuations of publicly traded rivals. The exact mechanism is not disclosed, which makes earnings at the Vision Fund something of a black box. But after taking massive writedowns across the board in the last fiscal year, for most portfolio companies that remain in business the only way is up.Below are the key things that have boosted Son and SoftBank’s fortunes since March.The Tech RallyAfter a broad plunge in markets early this year with the coronavirus outbreak, tech stocks have been surging worldwide. Nasdaq, driven by the likes of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., climbed more than 30% in the second quarter.For SoftBank, Uber rebounded 11% last quarter after tumbling in the first quarter, and is now trading around the $33 price the Japanese company paid in early 2018. That may allow SoftBank to mark up the valuations of its other ride-hailing startups, the most significant part of its portfolio with stakes in Didi Chuxing in China, Southeast Asia’s Grab and Ola in India.SoftBank-backed Slack Technologies Inc., the workplace-collaboration software company seen as a key beneficiary of the pandemic, climbed about 30% this year. ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co. rose about 75%. Guardant Health Inc., a cancer-detection company in which the Japanese conglomerate is the largest shareholder, added 17% last quarter.IPO ThawWeWork’s implosion and Uber’s disappointing debut last year were seen as a signal the public markets were wary of the fast-growing, money-losing companies that SoftBank tends to back. But investors’ appetite for riskier equities has been rekindled, perhaps by the tech rally and central banks’ aggressive actions to fight the pandemic.One marquee SoftBank investment is the online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc., which more than doubled since its initial public offering last month. SoftBank owns a 21.8% stake that is now worth about $750 million, more than double its investment last year. Lemonade has yet to turn profitable since its inception in 2015.Oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. surged more than 85% since its trading debut last month. The Vision Fund invested $300 million in Relay in 2018 and holds a 41% stake in the company. Relay had a net loss of $75 million for 2019.The successes could pave the way for more listings from the fund, helping Son deliver on his promise of several IPOs a year. Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage, is planning an offering within a month, according to a person familiar with the matter. SoftBank in January invested $1.3 billion at a $10 billion valuation, which is likely to double in the IPO, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are public.DoorDash Inc., a food delivery company, in February filed paperwork for a public stock listing. Online insurance platform Policybazaar and South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Corp. are also preparing for offerings in 2021.Sell, sell, sellSon, who was long criticized for his unwillingness to exit investments, has been on an unprecedented selling spree in the past few months. SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in assets, including stock in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and its domestic telecom unit. The proceeds will be used to fund share repurchases and to pay down debt.SoftBank is also selling its stake in OSIsoft LLC. Son paid close to $1 billion for a 45% stake in 2017, valuing the industrial software maker at $2 billion at the time, according to the person familiar. The company is now in talks for a sale at more than $4 billion, Bloomberg News has reported.By far the biggest deal would be the sale of the sale of Arm Ltd., the chip designer SoftBank bought for $32 billion four years ago.

2020-08-11,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is targeting investments of more than $10 billion in public stocks as part of a new asset management arm, far exceeding the initial holdings that founder Masayoshi Son outlined to shareholders on Tuesday, people familiar with the initiative said.The tally could reach into the tens of billions, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the plans are private.Son, the chief executive officer, unveiled the investment arm in a conference call to discuss earnings on Tuesday. He said the unit has about $555 million in capital. However, the amount is seen as a placeholder, people familiar with the project said; 555 is slang in Japanese gaming culture meaning “go, go, go.”The asset management team is led by Akshay Naheta, a senior vice president in Abu Dhabi, the people said. The group has been quietly amassing multibillion-dollar stakes in American Big Tech companies over the past few months, the people said.On Tuesday, Son said SoftBank had acquired holdings in some of the so-called FAANG stocks. FAANG refers to a group of five large tech companies: Facebook Inc., Amazon Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google, whose parent company is Alphabet Inc.The Japanese company didn’t disclose the size of these positions. The investments were made using financing structures that can prevent SoftBank from showing up in public records as a direct shareholder, said the people familiar with the initiative.A representative for SoftBank declined to comment. “As an investment company, we need to explore various angles and scope. But our focus is still on companies driving the information revolution,” Son said during the earnings presentation. “This is the purpose of our company.”In recent years, SoftBank has painted itself as a champion of innovative startups, led by its $100 billion Vision Fund. That strategy faltered after WeWork and several other high-profile flameouts. But SoftBank’s dealings with public stocks have notched some wins over the past three years. It profited from investments Charter Communications Inc. in early 2018 and in U.S. chip designer Nvidia Corp., which was worth 398 billion yen when it was sold last year.Less successful was a complicated investment in the now-infamous German payments company Wirecard. The bet profited select SoftBank employees and sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, an investor in the Vision Fund, but the collapse of Wirecard in recent months caused analysts to question the nature of the investment.The development of a public-equities vehicle was driven partly by a long-held desire by various executives at SoftBank to pursue asset management. Following its $3.3 billion takeover of alternative-asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC, SoftBank also considered buying a stake in Swiss Re, the world’s second-biggest reinsurer.SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in legacy assets, including stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., T-Mobile US Inc. and its domestic telecom unit. Some of the capital raised will fund the asset management arm, the people said. SoftBank said it will own 67% of the asset management group, and Son will personally own the rest.The new unit reflects the revived ambitions of Son. The founder had said in May that SoftBank was unlikely to secure outside investors for a second Vision Fund after problems with the first. But in the upbeat financial results Tuesday, Son expressed readiness to accelerate a companywide shift from telecom to investing. “Our strategy hasn’t changed,” Son said. “We still plan on unicorn hunting with Vision Fund two, three and so on.”SoftBank’s investments in FAANG stocks are buoyed by a tech rally in the market. Uber Technologies Inc. rebounded 11% last quarter after tumbling in the first and is now trading at close to the $33 price SoftBank paid in early 2018. The performance gives a strong boost to the Vision Fund portfolio, which is heavily weighted toward ride-hailing companies, also including Didi Chuxing in China, Grab in Southeast Asia and Ola in India.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Is Targeting Over $10 Billion in Public Investing

2020-08-11,"SoftBank Group Corp broke with tradition on Tuesday and declined to disclose operating profit in its quarterly results, saying the measure was ""not useful"" to gauge performance, and instead pointed to a $2.8 billion gain at its Vision Fund.  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has long emphasised the total value of assets as his preferred yardstick.  By jettisoning operating profit, however, SoftBank could further stoke investor complaints about a firm long seen as opaque and hard to value.","SoftBank touts Vision Fund gains, ditches operating profit as yardstick"
2020-08-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is launching a new asset management venture to buy stocks in publicly traded companies, expanding SoftBank Group Corp.’s investment efforts as it rebounded from record losses to profitability.The Tokyo-based company reported net income of 1.26 trillion yen ($11.8 billion) for the three months ended June 30, following a loss of 1.44 trillion yen three months earlier. The profit was boosted by more than 1 trillion yen in one-time gains from the sale of Sprint Corp. and shares in T-Mobile US Inc.Son has shifted his attention to investments in recent years after building his fortune in the telecom sector. The asset management initiative expands on previous efforts like the $100 billion Vision Fund, which he set up three years ago to take stakes in private startups. The new arm has already purchased shares in Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.“As an investment company, we need to explore various angles and scope. But our focus is still on companies driving the information revolution,” said Son. “This is the purpose of our company.”SoftBank will own 67% of the asset management firm, while Son personally will own the rest. The unit has about $555 million in capital, he said.It’s not clear why Son thinks SoftBank will have an edge in picking stocks, moving into a field crowded with heavyweights like Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. The effort may increase the volatility of SoftBank earnings, which has grown with initiatives like the Vision Fund.“Investors will need to build greater risk into their expectations -- and Masa investing alongside is not a good look,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Research who writes for Smartkarma. “Launching a new investment vehicle targeted at public tech when Nasdaq is near all-time highs with bubble concerns seems like a good way to keep the share price discount to public value from closing.”The Japanese billionaire has pulled off a remarkably speedy comeback after the worst loss in his company’s 39-year history. A global rally in technology shares lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio, from China’s Didi Chuxing to South Korea’s Coupang.Far from striking a winning pose on Tuesday however, Son emphasized the importance of defense. He opened his presentation with slides depicting a 16th century battle between two Japanese lords. Oda Nobunaga, who would go on to unify Japan, won the engagement by sheltering his riflemen inside a wooden structure to protect them from samurai on horseback.“You can’t skimp on defense,” Son said. “We need to strengthen our defense. Defense is cash.”SoftBank also stopped reporting operating profit, long a key metric tracked by investors. It said the figure is “no longer meaningful” as the company becomes a “strategic investment holding company.”SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in assets to fund share repurchases and to pay down debt. The company already raised 4.3 trillion yen through sales that include stakes in T-Mobile, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and its domestic telecom unit, completing about 95% of the program.The Vision Fund returned to profitability, following a 1.13 trillion yen loss in the previous quarter. SoftBank booked a 296.6 billion yen gain on Vision Fund investments in the quarter, including 111.4 billion yen in realized gains after selling a portion of its shares in four listed portfolio companies. About $1.4 billion of the unrealized gains came from holdings in public companies, with Uber responsible for about $700 million and Ping An Good Doctor, Vir Biotechnology Inc. and Guardant Health Inc. contributing about $200 million each.“It’s still too early to say that it will be all profits at the Vision Fund going forward,” Son said in a live-streamed briefing. “But things are turning around in a big way.”Several SoftBank-backed companies have also pulled off successful initial public offerings, raising the prospects for more in the future. Online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc. more than doubled in the days after its initial public offering last month, while oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. has surged about the same amount since its trading debut.Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage backed by SoftBank, said last week it is seeking to raise about $2 billion in a U.S. IPO. DoorDash Inc., a U.S. food delivery company backed by SoftBank, has filed paperwork for a public stock listing. Online insurance platform Policybazaar and e-commerce giant Coupang are preparing for offerings in 2021.Son confirmed that SoftBank is looking to sell or take public Arm Ltd., the chip design firm that he bought four years ago for $32 billion. He said he may accelerate plans for an Arm IPO from the original 2023 schedule or he may sell part or all of the firm. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talked to acquire Arm.Son put plans for a second Vision Fund on hold after missteps, including the meltdown at WeWork. Now, the fund’s upbeat results and a renewed investor appetite for risk could revive the idea, according to Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group.”Our strategy hasn’t changed,” Son said at the briefing. “We still plan on unicorn hunting with Vision Fund 2, 3 and so on.”(Updates with details from the briefing from ninth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Moves Into Asset Management After Return to Profits
2020-08-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- SoftBank Group Corp. has given up pretending to operate anything.Once the owner of two telecom companies and a collection of other operating businesses, the Japanese conglomerate would report quarterly operating profit and net income.That’s how most normal companies do it. In days past, the former category included profits from Sprint Corp. and Softbank Corp., as well as operating income from the SoftBank Vision Fund, but excluded gains or losses from other investments.On Tuesday, SoftBank announced it will no longer bother reporting operating income, instead “gain (loss) on investments will be used in order to show investment performance in the consolidated financial results.” The catalyst was the sale of Sprint to T-Mobile US Inc., meaning that the U.S. mobile operator is no longer a consolidated entity. The change makes sense. SoftBank hasn’t “operated” anything for a while, instead cobbling together a growing pile of investments both within the Vision Fund (such as ByteDance Ltd. and Uber Technologies Inc.) and outside (including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and domestically listed telco Softbank Corp.).In the June quarter, the major driver of earnings was the sale of shares in T-Mobile. A year earlier, it was a rise in the value of its stake in Alibaba. SoftBank Corp. continues to provide a handy income stream.With the Vision Fund’s $98.6 billion almost fully invested, there’s not much left to be done hunting for unicorns and handing out fat checks. Earnings from the fund, generally based on mark-to-market valuation changes, fell 39% for the period.This shift in reporting may be all the more relevant in light of one of the few remaining companies that SoftBank controls, but which is neither listed nor controlled by the Vision Fund: Arm Ltd.SoftBank seems desperate to offload the British semiconductor company  just four years after acquiring it for $32 billion. My colleague Alex Webb and myself recently advised against an IPO because the unit’s revenue has slowed and SoftBank would get a better price if it waited for a pickup in demand for new devices like internet of things and self-driving cars. The news flow over the past few weeks indicates that Softbank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son and his team have been doing the hard sell, with names like Nvidia Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Foxconn Technology Group all in the mix.Should a sale go through, even a partial divestiture, the pool of companies that Son’s team controls will shrink further. I’d hazard that we could see a further offloading of its shares in SoftBank Corp., too.These moves would put even more of the burden of earnings on returns from its portfolio of investments, of which Alibaba remains the largest. Today, SoftBank Group’s net asset value can largely be tracked in real time simply by following the stocks it owns. Sadly, the company just took a back step backward for transparency by announcing Tuesday that it would no long post daily updates on its website.For investors, the reporting shift highlights the truth of what SoftBank Group has become: a fancy, highly managed fund — a hedge fund, perhaps — whose returns ought to be benchmarked against indexes of its peers and not as the technology company Son once ran. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-08-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. begins taking orders for its dual-screen Surface device in the U.S. on Wednesday, an attempt to re-enter the mobile handset market with a product that blends the features of a tablet with those of a phone. The Android-powered Surface Duo starts at $1,399 and will be available Sept. 10, said Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay. The device will be sold on Microsoft.com as well as by AT&T Inc. and Best Buy Co. It is the thinnest Surface ever, with screens that unfold completely to serve as a phone or act like a book to provide more space for different apps.  The gadget represents Microsoft's return to the handset market following an ignominious retreat in 2016 after the company’s acquisition of Nokia’s handset unit crashed and burned in a costly writedown. It’s also the company’s first Surface device running Google’s Android operating system, which Windows Phone once sought to vanquish. Why Android? Panay told reporters it came down to the need for apps — Microsoft's previous efforts were largely doomed because of the lack of mobile developer support.“The product was built as the Microsoft you love and the Android you know,” Panay said. The gadget’s OLED displays measure 5.6 inches individually or 8.1 inches taken as a whole, with Microsoft promising “all-day battery life.” It’ll have either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, 6GB of memory, a Snapdragon 855 processor from Qualcomm Inc., and will work on the wireless networks of Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T and T-Mobile US Inc.The U.S.-only release will disappoint international fans of the Courier concept device that Microsoft teased a decade ago — it’s the original “digital notebook” inspiration underpinning the Surface Duo and something that enthusiasts have been asking to see as a real product for a long time.Microsoft’s hinge-and-two-screen approach is less futuristic than devices from the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. with a single screen that folds in the middle.  To make it work, the Duo has 56 cables connecting the two screens with the batteries and mainboard split between the two halves.The device has a 360-degree hinge and can be used in vertical or horizontal orientation. Different apps can run on each screen or an app can be spread across both screens for things like gaming or a larger view. Users can create app groups — a blend of two apps that open with one click. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has used this to combine the Kindle app and Microsoft’s OneNote so he can take notes while reading.  To watch video, you can open the hinge partially and turn one side of the Duo into a stand.“I’m not trying to reinvent the phone,” Panay said. “But I do believe this is a better way to get things done, a better way to create, and a better way to connect on a mobile device.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Surface Duo Phone Goes on Sale Starting at $1,399"

With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 1.41%.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on TMUSDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.T-Mobile US Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 74.46 of the Telecom Services industry.

2020-08-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp. said it will sell about 1.33 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) of the stock it holds in its Japanese wireless operation, adding to massive asset sales that have helped his conglomerate get back on track after missteps with startup investments.The Tokyo-based parent said it will sell 927 million shares in SoftBank Corp. through a global secondary offering, about a third of its stake. The carrier’s stock, which closed at 1,431.5 yen on Friday, will be sold at a discount of 3% to 5%. Separately, the wireless unit said it will buy back up to 1.68% of its shares for about 100 billion yen.Son, founder and chief executive officer, has turned around his company’s fortunes since March by selling off assets and repurchasing his own stock. SoftBank Group had previously announced plans to sell about 4.5 trillion yen in assets and had said it was almost done with that program. Son has used the proceeds to pay down debt and embark on 2.5 trillion yen in buybacks.“The question is what will the money be used for,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “It could just as likely be used for more buybacks or another wild acquisition.”SoftBank plans to sell 223.5 million shares to overseas investors in Europe and Asia, excluding the U.S. and Canada, with an extra allotment of 33.5 million shares. Domestic investors will get 670.5 million shares. The company aims to hand over the shares between Sept. 23 and Sept. 25, or five business days after the pricing and other details are settled.SoftBank Group shares have more than doubled from their lows in March to 6,397 yen a share, as the company repurchased about 1 trillion yen worth of stock. Two more tranches totaling 1.5 trillion yen still remain, one running until March 31 next year and another until July 30.The past few months have been a whirlwind of deals for SoftBank. In addition to an earlier sale of $2.9 billion of SoftBank Corp. shares, the company has offloaded $13.7 billion of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. stock and a stake in T-Mobile US Inc. for about $20 billion. Son has also said that he is looking to sell or take public Arm Ltd., the chip design firm that he bought four years ago for $32 billion.In addition to paying down more debt and further buybacks, Son could use the proceeds in several ways. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new asset management arm with about $3.9 billion of investments into 25 of the world’s largest technology companies including Amazon.com Inc., Tesla Inc., Netflix Inc. and Alphabet Inc. The portfolio of public stocks could exceed $10 billion, according to people familiar with the initiative.SoftBank has also emerged as one of the participants in the bidding for the short-video app TikTok in the U.S. It was part of the consortium together with Google parent Alphabet and Walmart Inc. that has since dissolved, according to a person familiar with the matter. SoftBank owns a minor stake in TikTok’s parent ByteDance Ltd.Son has said he plans to raise a successor to his $100 billion Vision Fund every two to three years. But a string of missteps, including a meltdown at WeWork, and the coronavirus virus outbreak led to a record loss of almost $18 billion in the business, scuttling fund-raising plans. With billions of dollars in cash, Son could afford to go it alone for the foreseeable future.SoftBank said it is expanding its cash reserves beyond the asset sales already announced “to ensure flexible options to respond to changes in the market environment.” The company cited “the ongoing uncertainty in the market environment due to concerns about a potential second or even third wave of COVID-19.”(Updates with analyst’s comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Group to Sell $12.5 Billion of Wireless Unit Stock

2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- AT&T Inc. is once again looking to sell its DirecTV unit, a business that has lost billions of dollars in value since the wireless carrier acquired it in 2015. The sooner it waves goodbye, the better. The question is, who wants it?DirecTV has faded into the background at AT&T, a company now entirely focused on competing in 5G wireless connectivity and online television. Any DirecTV user can attest to how the service has been neglected in recent years, and the business might be forgotten by investors if it weren’t for the headline-grabbing subscriber losses it’s mounted each quarter.AT&T, which also owns the U-Verse brand, has lost about 6 million traditional pay-TV customers overall in just the last two years. The Covid-19 pandemic is causing cord-cutting to accelerate as consumers look to save money by switching to streaming-video services such as Netflix and AT&T’s own HBO Max. So while AT&T paid $49 billion when it bought DirecTV, it’d be lucky to fetch even half that now. One analyst, John Butler of Bloomberg Intelligence, estimates a potential sale price of just $20 billion.Some may be wondering, what on earth would any buyer want with a satellite-TV business anyway? The answer is cash. DirecTV still throws off quite a bit of it, which explains why private equity firms including Apollo Global Management Inc. and Platinum Equity are said to be taking a look. Financial suitors want businesses that generate lots of cash because they can support dividends and the debt load needed to take them private — although DirecTV’s ability to do so is certainly diminishing. Cash is one reason AT&T has waffled over whether to part with DirecTV; its earnings help the parent company chip away at its own mountain of debt. According to a Los Angeles Times article in January, AT&T said that DirecTV had generated $22 billion of cash flow since 2015. But now that Randall Stephenson, the CEO who bought DirecTV, has retired, and AT&T has a new linear TV product called AT&T TV, it no longer makes sense to hold on to a tired brand. DirecTV also won’t rebound after the pandemic, and given the uncertainty around sports, there’s now a question mark on the value of its NFL Sunday Ticket package.Satellite TV does continue to serve a crucial demographic: rural America. There, streaming apps often aren’t an option; instead, the choice is between DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. In fact, roughly half of satellite churn is back and forth between DirecTV and Dish, according to a research report last September by Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson LLC. As they both try to offset subscriber shortfalls and higher programming costs, DirecTV has turned to price hikes and Dish has embraced channel blackouts. This is why Dish has long been considered the most obvious merger partner for DirecTV, an idea that seems to have been deterred only by the regulatory hurdles. So even as AT&T holds formal discussions with private equity suitors, there would seem to be a high likelihood that Dish billionaire Charlie Ergen also joins the fray. The satellite business may be the awkward sibling of the AT&T family, but it’s a piggy bank for Ergen’s desire to launch his own 5G wireless network.This may be the last chance for DirecTV and Dish to strike a deal. The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission’s approval of T-Mobile US Inc.’s purchase of Sprint Corp., which was backed by a court ruling this year, opened the door to other mergers between direct rivals in highly concentrated markets. That lax approach to antitrust may end, though, if Joe Biden defeats Donald Trump for the presidency in November. Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat leading a House investigation into Big Tech’s anticompetitive practices, told Bloomberg News last week that Biden would likely pursue an aggressive antitrust policy.While a group of state attorneys general were unsuccessful in trying to block T-Mobile’s takeover of Sprint, their efforts signaled that states are willing to step in when they see regulators drop the ball. As AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens noted in an interview in January, contending with antitrust matters now means squaring off against the “three-headed monster” of the DOJ, FCC and states. “Or maybe a 52-headed monster, I should say,” he added.AT&T may not want to take the risk of that monster coming after it — again. Its $109 billion deal for WarnerMedia (then called Time Warner Inc.) got tied up in a legal battle with the Justice Department for well over a year. New CEO John Stankey, who oversaw that effort, probably doesn’t want a repeat. The company has enough on its plate, with the virus halting productions at WarnerMedia and starving HBO Max of content. Considering AT&T’s $178 billion of net debt, including lease obligations, it’d be prudent to sell DirecTV to whoever offers a combination of best price and best chances of getting a deal done quickly. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-09-04,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is exploring assembling a group of bidders for TikTok’s India assets and has been actively looking for local partners, according to people familiar with the matter. Over the past month, the Japanese conglomerate, which owns a stake in TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd., has held talks with the heads of India’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd., the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. While discussions have fizzled since, SoftBank is still exploring options, according to the people. Representatives for SoftBank, ByteDance, Reliance and Bharti Airtel declined to comment. SoftBank shares slid 3.2% in Tokyo.TikTok is considering selling its operations in several countries after local governments shut out the app, citing fears that sensitive user data was passing into the hands of the Chinese state. India, a long-time regional rival, has taken a particularly tough stance, banning 59 of China’s largest internet services in July, including TikTok. The move came less than a month after 20 Indian soldiers died in border clashes amid heightening nationalism stoked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.SoftBank would almost certainly need a local partner to cut a deal that would win government approval.  Before the ban, India was one of TikTok's largest markets, with more than 200 million users.In the U.S., President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok and then ordered ByteDance to sell its assets in the country because of national security concerns.Despite holding only a minor stake in ByteDance, SoftBank has played a particularly active role in negotiations. In the U.S.,  the Japanese company brought in Walmart Inc. as the main investor in a group of bidders that also included Google parent Alphabet Inc. But the consortium fell apart after the Trump administration insisted a U.S. tech company lead the investments, one of the people said. Google said it is no longer interested, while Walmart joined a bid led by Microsoft Corp. It’s unclear which group SoftBank is currently working with in the country.Centricus Asset Management Ltd., which is also a frequent adviser to SoftBank, teamed up with Triller Inc. in a bid for TikTok’s operations in the U.S. and several other countries for $20 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has a long history of investing in India and a deep network of local business connections. Local startups backed by Son include e-commerce provider Snapdeal.com, ride-hailing service Ola Cabs and hotel-booking app Oyo Rooms. In December, SoftBank poured $275 million into eye-care provider Lenskart, minting India’s latest unicorn.  The company is also part of a solar power joint venture with Bharti Enterprises Pvt.

2020-09-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Masayoshi Son, at one time considered to be the Warren Buffett of Japan, has pretty much gone full Robinhood trader.As it turns out, Son’s conglomerate, SoftBank Group Corp., may be behind the rip-roaring ride in large-cap U.S. technology stocks in recent weeks that lifted the broader market and, in effect, made investors nearly forget the Covid-19 crisis for a moment. The “Nasdaq whale,” the Financial Times calls him, referring to a monstrous options trade that the paper’s unidentified sources say was made by SoftBank. Here’s how the Wall Street Journal describes the curious move:Investors watching the vertigo-inducing rise — and Thursday’s fall — of technology stocks are buzzing about a single trade, a giant but shadowy bet on Silicon Valley big enough to pull the market up with it. The investor behind that trade, according to people familiar with the matter, is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., which bought options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks. It’s a lot to take in. We’re talking about a period during which Apple Inc. became a $2 trillion company; Amazon.com Inc. added more to its market value in a month than it did in all of last year; and Telsa Inc. founder Elon Musk vaulted past Buffett in the ranking of the world’s wealthiest people. While all the tech giants have benefited in some way from societal shifts brought on by the pandemic — a surge in demand for everything from online shopping and streaming-video, to work-from-home software solutions — market observers have struggled to explain exactly why their share prices took an extra leg up over the summer. Bloomberg Opinion’s Nir Kaissar wrote this week about the conundrum that this has created for money managers: whether to stick with a responsibly diversified portfolio that’s destined to underperform, or chase the fad.It’s unusual for options-buying tied to individual stocks to be so explosive that it could move markets in this way, but that’s now the prevailing theory. Equity derivatives have become a favorite trading toy for presumably bored retail investors — those who don’t manage money professionally — who have taken a liking to platforms such as Robinhood while being shut in during the Covid-19 crisis. It’s hard to know Son’s specific motivations for joining that camp, but it’s certainly not boredom. Investors have gone back and forth on whether Son, 63, is a true visionary or more of a gambler. He once spoke of a 300-year plan for SoftBank, but it soon became evident that he needed to concentrate on the present. Fraught investments in U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp. and office-rental company WeWork Cos. bruised his reputation. And after writing down the values of investments in WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc., SoftBank suffered a loss for the Japanese record books. Son was finally able to sell Sprint to T-Mobile US Inc. this year, ironically leaving the Japanese businessman as the biggest beneficiary of a deal pitched to regulators on American patriotism. As SoftBank laid plans to dump more than $40 billion of assets to shore up its balance sheet, Son was apparently left with funds to spend. SoftBank, best known for its Vision Fund, also said last month that it will no longer report operating income. My Opinion colleague Tim Culpan wrote that the change makes sense given that SoftBank hasn’t “operated” anything for a long time; it functions more as a stock picker, investing in startups and publicly traded companies. A bet on Big Tech is a risky one, though. Some have compared the industry’s outsize gains to the dot-com bubble that famously burst 20 years ago. Fellow Opinion columnist John Authers got it right when he wrote Friday: “If there is a bubble in the biggest tech companies, it is arguably in their profits, and how they have been allowed to build up monopolistic market power, rather than in their valuations.” A monopoly bubble is a lot harder to pop, but Democrats are trying. What stands in their way are 100-year-old antitrust laws that don’t make a single mention of the word at the root of Big Tech’s power and overreach — its exclusive hold on reams and reams of valuable data.Still, the bubble began to seep this week, and news of Son’s almost single-handed influence won’t help matters. But the only thing that will truly rein in Big Tech is an administration that wants to. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-09-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Seven months after launching its first modern reboot of the early-2000s classic, Motorola on Wednesday announced its second-generation foldable Razr and said the first had greater impact on improving its brand rather than sales. The new Android smartphone continues to give China’s Lenovo Group Ltd. a unique selling point versus the likes of Apple Inc.: a screen that folds in half like a flip phone. Still measuring 6.2 inches, the main display functions like that of any other modern device, but it turns into a compact square when closed, and Motorola has focused on improving the things a user can do with the exterior screen in this new iteration. It also adds 5G wireless capabilities, a faster processor and much-improved cameras.The Razr brought in more people switching from competing Android brands this year than any other Motorola device, according to the company. 20% of Razr buyers were iPhone or iPad owners, the company added, indicating that the pricey Razr was crossing partisan tech divides and appealing to those loyal to the Apple brand.Priced at $1,399, the 5G Razr is $100 cheaper than its predecessor and also more affordable than the $1,449 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G, its only competition in this nascent class and pocketable size. In an interview, Motorola executives said the first Razr owns 50% of the foldable phone market in North America. Motorola is launching the 5G edition in several new countries, including China. In the U.S., the new Razr will go on sale later this year, adding T-Mobile and AT&T to Verizon Wireless as carrier options.Sergio Buniac, Motorola’s president, told Bloomberg News that sales numbers for the original model were in line with internal projections, though he wouldn’t divulge specifics. He said that the device wasn’t a major portion of the company’s overall sales in 2020, but that the impact was larger than the numbers as it drove new awareness of Motorola as a brand.The first foldable Razr’s launch just weeks before the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. hurt the debut, but the company was profitable across all geographies during the quarter from April to June and grew 35% from the previous quarter, Buniac said. Read the review of last year’s model:  Motorola’s $1,500 Razr Reboot Feels More Prototype Than PremiumThe tweaked Razr 5G design has a more polished back, updated colors and a fingerprint scanner that has been moved from the front chin to the back. Depending on a person’s hand size, that is either an improvement or a downgrade. The camera specifications are updated considerably, going from a 5-megapixel selfie camera to 20 megapixels and upgrading to a more sophisticated 12-megapixel main shooter on the rear with larger individual pixels and optical image stabilization. This is one of the few flagship-tier Android devices on the market without a multi-camera system, one of the compromises enforced by the foldable form factor.Stepping up to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor is a move in the right direction, though a tier below Samsung’s Z Flip 5G. The new Razr’s battery has also been upgraded to 2,800mAh, but it too is behind most of the Android competition.The new Razr feels decidedly less flimsy in the hand than the original foldable, but the screen still emits a slight creak when it opens and closes. It is also a fingerprint magnet and uses a plastic cover unlike its Samsung rival with ultrathin glass. $1,399 is a high price to pay for a phone without an overwhelming use case advantage, especially at a time when every Android manufacturer is putting out devices, including Motorola’s own Edge+, that cost hundreds of dollars less and offer far better specifications, displays and battery life. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Motorola's 5G Foldable Razr Adds Better Cameras and Processor, Costs Less"

At scale, this technology means T-Mobile could connect massively more devices to the same cell infrastructure and still deliver blazing fast speeds to all of them without compromising performance and that means wireless companies will be able to deliver even better 5G performance to even more people.",Buckle Up!

2020-09-14,(VZ) Communications has an agreement to purchase TracFone Wireless from  (AMX) for about $6.3 billion.  It is a move to expand Verizon’s presence in the prepaid and value segments of the U.S. wireless business as the industry transitions to next-generation 5G networks.  Taking over TracFone and presumably becoming its exclusive network in the future could fill a hole in Verizon’s subscriber base relative to peers while also allowing it to use more of its network capacity.,Verizon Is Paying $6.3 Billion for TracFone. How the Deal Is a Strategy Shift for Verizon.
2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A flurry of corporate dealmaking in recent days is creating the illusion of an almost-return to normalcy — that is, buyers are confident enough to be buying again even as Covid-19 continues to burden the U.S. economy. But don’t let the billions of dollars suddenly swishing around the M&A market fool you: This isn’t a Merger Monday to celebrate. None of the announced deals necessarily signals renewed bullishness toward the economy, and in fact, one is flashing just the opposite.For starters, there’s the TikTok takeover saga, which looks like it will end without an outright takeover and rather a partnership with Oracle Corp. Remember, these negotiations were brought about not by natural market forces, but by geopolitical tensions with China and somewhat squishy national-security logic employed by the White House.Also in the tech space, Nvidia Corp. is buying chip designer Arm Ltd. from SoftBank Group Corp. for $40 billion, in what ranks as the biggest transaction of 2020 and a chance for Nvidia to cement its industry dominance. But the backstory is just as important: The deal is part of a larger retrenchment by SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son — also now known as the “Nasdaq whale” — after a series of ill-advised investments left his empire facing shareholder pressure to shed assets and shore up is finances. Just like TikTok, Arm is essentially a forced sale — not the kind used as a market barometer. A smaller acquisition announced by Verizon Communications Inc. on Monday may be even more telling. The company agreed to acquire TracFone Wireless for up to $6.9 billion in a bet that the market for prepaid, or pay-as-you-go, plans will see increased demand amid the crisis. Verizon is the biggest U.S. carrier, but when it comes to prepaid it’s been a laggard. That market had also been shrinking in recent years as U.S. wage and job growth enabled more customers to upgrade to postpaid plans that require better credit and get billed at the end of each month.When T-Mobile US Inc. bought Sprint Corp., I noted that their combined market share in prepaid could worry regulators — or it least it should have — because economists were already vaguely predicting a recession was on the way even before Covid-19 hit. It’s now here, and to the extent that the prepaid market serves as an inverse economic indicator of sorts, Verizon seems to be betting more people will have to resort to this kind of service amid what promises to be a slow and uneven U.S. recovery. As I wrote last week, various consumer-spending patterns provide stark evidence of a K-shaped rebound exacerbating the nation’s wealth inequality. In other M&A news, Gilead Sciences Inc. agreed to buy Immunomedics Inc. for $21 billion to expand beyond its core HIV-treatment business and gain a promising breast-cancer drug. My Opinion colleague Max Nisen cautions that Gilead looks to be overpaying, though, and may wind end up experiencing buyer’s remorse. Unfortunately, it’s yet another example of how this Merger Monday feels a bit more like the Sunday Scaries. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to buy TracFone Wireless Inc. from America Movil SAB for as much as $6.9 billion, as the largest U.S. wireless carrier seeks to expand its mobile business into the so-called prepaid market.Verizon will pay $3.125 billion in cash and $3.125 billion in stock, with as much as $650 million additional tied to performance goals, it said in a statement Monday. TracFone, a U.S. prepaid mobile service, is a subsidiary of billionaire Carlos Slim’s Mexico-based wireless carrier. It’s the largest U.S. prepaid service, with 21 million subscribers.America Movil’s American depositary receipts rose as much as 4.5% to $13.09 in New York trading. Verizon shares gained as much as 1.1% to $60.46.The acquisition comes as Verizon faces new pressure from an enlarged T-Mobile US Inc., which concluded its merger with Sprint Corp. earlier this year. T-Mobile has 20.6 million prepaid subscribers, with the largest group under the Metro brand. AT&T Inc. has 18 million prepaid subscribers, most under its Cricket brand.Though Verizon is the largest wireless carrier overall, with 116 million regular monthly subscribers, it has only 4 million prepaid customers.The prepaid market attracts a wide range of people, many young or poor who don’t have a strong credit history. While there are higher risks of nonpayment and less loyalty than among regular subscribers who pay bills at the end of the month, the prepaid market is also one of the biggest pipelines for customers upgrading to higher-priced plans. Verizon had never been a big participant in that market.Talking a YearVerizon, which had sold network capacity to TracFone for 15 years, started talks with America Movil nearly a year ago, said Ronan Dunne, who heads Verizon’s consumer business.“We were looking for a way to control our own destiny in the value segment or prepaid segment,” he said. “It’s fair to say we were not serving all segments of the market. So I was keen on making sure that we had the scale and distribution to maximize those assets. It’s definitely a doubling down on our commitment to a network strategy.”TracFone includes several brands, including Straight Talk and Simple Mobile, that are sold in large retail chains like Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. The business will remain a separate division and continue to be based in Miami. Dunne said there is no plan to change the TracFone name or any of its brands.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Verizon’s agreement to buy Tracfone, a leading U.S. prepaid service provider, from America Movil for $6.25 billion makes strategic sense to us, as it may help stem any low-end share loss to T-Mobile and AT&T. Verizon plans to expand its services to increase revenue in the prepaid segment by offering fixed and mobile 5G services as well as international roaming. The latter can boost high-margin fee revenue, which has declined amid the pandemic.”&#92;--John Butler, telecom analystClick here to read the research.TracFone and America Movil’s operations in Colombia were the company’s only prepaid-mobile units to add users during the second quarter, the Mexican mobile-phone giant reported in July.America Movil has been strengthening its position across Latin America. Last week, Brazil’s Oi SA said it accepted a 16.5 billion reais ($3.1 billion) offer for its mobile unit from Telefonica Brasil, TIM and America Movil’s Claro. The companies are now considered a “stalking horse” and have the right to top other proposals.Last year, America Movil had also announced its purchase of Telefonica’s assets in Guatemala and El Salvador. While the Guatemalan transaction went through, the company announced last week that regulatory hurdles in El Salvador led it to terminate that deal.(Updates with shares in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Verizon Buying TracFone Wireless for Up to $6.9 Billion

2020-09-14,"On Monday, shares of T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $112.77.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-18  * Strike Price: $114.00  * Volume: 212  * Open Interest: 198Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Contracts that have been traded, but not closed by a counter-party, are called open interest. A purchased contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for the option.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * A Look Into T-Mobile's Price Over Earnings  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is making another surprising strategic move with plans to introduce its own blank-check company in the next two weeks.Rajeev Misra, head of SoftBank’s Vision Fund, made the disclosure Monday in a virtual interview at the Milken Conference on a panel hosted by Bloomberg News. SoftBank is planning to invest its own cash in the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, at the same time public investors put in their cash. That would provide a shell for a promising private company to go public in the future, even if the markets turn rocky.SoftBank is in talks with potential arrangers including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. about the SPAC listing, according to two people familiar with the matter. The Japanese company’s second Vision Fund could invest in the SPAC, one person said.“We’re going to do a SPAC ourselves, with our own capital, as an investment vehicle,” Misra said. “It’s ideal for companies that were ready to go public 12 months from now and want to do it with certainty maybe six months earlier.”Blank-check firms ask investors to put money in a stock before knowing which company they’re backing. The SPAC manager then chooses a company, typically one that’s privately traded, and pursues a merger that lets the startup go public and inherit the capital raised.The first few years following the launch of the $100 billion Vision Fund in 2017 were marked by a hurricane of dealmaking by SoftBank, as the unit built up its portfolio of startups. But after losing billions from its investment in WeWork, the Japanese conglomerate has changed course. It’s raised 4.3 trillion yen ($41 billion) by selling stakes in holdings including T-Mobile US Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and its domestic telecom unit. SoftBank has also signed a $40 billion-deal to sell Arm to Nvidia Corp.SoftBank is now looking at ways to deploy the cash it’s raised, and has recently launched an asset management unit that’s putting money into public securities. However, Misra dismissed reports the company was a “whale” responsible for roiling public tech markets.“Are we buying a few billion of other stocks to diversify away from the Alibaba we sold in the past six months?” Misra asked. “We’re still sitting on a lot of cash. It’s a liquidity-management strategy, it’s a diversification strategy.”SoftBank’s SPAC will target later-stage growth companies, and be part of SoftBank Investment Advisors, the investment arm that houses the Vision Fund. While the exact size of the SPAC wasn’t clear, Misra hinted that SoftBank could invest $500 million.The Vision Fund has backed scores of startups, including WeWork, Didi Chuxing Inc. and Grab Holdings Inc.. Misra didn’t comment on whether SoftBank would use SPACs to take its portfolio companies public, though many of them would likely consider an initial public offering in the next year or so.“A SPAC is right for a good growth company which had plans to go public a year from now or nine months from now and uses this window of buoyant capital markets,” Misra said.So far this year, more than 100 SPACs have raised over $40 billion on U.S. stock exchanges. One of the Vision Fund’s own companies, property technology firm Opendoor, said last month it was going public through a merger with a blank-check company led by Chamath Palihapitiya, a prolific SPAC manager.Misra argued that SPACs are a result of surging public markets, where investors are striving for new opportunities. He cautioned they can be abused and that investors need to pay careful attention to management talent, sponsor fees and other details.Misra gave a hypothetical example of a “good growth company” that wants to raise $1 billion at a valuation of $3 billion and later go public. “We say we want to invest in you,” he said. “The deal is we’ll put in $500 million, we’ll raise $500 million in a SPAC fundraising. It’s just an investment in the company.”(Updates with additional reporting in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","SoftBank, Armed With Billions in Cash, Joins Blank Check Binge"

2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPhone 12 5G, the most anticipated phone in years, will be given away for free by AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., showing the carriers are gearing up to fight hard for new subscribers during a potentially huge upgrade cycle.The promotions announced Tuesday coincide with Apple’s introduction of its first 5G iPhone. Customers can begin placing orders online starting Friday, according to the companies. They’ll have to sign up for unlimited plans and trade in qualifying phones.The 5G iPhone is Apple’s biggest product introduction of the year, and the first major redesign of the popular handset since 2017. The wireless industry has been awaiting this event for more than a year, and as the giveaways suggest, each carrier is eager to use the moment to win or at least solidify its customer base.The offers are a gamble that if the mobile-service providers cover the cost of the phones over a two-year-plus payment schedule, subscribers will be inclined to sign on for higher-priced unlimited plans. The free offer is available on the $799 iPhone 12, but not on the $699 mini, the $999 Pro or the $1,099 Max, according to the carriers.Read more: Apple launches iPhone 12 with 5G speeds, new screensWhile all of the companies require a qualifying trade-in device and an unlimited plan, AT&T is offering free iPhones to both new and existing customers. Verizon is only offering free iPhones to new customers. Existing Verizon customers can get a new iPhone for $15 a month if they qualify.Given the sluggish pace of phone sales over the past few years, the arrival of a next-generation iPhone has been expected to trigger a robust upgrade cycle. But as AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said last month, demand could be tempered by tough economic conditions and job losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Ready or NotReady or not, the jump to 5G could be thorny for the carriers if customers are disappointed by a lack of dramatic speed improvement on their expensive new phones.U.S. carriers have spent billions of dollars upgrading their networks with fifth-generation wireless technology that promise 10 times faster speeds than current connections. Verizon on Tuesday became the third carrier to boast about having nationwide 5G coverage. But at the moment, the super-fast 5G experience is only available in limited areas as the carriers continue to expand their networks.T-Mobile US Inc. is also in the promotion game. The carrier, now second largest in the U.S. thanks to its Sprint Corp. merger, is offering two iPhone 12 Pros for $100 each to new customers with trade-ins. It’s also selling the new iPhone for half off with a trade-in.AT&T is also offering deals on Google Android phones. Android shoppers looking for new 5G devices can get as much as $700 off Samsung, LG and Motorola phones with trade-ins, as long as they sign on to an AT&T 5G unlimited plan.(Updates with timing of the offer in the second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Free Apple 5G iPhones Are Offered by Carriers to Lure Upgraders
2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. unveiled its latest range of iPhones, a product line that Wall Street expects will kick off a new cycle of sales growth for the world’s largest technology company.At a virtual event on Tuesday, the company showed off the iPhone 12 in black, red, blue, green and white with a 6.1-inch screen. It starts at $799. A smaller version, the iPhone 12 mini, costs $699. The phones use aluminum sides.There’s also an iPhone 12 Pro, starting at $999 and a iPhone 12 Pro Max that costs at least $1,099, both with stainless steel edges. The Max has a 6.7-inch (17 cm) screen, Apple’s largest ever, while the regular Pro has a 6.1-inch display. They come in blue, gold, graphite or silver.Some analysts praised Apple’s pricing strategy, especially the $699 mini handset which may entice users with older, smaller iPhones to upgrade.“The pricing dynamics are the killer app for the phone launch,” Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler & Co. wrote in a research note. “Pricing was lower than our expectation, which is important in the current global pandemic.” Cheaper devices may help increase Apple’s installed base of devices, driving further growth of more profitable services, he added.The front of the phones looks similar to last year’s iPhone 11, but the edges are now flat instead of curved. They all support 5G, a new wireless standard that can transmit data as much as 10 times faster than the current 4G LTE technology.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant has generated relatively little sales growth from its marquee product in recent years as consumers hold onto their phones for longer. Quarterly revenue from this segment peaked in the first quarter of Apple’s 2018 fiscal year.This year’s crop of new iPhones marks the first major redesign in three years, which could prompt more upgrades and a new spurt of growth. Investors and analysts are also bullish on sales in China, where 5G networks are more built-out than in the U.S.“With our estimation that 350 million of 950 million iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, we believe this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for Apple,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.Apple shares slipped 2.7%, giving up gains of more than 6% from Monday ahead of the event.The handsets have a faster A14 processor and updated cameras and use sharper OLED screens, an improvement from last year’s cheaper LCD screens, Apple said. The company showcased major improvements to the iPhone 12 Pro Max cameras, including with video recording and zooming in during picture taking.The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro come out on Oct. 23, while the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max arrive Nov. 13. The first two models are available for pre-order on Oct. 16, while the second pair go on pre-sale Nov. 6. The iPhone 12 for T-Mobile and Sprint, as well as a version not tied to a carrier, costs $30 more than the Verizon and AT&T versions. That means the 64 GB version can be $829, rather than $799.Read more: Free 5G IPhones Offered by Carriers to Lure Upgraders“iPhone 12 mini hits the magic $699 price point,” longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster wrote on Twitter. “That’s a big deal and slightly expands iPhone’s addressable market. This is the first time in 7 years (iPhone 5S) that smaller form factor is part of flagship lineup.”5G support makes the phones theoretically capable of downloading data much faster, although that will mostly depend on wireless carriers updating their networks. Apple’s 5G launch comes over a year after Samsung Electronics Co. and other rivals started selling handsets supporting the standard.Apple said it tested 5G globally with 100 carriers. It added that the U.S. models will support faster millimeter wave technology. Verizon Communications Inc. Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg joined the event to announce nationwide 5G coverage in the U.S. and an expansion of its fastest, ultra wideband 5G service, which relies on millimeter wave spectrum.Citi analyst Jim Suva said the inclusion of millimeter wave in all U.S. iPhone 12 models was positive because there was concern before the event that this functionality would only be available in the higher-end devices.In the first quarter of this year, phone makers led by Samsung shipped 3.4 million 5G phones in the U.S., a fraction of the overall market, Strategy Analytics data show. In a few other countries, 5G has performed far better. A third of phone sales in China during the second quarter were 5G handsets, according to Counterpoint Research.Tests by IHS Markit’s RootMetrics across 125 U.S. areas in the first half of 2020 showed that 5G speeds on AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint are only slightly faster than 4G LTE. AT&T and T-Mobile, which bought Sprint, have both claimed their 5G networks are available “nationwide,” a metric that means they can reach 200 million people, but coverage is still often sporadic and data speeds are not consistently faster.The handsets also support a new magnetic version of wireless charging called MagSafe. That lets the phones magnetically attach to new charging pads from Apple and other providers. Apple will also offer several new cases to support the new charging system.Apple didn’t include headphones or a charging adapter with the new iPhones, a move it said would be beneficial to the environment. Citi’s Suva said excluding the accessories in the box could spur purchases of AirPods and new charging accessories.(Updates with analyst reactions throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Apple Launches iPhone 12 Line With 5G Speeds, New Screens"

2020-10-14,"Shares of T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $118.6.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-30  * Strike Price: $113.00  * Volume: 502  * Open Interest: 105Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Analyzing T-Mobile US's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-19,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. shares climbed to a new 20-year high as investors rally behind founder Masayoshi Son‘s more cautious strategy of selling assets, paring debt and buying back shares.The Tokyo-based company’s stock gained more than 3% to 7,244 yen, the highest level since March of 2000 in the midst of the dot-com boom. The stock had already hit several two-decade highs in the second half of this year after a record plunge in March with the coronavirus pandemic.Long known for his extravagant spending on acquisitions and investments, Son reversed course this year after the Covid-19 outbreak and management missteps. He unveiled plans to sell 4.5 trillion yen ($43 billion) in assets and buy back a record 2.5 trillion yen of his own stock. Shares are up more than 160% from their March low.“It’s a big turning point for SoftBank,” said Naoki Fujiwara, chief fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co. “They reversed course to defensive from offensive, shining a spotlight on the value of their assets.”By the end of June, Son had offloaded $13.7 billion of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. stock, an even larger chunk of his stake in T-Mobile US Inc. and some shares of SoftBank Corp., the Japanese telecommunications affiliate. He then announced the sale of chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for about $40 billion and sold an additional chunk of SoftBank Corp. for more than $10 billion.In a conference call in August, Son said that the Covid-19 fallout had persuaded him to pull back.

2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Google doled out more than $1 billion last year to U.S. mobile carriers to distribute its search engine, according to the landmark antitrust lawsuit from the Justice Department.The DOJ suit, filed Tuesday, details several methods Google uses to make its search the default service on browsers, smartphones and other devices. That includes deals with Apple Inc. and Android manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co.Read the U.S. antitrust suit against Alphabet Inc.’s Google here.Google also cut hefty revenue sharing agreements with major mobile carriers to box out competing search engines and browsers, the Justice Department said. In exchange for placing Google search as the default on phones, carriers received a portion of search advertising revenue.“If a carrier or manufacturer does not renew its revenue sharing agreement with Google, the distributor loses out on revenue share not only for new mobile devices but also for the phones and tablets previously sold and in the hands of consumers,” the Justice Department said in the suit. “This provision is punitive to the carrier or manufacturer and helps to ensure that carriers and manufacturers will not stray from Google.”Last year, Google paid major U.S. carriers, collectively, more than $1 billion, the DOJ noted. A 2014 Google document in the lawsuit showed that Google paid $460 million for these deals, which are typically set for two to three years.The filing did not specify which carriers were involved in these deals, however the largest providers in the U.S. are Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.Soon after the suit hit, Kent Walker, Google’s head of global affairs, rejected the complaint’s claims. “Our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software,” Walker wrote in a blog post.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Locks In Search Monopoly With $1 Billion to Carriers

2020-10-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The logic behind AT&T Inc.’s acquisition of $170 billion of entertainment assets and their affiliated debt these last few years was difficult to comprehend from the start. The company had a perfectly good wireless business. How could entangling itself in an unfamiliar and highly competitive industry, and in a big way, be anything but a distraction?  Perhaps AT&T is struggling with that rationale now, too.The company opened its third-quarter earnings release Thursday with a curious line referring to its “market focus areas of wireless and fiber broadband,” in which it saw an unexpectedly large increase in subscribers. Although wireless has traditionally been AT&T’s core business, its splashy WarnerMedia purchase and new HBO Max video-streaming app have been the focus both inside and outside the company even as that strategy has taken an inauspicious turn. Former CEO Randall Stephenson and his recent successor, John Stankey, had shared the vision that controlling a wireless network and streaming-TV content would fuel mutual growth and customer loyalty, a synergistic relationship meant to give it an advantage over pure-play rivals like Verizon Communications Inc. and Walt Disney Co. Yet AT&T’s share price reached a decade low heading into earnings, and its shareholder losses this year far outpace those of Disney and Verizon.The plan isn’t working too well. As streaming gets its time to shine, HBO is losing its luster, just as investors feared it would under AT&T. Meanwhile, Comcast Corp. is facing similar questions; an activist shareholder may be angling for a divestiture of the company’s bruised entertainment operations so that its focus can return to the more stable cable side. Quibi, a streaming upstart, is also throwing in the towel after making mistakes not all that different from the ones AT&T is making — prioritizing technology over programming, charging a relatively steep price and not doing enough promotion. Netflix Inc. makes it all look so easy.AT&T reported Thursday that HBO and HBO Max together had 38 million U.S. subscribers as of September and 57 million globally. That may not sound terribly far behind Disney+, which had more than 57 million as of June. But HBO Max also had a jump start of about 30 million subscribers from the legacy HBO network. The latest figure suggests that it added merely 3.4 million in the U.S. this year — the year of a pandemic that’s made the television set the center of households once again and left consumers starving for anything to watch. For perspective, Netflix gained 28 million new subscribers this year — basically an entire HBO. AT&T’s wireless operations continue to be the most attractive piece of the conglomerate, making Stephenson and Stankey’s dealmaking seem unnecessary at best and harmful at worst. But it’s still a bit early to judge. As Hollywood slowly resumes Covid-safe productions, and as Netflix nears a price hike that potentially puts it neck and neck with HBO Max’s $15-a-month fee, AT&T’s streaming business has a chance at redemption. Stankey said Thursday that about 130 productions are back in motion. It’s also gutting costs with thousands of job cuts planned within WarnerMedia.  Disney is restructuring its own TV and film businesses so that they all become workhorses for Disney+ as consumers continue to ditch cable and avoid movie theaters. While investors remain skeptical of AT&T’s and Comcast’s streaming moves, Disney’s stock has been rewarded for its efforts despite the company’s biggest profit centers being walloped by the pandemic more than most. AT&T’s best business continues to be wireless, and all it took for AT&T’s stock to get a nice pop were some signs of improvement in that division and bit of downplaying of the entertainment side. Its shares jumped 5% after adding more wireless customers than expected and showing lower churn. The improvement includes its premium unlimited data plan, which is bundled with HBO Max, though executives didn’t stress that as the reason. T-Mobile US Inc. has a spectrum advantage heading into 5G, and Verizon was Apple Inc.’s launch partner for its new 5G-enabled iPhone, so AT&T has work to do in proving HBO Max will give it the edge it needs. If it can’t do that, there are detour signs for the breakup path that Comcast is being steered toward. Clearly, AT&T’s DirecTV division needs to go — it never made sense for AT&T to own it. But just because HBO had the prestige and fanfare going in doesn’t mean it’s a good fit for AT&T, either.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-10-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Welcome to the four flavors of 5G.Now that people have their hands on the first Apple Inc. 5G iPhones, they will see service indicators showing either 5G, 5G E, 5G UW or 5G+, a battling iconography that says fifth-generation wireless has finally arrived.Mobile-service providers, like any consumer company, can’t resist the opportunity to slap on a logo or coin a buzzy new abbreviation. The five bars that measure signal strength weren’t enough -- the carriers have now each crafted their own unique symbols to help brand the 5G experience.Can you blame them? Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and AT&T Inc. each have invested billions of dollars in airwaves and network equipment, hoping to get a slice of the $1.15 trillion in revenue the industry expects to generate by 2025.Speed sells. This newest generation of wireless technology is being pitched as providing “mind-bending improvements in speed” over today’s connections. Never mind that at this early stage of network buildout, most people won’t notice a difference between 4G and 5G.4G basically turned up the speed of the data flying through the existing infrastructure. Early 5G is just as fast, but as networks expand and add more capacity it will be like going from a two-lane road to a superhighway.5G signals travel on a broad range of frequencies, from low band through midband and up to high band, which is known as millimeter wave. Each band has its own characteristics. For example, low-band signals can travel through walls and deep into buildings. High frequencies are limited in range but are already reaching speeds of 4 gigabits per second, about four times faster than today’s fiber-optic desktop connections.Early customers may be baffled at the sameness of 5G service, said Roger Entner, a wireless-industry expert at Recon Analytics, “but they’ll also have a device in their hand that’s part of an upcoming era of invention that will make our jaws drop.”Here’s an attempt to decode some of the 5G lingo.5G EThe 5G symbol people have already been seeing doesn’t designate real 5G at all. AT&T wanted to be the first with 5G but the equipment wasn’t ready, so it souped up its 4G network and called it 5G E (for “evolution”). Sprint Corp. sued, saying AT&T was deceiving customers. The companies settled last year, and AT&T still uses the icon.5GA format called OFDM, or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, provides the promised next-generation jump in performance. Like its 2G and 3G ancestors CDMA (code division multiple access) or TDMA (time division multiple access), OFDM sprays more signals faster.5G+AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey calls this “holy cow 5G.” You might have to take his word for it, because AT&T’s high-speed millimeter-wave service is only available in certain parts of 36 U.S. cities so far.5G UWVerizon calls its millimeter-wave service “ultra-wideband,” or UW. But like 5G+, good luck finding it. Verizon has the service in parts of 55 cities, aiming to reach at least 60 by year-end. This is also the service Verizon is using to beam broadband into homes.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple 5G iPhones Arrive With an Alphabet Soup of Abbreviations
2020-10-26,"(Bloomberg) -- A victory by Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election could usher in an abrupt change in the nation’s telecommunications policy, restoring so-called net neutrality regulation and shifting the Republican drive to rein in social media outlets, among other things.“Democrats are more comfortable with an activist role,” Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant said in an interview.Biden hasn’t talked much about the FCC during the campaign, but his party’s platform is specific. It calls for restoring net neutrality rules put in place under then-President Barack Obama when Biden served as vice president and taking a harder line on telecommunications mergers.And the Democratic commissioners on the FCC have already objected to the agency’s steps to strip the social media companies of liability protections they have for what users post in response to alleged favoritism by the platforms for liberal points of view.That last issue will be in the spotlight on Wednesday when the CEOs of Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee that is considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that shields their platforms from liability.Current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who was appointed to the post by President Donald Trump, has taken up a Trump administration demand for a tougher social media policy. Earlier in his term he reversed Democratic policies on net neutrality and waved through T-Mobile US Inc.’s bid to buy Sprint Corp.If Biden wins, the FCC, which currently is at full five-member strength, could begin the new presidential term with a 2-to-1 Democratic majority, allowing it to move quickly. A Republican commissioner is leaving at the end of the current Congress and chairmen traditionally depart as a new administration arrives.Pai hasn’t indicated what he’ll do. He can stay on as a commissioner but a new president could strip him of the chairmanship and its power to control what policies advance to a vote. An FCC spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about Pai’s plans.If Pai stays after a Biden win, “he’s denuded of power to do much of anything except to block things,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a Washington telecommunications lawyer.The dynamic means initiatives left incomplete by Pai -- for instance the social-media rulemaking -- could be targeted for elimination by Democrats.Companies “must brace for impacts from the 2020 election,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Schettenhelm said in a Sept. 30 note.Policy areas likely to receive attention include:Social MediaBoth the Democratic commissioners -- and an outgoing Republican -- have criticized efforts by Pai and the Trump administration to weaken Section 230 legal protections.Ultimately, changes to the law may require an act of Congress. But the FCC’s general counsel recently said he believes Pai has authority to alter the agency’s interpretation of the measure and Pai -- at the urging of Trump -- says he will.“There is a very broad political constituency on both the right and left that want to change it,” Blair Levin, a Washington-based analyst for New Street Research said in an interview. “It’s a clear and easy target.”There is disagreement about the changes that are needed, however. Democrats want the social media companies to do more to control disinformation and Republicans say with little evidence the sites unfairly suppress conservative views.Net NeutralityRestoring net neutrality rules that were eliminated by Pai in 2017 has become a popular cause on the left. The rules written by Democrats in 2015 barred broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. from unfairly using their management of data traffic to favor their own content over rivals’ fare. But a Democratic-majority FCC would likely stop short of dictating prices charged by broadband companies.“Are they going to reimpose net neutrality? Yep. Are they going to impose price regulation? I don’t think so,” said Gallant, the Cowen analyst.Arguments over the demise of net neutrality rules continue. Pai recently said more and faster broadband connections serve to refute critics. Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the agency’s policy makes it easer for broadband companies to block websites.Digital DivideAnother top Democratic priority is closing the digital divide that, according to the party platform, leaves more than 20 million Americans without high-speed internet access.The problem is a centerpiece for two possible contenders to be named by a President Biden to lead the agency. Mignon Clyburn, a former FCC commissioner, has called for larger subsidies to expand broadband access. And Rosenworcel, the FCC commissioner, advocates steps to ensure internet access for all. Lobbyists and analysts cited both as possible choices to lead the agency.Clyburn is considered to have an edge if she wants to return to the agency where she spent nine years including time as interim chairman: she is the daughter of House Majority Whip James Clyburn, whose support helped Biden win the Democratic primary in Clyburn’s South Carolina and set the former vice president on his path to the nomination.Broadband SubsidiesOn Capitol Hill, Representative Clyburn has called for investing $80 billion over five years to expand broadband access. Mignon Clyburn has backed a call to boost the current federal broadband subsidy to $50 a month, from less than $10. Since leaving the agency in 2018, she has formed a consultancy and joined the boards of TV and film company Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and waste manager Charah Solutions Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When reached by telephone Oct. 16 she declined to comment.MergersDeals to combine wireless companies would face tougher scrutiny than they have under Republican leadership. Pai’s FCC cleared T-Mobile US Inc. to buy Sprint Corp. over Democratic objections.“It’s going to be a new day,” said Gigi Sohn, a former Democratic FCC aide. “I wouldn’t take any merger for granted.”The T-Mobile deal, which was finalized in April, reduced the number of U.S. national mobile providers from four to three. Democrats may seek to bolster competition by finding ways to strengthen wireless offerings by Dish Network Corp. and cable providers, Gallant said.Data CapsThe FCC may move to bar broadband providers from exempting their own entertainment or media offerings from data caps. Pai squelched an agency move toward doing so soon after taking office in 2016. Such rules would give Netflix Inc. and Dish’s streaming service a clearer path to consumers, since viewers wouldn’t risk extra fees by loading up on those companies’ videos.Media Ownership, SpectrumThe Supreme Court is to consider letting the FCC ease some rules that limit radio and TV station ownership. A ruling may be handed down by June, and could let the rule changes go ahead. A Democratic FCC wouldn’t be likely to pursue further changes aggressively.Democrats like Republicans will work to allocate more frequencies for use by fast 5G signals, said Gallant and Schettenhelm.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Biden Win Could Curb Deals, Revive Net Neutrality in FCC Pivot"

2020-11-04,"The Federal Communications Commission’s Enforcement Bureau has announced that T-Mobile (TMUS) will pay a $200 million penalty to the U.S. Treasury to resolve an investigation of its subsidiary Sprint’s compliance with the Commission’s rules regarding waste, fraud, and abuse in the Lifeline program for low-income consumers.According to the FCC, the payment is the largest fixed-amount settlement the Commission has ever secured to resolve an investigation.The settlement comes after an Enforcement Bureau investigation into reports that Sprint, prior to its merger with T-Mobile, was claiming monthly subsidies for serving 885,000 Lifeline subscribers even though those subscribers were not using the service, in potential violation of the Commission’s “non-usage” rule.The FCC investigations showed that companies were aggressively selling free Lifeline service, knowing that they would get paid each month even if consumers didn’t use their phones. Since there was no bill, consumers had no incentive to relinquish the subscription.The matter initially came to light as a result of an investigation by the Oregon Public Utility Commission.In addition to paying a $200 million civil penalty, Sprint agreed to enter into a compliance plan to help ensure future adherence to the Commission’s rules for the Lifeline program.“Lifeline is key to our commitment to bringing digital opportunity to low-income Americans, and it is especially critical that we make the best use of taxpayer dollars for this vital program,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.Earlier this year, Sprint and T-Mobile merged, with Sprint continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of T-Mobile.Shares in TMUS are up 4.5% in Wednesday’s trading, with shares having gained over 48% year-to-date. Analysts have a bullish outlook on the stock with a Strong Buy Street consensus and $136 average analyst price target (17% upside potential).Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson has just kicked off coverage on T-Mobile with a buy rating and $140 price target, indicating 21% upside potential lies ahead.The analyst explained: “We believe T-Mobile is poised to take advantage of sector shifts and its newfound spectrum leadership; while already a consensus long and we acknowledge 3Q/4Q competition concerns, Sprint churn, and Biden tax plan concerns, the recent pull-back presents an attractive entry point for mid- to long-term investors.” (See TMUS stock analysis on TipRanks)Related News:  Wendy’s Drops 4% In Pre-Market As Quarterly Sales Disappoint  Baker Hughes Snaps Up Compact Carbon Capture For Energy Transition Path  AT&T Mulls Sale Of DirecTV Stake – Report More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Novavax, Australia Ink Deal For 40M Covid Vaccine Doses; Shares Rise   * Hilton Surprises With Quarterly Profit As Demand Steps Up; Shares Gain   * Wendy’s Drops 4% In Pre-Market As Quarterly Sales Disappoint   * General Dynamics IT Unit Wins $4.4B Defense Cloud Contract",T-Mobile Will Pay $200M Penalty In Sprint Lifeline Settlement

The pandemic crash surprised us all. But savvy investors used tools to avoid the obvious mistakes. Late in January, stocks were rallying out of control, even though we had warnings from China. It made no sense to make new highs when second-largest economy had completely closed. I warned about staying long Nokia stock after a strong rally it had back then. It had just rallied 25% on a bounce from the disastrous reaction to the October 2019 earnings report. Even though I didn’t catch the top exactly, I would have saved investors a lot of losses and heartache.
Winning in the stock market starts by not making unforced errors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is very dangerous. It is innate to everyone and pushes us to chase trends. Those who do it late suffer consequences in their portfolios. Investors need to learn a skill to help them resist the FOMO. It is crucial for us to have the ability to leave profits on the table. Another thing that is essential is the guts to book a loss before it balloons. This is especially critical with a fast mover like this.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Opportunity in Nokia Stock Starts in 2021

We’ve all been waiting for 5G for what seems like an eternity. Finally, all the handset makers and service providers are ready for it.


					7 Data-Driven Stocks for a Wave of Innovation 				

T-Mobile’s (NASDAQ:TMUS) latest earnings report showed that the industry is healthy. This should help Nokia come out of its doldrums. It may take months, but it has fallen far enough that it’s worth a shot. The Covid-19 crash test should stand as a cement floor. I doubt that there will be a lower-low soon. This is a base from which the bulls can engineer a comeback.

The fundamentals are not likely to be a source of worry. It has a trailing 12-month price-earnings-ratio of 21x. Looking forward, the P/E drops to 14x, so it’s not rich. The price-to-sales is under one, which is an indication that investors have realistic expectations. There is not a lot of hope built into the current stock price. Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that there’s also no growth on the income statement. We can find points of entry and exits with confidence on Nokia’s stock chart.
From the 12 months trend I surmise that it likely has more upside. Perhaps it can fill the gap from the earnings debacle. Expanding the view we quickly realize that Nokia stock has been in a hideous downward spiral from its highs. It’s depressing to see it come down from $62 a share to this. I propose that the channel range still allows for this swing trade higher within it.
It is important to note that this is a trade not an investment. I can’t bet on a long-term recovery effort yet. The bears have had their claws into it for years. It’s up to Nokia’s management to prove that they deserve the benefit of the doubt now. So far, there’s no evidence of that; therefore, it is important to know when to get out.
Better Be Safe Than Sorry
A drop below $3.20 would signal a much lower target that could even breach the March lows. Conversely, if a rally materializes here, NOK will face resistance near $4 per share. Since we defined the opportunity as a trade, it is important to book some profits there. If the bulls can break through the resistance band, they can reach for $5 or higher.
The macroeconomic conditions have not improved much and this has to work within it. The globe is still wrapped up in a hideous virus situation. Going into the colder months, infection rates are expanding and we still await a vaccine. Until then, Nokia’s business will continue to face headwinds.
This is all to say that expectations should be realistic. Knowing when to book a loss early is extremely important. I wouldn’t mind sitting on losses in company like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). I don’t do it inside a descending channel like this one. Nokia stock is cheap on its face value because it’s under $4. That doesn’t mean it can’t lose you 100% of your money. Don’t let the low sticker price fool you into taking oversized volatile speculative risk.

While the shares of several tech companies are climbing at breakneck speeds, Nokia stock is meandering along at a sluggish pace. After a brief period trading over $5.00, the shares are now changing hands for around $3.50.

Granted, a few recent developments have not done Nokia stock any favors. Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) won a $6.65 billion contract to provide wireless communication network equipment to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in the U.S. for the next five years. Meanwhile, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is using Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson’s (NASDAQ:ERIC) equipment to enable 5G in New York City, with Nokia’s equipment relegated for use on the 4G network.
These developments come just as the company was building up some steam. In the last few quarters, Nokia managed to increase its operating cash flow, especially after its dividend was suspended.  Its new CEO, Pekka Lundmark, has drawn praise after his predecessor, Rajeev Suri, received a lot of flack for becoming complacent about Nokia’s 5G position.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The 5G market is fairly large, since the whole world will eventually use it. So even though it may seem like Nokia’s piece of the pie is shrinking, it’s still a big slice.
Nokia stock is practically a steal at its current levels. I think investors should take the contrarian view and pour capital into the shares, especially when conservative analysts criticize it.


					7 Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now For The Future				

Nokia Remains Powerful
Regular readers of my columns will know I’ve been bullish on Nokia stock for quite some time. My view hasn’t changed. In fact, I believe that value investors who don’t buy the shares are forgoing a golden opportunity.

It’s important to note that 5G, is a marathon and not a sprint. As I mentioned earlier, the whole world will eventually shift from 4G to 5G. Although the pandemic has stalled the transition’s progress, it has also advanced the change in some ways .
In the U.S., it’s believed  that approximately half the workforce is still working remotely. A majority of these workers want to continue doing so after the pandemic is over.
Further, consumers are streaming more  content than ever since traditional entertainment outlets like concerts and movie theatres are still not considered safe. Carriers need more and better bandwidth to handle all that extra demand.
That brings us back to Nokia. While it’s true that the company lost a lot of contracts recently, there are several contracts it has won as well. Look no further than Europe, Nokia’s home market. Spanish carrier Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) and France’s Orange (NYSE:ORAN) are both buying their equipment from Nokia. Simultaneously, the company is also building an optical network in mainland China for the country’s State Grid Corp.
An Important Partnership
Much has been said about the Nokia-Verizon partnership. Undoubtedly, Nokia will be hurt by its recent loss to Samsung . But that doesn’t mean that Verizon has completely washed its hands of Nokia.
Just recently, Verizon tapped Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nokia to help its clients build private 5G networks. A private 5G network is a local area network that offers restricted, dedicated bandwidth using 5G-capable spectrum.
The networks will allow clients to automate their factory floor processes and run data-intensive applications. Overseas, where Verizon doesn’t have a presence, it will use Nokia to build private networks for manufacturing and logistics companies.
Nokia Stock Is a Deep-Value Name
There are several excellent articles on this website that will help you find genuine bargains that can pay back phenomenally over the long term. I believe Nokia deserves a place on this list, considering the stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.30 times,  while Ericsson, its next biggest rival, trades at 18.35 times.
I expect Nokia stock to rebound above the $4.00 support line and continue its ascent to $5 per share.  And  Nokia posted positive operating cash flow \in Q3. All signs point to a repeat in Q4.
As of the end of Q3, Nokia had $9.25 billion of cash and short-term investments. If it has anywhere close to the same cash when it reports its Q4 results, its dividend will likely be reinstated.
So, any way you slice it, there are plenty of reasons to invest in Nokia stock.

The stock is currently above from its 52 week high by 0.32%.  The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

2020-11-06,"(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. has been called many things over its 135-year history: Ma Bell, monopoly, media conglomerate. The company, which traces its roots to the patent rights of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, was the dominant phone company for much of the 20th century. So dominant, in fact, that it was broken up in 1982 as part of an agreement with antitrust authorities. But those businesses eventually began to merge, culminating with SBC Communications — one of the so-called Baby Bells — acquiring AT&T in 2005 and taking the name.That wasn’t the end of it. What followed was a streak of deal-making that turned AT&T into a new behemoth spanning television, media and advertising. After a failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, becoming the biggest provider of pay television. It purchased Time Warner in 2018 for $85 billion, making Ma Bell the improbable parent company of HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DC Comics. The carrier also made smaller deals, such as the 2018 acquisition of AppNexus, an online ad platform.And once again, AT&T was too big.This time around, it isn’t the government pushing to slim down the company — though the Justice Department did unsuccessfully oppose the Time Warner deal — but its own investors and Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.Stankey took the helm in July, putting him in charge of a company with heavy debt and a media business that was ravaged by the pandemic. AT&T also was shunted to No. 3 in the wireless-phone business this year, following T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp. The company had just launched HBO Max, an attempt to take on Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in streaming, but perhaps the most urgent matter was undoing some of the work of his predecessor.The last CEO, Randall Stephenson, had spent much of his 13-year tenure obsessed with deals. He kept a color-coded roster of potential companies he wanted AT&T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions. Now Stankey has his own to-do list: things he wants to sell.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have urged AT&T to focus on its subscriber services and walk back its go-big-or-go-home M&A strategy by divesting acquisitions, including DirecTV.“When you look at what’s worked or hasn’t worked in telecom, you see that conglomerates and empire building has not been rewarded by the marketplace,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist with the Private Bank at Union Bank.Stankey, who has spent his entire 35-year career at AT&T, may be an unlikely person to dismantle AT&T’s acquisition empire. He rode shotgun as a top captain during Stephenson’s decade of agglomeration. The executive had a hand in creating some of the current problems and he calls them out directly: Last month, he acknowledged that pay-TV providers like DirecTV will probably face years of cord cutting before they hit bottom.Now, more than 100 days into the job, he says his plan of attack is to focus on three key growth areas: wireless — particularly 5G — where there’s hope for new consumer and business applications; fiber-optic network connections to accommodate surging data traffic; and HBO Max, the online streaming future of AT&T’s video ambitions.As for new acquisitions, don’t expect much beyond opportunistic purchases, Stankey said in an interview in September. “Right now this management team is focused on getting execution right and moving the distractions elsewhere,” he said. “It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Last month, AT&T got $1.1 billion for its stake in Central European Media Enterprises. The company has already sold office buildings and a stake in Disney’s streaming service Hulu. It also got nearly $2 billion from the sale of its Puerto Rico phone business earlier this month.The company is aiming to pay down debt and cut $6 billion in annual costs, partly through slashing thousands of jobs.But AT&T still has plenty of potential businesses to sell or scale back. The question now is how big an asset sale it wants to have — and who may be interested in buying.DirecTVThe biggest priority is DirecTV and AT&T’s other pay-TV operations, which have been hemorrhaging customers.  AT&T has been exploring options for DirecTV for more than a year, but finding a buyer for the whole business seems unlikely.A combination with Dish Network Corp., the nation’s other satellite-TV provider, is one scenario. But reducing the industry to a single player would draw antitrust scrutiny, especially since rural customers have few other options. A proposed combination of the two businesses was shot down by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department in 2002.Instead, AT&T is trying to sell a stake — and possibly control of the business — to outside investors. a move that could take some of the drag off AT&T’s performance. But the ice cube is melting fast: Pay-TV revenue fell by more than $1 billion, or 10%, in the third quarter.Apollo Global Management Inc. has been in discussions about such a transaction. And Bloomberg News reported this week that former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein could do a deal through his blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV. Ideally, an agreement would let AT&T remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.But a deal is expected to value DirecTV at only about $15 billion when final bids are accepted next month. That's less than a third of the price AT&T paid five years ago.VrioAT&T’s DirecTV Latin America business suffers some of the same problems as the U.S. operations, only with an even more erratic political backdrop. The 2015 acquisition of DirecTV included satellite businesses in South America and the Caribbean — an entity that was renamed Vrio. The unit’s biggest problem was its Venezuela pay-TV business. During the country’s political turmoil, the service was shut down after getting caught between U.S. restrictions and the local government.AT&T tried but failed to spin off part of Vrio in an initial public offering. Then, after reducing the size and price of the offer, AT&T abandoned the move. For the past two years, the falling value of the satellite-TV business has made prospects of unloading the business even dimmer.Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentUnlike some of its businesses, AT&T’s video-game division would be a prized asset for a number of potential buyers. The company has reportedly explored a sale of the operations, which are estimated to be worth $4 billion. But AT&T recently pulled the business off a list of noncore assets that it's willing to part with.The unit, whose video games include titles like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and Mortal Kombat 11, attracted interest from several major companies. But with the gaming industry booming during the pandemic — and AT&T facing the complications of wanting to retain licensing rights — the company may have decided the division was worth keeping for itself.CrunchyrollThe animation video service was the first step in AT&T’s massive pivot to media six years ago. Crunchyroll was acquired through the company’s newly formed joint venture with the Chernin Group, called Otter Media. The name is derived from the abbreviation OTT, for content delivered via the internet “over the top” of a traditional platform. Since then, just “streaming” has become the more popular term.AT&T bought out the remaining stake in Otter Media from the Chernin Group in 2018. More recently, the telecom giant has had second thoughts. Last week, the Nikkei business daily reported that Sony Corp. was in final talks to acquire the service in a deal worth close to $1 billion.CNNCNN is one of the more controversial businesses that AT&T acquired when it absorbed WarnerMedia in 2018, with the president regularly assailing the cable-news network on social media. It's also been the source of takeover speculation, with Jeff Bezos seen as a potential buyer. But Stankey said in September that CNN was one of the pieces of the WarnerMedia structure that are “more tightly wound together than they were before.” In other words, selling it would seem less likely. XandrAT&T had high hopes for the AppNexus digital advertising unit it acquired for $1.6 billion in 2018. Named in a nod to Alexander Graham Bell, Xandr was going to be an advertising network that all pay-TV providers could use. Ad-industry veteran Brian Lesser was hired to run the operation, and Stephenson told investors that the business would bring in $2 billion in new revenue by using customer data to deliver targeted ads.Those fortunes didn’t materialize. Lesser left, and now it’s up for sale as new WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar brings in another ad team.Regional Sports NetworksAT&T has four regional sports networks, or RSNs, which include rights to teams such as hockey’s Pittsburgh Penguins, basketball’s Houston Rockets and baseball’s Seattle Mariners.Though live sports are still the closest thing to must-see TV these days, owning RSNs has increasingly become a headache. Sports leagues have sought ever-increasing sums for rights to their games, and subscribers aren’t as reliable as they once were. Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. just wrote down its RSNs by $4.23 billion, an admission that it overpaid for the cable channels, which it only acquired last year.Looking for cash to pay down debts, AT&T had hoped to sell its RSNs and cash in on their $1 billion in estimated value. The company sought bids last year, but a buyer didn’t materialize. This year, with sports still trying to bounce back from Covid-19, a sale seems even less likely.Digital LifeIn a bold attempt to take on home-security giant ADT Inc., AT&T launched its own “smart home” security and monitoring venture in 2013. While the effort was intended to explore opportunities beyond its wireless service, the timing and model may have been wrong. Homeowners were already moving away from expensive security services and buying do-it-yourself systems or products like Ring from Amazon.com Inc. or Nest from Alphabet Inc. Four years into the venture, AT&T started looking for ways to get out.AT&T MexicoStephenson crossed borders and ended a decadeslong friendship with his onetime mentor Carlos Slim by becoming a direct competitor for mobile customers in Mexico. AT&T bought wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA for $2.5 billion in 2015 and expanded the service to cover most of Mexico by 2018. But Covid-19, foreign-exchange rates and the dominance of rival America Movil in Mexico has kept the investment unprofitable and difficult to justify.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”So what does Stankey do now? Holding out to get top dollar for some of these assets might not be the right approach, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen.Stankey just needs to “rip the Band-Aid off and move on,” Synesael said. In other words, take what he can get. “I think it has become obvious to him that he needs to do it. And the sooner he does it the better,” Synesael said. “He doesn’t want to spend his entire CEO tenure undoing what he and Randall did in the past. Get it done now so he can concentrate on other initiatives.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The Second Breakup of AT&T

2020-11-09,"Shares of T-Mobile rose 5.4% on Friday after its 3Q revenues soared 74% year-over-year to $19.3 billion and beat the Street estimates of $18.34 billion, thanks to higher subscriber base and benefits from its Sprint merger. 3Q earnings of $1 per share compared with analysts’ expectations of $0.46 per share, but remained flat on a year-over-year basis.T-Mobile US (TMUS) added “record-high” 2.04 million subscribers in 3Q, more than double the net additions of 1 million projected by analysts. The company’s postpaid net additions of 1,979,000 in 3Q were driven by “best in industry” postpaid phone net additions of 689,000, the company said.T-Mobile’s CEO Mike Sievert said “Customers are choosing T-Mobile in record numbers because we are the only ones that can deliver this combination of value and experience with a true 5G network that is available to customers in every single state.”The company also remains confident “to deliver $43 billion of synergies and achieve the $6 billion of annualized savings from the Sprint merger from a combination of cost avoidance and expense reductions.” T-Mobile is “targeting more than $1.2 billion of synergies in 2020,” from the merger.As for the second half of 2020, the company expects postpaid phone net customer additions of 1.3 million to 1.4 million, which includes 600,000 to 700,000 subscriber additions in 4Q. T-Mobile raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $13.6 billion to $13.7 billion, up from previous range of $12.4 billion to $12.7 billion. (See TMUS stock analysis on TipRanks)On Nov. 5, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan said “Management is executing well through COVID and making good progress on the merger integration with Sprint.” Horan added that “revenue growth is accelerating, and TMUS is very confident on delivering $6B in annualized cost savings.” The analyst maintained a Hold rating on the stock, saying “We've yet to see bumps in the road on integration or a major competitive response from peers.”Unlike Horan, the rests of the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 13 Buys vs. Oppenheimer's Hold. The average price target of $143.50 implies upside potential of about 16.1% to current levels.

2020-11-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is making his case for SoftBank Group Corp.’s turnaround.The Japanese conglomerate reported a record 784.4 billion yen ($7.6 billion) profit in its Vision Fund business for the three months ended Sept. 30, a sign the fund’s investments in startups are paying off amid a broad rally in technology stocks. One Chinese startup quadrupled SoftBank’s money after going public in August.Son also addressed nagging concerns about his stewardship. He revealed details about a controversial stock and options trading program, making clear the effort was relatively modest in scope and strategy. He even took steps to improve corporate governance by increasing the proportion of outside directors with the removal of four insiders, including Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure and Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra.“Masa, myself, should be most supervised,” Son joked in a question and answer session after the results. “More external directors mean better governance.”The Japanese billionaire took the stage at a briefing in Tokyo to explain how the company he founded four decades ago is coming back from record losses in the last fiscal year. The Vision Fund unit’s highest-ever profit cames as a global surge in technology shares lifted the value of stakes in public firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio. That helped the Tokyo-based company report net income of 627.5 billion yen for the quarter.“The Vision Fund’s performance was very encouraging,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anthea Lai said. “They have pulled off a U-turn.”The standout success for the quarter was a little-known Chinese startup called KE Holdings Inc. It runs an online property platform called Beike and its shares have surged since an initial public offering in August, handing SoftBank an unrealized gain of $5.1 billion on the investment for the quarter.In his presentation, Son said his original $1.35 billion investment is now worth $7.9 billion because shares have kept surging since the end of September. Still, he said that after WeWork, another real estate bet that lost him billions, Beike “wasn’t very popular” at first.Son’s disclosures about his stock and options trading may ease the concerns of some investors who sold off SoftBank shares after initial reports about derivatives bets in September. The company said the fair value of its futures and options positions came to $2.7 billion at the end of September, including long call options on listed stocks worth $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks with negative $1.26 billion of value.In response to media reports that SoftBank was the “Nasdaq whale” stoking the rally in tech stocks, Misra said publicly in October that SoftBank is “not even a dolphin, forget being a whale.”Son explained that recent investments in securities and derivatives are experiments in how to put its cash to use now that the company is selling assets. He pointed out that the options account for just 1.2% of the company’s shareholdings.That hasn’t stopped the skeptics.“It’s still not clear why a company like SoftBank is dabbling in derivatives,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “There is a chance they are mistaking their initial success at the Vision Fund for skill instead of luck. Now they are trying to replicate that with the public funds division.”SoftBank has also been putting capital into publicly traded stocks, part of an asset management effort revealed this year. It acquired 1.7 trillion yen of “highly liquid listed stocks” in the quarter, including a $6.3 billion investment in Amazon.com Inc., $2.2 billion in Facebook Inc. and $1.8 billion in Zoom Video Communications Inc. The operation is managed by its new subsidiary SB Northstar, in which Son personally holds a 33% stake.SoftBank has typically made investments in private startups, giving funds to companies like Uber and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to help them grow. The founder argued his bets on public stocks are consistent because he’s backing more mature companies with advanced capabilities in areas like artificial intelligence.“I can hear people saying, what’s he doing now investing in public companies,” Son said at the briefing. “These are investments in the AI revolution.”Separately, Son announced the most substantial changes to his board in years, a move toward stronger governance practices supported by activist investor Elliott Management Corp. Four internal directors -- Claure, Misra, Chief Strategy Officer Katsunori Sago and Yasir Al-Rumayyan of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund -- have resigned. That increases the proportion of outside directors because the changes leave the board with four independent members out of nine.SoftBank also said Chief Legal Officer Robert Townsend is leaving the company this month. The former co-chair of Morrison & Foerster’s Global M&A Practice Group joined SoftBank in August of 2018 to head its legal, compliance operations and corporate governance operations. Tim Mackey, who has served as deputy general counsel since November 2018, will take over from Townsend.The departure comes after SoftBank has lost several top executives, including the COO of the Vision Fund. SoftBank’s Chief Compliance Officer Chad Fentress left the company in September and vacated his WeWork board seat.Son has boosted his share price in part by selling off assets and buying back his own shares. After years of resisting, he’s sold stakes in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the Japan telecommunications unit. SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for $40 billion.The shift from running telecom and tech companies to investment management has left some investors and analysts perplexed.“It’s becoming difficult to tell what SoftBank is all about anymore,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies. “While investors are always keen to hear about Son’s vision for the company, it seems to be changing every quarter. What people really want is more consistency.”The billionaire argued that SoftBank is in fact very simple to understand: Investors should focus on a single metric -- net asset value, or the value of its shareholdings minus net debt. By that measure, the company is worth 27.3 trillion yen, a 5.6 trillion yen gain from half a year ago. SoftBank’s market capitalization was 14.8 trillion yen at the end of trading on Monday.“What is SoftBank? It’s a company that invests in the information revolution,” Son said. “That hasn’t changed even for a day since I founded it.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Recovery Gains Ground With Vision Fund’s Record Profit

2020-11-16,The Oracle of Omaha and his team had a very active third quarter. Here's a rundown of the all the moves they made.,Here Are the Stocks Warren Buffett Has Been Buying and Selling
2020-11-16,Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway released its newest holdings worth more than $1.8 billion with notable investments in some big pharma stocks like Merck and Pfizer. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre breaks it all down.,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reports new stakes in AbbVie, Pfizer, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb"
2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett is a living, breathing billionaire, but he’s also a leading economic indicator. So after his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. dumped almost $13 billion of stocks in the throes of the Covid-19 crisis, investors were beside themselves. They’ll now be quite relieved to see that his company is back in buying mode, making the biggest outlay for equity purchases in a year.And he’s not just making oddball bets, like Japanese trading houses and, yikes, gold. A filing late Monday showed that in the latest period Berkshire Hathaway bought a handful of U.S. pharmaceutical giants: AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. It also purchased a new stake in T-Mobile US Inc., the wireless carrier with the most enviable spectrum position heading into 5G, and Snowflake Inc., one of the hottest tech IPOs of the year. They’re part of the net $4.8 billion Berkshire spent buying equities during the period; it spent an additional $9 billion buying up its own shares.  The disclosure of Berkshire’s Pfizer holding — valued at $138 million as of Monday’s close — comes a week after the drugmaker announced that its Covid-19 vaccine has been more than 90% effective in preventing cases of the virus. Following up on the good news, Moderna Inc., another company in the Covid-19 vaccine race, said Monday that its formulation was 94.5% effective. Even so, my colleague Max Nisen tells me that Buffett’s pharma bets likely aren’t entirely vaccine-related, as that logic only really works for Pfizer. Instead, Buffett — or one of his investing deputies — probably sees broader value in the pharma space, which had been somewhat beaten down heading into the U.S. election on fears of a “blue wave” that would produce profit-crimping policies. Those fears aren’t quite so intense without Democrats taking control of the Senate, or at least not yet.Berkshire continued its banking purge — further reducing its stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. It also exited a $1.3 billion position in Costco Wholesale Corp., which I guess means Buffett didn’t take my suggestion to outright acquire the retailer for his next “elephant-sized” deal. But shares of Costco have risen 7% to an all-time high since the third quarter ended, and it just declared a whopping $10-a-share special dividend. Buffett is going to be hitting the See’s candies hard tonight!Read more: Buffett's Next Bulk Purchase Should Be Costco: Tara LachapelleBut it sure is good to see the investor, well, investing again. Right before the pandemic hit, Buffett said in a TV interview that he’s been a net buyer of stocks every year since he was 11 years old; he’s 90 now. It's incredible how a virus — and the mishandling thereof — rattled his optimism in a way that wars, terrorist attacks and other recessions didn’t. The U.S. isn’t out of the woods yet, but there are reasons to be hopeful, and that seems to be what Buffett’s latest moves are suggesting. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-11-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and other technology companies said confidential material they provided for the U.S. government’s antitrust probe of Alphabet Inc.’s Google should not be shared with the search giant’s in-house lawyers because the information is too sensitive.In a filing Friday in federal court in Washington, Apple said it gave the U.S. Justice Department “competitively sensitive” documents and that allowing lawyers inside Google to see the information would result in “material harm” to Apple. A similar joint filing was made by Amazon.com Inc., AT&T Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Comcast Corp., Sonos Inc., Duck Duck Go Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.Concerns about such disclosures have emerged since the government sued Google for allegedly abusing its power to thwart competition. The Justice Department and Google have clashed over the extent of access to information collected by the government before it sued. The judge overseeing the case, Amit Mehta, has yet to rule on the issue.The Justice Department has proposed allowing companies that provided information to designate their most sensitive documents as “highly confidential,” which would prevent access to Google’s in-house lawyers, according to court papers. The U.S. argues that allowing the search giant to see the proprietary information would give Google even more power in the market than it already has.Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year to make its search engine the default browser option on iPhones and other products, according to analyst estimates. In its court filing, the iPhone maker said the documents at issue relate to its negotiations with Google and other search engines and Apple’s internal deliberations about those discussions.“Disclosure of this information to Google would directly implicate future business dealings between Apple and Google, provide Google with a substantial advantage over Apple in negotiations, and potentially disadvantage competitor search engines that negotiate with Apple and other software providers,” it said.(Updates with filing by Amazon and other companies.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple to AT&T Wary of Full Disclosure in Google Antitrust Case

2020-12-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc., the biggest maker of networking equipment, is upgrading its Webex conferencing service to beat back challenges from Zoom Video Communications Inc., the upstart whose stock has risen six-fold this year.The company announced a raft of enhancements going live on Tuesday and promised a number of others will be added soon. Webex calls will now enhance speech and cancel background noise, Cisco said at a corporate event. The service will include closed captioning, transcriptions, voice commands and impromptu meetings that don’t require advanced scheduling.Cisco is trying to bolster Webex, a longtime favorite corporate tool, to fend off a raft of relatively new entrants such as Zoom and enhanced offerings from other technology companies that have grown rapidly during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.The strategy is part of Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins’s drive to wean the company off a reliance on sales of pricey hardware and make the company a provider of networking services. Cisco hasn’t kept pace with Zoom or other corporate darlings of the pandemic. The stock is down about 8% this year.Other new features on Webex include the ability to read gestures by participants. A physical thumbs up will translate into a virtual reaction conveyed to a speaker. Templates will help meetings progress in a more orderly way and finish on time. For example, attendees might be locked out of speaking again until everyone has had an equal chance to speak. Cisco is also adding real-time translation, starting in February, in 10 languages.Cisco Senior Vice President Jeetu Patel, who heads the business unit, said the company is aiming to make Webex interactions 10 times more effective than in-person meetings by automating time-consuming follow-up activities and making the software and hardware able to read and respond to human behavior.Webex has about 600 million monthly users.

2020-12-09,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is debating a new strategy to go private by gradually buying back outstanding shares until founder Masayoshi Son has a big enough stake he can squeeze out the remaining investors, according to people familiar with the matter.The approach would likely take more than a year and would mean the Japanese company continues to sell assets to fund successive buybacks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plan is private. Son wouldn’t buy more shares himself, but his ownership stake, now about 27%, would increase as other investors sell stock. Under Japanese regulations, Son could compel other shareholders to sell when he gets to 66% ownership, perhaps without paying a premium, the people said.One advantage of the plan, which insiders have called a “slow-motion” or “slow-burn” buyout, is that it gives SoftBank flexibility to purchase its own stock when it dips, according to the people. In the case of a formal buyout, it would have to pay a premium, likely of around 25%. Shareholders are also likely to support buybacks, especially since the company continues to trade at a discount to the total value of its holdings in companies from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Uber Technologies Inc. to DoorDash Inc.The billionaire said as recently as February he thought SoftBank was better off as a public company. More recently, he has declined to comment on his plans after reports about a possible buyout in publications, including Bloomberg News.“If our shares drop down, I will buy back more shares more aggressively,” Son said at a conference in November. SoftBank declined to comment for this story.Shares rose 5.6% on Wednesday in Tokyo after Bloomberg’s report, hitting a fresh 20-year high at 7,489 yen.Son has debated the idea of going private off and on for at least five years. When SoftBank’s shares tumbled in March with the coronavirus pandemic, he began conversations with advisers and lenders, including Elliott Management Corp. and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. Even with SoftBank’s market capitalization at about $50 billion and its assets worth three times that, banks proved hard to convince. They offered unfavorable terms, torpedoing the talks, a person involved in the negotiations has said.Instead, Son unveiled plans to sell about $43 billion in assets to pay down debt and buy back stock. By June, he had offloaded $13.7 billion of Alibaba stock, an even larger chunk of its stake in T-Mobile US Inc. and some shares of SoftBank Corp., his Japanese telecommunications unit. He then went even further, announcing the sale of Arm to Nvidia Corp. for about $40 billion, slashing the stake in SoftBank Corp. by about a third and selling a controlling shareholding in phone-distribution company Brightstar Corp.Son says he is now sitting on $80 billion in cash. The robust initial public offering market has also given SoftBank some big gains on investments, including China’s KE Holdings Inc. and DoorDash.SoftBank’s market value has surged however, with a rally of more than 160% since its low in March. The value of the stock outside of his control is about $87 billion.SoftBank is not obligated to publicly disclose buyout plans, unless it takes concrete steps like setting up a special committee to review the bid or getting letters of intent from the banks for financing, according to one of the people familiar. The disclosure rules in Japan, where management buyouts are rare, have gray areas that would give SoftBank room to maneuver, the person said.Son may still do a traditional management buyout if the share price falls below a certain level, one of the people said, declining to give specific numbers. Elliott, SoftBank’s biggest external shareholder, would take part, provided the stock is still trading at a discount to its underlying value, according to a different person. The Japanese conglomerate is also less leveraged today and a much easier vehicle to lend to for the banks than it was in March, the person said.After repurchasing 1.35 trillion yen of shares this year, SoftBank holds about 12% of outstanding stock. Son controls about 26.8% through various entities. The company has already announced plans to buy back 1.5 trillion yen more through July of next year. At yesterday’s closing price, that would increase Son’s share to less than 35%, a long way to go until a decisive majority.Some analysts are skeptical Son would pursue a buyout now given such challenges -- and his propensity to use any cash he has for ambitious deals.“Until this year, Son has shown little appetite for tackling the discount with buybacks,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies. “Are we supposed to believe that he will now spend years and all of SoftBank’s cash on this scheme, instead of doing what he really loves – making big bets in the tech space?”The problem with a slow-burn MBO strategy is that the buybacks are likely to raise the cost of the eventual deal, according to Goyal. Even if Son manages to raise his personal stake in the company to 66%, Goyal is not convinced he will be able to pull off the buyout without a challenge from minority shareholders.Many inside SoftBank are also against the idea of going private. The sheer amount of cash required is one obstacle. Going private is also likely to cause blowback from credit-rating agencies, making the refinancing of billions of dollars in corporate bonds more difficult, one person said. A buyout would actually prevent Son from doing big deals for as long as a year and a half, one factor giving him second thoughts, a different person said.In February, when he addressed the idea of a buyout, Son said he decided against pursuing a deal after giving it serious consideration. Keeping SoftBank public would allow shareholders to participate in the company’s growth and enforce management discipline, including transparency, he said at the time.(Updates with share rise in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Is Discussing a ‘Slow-Burn’ Buyout to Go Private

2020-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- When Japan invented the world’s first camera-equipped mobile phone two decades ago, it signaled an early but crucial step in the transformation of the phone into a sophisticated high-speed wireless information terminal.Two decades later, as the world develops 5G networks that are tens of thousands of times faster, the nation that pioneered many of these technologies has been almost entirely absent. Having lost the lead in consumer-facing handsets after missing the shift to smartphones, Japanese brands have also fallen behind Nokia Oyj, Ericsson AB and above all Huawei Technologies Co. in the buildout of 5G infrastructure.Those three manufacturers control almost 80% of 5G base-station market share, according to research company TrendForce. But Japanese firms have been handed an unexpected lifeline by the U.S.-led crackdown on Huawei, the Chinese company that was at the forefront of the technology’s rollout. With U.S. partners seeking out suppliers from friendlier nations, vendors in close U.S. ally Japan suddenly seem a lot more attractive to carriers around the world racing to upgrade their networks.“It’s given us a chance,” Jun Sawada, chief executive officer of Japan’s telecommunications behemoth Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., also known as NTT, said of the U.S. steps to remove Huawei.The 5G opportunity could help the likes of NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and other network equipment makers make fresh inroads in a global supply chain that’s only set to grow. Recognizing this, the government has also thrown its weight behind the effort, offering hundreds of millions of dollars in support earlier this year to the nation’s few remaining suppliers to build 5G and post-5G technologies.Since coming to power in September, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s administration has furthered this charge, jumping on the sector as one of its pillars for growth.“In order to take a global lead in next-generation technology including post-5G and 6G, the government will lead the charge of research and development,” Suga said at a press conference on Friday, announcing more than 1 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) in spending in an upcoming extra budget for technologies including wireless.Having banned installation of Huawei 5G equipment from next September, the U.K. is already soliciting NEC and Fujitsu, as well as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., to assist with its 5G roll-out. NTT in June agreed to acquire a 5% stake in NEC, partnering to jointly develop 5G technologies.In a report on U.K. supply chains last month, U.K. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden noted that the decision to remove Huawei would leave the country entirely reliant on just two suppliers, Nokia and Ericsson, to supply critical 5G infrastructure.“This represents an intolerable resilience risk,” Dowden wrote. The strategy lays out a plan to attract new suppliers and support incumbents so that the nation is “not reliant on any single vendor.”Shares in NEC have risen about 19% this year, while Fujitsu has added almost 35%, although the gains are largely supported by expectations for their role in Suga’s plans for a digital transformation of Japan’s public sector.Open ModelJapan’s early attempts to dominate the mobile Internet space failed miserably, with NTT unit NTT Docomo Inc.’s own tightly-controlled I-mode Internet access service unable to catch on in an era of open Internet standards. From Betamax to Blu-Ray, Japanese firms have rarely been associated with promoting open platforms, but are now embracing the concept as they look to cover lost ground amid Huawei’s challenges.NTT Docomo is one of the founding members of the O-RAN Alliance, a group that is pushing for open radio access networks (RAN) — a crucial part of telecoms infrastructure that connects users’ devices to the broader network.Traditionally, vendors would supply the RAN and core network together, and as networks became more complex, only the biggest vendors could supply the entire bundle. That advantage accrued for the likes of Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei.“From the perspective of the carriers, hiring Huawei is easy,” explains Sawada, who spoke to Bloomberg News in an interview earlier this year. “They’ll do everything for you.”He likened this vertically-integrated approach to that taken by Apple Inc. as compared to Microsoft in PCs or Google in smartphones. The open model aims to break this down and provides opportunities to smaller makers.“The concept of O-RAN is fine, but Nokia and Ericsson won’t simply stay quiet and stand by,” said Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities Co. “They may come after the O-RAN alliance with price cuts.”‘Big Chance’U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has campaigned against Huawei’s involvement in 5G networks since 2018, urging its allies to boycott the company’s 5G equipment. Japan has a harder needle to thread than some others, dependent on the U.S. for its national security but also seeking to improve relations with its top trading partner. It’s a tension that Sawada acknowledges.“China and the U.S. are both strong countries,” he said. “The worst thing that could happen for Japan is for them to work together.”Rakuten Inc., the Japanese e-commerce giant that is building out its mobile phone network in Japan to challenge the long-term incumbents, has embraced O-RAN for its 4G and 5G networks. Founder and CEO Hiroshi Mikitani told a conference in November that he aims to export its network technology overseas and sees its value “easily exceeding 1 trillion yen.”Read more: Huawei Ban Spurs New Competition for Ericsson, NokiaThe open model is also seen bolstering the negotiating position of carriers in contracts for 5G network buildouts, with telcos able to choose from a wide range of suppliers. It also provides opportunities to system integration providers, which Japan’s firms excel at.“Pursuing this open model which increases competition and seeing how much we can gain is a big challenge for us,” said Takahito Tokita, Fujitsu’s CEO. Earlier this year, Fujitsu sealed a deal to sell 5G technology to Dish Network Corp., which is building out its own network having acquired the Boost wireless business from T-Mobile US Inc.“This is a multitrillion-dollar market,” he told Bloomberg News. “Even a small percentage of that is a big chance for us,” he said, adding that Fujitsu is still no more than a “newborn chick” compared to the likes of Nokia.Japan’s firms were once spoken of in western circles in a similar way to China’s are now, working too closely with the central government and benefiting from unfair competitive advantages. But much has changed in Japanese business since that first camera phone was rolled out — with its maker Sharp Corp. now itself owned by a Taiwanese firm, something almost unthinkable just a decade ago. The 5G era and beyond could show its firms how to fight larger competitors with a more open approach.(Updates share-price moves in the 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Handed a 5G Lifeline by Trump, Japan Races to Catch Up to Huawei"

2020-12-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Offers for 5G airwaves soared to almost $34 billion in a massive U.S. auction that could feature heavy bidding by Verizon Communications Inc., which needs more spectrum to compete in the dawning era of ultrafast mobile connections.Analysts expect Verizon to put up $20 billion in a field of 57 bidders that includes fellow mobile heavyweights AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., and cable companies Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. Collectively they could push bidding to a record $47 billion, according to 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bidding started Dec. 8 and is expected to continue into the new year.Wireless carriers see the auction as crucial to seizing global leadership in new 5G technology. As more countries are opening up use of midband frequencies, companies are buying airwaves that they hope will drive a yearslong surge of profits when deployed for next-generation mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, health-care devices and manufacturing facilities.Here are the bidders and their motivations.VerizonVerizon has the most wireless subscribers but trails its biggest peers in airwaves capacity. To help address this, the company has built a $21 billion war chest and has even more that it can tap for the auction. Analysts predict Verizon will outspend AT&T, the next highest bidder, by more than 2-1.But to avoid showing their hand, executives have tried to downplay how eager they are to get ahold of the frequencies being sold.“We’re happy with the assets we have, but we certainly look at C-band as something that has a significant opportunity around it as well,” Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said on an investor webcast in August.Companies participating in Federal Communications Commission auctions typically don’t discuss tactics or goals for fear of violating rules aimed at preventing collusion among bidders.The auction is a critical juncture for a company that built its brand on reliable wireless service and network quality.Stakes are becoming higher as 5G comes online, providing connections for devices in homes, vehicles, schools and factories.“Verizon desperately needs midband spectrum in order to be competitive in 5G longer-term,” said Kevin Roe, an analyst with Roe Equity Research.AT&TAT&T can neither afford to fall behind in the 5G race, nor to spend as much as Verizon to lead the aerial land grab.AT&T has $10 billion in cash on hand and possibly a further $16 billion coming with the potential sale of its DirecTV satellite-TV business and the agreed sale of Crunchyroll, its animated-video service.But on the cost side, the company has a $184 billion debt pile to pay down, a $15 billion annual dividend, a $20 billion capital-spending budget and a WarnerMedia production schedule to keep up.Chief Executive Officer John Stankey has made 5G expansion one of his top three priorities since taking over the job in July. AT&T has been the most aggressive of the group with free 5G iPhone promotions and boasts of having the fastest 5G network.AT&T will spend about $9 billion in the auction, according to analyst estimates.T-MobileOf all the bidders, T-Mobile has the least need for midband spectrum. With its Sprint takeover earlier this year, T-Mobile acquired the largest swath of 2.5-gigahertz spectrum in the U.S.Adding to that position would seem unnecessary, but T-Mobile could be interested in bolstering its coverage in major cities in an effort to defend its airwaves advantage.T-Mobile will also be running interference. Without strong counterbids, Verizon could walk away with a majority of the airwaves for a relatively low price.Analysts predict T-Mobile will bid $6 billion in the auction.DishDish Network Corp. Chairman Charlie Ergen rarely sits on the sidelines of any airwaves deal, whether it’s an auction or a when a satellite operator lands in bankruptcy court.Now that Dish is building its own 5G network, with a projected initial cost of $10 billion, there might be less cash available for the midband auction. But earlier this week, Dish announced plans to raise about $2 billion through a sale of convertible notes.Dish will spend about $3 billion in the auction, according to the Bloomberg survey.CableComcast and Charter have formed a joint venture called C&C Wireless Holding Co. to bid in the C-band auction. Both companies offer cable subscribers a mobile-phone service that runs on Verizon’s network.The JV may be interested in acquiring airwaves outside its cable footprint “as deployment of its own cellular infrastructure makes sense from an economic perspective,” Cowen analyst Colby Synesael wrote in a note earlier this month.The cable duo is expected to bid $5 billion.AirwavesThe airwaves being auctioned are in the 3.7-gigahertz frequency range, known as the C-band, and are now used by satellite providers such as Intelsat SA and SES SA. The satellite companies will give up frequencies and operate in a smaller swath. In return, they will receive a portion of the auction proceeds. The remainder goes to the U.S. Treasury.The C-band sale is the largest midband offering in the FCC’s history. The richest FCC auction to date raised $41 billion in 2015.“By freeing up this wide swath of critical midband spectrum, the FCC is paving the way for Americans to receive fast 5G wireless services,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said as the auction began.One potential problem with a portion of the C-band is interference concerns from aviation groups.Radar altimeters -- electronic devices that calculate an aircraft’s height above the ground -- may suffer interference from the new 5G uses that begin after the auctioned airwaves are deployed, aviation groups say.The FCC and industry have said interference isn’t likely because there is plenty of buffer between the envisioned 5G uses and the airwaves assigned to the altimeters.(Updates auction tally in first paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",5G Auction Soars to $34 Billion With Verizon Leading Way

2021-01-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Once again, I offer my predictions for the year to come. But first I will perform the ritual that every prognosticator should: reviewing how I did at predicting the year now ending. So before I get to my predictions for 2021, let’s see how I did in 2020. (Scroll down if you just want to see what I think about the coming year.)I predicted that most of the Democratic presidential candidates would condemn the Secure Act’s limits on non-spouses who inherit retirement accounts. Evaluation: False. The unfortunate limits are still there – why not treat everyone who inherits a retirement account the same? – but they weren’t an issue during the election.     I predicted that the number of surveillance cameras in the world would swiftly surpass one billion. Evaluation: Probably true. Nobody knows the number – recent estimates put it at close to 800 million – but the popularity of private surveillance devices for home and business needs to be factored in. I predicted that due to insufficient appropriations, NASA would push back its 2024 target for returning human beings to the Moon. Evaluation: Partly true, partly false. The appropriation is much smaller than needed, but for now NASA is sticking to the 2024 target.   I predicted that the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint would survive judicial scrutiny. Evaluation: True. I predicted that the New England Patriots would win Super Bowl LIV last February. Evaluation: False. I hereby declare an end to my tradition of picking the now-woeful Patriots every year. I predicted that the rate at which Arctic ice is melting would continue to increase, and that climate activists would continue to argue against technological mitigation. Evaluation: Alas, both true.   I predicted a rapprochement between the U.S. and Belarus dictator Alyeksandr Lukashenko. Evaluation: A brief glimmer of promise, but now looks as if the better term is false. I predicted that the highest grossing film of the year would be “Wonder Woman 1984.” Evaluation: Although the film is doing fairly well, all things considered, this prediction will turn out to be extremely false – but, come on, did you predict a global pandemic? I predicted that a near-ban on vaping products would pass Congress and be signed into law. Evaluation: Mostly true. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act (you know, the one with Covid-19 relief) redefines nearly all vaping products as cigarette products, subjecting them to lots of new regulation. I predicted that Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, facing allegations of rape by two Black women, would decline to run for governor. Evaluation: Extremely false. The Washington Post reports that the scandals “have largely faded” – forgetting, perhaps, that it is usually up to the news media to decide which ones stay alive. I predicted that the U.S. stock market would hit several new highs in the first half of the year, then fall in the run-up to the presidential election, before ending the year on a sharp upswing. Evaluation: Largely true, although the driver was not politics but news about the pandemic.   I predicted that the Houston Astros would defeat the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Evaluation: About as false as it could be. I predicted that journalists wouldn’t apologize for their craven stupidity in asking whether cadets who circled thumbs and forefingers during the Army-Navy game were sharing white power signs. (As the Anti-Defamation League among others has pointed out, the OK symbol is almost always just an OK symbol.) Evaluation: True. I predicted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would maintain its position that trace amounts of nitrosamines in some prescription medications were safe. Evaluation: Somewhat false. The FDA has joined other countries in setting daily limits for nitorsamines and has warned patients and doctors to be cautious. Finally, to recapitulate my tongue-in-cheek prediction on the presidential contest, I predicted that the Democrats would flip Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but the Republicans would flip New Hampshire, leading to a tie in the Electoral College and litigation from President Trump. Evaluation: On the litigation part, I was right. I was also right in picking four states the Democrats would flip. I was wrong about the Electoral College tie, but that part was obviously farce.Now we come to my predictions for 2021. Do bear in mind that not all are seriously meant:In January, President Donald Trump will finally invite President-elect Joe Biden to the White House. Trump will even attend the inaugural, albeit with poor grace. After leaving office, Trump will become a resident of Florida. He will place his New York triplex on the market, but it will take over a year, and several price cuts, before it sells. In his inaugural address, President Joe Biden will be as charitable toward Trump as Trump was toward his predecessor, President Barack Obama. (Trump, as you may recall, was able to bestir himself to thank Obama for “gracious aid throughout this transition” – that is, for helping Trump – and that was it.) Alas, within the first six months of Biden’s administration, much of the progressive left will turn on him, labeling him too cautious and forgetting that it’s a big and complex country which will be holding a congressional election in 2022. (Some predictions are easy.) Other countries will begin to follow the lead of Japan, which is making ambitious plans to use GPS to track every visitor who enters the country.  The rich world’s V-shaped recovery will strengthen but poorer nations will struggle with the pandemic’s second wave, leading to more accusations that wealthy nations are most interested in vaccinating their own people. In other Covid-19 news, at least three governors, having grown enamored of ruling by decree, will extend their states’ declared emergencies through the end of 2021. Due to pandemic restrictions, Super Bowl LVI in Tampa Bay will be played before no more than 15,000 fans in a stadium that can seat more than four times that number. The Green Pay Packers will win. A significant number of top jobs in the financial sector will move from New York to Connecticut, now that Darien seems again to make “loads of sense.” In climate news, additional measurements will tend to confirm recent speculation that the Antarctic ice sheet is much less stable than thought.  As the news media struggle to figure out how closely to scrutinize the new administration, “bothsidesing” will become a popular verb – and your humble Grammar Curmudgeon promises to weigh in. Despite the Covid-19 vaccine, audiences will remain leery of movie theaters, and at least one major chain will declare bankruptcy. Nevertheless, many more people than in 2020 will go to the movies – admit it, popcorn is never quite the same at home – and the top grossing film of 2021 will be “Fast and Furious 9,” but nostalgia-seeking baby boomers will boost “Top Gun: Maverick” into the top three. The darling of the critics will be “The United States vs. Billie Holiday.” While we’re on the subject, no later than summer of 2021, the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, having read the handwriting on the wall, will vote to make permanent its “temporary” rule permitting Academy Award consideration for certain films that skip theatrical release and go straight to video. In other pop culture news, to the dismay of the fan base, Grogu, better known as Baby Yoda, will not show up until midway through season 3 of “The Mandalorian.” Bonus prediction: We’ll see Kylo Ren’s turn to the dark side. Although the antitrust suit against Facebook will generate tens of millions of dollars for law firms, it will become increasingly clear that the case is thin. The World Series will feature surprise teams from both leagues, with the Atlanta Braves defeating the Oakland Athletics. College administrators, having had a sudden transplant of backbone, will become resolute in standing up for faculty members under attack for taking unpopular positions. (Well, yes, one can always dream ...)That’s what I think will happen in 2021. Whether I’m right or wrong, I wish for all my readers a year full of joy and delight and thoughtfulness and companionship and love.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Stephen L.

2021-01-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Corporate bond sales are expected to resume in earnest next week after taking a breather in late December while voters in Georgia head to the polls to choose which party will control the U.S. Senate.Investment-grade companies may borrow as much as $30 billion in the coming five trading days and up to $100 billion in lighter-than-normal sales volume during the month, according to Bank of America Corp. credit strategists led by Hans Mikkelsen. January’s issuance will be front-loaded with foreign borrowers tapping the U.S. high-grade market in the first couple of weeks as domestic firms enter voluntary earnings blackout periods, the analysts said in a report.T-Mobile US Inc., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., Conagra Brands Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. are among companies scheduled to report earnings next week.“There could be some M&A-related issuance in the pipeline, as well as a wildcard factor from the U.S. 5G license auction that‘s drawing bidders like AT&T, Charter, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon among others and reaching much higher-than-expected valuations,” the analysts wrote.Two runoff races in Georgia on Jan. 5 will determine whether President-elect Joe Biden gains a slim majority in the Senate to advance his agenda in Congress, or if Republicans will maintain the ability to block major legislation. Market participants expect more fiscal stimulus, regulation and higher taxes if Democrats win and the initial reaction would be positive as stimulus would likely come first, JPMorgan Chase & Co. credit research analysts led by Stephen Dulake wrote in a note last week.“One potential fly in the ointment could be a snap higher in underlying bond yields and interest rate volatility,” the analysts said.Inviting ConditionsThe high-yield primary market is also expected to spring back into action next week, with one of the market’s top-five dealers expecting more borrowers to return in the new year as the “extremely attractive” conditions should continue at least into the first quarter.Average January junk-bond issuance over the last six years has been in the range of $20 billion, with annual supply forecasts largely ranging from about $300 billion to $375 billion. That compares to an all-time high of $431.8 billion in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The leveraged-loan market will see a slow start to 2021 with only a few deals expected to launch in the first two weeks of January, though a few stragglers left over from last year may price. No bank meetings are scheduled for next week.Wall Street credit strategists expect a decline in U.S. leveraged-loan sales in 2021, projecting volume of $275 billion to $380 billion, after almost $334 billion of loans launched and $301.3 billion priced in 2020 as of Dec. 17. However, this could change once the year gets started given the attractive terms available to issuers now, upward trends in returns and a key price index, and expectations that CLO issuance will rebound.Finally, private credit will continue to see a flurry of activity persist into next week as lenders sit on about $300 billion of cash, and private equity sponsors are encouraged to close tack-on acquisitions or secondary buyouts. The uptick in volume is expected to be driven by optimism surrounding Covid-19 vaccine roll outs and demand that had stored up following a standstill period earlier in the pandemic.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Corporate Bond Sales Line Up Amid High-Stakes Vote

2021-01-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Bidding in a 5G airwaves auction in the U.S. surged past $76.5 billion, fueled by a frenzied demand for capacity that could send carriers like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. to the debt market to finance the tab.The auction run by the Federal Communications Commission started last month with a field of 57 potential bidders, including the third major wireless carrier, T-Mobile US Inc., and pay-TV providers such as Dish Network Corp., Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. Within days, the tally exceeded analysts’ estimates of $47 billion.“It blows all auctions away,” said Sasha Javid, chief operating officer of wireless data company BitPath. The previous top FCC airwaves auction attracted almost $45 billion in bids in 2015. The current sale of frequencies in the so-called C-band could approach $80 billion as bidding extends for another week or more, Javid said in an interview.The go-for-broke bidding underscores how crucial these midband frequencies are to companies trying to seize global leadership in emerging 5G technology. The airwaves are expected to drive a yearslong surge of profits when deployed for next-generation mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, health-care equipment and manufacturing facilities.“It’s great spectrum, there’s a lot of it, and it’s coming right as carriers are gearing up to get ready for 5G,” said Doug Brake, director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit research outfit.Verizon VersusWhile Verizon was expected to be the biggest bidder in the auction, the carrier may have run into a formidable counterbidder in T-Mobile, thanks to the financial backing of its controlling stockholder, Deutsche Telekom AG.“If you’re Verizon and you don’t get this spectrum, you’ve basically lost the race to 5G,” Javid said.With about $10 billion in additional cash from Deutsche Telekom, New Street Research says T-Mobile could be using the auction to build on an already-large holding of midband 2.5-gigahertz airwaves gained with the takeover of Sprint Corp. in April.T-Mobile already has “a powerful network advantage today, and they may extend it,” New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin wrote in a note Monday.Collectively, the largest bidders had about $70 billion in cash available at the beginning of the auction. But with the total already higher than that, companies like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Dish and Comcast “may have to tap the bond market in early 2021,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephen Flynn wrote in a note Monday.In addition to the airwaves licenses, winning bidders also will pay an estimated $13 billion or more to current users of the airwaves, including satellite providers Intelsat SA and SES SA. The satellite companies will change their use of frequencies to make room for the 5G providers.(Update new bid total in first paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",5G Airwave Bids Surge Past $76 Billion to Set Auction Record

2021-01-06,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is preparing to take at least six more of its portfolio companies public this year, building on a 2020 turnaround that pushed the value of Masayoshi Son’s technology conglomerate to the highest since the dot-com boom.Among the startups heading for initial public offerings are South Korean e-commerce pioneer Coupang Corp., Indonesian online mall operator PT Tokopedia and China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, according to people familiar with the matter, asking not to be named because the matter is private. The IPOs could give Son another round of enormous gains after successful offerings from DoorDash Inc. and KE Holdings Inc. in 2020.Son started last year under a cloud after the meltdown at WeWork, then saw his shares plunge with the coronavirus pandemic and a loss of almost $18 billion at SoftBank’s Vision Fund. But the Japanese billionaire, long reluctant to cash out of investments like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., embarked on an uncharacteristic sales blitz, raising more than $50 billion by shedding stakes in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and its domestic wireless affiliate, SoftBank Corp. He used the cash to buy back his own shares, pushing SoftBank Group’s stock to the highest level since 2000.If demand for IPOs continues to be robust, it would improve the prospects for the remaining 100 or so startups in SoftBank’s portfolio. That would give Son more liquid assets to keep funding buybacks -- or perhaps take his company private.“That old concern about them not being willing to monetize assets is largely in the past,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “Son has successfully shed the WeWork stigma and no one talks about that anymore. The story is now about further investment exits and prospects for privatization.”Even for a man whose career has been filled with epic success and failure, Son’s 2020 was unusually dramatic. In the span of a few months, SoftBank lost half its value in a pandemic-driven rout, reported the largest loss in its history and then recovered to record profits and a surging valuation.Son was rescued, at least in part, by the speculative frenzy sweeping global markets. Energized by the fervor, Japan’s most famous financier agreed to sell chip designer Arm in the largest deal of his career, tried his hand at trading stock options and flirted with taking his company private. Now, the Vision Fund is on track to report its second quarter of record profits and SoftBank is raising $525 million through a blank-check company.The outbreak has had an uneven impact on Son’s startups. With many people sheltering at home, SoftBank took large writedowns on the value of office-sharing giant WeWork and hotel-booking service Oyo Hotels & Homes. At the same time, e-commerce and food-delivery companies have seen their prospects brighten.Tokopedia may be the closest to a market debut. Indonesia’s largest online mall last month hired advisers, saying it is considering options for a public debut. The company is in talks to merge with ride-hailing provider Gojek ahead of an IPO of the combined entity and, separately, has discussed going public by combining with the special purpose acquisition company Bridgetown Holdings Ltd.In either scenario, Tokopedia could be valued at about $10 billion. SoftBank’s Vision Fund owns about a quarter of the company, a stake it acquired for less than $1 billion, one of the people said.Coupang’s IPO could come in the second quarter of this year and may value the South Korean e-commerce giant at over $30 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The Vision Fund paid $2.7 billion to acquire its 37% stake in the company, most of it at a $9 billion post-money valuation, the person said.India’s Policybazaar is also considering a listing that may value the online insurance platform at over $3.5 billion. SoftBank invested about $200 million in the company at $1.5 billion pre-money valuation and owns around 15%, the person said. Auto1 Group GmbH is looking to raise 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in an offering that would value the German used car retailer at over $6 billion. SoftBank paid $600 million for its 20% stake at a pre-money valuation of $2.9 billion, the person said.SoftBank also owns a stake in ByteDance Ltd., the enormously successful Chinese parent of the video app TikTok. SoftBank invested $2.5 billion at a $75 billion pre-money valuation, according to the person. The Beijing-based company is in talks to raise money at a $180 billion valuation before listing some of its businesses in Hong Kong, Bloomberg News has reported.Perhaps most significant would be Didi. Son has been the largest investor in ride-hailing companies, pouring over $20 billion into Uber Technologies Inc., Didi, Southeast Asia’s Grab and India’s Ola. Uber went public in 2019, but its rocky debut dampened demand for similar stocks.Uber shares jumped 71% last year however, suggesting the markets are once again open to such money-losing startups. The Chinese ride-hailing giant is already considering a listing in the U.S. in the second half of this year, the people familiar said. SoftBank owns about 20% of the company after investing over $10 billion, making it the single-biggest investment in the Vision Fund’s portfolio.Other SoftBank companies that have reportedly begun preparations for IPOs include the U.S. real estate brokerage Compass, India’s online grocery Grofers and SenseTime Group Ltd., China’s largest artificial intelligence company.Several SoftBank-backed companies have already pulled off solid debuts. Online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc. quadrupled since its July IPO, while oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. has surged about 90% since its trading debut. The August listing of KE Holdings, a Chinese online property platform, added $5.1 billion in paper gains to Vision Fund’s profit in the quarter ended in September. Last month’s market debut of DoorDash Inc., a food-delivery company where SoftBank holds a 20% stake, is alone likely to bring in over $10 billion profit in unrealized gains.“A less charitable view could hold that Son’s past mistakes were most of his own making, but the recent successes are in the large part the market giving Son a salvation,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies.Fueled by central bank stimulus and individual investors, companies announced a record $208 billion in IPOs in the U.S. last year. DoorDash’s $3.4 billion debut was the fourth-biggest, while KE Holdings was No. 7 with $2.4 billion. Special purpose acquisition companies accounted for almost half of the total.SoftBank needs more successes as Alibaba -- by far its most valuable holding -- comes under scrutiny from China’s antitrust authorities. The e-commerce giant’s stock has tumbled more than 20% from its peak in October.“There is a window of opportunity for listing and selling SoftBank portfolio companies before IPO fatigue sets in,” said Tang at United First Partners. “We are closer to the end of it than the beginning.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank’s Son Is Poised for Another IPO Windfall in 2021

2021-01-15,"Some technological advances are evolutionary, a simple next step from where we are now, but others are revolutionary, bringing us more than just more and better than what we have. 5G, the new wireless tech that has been rolling out since 2018, is shaping up to fall into the latter category. It started out looking like that simple next step. 5G would be a faster network, just as 4G once had been. But as it has come online, the other advantages have started to pile up: clearer signals, lower latency, far greater data carrying capacity. That last may be the key – the greater data transfers available in 5G offers to bring the promise of the connected world and the Internet of Things to full fruition. Everything from industrial IoT to autonomous vehicles to remotely operated microsurgery may benefit from 5G, and once that happens, our world will never be the same. The vista opening up as 5G's expansion is not limited to the tech world. Finance and investment will also be impacted; companies with a direct – or even an indirect – link to underlying work of 5G will find the expansion of the networks to be a golden opportunity. Look for 5G to provide a potential boost for the stock of companies involved in providing wireless network services, infrastructure and hardware, handset devices, and semiconductor chips. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks' database to find three 5G names that earned some praise recently from 5-star analysts. Not to mention, the analysts see a double-digit growth potential for each. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) 5G won’t go anywhere unless the transmitting towers get a signal – and they get that signal over cable connections. That’s where Applied Optoelectronics comes in. The company designs and produces a range of optical-based communication products, from fiber optic cables to analog and digital lasers. AAOI supplies optical transceivers to data centers and cable hardware to networking providers. Applied Optoelectronics has had several difficult years. The company relied heavily on Amazon in the mid-2010s, but saw that collapse when the online retail giant cut its orders in 2017. Since then, AAOI has had difficulty regaining traction in the competitive optical networking niche. However, the company is now entering 2021 on a positive note. Shares are up 23% in the first two weeks of the year, and new products in the 5G front-haul application niche are expected to do well. The company announced early last year a line of 25Gbps LWDM cooled transistor laser diodes, which now – due to high demand – make up a majority of current production. The demand is coming from data center and 5G telecom wireless providers, and AAOI has expanded its manufacturing capabilities to meet the customer orders. The result was strong Q3 revenues, with the top line growing 66% year-over-year to reach $76.6 million. Gross margins, at 25%, were up sequentially from the 21% recorded in Q2. The solid results come on the back of record laser production, which reached 1.1 million units by the end of July 2020. This figure marks a 65% increase from pre-COVID production levels – and reflects increased demand as 5G networkers expand their hardware. Tim Savageaux, 5-star analyst with Northland, rates AAOI as Outperform (i.e. Buy) based on his belief that the company’s product line will clear a path forward. His $14 price target suggests ~34% one-year upside from current levels. (To watch Savageaux’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Savageaux writes, “We believe the strength in Cable optics revenue seen at AAOI in Q3… is sustainable… This is especially the case given AAOIs focus on upstream transmission/Cable node technologies, the primary focus for Cable MSOs looking to relieve upstream bandwidth bottlenecks via node splits… we expect AAOI's cable optics unit could account for 25%+ of total [revenues]… Recent press reports and forecasts from China point to 5G base station deployments from 600K-1M in CY21 vs ~580K in CY20, supporting a 1H21 recovery in AAOI 25G laser shipments for 5G fronthaul…” Is the rest of the Street in agreement? As it turns out, the analyst consensus is more of a mixed bag. Split almost right down in the middle, 3 Buy ratings and 4 Holds were assigned in the last three months, giving AAOI a Moderate Buy status. (See AAOI stock analysis on TipRanks) T-Mobile US (TMUS) T-Mobile is well known as one of the largest wireless providers in the US – in fact, it has the third largest market share. In April 2020, the company completed its takeover of rival mobile carrier Sprint. The combined company is hoping to use its new pool of resources to expand its 5G capabilities. The company introduced 5G in December 2019, and added 121 cities and towns to its mid-band 5G network in 3Q20. T-Mobile is also launching mobile hotspots, with capacity for up to 30 devices, allowing customer to take 5G on the road. In all, T-Mobile has the largest 5G network in the US, with low band extended range systems covering 1.4 million square miles and more an estimated 270 million people. T-Mobile’s third quarter results showed top line revenue of $19.3 billion, up 73% year-over-year on the strength of the Spring merger. We’ll have to wait until next month to get the Q4 and full year 2020 numbers – but some preliminary indicators are looking good. The company recently reached a 100 million-strong customer base for the first time, and early Q4 numbers show an additional 1.7 million subscribers added. Among the fans is Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, who sees the company in a solid position. “We expect TMUS will aggressively launch 5G fixed wireless this year and its mid-band spectrum assets will help because of its favorable propagation characteristics… We expect TMUS's network quality to improve as it deploys more of Sprint's 2.5GHz this year. Customers will notice a difference in performance to LTE once 5G devices are widely adopted,” the 5-star analyst noted. These bullish comments back an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and Horan’s $160 price target indicates confidence in a 28% upside potential for the year ahead. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here) Wall Street’s confidence on the telecommunications giant speaks for itself; TMUS has received a whopping 15 Buy ratings in the last three months vs. just two Holds. Meanwhile, the $147.44 consensus price target suggests a potential upside of 18% from the current share price. (See TMUS stock analysis on TipRanks) II-VI, Inc. (IIVI) Last but not least is II-VI, a manufacturer of engineered materials and optoelectronic components for industrial use, optical communications, and semiconductor capital equipment, among other uses. II-VI’s products are found in the manufacture of computer chips and telecommunication equipment – and this is where it finds a connection with 5G. The company has focused its efforts on communications lasers, a vital component of 5G wireless tech, and in February of 2020 introduced a line of high-speed indium phosphide electro-absorption modulated lasers for 5G optical infrastructure. II-VI expects to find strong growth in Asia, as Chinese 5G networks expand outside of the major urban areas. Anticipated growth has come on the back of earnings and revenue growth. In its fiscal Q1, reported in November, II-VI reported a 47% year-over-year increase in EPS, from 55 cents to 84 cents. Revenue came in just below expectation, but were still up 113% yoy and reached $728 million. Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya likes II-VI’s industry position, noting: “II-VI strengthened its product portfolio within its communications business (~70% of sales evenly split across datacom/telecom), levered to some of our favorite secular themes in 2021 including 5G infrastructure and cloud… II-VI continues to remain our top SMid-cap pick, with its leading position in the optical market well levered to 5G/cloud…” To this end, Arya rates IIVI a Buy along with a $100 price target. This figure implies ~13% upside from current levels. (To watch Arya’s track record, click here) Turning now to the rest of the Street, it appears that other analysts are generally on the same page. With 15 Buy ratings and 5 Holds assigned in the last three months, the consensus rating comes in as a Moderate Buy.

Following the merger, the firm provided nationwide service in major markets but spottier coverage elsewhere. T-Mobile has spent aggressively on low-frequency spectrum, well suited to broad coverage, and has substantially expanded its geographic footprint. This expansion, coupled with aggressive marketing and innovative offerings, produced rapid customer growth. With the Sprint acquisition, the firm's scale now roughly matches its larger rivals: T-Mobile now serves 65 million postpaid and 21 million prepaid phone customers, equal to nearly 30% of the retail wireless market.

2021-02-08,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. reported a record profit in its Vision Fund as a surging stock market lifted the value of its portfolio companies, but founder Masayoshi Son wiped out a significant chunk of those gains with his controversial trading in derivatives.The Vision Fund reported a 844.1 billion yen ($8 billion) profit in the December quarter, surpassing record numbers set just a quarter earlier. A global rally in technology shares has boosted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and paved the way for initial public offerings from the likes of DoorDash Inc.Those gains, which had been widely expected, were offset by fallout from Son’s decision last year to start dabbling in trading stocks and options. SoftBank posted a 285.3 billion yen derivatives loss in the period. That led to an overall loss in the asset management arm of 113.5 billion yen, up from 85.2 billion yen in the previous three-month period.“The Vision Fund’s stellar performance in the past few quarters continues to cover for the losses on options trading,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “SoftBank could argue those derivatives were for hedging purposes, but Son’s venture into trading is definitely not looking good so far.”In a presentation to investors after the results, Son focused on his successes. He reprised his argument that SoftBank is like a goose that lays golden eggs, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! two decades ago, to companies like Uber and DoorDash more recently. Some 15 companies have gone public from the Vision Fund so far, he said.“Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,” he said, pacing a stage in a white turtleneck sweater and grey jacket. “We are finally in the harvesting stage.”He said Vision Fund 1 and Vision Fund 2 have invested in a total of 131 companies. In the case of DoorDash, SoftBank invested about $680 million for a stake now worth about $9 billion, he said, while its $7.7 billion investment in Uber is worth $11.3 billion.The Tokyo-based company had a net income of 1.17 trillion yen in the December period and did not release operating profit figures. At least six more portfolio companies are planning IPOs this year.“There is a lot of liquidity out there and investors are particularly partial toward tech stocks,” Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “At some point the IPO fatigue sets in, but doesn’t seem like we are there yet. For now, the window of opportunity is open for SoftBank.”After shares plunged in March with the coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank unveiled plans to sell off 4.5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and fund buybacks. The selloff included part of its interests in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the Japan telecommunications unit. SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for $40 billion.SoftBank held a total of $22 billion of “highly liquid listed stocks” as of the end of quarter, including a $7.39 billion investment in Amazon.com Inc., $3.28 billion in Facebook Inc. and $1.38 billion in Alphabet Inc. The operation is managed by its asset management subsidiary SB Northstar, where Son personally holds a 33% stake.The investments were accompanied by derivatives that amplified exposure, but SoftBank has been winding down its options strategy amid a backlash from investors. The fair value of SoftBank’s futures and options positions came to little over $1 billion at the end of December, compared with $2.7 billion the previous quarter. Long call options on listed stocks have dwindled to $1.68 billion from $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks declined to $238 million from $1.26 billion of value.Son said that the losses in the asset management arm have swung to a profit of about 100 billion yen since the end of last quarter. But the operations remain in a “test-drive stage,” he said.Alibaba, Son’s most stark investment success to date and SoftBank’s largest asset, saw its shares plunge about 20% last quarter amid a Chinese government clampdown that scuttled the planned listing of its affiliate Ant Group Co. Founder Jack Ma had all but vanished from public view, prompting investor unease before he resurfaced last month.Son said he remained in touch with Ma, without giving specific details of their communications. He said Ma likes to draw and shares his drawings with Son via chat; the SoftBank chief also sketches but hasn’t shared any of his work. Son also said he saw the increased antitrust scrutiny of Ma’s businesses in China as part of the country’s natural evolution.SoftBank’s own sale of Arm to Nvidia is still making its way through the approval process gauntlet. The United Kingdom and European Union are both preparing to launch probes into the deal, the Financial Times reported last week. Son said he remained confident that it will receive a green light at the end.SoftBank has also joined the blank-check company frenzy with plans for several special purpose acquisition companies. SVF Investment Corp. raised $525 million last month to address sectors like mobile communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud technologies and software. LDH Growth Corp I plans to raise as much as $200 million to target Latin American and Hispanic markets.SoftBank last week filed for two more SPACs, seeking to raise another $630 million. The new SoftBank vehicles, SVF Investment Corp. 2 and 3, will target the same diverse areas of technology as the first, including mobile communications and artificial intelligence, according to filings Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“Consistently good performance by Vision Fund portfolio companies also helps the SPAC’s prospects because investors can extrapolate management expertise,” said Tang at United First Partners. “It underlines their skill in deploying capital.”SoftBank may see between 10 to 20 public listings a year from its portfolio of 164 startups across three different funds, Son said. A typical early-stage venture capital fund might see a third of its bets pay off, but SoftBank’s portfolio of late-stage companies should do better than that, he said. Even WeWork has received SPAC interest, he said.The billionaire struck a tone that was reminiscent of the days before the WeWork fiasco in late 2019. He said the key to turning “white egg” investments into golden egg hits was “turbo-charging” startups with “overwhelming capital,” more ambitious goals and synergies with other portfolio companies.Son’s presentation then took a turn for the comical. He flipped to an animated slide of a goose tagged with “AI revolution” text and a line of golden eggs marching out of its backside to Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker.“Investment is a rhythm,” Son said. “But please don’t look at this too seriously.”(Updates with Son’s comments on Alibaba, derivatives from 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank’s Vision Fund Profit Undercut by Trading Losses

2021-02-16,"(Bloomberg) -- For Masayoshi Son, these days are even better than the dot-com bubble.Shares in the Japanese billionaire’s SoftBank Group Corp. surged in Tokyo on Tuesday to the highest close since the company went public in 1994, rising past a long-standing record two decades ago.The shares rose 4.2% to finish at 10,420 yen, surpassing its previous record of 10,111.09 yen marked on Feb. 18, 2000. SoftBank’s share price increases have been backed by a surging stock market which lifted the value of its portfolio companies.The gains come on the heels of last week’s record earnings at its Vision Fund, which reported an $8 billion profit in the three months ended in December. Son has said he wants 10 to 20 of his portfolio companies to go public each year. Already this year, South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Corp. filed for a U.S. listing, which could more than triple the value of SoftBank’s $3 billion investment.“The global equity market rally is boosting people’s view on SoftBank’s first and second Vision Funds,” said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.It’s a remarkable turnaround for SoftBank, which just last May posted a record fiscal year operating loss of 1.35 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) after missteps with office-sharing provider WeWork and satellite startup OneWeb. The coronavirus pandemic compounded those challenges, putting in jeopardy Son’s investments in the so-called sharing economy. Shares fell as low as 2,687 yen apiece.In a bid to regain investor support, Son reversed his long-standing aversion to parting with equity investments. He pledged in March to sell off 4.5 trillion yen in assets and buy back 2.5 trillion yen of its own stock. He quickly peddled stakes in China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the domestic wireless business.While aggressive buybacks propped up SoftBank Group’s shares last year, surging demand for IPOs pushed the stock to new heights. In November, the Vision Fund reported a record profit, largely due to a $5.1 billion gain from its investment in a Chinese real estate startup called KE Holdings Inc.This month, SoftBank revealed the Vision Fund had made even more money in the December quarter. A rally in technology shares boosted the value of stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and sparked strong demand for IPOs from portfolio companies such as DoorDash Inc. SoftBank invested about $680 million for a stake in DoorDash that is now worth about $9 billion, Son said last week.The lofty share price may bring back bubble-era memories, when Son briefly became the world’s richest man from backing hundreds of dot-com startups -- only to see his fortune plunge by $70 billion in a matter of months.Last week, he revisited his argument that SoftBank is like a goose that lays golden eggs, from Alibaba two decades ago to DoorDash and Coupang now. At one point, he marched in place while an animated goose laid sparkling eggs and music from Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker played.“Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,” he said. “We are finally in the harvesting stage.”With Tuesday’s rally, the stock has surpassed Ishino’s target share price of 10,000 yen. The stock also trades above analysts’ 12-month consensus of 9,592.14 yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative strength index on SoftBank stock hovers above the 70 mark, an indication that shares may be poised for a downward correction.Read more: Masayoshi Son Explains the Vision Behind SoftBank’s Vision FundIshino said it’s “possible” for SoftBank’s stock to head for levels near 15,000 yen, as Son has asked investors to evaluate the stock based on its net asset value, or the value of its equity holdings less its net debt. SoftBank calculated its net asset value at 14,935 yen a share as of Jan. 1, with much of that coming from Alibaba.“My eyes are on how the net asset value growth takes its course from here,” Ishino said. “Currently, it relies heavily on Alibaba. The focus will be on whether it is able to lift expectations for its other investments in the two Vision Funds, as it cuts back on Alibaba.”(Updates to add a chart)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Masayoshi Son Just Pushed SoftBank Shares Past Dot-Com Peak

T-Mobile US reached earnings of $2.56 billion and sales of $19.27 billion in Q3. Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, T-Mobile US posted an ROCE of 0.01%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. View more earnings on TMUS Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For T-Mobile US, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.

2021-02-23,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is moving toward selling another set of 5G airwaves as wireless providers engage in a multibillion dollar race for frequencies.Democratic FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called for an auction beginning in October for airwaves in the 3.45-to-3.55 gigahertz range. Her proposal faces a March 17 vote at the agency that’s split on partisan lines.The airwaves to be offered are useful for 5G wireless technology, which offers ultra-fast connections for such uses as remote surgery and autonomous vehicles.Roswenworcel in an emailed statement called for “5G that is fast, secure, resilient, and -- most importantly -- available across the country.”“This important auction is a crucial step toward making that a reality,” Rosenworcel said.Current users of the airwaves include the military, which operates high-powered radar. The Defense Department said it could share the frequencies, and the FCC last year said it would propose that federal systems in the airwaves can’t interfere with civilian use. Some other users will be re-allocated to different airwaves, Rosenworcel said.Another airwaves sale attracted $81.2 billion in bidding that concluded last week. Winners are to be announced in coming days. Companies registered to take part in that bidding included mobile giants AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.Rosenworcel’s proposal needs to win a majority vote from the agency, which is shorthanded with four members evenly split between parties.

T-Mobile marked its pay-TV business debut with the 2017 acquisition of online TV subscription service Layer3 TV Inc. The big bundle of channels, priced at $75 to $100 a month, noted a significant subscriber exodus. T-Mobile finally launched the TVision service in 2019 with a set-top box and a $100 price tag. Price action: TMUS shares traded higher by 0.82% at $124.47, and GOOG shares traded higher by 0.03% at $2,055.95 on the last check Tuesday.

2021-04-14,"T-Mobile US (TMUS) may be up around 50% over the past year, but the wireless carrier, which is 43% owned by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) and 24% owned by Softbank Group(SFTBF), could still wow investors as the year plays out. Last year’s merger with Sprint made T-Mobile a more formidable competitor against rivals AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ), and potential increases in customer retention together with further cost-cutting could see the company wring out even more value from this deal. The upcoming partnership with Alphabet (GOOGL) is also likely to give TMUS a boost. The currently stretched valuation of TMUS shares may hinder any substantial potential rally in the near-term, however, further gains from current prices (around $130 per share) are a possibility. TMUS Stock And Additional Upside From Sprint Deal Last year’s merger with Sprint has clearly started to pay off as seen from TMUS’ recent performance, but the upside from this transaction may just be getting warmed up and the company could reap even more benefits from this deal in the coming 12 months. T-Mobile has much higher customer retention rates relative to its competition, and by applying its strategy to minimize churn, it could hold onto a greater share of the customers it acquired from the Sprint transaction. There is also room for additional cost synergies. By consolidating operations, T-Mobile cut $1.3 billion in annual costs in 2020 with a further $3 billion in cost savings and operating expense reductions expected this year which should filter straight to the bottom line. But there’s even more on the table for TMUS stock than the extra “value add” from this deal. Other catalysts remain that could point to higher prices for the shares. T-Mobile is slightly ahead of AT&T and leaps and bounds ahead of Verizon with regards to quarterly subscriber additions, so its organic customer growth is another positive for the stock going forward. T-Mobile And Its Recent Deal With Google Outside of its main wireless business, there’s another catalyst at play for T-Mobile US. The company recently signed a partnership deal with Google which will see the two companies joining up with internet television company Philo to provide a wireless-pay TV bundle package. T-Mobile previously tried to go it alone with its TVision platform, but by partnering with Google and Philo, which provide their respective YouTubeTV and Philo platforms, the company may finally strike success with its expansion into other subscription telecom services. So, does this make this stock a slam dunk opportunity at current prices? On one hand, there’s plenty pointing to continued success in the coming 12 months. But with its valuation already stretched (48x projected 2021 earnings), it may be tough for shares to see additional gains in the near-term. What Analysts Are Saying About TMUS Stock According to TipRanks, TMUS comes in as a Strong Buy based on 12 analyst ratings comprised of 11 Buys and 1 Hold. As for price targets, the average analyst price target on TMUS stock is $157.55 per share, implying around 21% upside from current prices over the next 12 months. Analyst price targets range from a low of $133 per share to a high of $190 per share. (See T-Mobile US stock analysis on TipRanks) Bottom Line: Waiting for Weakness May Be The Best Move Initial results indicate that T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint was a success and subscriber growth, 5G, and pay-tv bundle catalysts could help it “level up” as well. But what’s good for the company may not translate into near-term success for the stock. With its current share price already factoring in its positive catalysts, it may be hard for TMUS to deliver in the short-term. For those willing to wait for a more opportune entry point, this may be a name to keep on one’s radar.

2021-04-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Dish Network Corp. signed an agreement making Amazon.com Inc. a key partner in the development of its planned 5G network, advancing the company’s efforts to compete in the wireless business with incumbents like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.Under the accord announced Wednesday, Dish will use Amazon’s cloud software and equipment to run core elements of the 5G network now under development. The company’s first 5G service will launch sometime in the third quarter using Amazon Web Services in Las Vegas, the first city in an eventual nationwide expansion. No financial terms were given.The agreement is a crucial piece of Dish’s 5G strategy and comes nearly four years after Chairman Charlie Ergen said he was seeking a key partner that shared his vision of putting the company’s treasure trove of airwaves to use in a futuristic wireless network. Dish, a pay-TV provider with 11.3 million subscribers, is spending $10 billion to transform itself into a cloud-based wireless carrier to challenge giants like AT&T.Shares of Dish rose as much as 4.4% to $39.61 Wednesday in New York, a 52-week high and their biggest intraday gain since December. New State Research called the deal “a ‘foot-in-the-door’ with a critical partner that provides strong validation of the opportunity ahead for Dish.”Dish has the fourth-largest holding of wireless airwaves in the U.S., but almost none of it is in service yet. By using a so-called cloud-native network, Dish will be able to nimbly scale capacity up and down, depending on traffic, and deliver a range of applications, from heavy-data processing for businesses to simple texts to consumer phones.Later Start“We definitely share the same vision with AWS,” said Marc Rouanne, Dish’s chief network officer.Dish is entering the 5G race behind T-Mobile US Inc., Verizon and AT&T, which already offer the service. But there are still very few 5G users, applications or revenue, suggesting the market remains wide open. Promoters of 5G services say they will enable innovations like immersive gaming and self-driving vehicles.AWS will serve as the core of Dish’s network, allowing the upstart 5G provider to outsource its data operations in much the same way other businesses have turned to outside IT and cloud-services providers for data management. For Englewood, Colorado-based Dish, this means that mobile traffic picked up by a tower antenna will be immediately connected to the AWS cloud.While AWS has tinkered in wireless, including a 5G edge-computing partnership with Verizon, this move with Dish is the first attempt to replicate core elements of a telecommunications network in the cloud.AWS, the largest seller of cloud-computing services, has worked in recent years to make its products more valuable to customers in potentially lucrative fields like telecommunications, health care and defense. The division had $45.4 billion in revenue last year.“A cloud partner like Amazon a gives us a low starting cost,” Rouanne said. Unlike the massive hardware and network-operation expenses of traditional carrier networks, “we will connect devices in a very cost-effective manner. This will make a big difference in the market.”(Updates shares in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Dish Enlists Amazon in Challenging Wireless Giants in 5G

2021-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son has run almost all the way through $23 billion allocated to buy back SoftBank Group Corp. shares, raising concerns that his stock’s bull run will end without rapid intervention.The Tokyo-based company purchased more than $20 billion worth of its own shares over the past year through March, according to SoftBank filings, an unprecedented effort that more than doubled the value of the stock. Now, with only about 10% of the committed capital left, the program may run out as soon as next month, Bloomberg’s calculations show.Already, there are signs the buybacks are losing their power to lift SoftBank’s stock. Shares declined 5.7% in March, their worst monthly performance since the pandemic low a year earlier. They fell even as more money was spent on re-purchases, the overall markets advanced, and SoftBank’s profit for the March quarter is expected to hit a record.“Buybacks are coming to an end,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies. “When that upward pressure on the stock price ends, the short bets may come out.”Son hasn’t said whether he will allocate more capital for buybacks, after announcing four overlapping installments last year for a total of 2.5 trillion yen or roughly $23 billion. It’s possible he would make a new commitment when SoftBank reports earnings results on May 12.A SoftBank spokesperson said in an email the stock price reflects not just buybacks but also shareholder appreciation of the progress being made in the investment business, declining to comment on plans for further buybacks.SoftBank shares slipped 1.5%, while Japanese stock indexes rose.After shares plunged in March 2020 with the coronavirus outbreak, Son unveiled plans to sell off assets to reduce debt and fund buybacks. He also announced a deal to sell chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for $40 billion. SoftBank’s stock touched a two-decade high before falling last month.It’s difficult to predict exactly when the buyback money will run out, but SoftBank’s history of purchases offers clues. The company spent on average 200 billion yen a month over the past half a year and 253 billion yen in March alone, its biggest monthly outlay this year. It had just shy of 258 billion yen left in the final buyback tranche as of the end of March.“It’s amazing how much they bought back over the past few months even though the shares are at a record high,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Research in Tokyo. “There hasn’t been a deceleration and that lends credence to the idea that the company will buy back more shares when the allocation is done.”SoftBank has also shown a willingness to make big interventions to bolster the stock against bad news and to build momentum on positive events, at times accounting for as much as 19% of trading volume. It spent over 50 billion yen in a single trading session on Dec. 10. The buybacks sent the shares 11% higher and came a day after Bloomberg broke news about Son debating a new strategy to take his SoftBank private, sparking a rally.The company also spent more than 130 billion yen over 5 business days in mid-April last year, its single biggest week of trading, after forecasting a record annual loss as the value of its startups cratered amid the coronavirus pandemic. When the booming equity markets helped turn the losses into a record profit in the Vision Fund business in early February, SoftBank bought more than 34 billion yen of stock over two days after the results announcement.Overall, SoftBank’s purchases have been effective. For every $1 billion spent on buybacks, the company’s market value increased by more than $6 billion -- until March. That month, the company spent over $2.3 billion only to see its market capitalization slide by almost $11 billion.The coming earnings announcement could offer another opportunity to bolster the share price. SoftBank is likely to report a full-year net income that’s the highest ever for a listed Japanese company in any quarter dating back to 1990, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Vision Fund profit, supercharged by the successful initial public offering of Coupang Inc., may reach an unprecedented $30 billion, people familiar with the matter said.SoftBank Vision Fund Profit Said to Near $30 Billion on CoupangWhile the profits are largely paper gains on investments, Son has plenty of cash to keep buying back stock. He paid for the original program by offloading about $16 billion of Alibaba stock, an even larger chunk of its stake in T-Mobile US Inc. and some shares of SoftBank Corp., his Japanese telecommunications unit. He then went even further, announcing the sale of Arm, slashing the stake in SoftBank Corp. by about a third and selling a controlling shareholding in phone-distribution company Brightstar Corp. The Japanese conglomerate had 4.45 trillion yen in cash and equivalents as of Dec. 31.Son, who has long railed against the gap between SoftBank’s capitalization and the value of its assets, has flirted with the idea of taking his company private as recently as last March. The buybacks may be part of a multi-year strategy of reducing outstanding shares until the founder has a big enough stake so that he can squeeze out the remaining investors, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in December. The proportion of treasury stock held by the company rose from just over 1% to almost 17% in the year since the re-purchases began last March. Combined with his personal stake, Son now controls about 40% of the outstanding shares.SoftBank Is Said to Discuss ‘Slow-Burn’ Buyout to Go Private (2)SoftBank’s stock has climbed more than 160% since the company started buying back shares, but gains have slowed in recent months as the corporate discount shrank.

Chinese technology companies including Huawei Technologies Co. are lobbying their government against the transaction, while a regulator in the U.K., where Arm is based, said it plans to intervene “on national security grounds.” At the same time, Arm is mired in a legal battle for control of its China unit with the chief executive, who was fired by SoftBank but has refused to leave.“Unless there is a catalyst to expand its net asset value, it is probable that we will see the discount widening out again,” Tang said. “It still is a conglomerate with a lot of unlisted investments in its portfolio.”(Updates with shares in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","SoftBank Nears End of $23 Billion Buyback, Imperiling Rally"

2021-05-04,"Covid-19 has normalized work-from-home, highlighting the need for improved connectivity, online security, and data sharing solutions. This alone could point to the secure future of 5G for its contribution to the technological landscape. Yet the potential within the 5G rollout, and the implications of its super-fast speeds, low latency, and greater functionality, extend far beyond remote work solutions. As Warren Buffett’s recently revealed 5G stock choices indicate, 5G underlies a digital transformation that is set to sweep the world. The hyperconnectivity that it supports could pave the way for smart cities, autonomous driving, and remote healthcare. 5G holds the potential to connect millions of devices, and process masses of data on everything from air or soil quality to traffic flow to a person’s body temperature. When coupled with Edge processing, and machine learning to maximize the power behind the data, 5G could bring unprecedented digitization of all walks of life. Investor and business tycoon, Warren Buffett, who has been considered one of the most successful investors in the world, recently demonstrated his confidence in the future of 5G by opening or enlarging investment positions in two companies central to the 5G rollout. His considerable capital lets him bet directly and extensively on these two power players in the 5G space, while next-generation retail investors can gain exposure by going for a 5G ETF (FIVG) that potentially mitigates the risk of a single company while offering diversified exposure to the 5G future. Buffett bought 147 million Verizon shares for $8.62 billion. Verizon (NYSE: VZ), which was formed in 2000, was the first to offer customers access to 5G, when it launched networks in Chicago and Minneapolis in April 2019. It resisted expanding into the realm of media and maintained a strong focus on 5G, focusing its R&D resources on challenges like improving spectrum range and penetration into buildings. By now Verizon has launched 5G networks across thousands of US cities and manufactures a range of commercially available 5G-enabled cell phones. It has also initiated 5G-industry partnerships, for example, supporting global pharma track-and-trace solutions, which improve inventory management, demand and use evaluation, patient safety, and cost control. Verizon recently announced the continued rollout of its Ultra Wideband service, which uses a millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum and is even faster than its nationwide service, which uses a lower spectrum. The pandemic does not seem to have harmed Verizon’s core value estimation. The company’s total debt fell by $4.9 billion in the second quarter of 2020 as Covid reduced advertising costs and lower subscriber-acquisition costs actually boosted company margins. Morgan Stanley even noticed that lower smartphone sales are actually linked to stronger stock value for Verizon, indicating the long-term potential investors see in Verizon as a 5G provider. Buffett also upped his stake in T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), from 2.4 million shares valued at $276 million that he bought in the third quarter of 2020, to 5.2 million shares of T-Mobile valued at $706 million. T-Mobile runs the largest US 5G network, covering 1.6m square miles, and it has been strategically pursuing this goal, merging with Sprint last year to add invaluable mid-band spectrum. It had a strong 2020, with 1.7m total net additions in the fourth quarter, the best in the industry. This aligned with 5.6m over the whole year, which also beat all the competitors and was the highest level achieved in the last four years. In the fourth quarter of 2020 it saw the lowest ever customer churn for the T-mobile brand, and again outperformed all other companies in the sector. T-Mobile ended the year with 102 million subscribers, a little behind Verizon’s 120 million. While T-Mobile launched its 5G network over a year ago, it has moved ahead aggressively and in January 2021 announced that independent research found it to provide the fastest download speeds, fasted 5G upload speeds, and most widely available signal. Buffett’s commitment to these two sector leaders is a clear acknowledgment of the wide use-case potential inherent in the ultra-low latency and high speeds of 5G. Indeed former CISCO (NASDAQ: CSCO) CEO, John Chambers recently highlighted 5G technology as a likely source of ongoing economic expansion. He analogized it to the 1990s when technology and the internet stimulated a decade of growth – a 34% rise in GDP, a 24% rise in average household income – due to the underlying infrastructure build-out. Chambers emphasized that 5G, as an enabler of the Internet of Things and the Edge, could be a similar source of development. He noted that countries ranging from France to India are all pursuing digitization as a necessity rather than an option. Warren Buffett is known for advocating the strategy of value investing, whereby companies are valued for their strong earning power and long-term growth potential. His decision to increase his exposure to two of the leaders in the US 5G rollout points to his confidence in the value and potential of 5G technology.

2021-05-05,"Shares of mobile phone service provider T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) jumped 5% in early morning trading Wednesday in response to earnings news released right after market close Tuesday afternoon.  Analysts had forecast that T-Mobile would earn $0.57 per share on $18.9 billion in revenue for its first fiscal quarter of 2021.  There's merely ""reporting"" earnings, and then there's bragging -- and what T-Mobile said yesterday verged on the latter.",Why T-Mobile US Stock Popped After Earnings
2021-05-05,"T-Mobile (TMUS) expects to deliver even better results in 2021 than it previously anticipated. The telecom operator has raised its full-year outlook after reporting strong Q1 earnings. T-Mobile merged with rival Sprint to expand its business. Given the strength of the execution of the merger, synergies are projected to more than double the $1.3 billion delivered in 2020. The wireless operator also sees its customer gains accelerating. It added 1.2 million postpaid subscribers in the first quarter, which it said was the industry's best performance. It now expects to add 4.4 million - 4.9 million postpaid subscribers in 2021. That’s higher than the 4 million – 4.7 million postpaid subscriber gain it previously forecast. Additionally, the company lifted its free cash flow target to $5.1 billion - $5.5 billion, up from $4.9 billion - $5.4 billion previously. Revenue rose to $19.8 billion from $11.1 billion a year ago. EPS of $0.74 was down from $1.10 as the Sprint merger added more shares. T-Mobile credits its gains to network investment, especially 5G. “We just keep pushing further ahead of the competition. Our network leadership is fueling customer momentum, delivering merger synergies and expanding our addressable markets for growth,” said T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. The integration of Sprint is progressing well. T-Mobile reported that Sprint customer traffic now running on its network has doubled from the previous quarter to 50%. It also disclosed that 20% of Sprint customers have shifted to its network. (See T-Mobile stock analysis on TipRanks) Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan reiterated a Buy rating and set a $190 price target on the stock after the strong earnings and guidance boost. It indicates upside potential of 41.98% “TMUS is executing very well and is ahead of its competition on network builds,” commented Horan. Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on the stock’s 12 Buy and 1 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $160.08 implies 19% upside potential from the current price. TMUS scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating tool, implying it is likely to outperform the market.

2021-05-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Telekom AG is considering taking a bigger stake in affiliate T-Mobile, according to a person familiar with the discussions, in a sign the German carrier’s management sees more growth potential in the U.S. than at home.Deutsche Telekom currently holds a 43.3% stake in T-Mobile US Inc. worth $73.3 billion. In 2020, it was granted the right to buy a further 101.5 million shares -- around 8% -- in the U.S. carrier currently held by SoftBank Group Corp. T-Mobile’s stock slipped 1.8% to $137.75 in New York trading Tuesday. A spokesperson for Deutsche Telekom declined to comment. The news was first reported by Handelsblatt.Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges, who is set to address shareholders at a capital markets day on Thursday, has lobbied in vain for years for cross-border European mergers that would allow the region’s phone companies to narrow a profitability gap with their U.S. peers.With Deutsche Telekom struggling for growth in Europe, T-Mobile has outperformed its parent company, and has taken a lead in fifth-generation mobile services outpacing rivals Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. Its acquisition of Sprint Corp. a year ago made it the second-largest provider of wireless services in the country.Earlier this month, T-Mobile topped earnings estimates and boosted its subscriber forecast.Read More: Deutsche Telekom Ponders European M&A After $26.5 Billion DealSoftBank became a co-owner of T-Mobile with Deutsche Telekom after the carrier took over Sprint in a $26.5 billion merger in 2020.(Updates share price in the second paragraph.

2021-05-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Telekom AG is in talks about a potential offer for SoftBank Group Corp.’s 8.5% stake in T-Mobile US Inc., a deal that would give the German telecom giant greater control over its U.S. affiliate.The terms of a potential deal, including whether Deutsche Telekom might bid for the entire stake to get majority control, haven’t been finalized and no firm decision has been made about an offer, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges may reveal plans to expand the company’s U.S. presence at a capital markets day this week, one of the people said.Representatives for Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment.Hoettges has a unique opportunity to increase the carrier’s exposure to the U.S., which generates healthier returns than the rest of its footprint, for a below-market rate. In 2020, SoftBank raised $14.8 billion from selling T-Mobile US shares to institutional investors. The terms of the deal gave Deutsche Telekom the right to buy some of SoftBank’s remaining stake at a price based on T-Mobile US’s share price at the time, more than 20% cheaper than they are now.Read More: SoftBank Stake Sale Could Change T-Mobile’s Prospects: Alex WebbUnder the options’ terms, Deutsche Telekom can buy as many as 44.9 million shares at a price that’s roughly equivalent to where the shares were trading in June 2020, or just over $100, according to regulatory filings and statements from the companies at the time. Another 56.6 million shares are available at the 20-day volume-weighted average price leading up to the purchase. If Deutsche Telekom were to buy all 101.5 million shares at Wednesday’s prices, the deal would cost approximately $12 billion.Deutsche Telekom has until June 2024 to act on the options.The Japanese group became co-owner of T-Mobile US last year after the carrier completed a merger with Sprint Corp., which was controlled by SoftBank. SoftBank’s 8.5% holding in the merged company is valued at about $14.3 billion as of the shares’ last closing price. Deutsche Telekom currently owns 43% of T-Mobile US.“We endorse the Board of Management’s objective of continuing on a consistent growth course in the United States and Europe,” said Ulrich Lehner, chairman of Deutsche Telekom’s supervisory board, in a separate statement ahead of the company’s capital markets day on Thursday. “The Supervisory Board also explicitly supports the expanded U.S. strategy - following the successful turnaround and the merger with Sprint.”SoftBank has been raising capital over the past two years as part of a push to unload assets to finance stock buybacks and pay down debt. Masayoshi Son’s technology investment giant has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes over the past twelve months, with SoftBank’s Vision Fund investment arm driving recent profits after being the source of its biggest loss a year ago.(Updates with details on option pricing, comment from Deutsche Telekom’s board from fifth paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Deutsche Telekom Said in Talks for SoftBank’s T-Mobile Stake
2021-05-19,"Deutsche Telekom AG (OTC: DTEGF) is targeting majority ownership in T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) by acquiring SoftBank Group Corp’s (OTC: SFTBF) (OTC: SFTBY) 8% stake in the wireless carrier at a deal valued at $12 billion, Bloomberg reports. SoftBank became a co-owner of T-Mobile with Deutsche Telekom after the carrier acquired Sprint for $26.5 billion in 2020, as per Bloomberg. Deutsche Telekom presently holds a 43% stake in T-Mobile. T-Mobile stock has appreciated 215% in the last five years and is valued at close to $170 billion. Peers Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) shares have gained 15%, and AT&T Inc (NYSE: T) lost 24% in the last five years. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert announced plans to return $60 billion to the shareholders via share buyback between 2023 and 2025 from incremental cash flow savings following the Sprint Corp acquisition. However, the acquisition could pressurize the already high debt level of Deutsche Telekom, which remains heavily invested in next-generation 5G and fiber-optic networks. Price action: DTEGF shares traded lower by 6.82% at $20.37, SFTBF shares traded higher by 0.54% at $80.89, and TMUS shares traded lower by 0.47% at $134.36 on the last check Wednesday.

2021-05-28,"T-Mobile Netherlands has signed Nokia (NOK) as a strategic partner. Nokia will secure T-Mobile’s network against cyber threats and also help accelerate the telecom operator’s digital transformation. T-Mobile Netherlands is the Dutch sister company of T-Mobile US (TMUS). Both are controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom. Finland-based Nokia sells telecom network equipment and provides the software and services that go with them. Regulators have demanded that operators improve the security of their networks at a time when threats and attacks are rising globally. Nokia will apply its NetGuard Audit Compliance Manager to minimize security risks to T-Mobile’s network and also help the operator improve its regulatory compliance. In addition to securing the network, Nokia will upgrade T-Mobile’s optical network. The upgrade will enable the network to meet 5G demands and make it ready for future technological developments. Furthermore, the work is expected to increase the network’s cost efficiency. Nokia will use its WaveFabric service-ready platforms and WaveSuite software for the optical network renewal. “Our intensified partnership with T-Mobile Netherlands leverages our deep understanding of their network while also ensuring heightened importance on protecting their network against possible cyber breaches,” commented Nokia’s Friedrich Trawoeger. Nokia’s security and optical network upgrade contract with T-Mobile Netherlands will run for five years. In another business win, Nokia will provide equipment and other services to AirFiber to help the broadband provider expand its fiber network in Bangalore and Tamil Nadu, India. (See Nokia stock analysis on TipRanks) Charter Equity analyst Edward Snyder recently reiterated a Buy rating on Nokia stock without assigning it a price target. The analyst believes Nokia stands to benefit from the Sweden-China tensions. Sweden banned Chinese vendors from its 5G market with China likely to retaliate. Nokia’s Sweden-based competitor Ericsson (ERIC) now fears it could lose market share in China. “Nokia to benefit if China excludes Ericsson from upcoming 5G tenders,” noted Snyder. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 5 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $5.65 implies 11.44% upside potential to the current price. NOK scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting the stock’s returns will likely align with the market performance.

2021-05-28,"Let’s face it, penny stocks can be nerve-wracking. While penny stocks (stocks that trade for less than $5 a share) have the potential for big gains, they can also be extremely volatile and are prone to big swings and even bigger losses. Investors willing to put money into penny stocks need to have strong convictions and strong stomachs. That said, there are some penny stocks that are more stable than others and could appeal to conservative investors. These tend to be shares of once high-flying companies that have fallen on hard times or are in turnaround mode, as well as shares of companies with good products that are in startup mode. These stocks tend to standout from the copper crowd with strong financials and potential for long-term gains. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever In this article, we look at four penny stocks that even conservative investors could love.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Ideanomics (NASDAQ:IDEX) Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Chico’s FAS (NYSE:CHS) Electrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO) Penny Stocks for Conservative Investors: Ideanomics (IDEX) Source: Sopotnicki / Shutterstock.com At $3 a share, IDEX stock is trading today at roughly half its 52-week high of $5.53 a share. Still, the share price of the fintech and electric vehicle (EV) company that is headquartered in New York City and has offices throughout China is up 710% from its 52-week low of $0.37. With returns like that, any investor could learn to love Ideanomics. Founded in 2004 as China Broadband, the company has gone through several names and re-brands over the years. However, the company and its stock look like they are finding their footing and gaining traction. The current optimism has come after Ideanomics reported better first-quarter results than analysts had expected. The company reported earnings per share of $0.00, better by 3 cents than what analysts had anticipated. Revenue in the first quarter came in at $32.71 million, which beat the forecast by $7.71 million. Ideanomics also impressed by announcing that it had $356 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter, giving the company plenty of capital for future investments and expansion. While some analysts continue to question Ideanomics’ role in the electric vehicle space, its fintech business continues to perform strongly, especially in China. Nokia (NOK) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com At $5.07 a share, NOK stock is just starting to edge out of penny stock territory. It’s been a long road for the Finnish telecommunications giant that was the world’s leading manufacturer of flip cell phones back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But it looks like the company has finally found a new niche for itself as a developer of fifth generation (5G) wireless internet networks. Companies such as as T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are turning to Nokia to help them get their 5G networks up and running. Also noteworthy is the fact that Nokia is the largest 5G network provider in China with a 25% market share in that country. Analysts expect that 5G wireless, which is 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks, will become the internet standard throughout the world in coming years, and Nokia is positioned to capitalize. 7 Cheap Stocks With Dividends for Both Returns and Cash Flow NOK stock is up 34% year-to-date at its current price. And 24% of that move higher has come since the end of April. Chico’s FAS (CHS) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstockc.om Fort Myers, Florida-based Chico’s FAS is a leading operator of women’s clothing brands. This includes its namesake Chico’s retail stores, as well as Soma, TellTale and other brands. Despite Covid-19 shuttering many of Chico’s brick-and-mortar stores, the company managed to pivot to its e-commerce platform and stay afloat through online sales. Digital sales at Chico’s FAS rose almost 70% in its most recent quarter, and the company has announced plans to shift more of its business online and to e-commerce platforms. Chico’s FAS latest quarterly results showed the company had a quarterly net loss of $79 million or $0.68 per share. This was due to depressed sales at the company’s 1,300 physical store locations as Covid-19 lockdown measures continued to hurt overall sales. Chico’s FAS has announced plans to permanently close 16% of its remaining stores within the next three years as it shifts operations online. The store closures are expected to be an important cost-saving measure for the company. CHS stock recently hit a 52-week high of $4.92 a share on May 18 and is currently trading at $4.46. The share price is up 181% year-to-date. Electrameccanica Vehicles (SOLO) Source: Luis War / Shutterstock.com Another electric vehicle stock that may appeal to cautious investors is Vancouver, British Columbia-based Electrameccanica Vehicles. The company manufactures a unique, single-passenger, three-wheeled electric vehicle called the “SOLO” that some analysts refer to as a “tryke.” The company has selected Mesa, Arizona, as the location for its U.S. manufacturing base and has opened showrooms for its vehicles in several locations, including San Diego, California. The Arizona facility will house light vehicle assembly and an engineering center. It’s still early days at Electrameccanica Vehicles, and the company is still firmly in startup mode. In its most recent quarter, Electrameccanica Vehicles reported revenue of only $224,000 and a net loss of $41.1 million, much of which can be attributed to expanding operations and business spending. However, the company has cash on hand of $129.5 million, which puts it on a solid financial footing. 8 Best Utility Stocks to Buy for Downside Protection SOLO stock is down 37% year-to-date at $3.90 a share and has been trading sideways since early May. Strong sales would help the stock reverse and move higher.
