2018-08-28,"The longest bull market in history has stocks trading at record-high levels. That sounds like great news all around, but it actually creates a problem for income investors: Where can they find dividend stocks poised for outperformance that still sport decent yields? The idea, after all, is to buy stocks when they&apos;re low, not hitting new highs. Furthermore, the market&apos;s relentless rise is depressing yields on dividend stocks. Don&apos;t forget: The yield on a dividend stock falls as its price goes up. A year ago, the dividend-paying stocks in the Standard & Poor&apos;s 500-stock index had a trailing yield of 2%, according to Birinyi Associates. After gaining roughly 13% over the past 52 weeks, the yield on the S&P 500 is down to 1.8%. Quality buy-rated dividend stocks with better-than-average yields are hard to find, but we&apos;re here to help. First, we scoured the S&P 500 for dividend stocks with yields of at least 2%.

2018-10-11,"Breakfast is big business. Americans gobbled up $8.5 billion worth of ready-to-eat cereal over the past year, according to IRI, a market research firm. Just four companies - General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), Post Holdings (POST) and Quaker Foods, a division of PepsiCo (PEP) - collectively accounted for $7.3 billion of those sales. Although cereal sales have been stagnant of late - down 1.4% year-over-year - growing interest in cereal as a snack among younger consumers could goose demand. Market research firm Mintel found that 56% of millennials say they&apos;ve eaten cereal as a snack at home, compared with just 32% of baby boomers. &quot;While breakfast is the most common occasion for eating cereal and nearly universal across age groups, snacking on cereal may offer greater potential for reinvigorating category growth, especially among younger adults,&quot; says John Owen, an analyst with Mintel.

2019-02-14,"Stocks looked set for more gains in pre-market trading before opening lower on weaker-than-expected retail sales. Stocks recovered their losses by midday trading, as bears weren't able to crack the markets too badly. That sets us up for a few must-see stock trades going into Friday. Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is having a pretty rough day, especially as its investors aren't too accustomed to 7.5% one-day pullbacks. After in-line earnings results and a beat on revenue, management provided a cautious outlook that sent shares reeling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's hard to deny that $50 was clearly resistance in this name, but there could be some debate about support. Some will say KO has already dropped through it at $46.50. Others will say support still rests down at $46. Within 50 cents of each other and I say it's a wash.  * The 10 Best ETFs You Can Buy Notably, we also have the 200-day nearby at $45.62. Those who want to take a stab at Coca-Cola stock should keep these levels in mind. A close below the 200-day and traders may want to rethink their position. Keep in mind, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reports earnings on Friday before the open. CyberArk (CYBR)Acting as the complete opposite, CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is soaring on the day after a very impressive earnings report. Shares are up 20% as a result (and good call Will Healy).Now investors are wondering where it can rally to. Short of a market-wide breakdown, CYBR has room above $110, with trend resistance still a little ways above current levels.On the downside, should CYBR pullback, look to see if it can stay over Thursday's low. If it can't, see how it handles uptrend support (purple line). Canada Goose (GOOS)Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) hammered earnings, and that's putting it lightly. Revenue of ~$400 million grew 50% year-over-year and smashed estimates by more than $130 million. Guidance was solid too.Despite all this, shares are down about 11%. Shares are now technically below the 200-day, but have the 21-day and 50-day moving averages just below current levels. Further, its got short-term uptrend support nearby too.Those who feel this is the wrong reaction and/or an overreaction to what were truly great results may consider this a buying opportunity. Below $50 and a drop down to $46 to $47 isn't out of the question, and possibly further.  * 7 Best of the Best Fidelity Funds to Buy Conservative traders who don't mind buying even though we're heading into the spring and summer seasons instead of the fall and winter seasons may consider waiting a few days to see if buyers step in first. S&P 500 ETF (SPY)The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is one we should look at now given how well the market has done since the December lows. A lot of investors were focused on possible downtrend resistance (blue line), but I didn't like that look.Why? Because it feels cherry picked and felt forced on the charts to justify a negative view. Plus, it's an inaccurate trend, but I digress. Instead, I continue to focus on the $280 level, a mark that SPY failed at three times in October, November and December. If we get there in a relatively quick amount of time, it will also likely push the RSI (green circle) into overbought territory.A rally to this level would be my ideal scenario and give investors a solid risk/reward for some profit taking and/or possible shorting opportunities. The exception is if we get there via a trade deal with China. If that happens, $280 may prove to be feeble resistance. CenturyLink (CTL)Not that it was surprisingly with a near-15% yield, but CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) stock is getting pummeled on Thursday after axing its dividend to $1 a share from $2.16. Shares are down about 12% in response, but according to the charts, they could have further room to fall.The downtrend (blue line) told investors all they needed to know leading up to this gut-punch. Now below $14 and shares are in no man's land until $12. Maybe buyers will step in near $12.50, but there seems to be little reason to hop on board into such a route.  * 7 Reasons Stock Buybacks Should Be Illegal Let CTL wash out and let's see if $12 holds.

2019-02-14,"To say that the Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock came out of the gate strong is the understatement of the decade. The stock got caught in a whirlwind trade that made instant millionaires but left many broken accounts. The rise was so fast that the shorts were decimated. Then the fall was equally impressive and surely caught late-comers stuck long.Source: Shutterstock Since then, the mania has abated but it still is an exciting stock to watch. It is now more than 70% off its highs on Sept. 19, 2018, but it still carries the aura of last year. Critics would argue that fundamentally, Tilray stock is grossly overvalued from a traditional standpoint. It has a market cap of $7 billion with only $20 million in revenues.But this is not a traditional stock. While I am not here to judge it for value, the bullish thesis here resembles that of Tesla a few years ago. Bulls have an array of reasons why TLRY has tremendous potential down the road. The cannabis stocks are levitating here for a whole host of reasons. Some see medicinal applications, while others expect mainstream companies like Coke (NYSE:KO) or Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) to promote the recreational cannabis-infused drinks. There is also the edible area which is already in full bloom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Looking Into Tilray StockI am not here to judge what's right or wrong from the ethical aspect. Nor am I here to judge the thesis. I can clearly see that the thesis is popular to the point that it is almost impossible to kill it here. As long as this is true, there will be a bid under cannabis stocks like TLRY.For those who believe strongly in the sector, they should just buy and hold the stocks for the long term. Personally, for that plan I'd prefer Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC). This way I can piggy back off the homework of Constellation (NYSE:STZ) and their $4 billion investment in CGC.For the traders among us, we can refer to price to learn the truth. The charts give us all the information that we need to find trigger levels up or down, then set a clear plan of action.My observation is that TLRY stock is too quiet here. For momentum stocks like this, this only means that a move is coming and direction is unknown. More to that point, the range of prices tightened severely in February. The last time we had a similar situation was on Jan. 7. What ensued was a giant 30% rally.While this is not a guarantee that history will repeat itself, the price action is similar. The range tightened between Dec. 20 and Jan. 7 and then the stock blow up. It is definitely worth an attempt at a trade.  Click to Enlarge The upside triggers are $78.30, $79.54 and $88.70. Each should bring some resistance, but then if the bulls break through them they invite more buyers to join. Now we have a higher low and lower high trading sequence coming into a point. This won't last, so traders must be fast.I don't normally condone jumping the gun, but Tilray stock might be hard to grab it if it starts moving. I am also not reckless, so it is probably a good idea to use options to get in for little money. I'd use March contracts or longer for this.TLRY is probably reporting earnings soon, and that is definitely an unpredictable short-term catalyst. First, we don't know what they will deliver. And second, we don't know how markets will react to the report. This is more reason to use smaller out-of-pocket expense in options.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Specifically, KO has found it difficult to offset the public's shift away from sugary sodas with other kinds of drinks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd yet, that's not the only stumbling block for Coca-Cola stock right now. Recapping Coca-Cola's EarningsFor the quarter ending in December, Coca-Cola generated $7.06 billion of revenue and operating earnings of 43 cents per share of Coca-Cola stock, both of which were in-line with analysts' consensus expectations.The company's top line fell 6% year-over-year, but that was entirely due to its re-franchising of some of its bottling operations, a move that ultimately improved its profitability. After adjusting for the exit of some of its bottling business, currency fluctuations, and its acquisitions, its revenue rose 5% YoY, while its operating margins improved by over five percentage points.The decision to focus more on branding and sales rather than bottling appears to have been a fiscally savvy one, though only modestly so. While revenue excluding acquisitions improved 5%, overall sales as measured by volume were flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Volumes fell slightly in Latin America and North America.KO noted that rising shipping costs forced it to raise its prices, adding that the price hikes may have lowered demand for its products. Perspective on KO's ResultsCoke's lackluster Q4 results were affected by challenges that the entire soft-drink industry is facing. That is, consumers are steering clear of sugar-laden sodas.Coca-Cola has risen to the challenge, developing new diet versions of carbonated drinks like its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar line and designing new Diet Coke cans that have proven more appealing than its standard Diet Coke can.The effort has gotten some traction, with the company's sparkling beverage sales growing 2% last year. That's not enough, however, to satisfy the owners of Coca-Cola stock, partly because the company's juice and dairy lines slumped 1% YoY, while the sales of water and sports drinks grew 3% and its revenue from its coffee and tea beverages grew a modest 1% in 2018. Concerned the company may not be capable of fostering meaningful growth in the foreseeable future, investors revolted by sending Coca-Cola stock down more than 7% on Thursday.But Coca-Cola stock may have been destined to tumble no matter what.Coca-Cola stock was up an impressive 8% from its late-December low headed into Thursday morning's report, and it had climbed more than 12% over the previous year.The strength suggested to Cornerstone Macro technical analyst Carter Worth that traders were ready to buy Coca-Cola stock on the news, driving KO stock even higher in the process.Worth's call on Monday was clearly bullish. His exact words were, &quot;Simple chart, simple breakout bet, earnings coming, and I like Coke long.&quot; A breakout move following Thursday's earnings report, however, would have snapped KO stock out of a trading range and above a resistance line that's been established since 2013. Coca-Cola stock hasn't historically made big moves that last for a long time.Given the chart's historical pattern and the depth of Thursday's selloff, a pullback to the lower edge of the trading range now seems likely. After such a move, Coca-Cola stock would be just above $42 within the next few weeks. What's Ahead for Coca-Cola StockAny sustained retreat by KO stock will be caused by the beverage company's 2019 outlook.Coke is looking for revenue growth, excluding acquisitions, of approximately 4% this year, along with comparable operating income growth of 6%-7%. All told, Coke's EPS should be little changed from last year's $2.08, give or take 1%, thanks to currency headwinds. Analysts' average EPS estimate before last week's results was $2.23.Although the company's outlook fell well short of estimates and was the main cause of Thursday's decline, it's conceivable that KO is deliberately providing conservative guidance.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-20,"PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) stock rose sharply on Friday after the global beverage and snacks giant reported fourth-quarter numbers that were largely in-line with expectations, but provided full-year 2019 revenue guidance that impressed investors. Pepsi stock rose more than 3% in the wake of the results.Source: Shutterstock From a big-picture perspective, Pepsi is doing everything right. It's expanding its beverage-product portfolio to include brands and products which resonate better with today's health-conscious consumers than traditional sodas. It's also doubling down on its push into the snacking category, which includes broadening the portfolio to include more health-conscious, relevant brands. And as far as operations, everything looks good at PEP.Meanwhile, the macroeconomic backdrop is stabilizing. Pepsi stock is also cheap both on an absolute basis and relative to shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Smart Money Stocks to Buy Now Thus, this rally of PEP stock makes sense. Good results, improving sentiment, and a depressed valuation will push Pepsi stock above $120 soon. Pepsi's Strategy Is EffectiveIn Q4, PEP reported sales growth, excluding acquisitions, of 4.6% and core earnings per share growth of 17%. That wraps up a year during which its sales excluding acquisitions rose 3.7% and its core EPS rose 9%. That was the third consecutive year that its sales excluding acquisitions rose 2%-4% range and its core EPS rose 9%.What has PEP done right during those three years? It has successfully broadened its reach and portfolio. We all know that the traditional carbonated beverage market is stagnant and perhaps even declining as consumers increasingly shift towards healthier options, like enhanced waters, sparkling drinks, and teas.PEP has made this pivot, too. Specifically, it made acquisitions, headlined by its $3.2 billion acquisition of SodaStream last year, and PEP has also made its existing beverage brands more relevant and healthy.Pepsi has made a similar pivot in the snacking category. Much like traditional sodas, traditional, sugar-heavy snacks are losing popularity as consumers shift towards healthier options. Mostly through acquisitions, such as the late 2018 acquisition of plant-based-snack-bar-brand Health Warrior, Pepsi has made its snacks exceptionally relevant to today's health-conscious consumers.This strategy of acquiring relevant, popular snack and beverage brands, and distributing them around the world, is a winning combination. For the foreseeable future, the strategy will generate largely consistent, low-single-digit-percentage-revenue growth for PEP. Coupled with cost-cutting measures, that top-line growth should enable Pepsi's EPS to steadily rise by mid-to-high-single-digit-percentage levels. The Valuation of Pepsi Stock Is AttractiveThe attractive thing about PEP stock is that, because everyone piled into KO stock in 2018 and forgot about Pepsi stock, the shares of Pepsi are still undervalued even after their post-earnings pop.Consider this. KO stock almost always has a higher forward price-earnings multiple than Pepsi stock. But the divergence between the forward multiples of KO and PEP s is currently at a multi-year high. Whenever the difference between the forward P/E multiples of the two stocks is above two(which it currently is), PEP stock tends to outperform.Also, Pepsi almost always has a lower dividend yield than KO stock. But, for the first time in five years, PEP's dividend yield is almost as big as KO's dividend yield.In other words, relative to KO stock and historical standards, PEP stock seems undervalued. That is also true on an absolute basis. Assuming Pepsi's mid-to-high-single-digit-percentage EPS growth persists, Pepsi's EPS could be $8.50 by fiscal 2025. Based on Pepsi stock's average historic forward multiple of 20, that equates to a fiscal 2024 price target of $170.for PEP stock Discounted back by 7% per year (three points lower than my usual 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of over $120. The Bottom Line on PEP StockPEP has found a winning strategy which should power consistent, healthy revenue and profit growth over the next several years. As a result, Pepsi stock is a good name to buy when its valuation is below normal and a good name to sell when its valuation is above normal.Right now, the valuation of PEP stock is below normal, so now is still a good time to buy it.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-27,"Although the soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) earned an unfortunate reputation as a boring investment, it now makes an attractive case. With multiple twists and turns in the economic and geopolitical landscape, KO stock provides a measure of stability. Conservative investors have long relied on its consistent dividends.Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)The issue, though, was that the KO stock price went range bound for several years. But in 2018, the shares finally made good on their upside potential. After hitting bottom around mid-May, the beverage-maker gained nearly 17%. Coca-Cola stock ended the year up almost 7%, becoming one of the few names that weathered last October's market fallout.Much of the enthusiasm centered on the company's rebranding efforts. As millennials and later Generation Z emerged onto the scene, their health-centric behaviors dramatically changed the beverage market. Coca-Cola stock suffered while young consumers avoided carbonated, sugary drinks. To counter this trend, the company offered its own healthy alternatives, while face-lifting and spicing-up its traditional soft-drink portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnlike earlier efforts, management finally generated momentum. Despite several fundamental headwinds -- such as unfavorable currency fluctuations and the U.S.-China trade war -- Coca-Cola generated surprising growth. Was Q4 the Growth Story's End?It was a similar story for its most recent fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report. The company met its target for earnings per share at 43 cents, while its revenue haul of $7.06 billion beat the $7.03 billion consensus estimate. This time, though, the KO stock price took a beating following the report.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market Wall Street didn't care for the fact that management downgraded expectations for the full year 2019. Against a forecast calling for EPS of $2.22, Coca-Cola's brass expects to &quot;range from 1% below or above $2.08.&quot;On paper, Q4 spelled the end of the growth story. Does it also spell the end of Coca-Cola stock? Soda isn't Dead and Neither is Coca-Cola StockI don't blame anyone from running away from KO stock. If you pay attention to industry news, you'll find a consistent theme: young consumers don't drink soda.Critically last year, I noted worrisome trend: both Coca-Cola and its principal rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) appeal to an older crowd. I wrote:The main challenge is shifting consumer tastes, especially among the younger demographic. Indeed, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have both unintentionally catered to a surprisingly old demographic. According to a 2016 Adweek report, Coke was most popular among people aged 35-to-44 years. The largest consumer base for Pepsi featured the plus-65 crowd.Sales stats indicate that Coca-Cola have moved the needle on demographics, especially with their slim, colorful Diet Coke packaging, That definitely helps in transitioning consumers back towards carbonated drinks.Another important point is that premonitions about soft drinks may have been premature. A year ago, Food & Wine reported that Slice soda -- a nineties phenomenon -- is making a comeback. Another blast from the past, Jolt Cola, has also returned to retail shelves.While it's too early to say whether these product resurrections will succeed, their return bodes positively for Coca-Cola stock. Logically, we can deduce that their respective backers see a viable opportunity. After all, Jolt Cola runs the tagline, &quot;All the sugar and twice the caffeine.&quot;That's enough to make millennials run to their safe spaces! Yet here they are.Moreover, I don't think prospective buyers should assume that Slice and Jolt are isolated cases. Just recently, Coca-Cola announced that an orange-vanilla variant to their flagship brand. Yes, they'll leverage their massive financial resources to market the hell out of it.But they're doing it for a reason: consumers still love soda, and that's net positive for KO stock. KO Stock is an Underappreciated China OpportunityIf the soda market's potential resurgence wasn't convincing enough, KO stock also has a viable, under-the-radar opportunity in China. Primarily, Coca-Cola can leverage its world-renown branding, something very few companies can boast.  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns Of course, branding alone won't guarantee success in China. Fast-food icon McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has recently suffered frustrating spells in the world's second-biggest economy. Additionally, McDonald's and other American fast-food joints have found difficulty competing against local offerings.This is where Coca-Cola's much-criticized buyout of British coffee-shop chain Costa Coffee will likely benefit KO stock longer-term. Sure, management paid a hefty premium on Costa relative to what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) earns. However, Starbucks isn't for sale.More importantly, both Starbucks and Costa compete aggressively in China. This makes sense considering that upwardly mobile Chinese millennials have embraced a coffee culture. But again, Starbucks isn't on the market. So the only way to effectively compete in the growing Chinese coffee market was through the Costa buyout; hence, the rich premium.Broadly speaking, the bears are overreacting to the immediate soundbites, which naturally hurt the Coca-Cola stock price. But if you take a step back, you'll see positive undercurrents. It just requires some patience for this narrative to play out.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-07,"When you write about investing as much as I do, sometimes it takes a little divine intervention to come up with ideas. Sometimes, I'll borrow an idea from another writer. Recently, I saw an article about dividend stocks that have already increased their quarterly payment early in 2019. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Eric Volkman, the author in question, recommended PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and TJX (NYSE:TJX). All Dividend Aristocrats, I like the latter two. Pepsi not so much. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, I do appreciate the inspiration. Now, on to the task at hand. I'm looking for seven dividend stocks that I'd want to own that have announced a dividend increase in the first 64 days of the year. While they don't have to be in the S&P 500, nor do they have to be a Dividend Aristocrat, they should have a market cap higher than $2 billion.To help with diversification, I'll try to get one stock for seven different sectors. I can't guarantee that will be the case, but I'll give it my best shot.  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks So, without further ado, here are my seven dividend stocks to own now. EPR Properties (EPR)On Jan. 16, 2019, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) announced a 4.2% increase in its monthly cash dividend. Payable as of Feb. 15, the monthly dividend is now 37.5 cents or $4.50 on an annual basis. It is the company's ninth consecutive year increasing its dividend. In February 2018, I recommended the REIT that specializes in experiential real estate, to own in good times and bad. At the time, it was yielding 7.7%. As of Mar. 5, 2019, it's yielding 6.1%. That's because it has appreciated significantly over the past year. I've been a fan of EPR stock for a long time. I first recommended it in 2013 when it was trading in the $50s. In 2019, EPR expects to generate adjusted funds from operation (FFO) of at least $5.30 a share. With all the interesting experiential real estate it owns or is developing, I continue to believe it's a REIT to hold for the next 20 years. Fastenal (FAST)On Jan. 16, 2019, Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) announced a 3-cent increase in its quarterly dividend. Payable as of Feb. 27, the quarterly dividend is now 43 cents or $1.72 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 2.8%. The company first paid an annual dividend in 1991. It went to semi-annual dividends in 2003, and finally to quarterly dividends in 2011. It has also paid out special dividends in 2010 and 2012. Fastenal is a wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. Although I haven't covered the company in recent years, its results from fiscal 2018 suggest it's doing just fine. In 2018, Fastenal grew revenues by 13% to $5 billion. On the bottom line, it increased earnings by 30% to $752 million. Both the company's fastener and non-fastener products experienced healthy double-digit growth in 2018.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains CEO Daniel Florness plans to double company sales to $10 billion. That ought to happen sometime in 2024. Perhaps earlier. BlackRock (BLK)On Jan. 16, 2019, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) announced a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend to $3.30. Payable as of Mar. 21, the quarterly dividend works out to $13.20 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 3.0%. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has become almost as famous for his annual letter to CEOs as he has for building the owner of iShares ETFs into a global asset management powerhouse. Fink's 2019 letter was another classic. Here's the part that stands out for me: &quot;Companies must embrace a greater responsibility to help workers navigate retirement, lending their expertise and capacity for innovation to solve this immense global challenge. In doing so, companies will create not just a more stable and engaged workforce, but also a more economically secure population in the places where they operate,&quot; Fink stated in BlackRock's 2019 Letter to CEOs. He's not shy to say what's on his mind. Some people don't like it. I do. I believe it's what sets BlackRock apart from other asset management and financial services firms. Stand up for the little guy, and the little guy will give it his or her all for management. It's a contract Fink believes should still exist within companies. I couldn't agree more. Penske Automotive (PAG) On Jan. 30, 2019, Penske Automotive Group (NYSE:PAG) announced a 1-cent increase in its quarterly dividend to 38 cents. Payable as of Mar. 1, the quarterly dividend works out to $1.52 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 3.4%. A penny increase in the quarterly dividend might not seem like a lot, but it adds up. That's especially true when you've increased the dividend for 31 consecutive quarters. That's not a typo. There aren't many companies that are that consistent about their dividend. Of course, would you expect any less from Roger Penske, the King of motor racing?It hasn't been smooth motoring for PAG stock over the past 26 months with negative total returns of 5.3% and 12.8% in 2017 and 2018, respectively; it's nice to see Penske stock is up almost 9% year-to-date.  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy I recommended PAG stock last August as one of seven dividend growth stocks to buy. Although it has gone slightly backward since then, I see its juicy 3.4% dividend yield as an excellent check to earn while you wait for its stock to revert to the mean. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)On Feb. 6, 2019, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) announced a 6.9% increase in its quarterly dividend to 50 cents. Payable as of Mar. 29, the quarterly dividend works out to $2.01 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 5%. Google the word &quot;infrastructure,&quot; and you get 718 million results. Without infrastructure investments, economies wither and die. President Trump ran on an impressive platform in 2016 to grow the nation's infrastructure, but very little has been done. That's because America is broke and infrastructure is a costly adventure. It's not for the faint of heart, hence the 5% dividend yield.In fiscal 2018, BIP saw funds from operations (FFO) increase by 5% to $1.23 billion. Leading the charge was its energy business, which saw FFO increase by almost 29% in the past year. A significant part of the increase was the result of the company's investment in a Canadian midstream business as well as a North American residential energy infrastructure company. Like its affiliated former parent, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), BIP's goal is to acquire assets at a reasonable price, get them operating both efficiently and profitably, and then sell those assets when prices are high. Then take the proceeds and do it again. Rince and repeat. Church & Dwight (CHD)On Feb. 5, 2019, Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) announced a 4.6% increase in its quarterly dividend to 22.75 cents. Payable as of Mar. 1, the quarterly dividend works out to 91 cents on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 1.4%. What the maker of Arm & Hammer baking soda fails to provide in terms of dividend yield, it more than makes up for it with lots of capital appreciation. Year-to-date, CHD stock is up 0.54%. Off to a slow start in 2019, Church & Dwight stock is in danger of a losing year, the first in more than a decade. Over the past ten years, CHD's delivered an annualized total return of 19.6%, 250 basis points higher than the S&P 500.  * 7 Stocks That Should Be Worried About a Data Dividend That is why I believe Church & Dwight is the best consumer staples stock for investors to own for the long haul. Best Buy (BBY) On Feb. 27, 2019, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) announced an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend to 50 cents. Payable as of April 10, the quarterly dividend works out to $2 on an annual basis. As of Mar. 5, it yielded 3%. With the 11% increase, Best Buy has now increased its annual dividend payment for six consecutive years. It has also paid a dividend for 61 straight quarters. Best Buy's past issues including its ongoing fight with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) appear to be very much in the rear window.In 2018, Best Buy grew same-store sales by 4.8%, overall revenues increased 1.7% to $42.9 billion, and earnings-per-share on a non-GAAP basis increased by 20.4% to $5.32 a share. In 2019, it expects to generate at least $5.45 a share in earnings on $42.9 billion in revenue. It might not be massive growth, but considering its shares were trading around $12 in 2012, it has come a long way. When I wrote about Best Buy in August 2013, it had online sales that accounted for 6.1% of its overall revenue. Today, it's 21.9% or almost four times as much. It's one of the best comeback stories of the 21st century. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-08,"If you know nothing about the stock market except what I'll explain here today, you'll be a vastly better investor than almost everyone on Wall Street… or any MBA… or anyone on CNBC.What I'm going to share with you is a &quot;secret&quot; in the sense that few people use it. It's really an &quot;open secret.&quot; Nobody has it under lock and key. It's hiding under an invisible blanket of common sense.When you start putting this secret to work for you, you'll &quot;graduate&quot; into a higher class of investor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRight now, you've probably got some money in the stock market: You probably have a 401(k), an IRA, or an individual brokerage account.Once you've invested some money, you probably started watching a little financial television.  You probably read financial websites or a few investment magazines.While reading and listening to financial media, you're sure to encounter dozens of &quot;gurus&quot; who promote lots of different market strategies… and make lots of big predictions. You're sure to see lots of news stories about the economy and the government.It's a lot to take in. It can all be very confusing.And for 999 out of 1,000 people, it distracts them from what really leads to long-term success in stocks.You see, the news you read in the paper or hear on CNBC is completely meaningless compared to the idea I'll share with you now.Most people watch the financial news and think they're doing something important. They're actually just wasting time and getting distracted from what's truly important for making big, safe returns in the stock market.And what's truly important for growing wealth in stocks is the accumulation of elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices.That's it.It's the most important idea.It's the &quot;king&quot; of all investment ideas.It's a thousand times more important than knowing what the economy is doing… or what the government is doing… or what's happening in the news.Again… what's truly important for growing wealth in stocks is the accumulation of elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices.What is an elite business?How can you find them?And how can one safely and surely generate wealth for you? The Traits of Elite BusinessesThere's no set definition of an &quot;elite business.&quot; But most smart people agree that elite businesses share some unique traits.An elite business has a durable competitive advantage over its competitors.For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has a durable competitive advantage because its huge global distribution network allows it to sell goods at unbeatably low prices. It's very, very difficult for smaller firms to compete against it.An elite business usually has an outstanding brand name. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a good example. People associate Coke's logo and name with quality soda all over the world.An elite business is often the largest business in its industry.  When you run your business better than the competition, you usually can't help but become the biggest. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) became America's biggest fast food chain because it ran a better business than its competitors.An elite business often sells &quot;basic&quot; products, like food, oil, soda, cigarettes, beer, mouthwash, razor blades and deodorant. These are things that don't go out of style.And here's something you don't often hear: Most of the truly elite businesses sell habit-forming, or even addictive, products.If you look at the list of the 50 Best Stocks of All Time (July 1926 through  December 2016), you'll note many of them sold habit-forming products. It jumps right out at you.For example, Philip Morris, rebranded a few years ago to Altria (NYSE:MO), is right near the top of the list -- creating $470.2 billion of wealth in its lifetime. It sells cigarettes, which contain addictive nicotine.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) are on the list. They sell soda… which is a sugar and caffeine delivery vehicle.People love a little sugar rush. It's habit forming… even addictive.PepsiCo's business includes Frito-Lay, and salty snacks stay strong even when sugar gets a backlash.Many big drugstore brands are on the list. These names include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) -- whose products include Ensure nutrition drinks and Similac baby formula -- Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).People get very accustomed to filling a prescription, over and over. Much of the time, those drugs are useful, although sometimes they are not. And the same goes for your favorite brand of beer. I'm not saying these things are good or bad. I'm simply pointing out that people get very accustomed to them.You can make the case that certain fast foods are addictive as well. Fast food companies load their food with fat, sugar and chemicals that make people want more. This is part of the reason McDonald's has been such a corporate success.The businesses I just mentioned produced more than 13% annual gains for over three decades.Those returns are extraordinarily rare in the stock market. You won't find anything better.An investment of $25,000 in a tax-deferred account that grows 13% per year for 30 years grows to nearly one million dollars ($977,897).Most companies can't sustain 13% annual returns for more than five years.  The businesses I just mentioned sustained those returns for decades.And the reason why they did so well is simple… Why Habit-Forming Products Are Such a Cash CowWhen people form a habit around a product, it goes a long way towards ensuring repeat business.  People get used to certain brands, and they grow resistant to switching.Also, when people get used to a product and the brand surrounding it, they are more likely to continue buying the product even if the price increases a little. Both of these help companies sustain long-term sales growth and healthy profit margins. That's good for shareholders.It's also important to know that when these companies hit upon the right recipes or the right mix of whatever it takes to make good products, they don't have to make large, ongoing investments in the business. They don't have to spend tons of money on more research and development.Once Coca-Cola hit upon Coke, it didn't have to change it. The same goes for Budweiser and Hershey (NYSE:HSY) and Tootsie Roll (NYSE:TR).When you develop a product that people love and develop habits around, you don't tinker with it. You don't have to spend a lot of money on new research and development. You don't have to buy expensive high-tech equipment. You can instead spend that money on things that will provide a high return on investment, like marketing, distribution or manufacturing.This means a larger percentage of revenues can be sent to shareholders.Owning the world's top sellers of basic (often habit-forming) products is also ideal for investing in high-growth emerging markets like China and India.Combined, China and India have about 10 times the population of the United States. Many of those people are at the level of economic development of 1940s America… and they are getting a little richer every year. It's one of the biggest investment opportunities in history.To invest in this trend, I don't want to try and guess what websites will get the most clicks… or what retailer will become popular. That's a very difficult game to play. Those business landscapes will change rapidly.On the other hand, I'm very confident those folks in China and India who are getting a little richer every year will want to enjoy the same habit-forming products Americans have enjoyed for decades.They'll want to consume more branded soda, cigarettes, beer, liquor and processed foods.Owning elite, global businesses that serve those growing markets makes a lot of sense.By the way… these global sellers of branded, habit-forming consumer goods are the kinds of businesses Warren Buffett, the greatest investor in history, always looks to buy. He's a long-time owner of soda-maker Coca-Cola and candy maker See's Candies.My friend Neil George also owns several big-name, habit-forming brands in his portfolio for Profitable Investing -- a portfolio that has a long track record of correctly timing (and profiting from) trends ranging from gold and real estate booms to income stocks.Regards,BrianP.S. Besides habit-forming products…there's another key element that the best-performing stocks share.Compare Brokers The post The 1 Way to Invest for Retirement appeared first on InvestorPlace.",The #1 Way to Invest for Retirement

2019-03-13,"Target (NYSE:TGT) CEO Brian Cornell was hired by the Minneapolis-based retailer on July 31, 2014. Since then, Target stock is up 46%. Not bad for a company that was thought to be losing the discount war to companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) when the former head of PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) global food business took the job.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYear to date, Target stock is up 16% through March 11, less than four bucks away from $80, a level it's only seen twice -- August 2015 and August 2018 -- since Cornell's been in the top job. In November 2017, I wondered if Target could hit $80 in 2018. &quot;Can Target deliver an $80 stock in 2018? It's going to be even tougher after the latest hit to its share price,&quot; I wrote. &quot;I'll reserve judgment until after Black Friday, but business does appear to be getting stronger. And that's all you can ask for as an investor.&quot;In the 16 months since my comments, Target's business has come on like gangbusters, but it's hardly been reflected in its share price. Here's why I think that's about to change.  Business Is GoodTarget announced its fourth-quarter results March 5. They were very solid with full-year same-store sales growth of 5.0% -- brick-and-mortar up 3.2%, while digital sales increased 36% on a comparable basis -- and bottom-line adjusted earnings per share of $5.39, 15.1% higher than a year earlier. My InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blankenhorn called Target a good yield stock after it reported earnings, but not a good buy if you're looking for capital gains. I respectfully disagree.Perhaps it was a mirage, but Target's traffic and same-store sales growth in 2018 were the best the company's achieved in over a decade. Furthermore, its adjusted EPS set a record this past fiscal year. Those are hardly the hallmarks of a business in decline. The fact is, if you exclude the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2017, Target's Q4 results were significantly stronger than its reported numbers. On the top line, Target's revenue was $22.7 billion, flat compared to a year earlier. However, if you exclude $1.62 billion, the average of 14 weeks in 2017, the company's sales increased by 7.7%. On the bottom line, EPS increased by 12.5%, significantly better than the reported decrease of 23.5%. Looking ahead, Cornell sees low- to single-digit same-store sales growth in fiscal 2019, with GAAP earnings-per-share growth of at least 6.7%. Both are likely very conservative given the fact that Target's EPS guidance when it reported Q4 2017 last March was between $5.15 and $5.45 a share.   With digital sales growing at a blistering pace and traffic better than it's been in a long time, only a severe correction in consumer sentiment is going to slow Target's business.  Cannibalization Isn't an IssueTaking a page out of the Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) playbook, Target has optimized its retail footprint to meet growing online sales. Some analysts see this move hampering the retailer's in-store sales. Target doesn't see it quite the same way. &quot;Since 2016, we've made our stores more productive by using them as fulfillment centers. Our fulfillment sales per square foot have grown at an average 67% rate per year. Now, more than $14 a foot as our stores increasingly support our digital business,&quot; COO John Mulligan said during Target's conference call. &quot;At the same time, our in-store sales per square foot have grown at a 4% rate per year, which means our Target stores can support incremental growth from Target.com without hurting in-store sales.&quot;Investors have seen firsthand how Best Buy has been able to fend off Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by providing consumers an omnichannel shopping experience that works. Target's merely doing the same thing. And the fourth-quarter numbers bear that out. Target's using its store-as-a-hub strategy to grow faster. Forfeiting a few percentage points -- Q4 2018 gross was margin was 25.7%, 40 basis points lower than a year earlier -- in the name of growth is a good thing. Just ask shareholders who've held TGT stock for more than a few years.  The Bottom Line on Target StockOver the past two years, Target's capital expenditures have topped $6 billion, as it continues to invest in its business. Take out the impact of the Tax Act and Target's return on invested capital increased by 100 basis points in fiscal 2018 to 14.6%. Not everything's perfect about Target's business. It continues to struggle with its grocery store business. It's not so much that it isn't growing sales -- its food and beverage business has increased for six consecutive quarters -- but it doesn't have a coordinated strategy to take its grocery game to the next level. I believe Brian Cornell and the rest of the Target team are on top of the situation. In 2-3 years, investors won't recognize the company's grocery business.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners Under $75, I'd be a buyer of Target. Under $70, I'd back up the truck.

2019-03-13,"From the looks of it, National Beverage Corp. (NYSE:FIZZ) is a brand in crisis mode. The parent company of leading sparkling water brand La Croix has seen its growth narrative come off the rails over the past several quarters as competition in the sparkling water category has heated up and broader market growth has cooled for FIZZ stock.Source: H. Michael Karshis (Modified)Meanwhile, management appears to be in damage control mode, the PR backlash hasn't been great, and the outlook for demand and profit growth to return in the near term is bleak.All together, FIZZ stock has dropped from a 52 week high of $120-plus six months ago, to prices below $60 today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt this point in time, the bear thesis on FIZZ stock looks pretty compelling. You have a brand that is rapidly losing mind and market share in a slowing market, with falling margins and rising opex rates, too. All together, National Beverage Corp. will likely pivot into an era of sideways profits for the foreseeable future, which should lead to further weakness in FIZZ stock.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash That thesis sounds good. But, it misses one big element: valuation.At current levels, FIZZ stock is dirt cheap. It's already priced for all those negatives. But, in the event that National Beverage Corp. actually turns sales around and stabilizes margins, this stock could fly higher.I think that's what will happen. In the big picture, National Beverage Corp. is losing share in a rapidly growing market that has supported and will continue to support multiple high volume brands. La Croix will be one of those high volume brands. As such, sales will stabilize. So will margins. And profits.None of that stabilization is priced in today. That's why now looks like the right time to buy the dip in FIZZ. The Brand Is Losing SteamThere's no question about it; La Croix is losing momentum. Revenues rose 18% last year. Then, throughout the course of fiscal 2019, they have fallen from 18% to 13%, to 7%, and finally to down 3% last quarter. As revenue growth has slowed, gross margins have come under pressure, as have opex rates. All together, profit growth has pivoted from hugely positive, to hugely negative.There's a few reasons behind this big pivot. First, the sparkling water category is slowing. There's nothing that National Beverage Corp. can do about this. Sparkling water market growth rates have steadily declined over the past several years, as is only natural for a red hot market with big growth rates.Second, competition in the sparkling water category has picked up. There's also nothing that National Beverage Corp. can do about this. More competitors have entered this market, include PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) with their flavored sparkling water drink Bubly. Those new competitors have stolen share from La Croix.Thus, largely due to no fault of its own, La Croix brand is losing momentum. The financial implications of this are meaningful. Revenue growth will be way slower going forward thanks to falling market share. Gross margins will be pressured for the foreseeable future due to bigger pricing competition. Opex rates will head higher as the company will have to spend more to compete on the awareness front.Putting all that together, it's easy to see that National Beverage Corp's profit growth over the next several years won't be great. After back-to-back years of 30%-plus profit growth, investors weren't expecting great. As such, FIZZ has come under significant selling pressure over the past several quarters as weak profit growth has turned into a reality. The Valuation Is Cheap Enough to BuyWith sales slowing, margins retreating, and profits shrinking, it's tough to see why you would want to buy FIZZ here. But, the bull thesis is pretty simple. All those negatives are already priced in. Eventually, they will fade out. When they do, the stock will pop in a big way.The reality is that, while La Croix is losing market share to newer entrants in the sparkling water category, this brand still remains one of, if not the, most important brand in the sparkling water market.It's easy to see La Croix's dominance weakening going forward. But, it's equally tough to see the brand not being one of the top sparkling water drinks in any time horizon, given that La Croix has become almost synonymous with sparkling water.As such, La Croix should be able to grow revenues at a slightly slower rate than the entire sparkling water category. The entire sparkling water category projects as a double-digit grower over the next several years. Thus, La Croix should be able to grow revenues at a high single digit rate during that stretch.Gross margins will come under pressure, but should stabilize as competitive forces stabilize. Opex rates will likewise move higher, but should retreat in the long run thanks to high single digit revenue growth and stabilized competition.Overall, I think sparkling water market expansion can drive National Beverage's EPS towards $5 by fiscal 2025, even against a competitive backdrop. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi normally trade around 20 forward earnings. Based on that comp average 20 forward multiple, a realistic fiscal 2024 price target for FIZZ stock is $100. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of over $60.FIZZ  trades at under $60 today. Thus, it's reasonable to say that, even considering all the competitive risks, FIZZ stock is undervalued relative to its long term growth prospects. Bottom Line on FIZZ StockI used to drink a lot of La Croix. Now, I drink some La Croix and some Bubly. Apparently, I'm not the only one who has started drinking Bubly, and FIZZ stock has dropped big as a result.But, I still drink La Croix, as do a ton of consumers, and the whole sparkling water category is still growing by a ton. Thus, growth in the long run will stabilize and remain healthy. FIZZ stock currently isn't priced for this. That's why buying the dip here looks like an opportunity.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FIZZ.

2019-03-15,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has become a favorite among investors. How could it not, given its consistency, continued growth and dividend increases? Yet, as good as PEP stock is, not everyone is sold on the beverage and snacks maker. Who's not on board? Credit Suisse analysts.Last week, the research team initiated coverage on the Pepsi stock with an underperform rating and $100 price target on shares. The stock didn't really feel the impact of that downgrade -- given the strength of the overall market lately -- but as it stands, the target implies just under 14% downside from yesterday's $115.50 close.Is that something investors really need to look out for and if so, should they consider Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) instead? KO stock sits midway between its 52-week low and high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Evaluating PepsiCoWorth pointing out (or maybe not) is that Credit Suisse has the lowest price target on the Street. The average target is at $117.75, not much higher than current levels, while the highest sits up at $133, implying just over 14% upside.The analyst is critical over PEP stock's valuation, which is admittedly a bit high. The stock trades at more than 21 times this year's earnings. That wouldn't be all that bad for a blue-chip stock, but the growth profile is disappointing. Analysts expect the company to earn $5.51 per share this year, which is a 2.7% decline from 2018. That's despite 2.5% sales growth this year.Over the last five years, PEP stock has an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.9. If that were the case now, that would put Pepsi stock down near $109.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% Perhaps investors are excited about the company's prospect of growing earnings and sales 7.8% and 3.9% in fiscal 2020, respectively, but that's a long ways off. Some further digging shows Pepsi stock has other strains.While gross margins are ticking higher in the recent quarter, they have been trending lower for over two years on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating margins have come under pressure over the past few quarters, while free cash flow has been greatly pressured. In 2016, the company generated more than $8 billion in free cash flow, while in 2018 it barely eclipsed $6 billion. Trading Pepsi Stock  Click to EnlargeIs PEP stock a bad company to own? Absolutely not. After the company's 15.2% dividend bump last May, the stock pays out a respectable 3.2% yield. For long-term investors, this potential decline isn't likely enough of a reason to sell the stock. But perhaps it will cause them to wait for a decline before buying more.I don't know if we get Pepsi down to $100 without a market-wide correction. That said, its valuation is stretched at a time when growth isn't exactly robust. As for the PEP stock price, take a look at the three-year weekly chart above. Support and resistance are quite clear, while uptrend support (in blue) makes its way higher.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio The Doritos maker is a good company, so I'd be interested on a pullback into support, (although we won't likely get it at $96 like we did last time). Because the Pepsi stock valuation is stretched, it makes me hesitant to buy -- even on a move over resistance, given this isn't the type of quick-moving momentum stock that investors typically trade. KO Stock or PEP Stock?So that brings up the question, should investors buy PEP stock or KO stock?To much surprise, KO stock might be the better buy, at least right now. Coca-Cola stock trades at almost 22 times this year's earnings, which is only slightly higher than Pepsi. However, analysts expect earnings to grow 1% this year on the back of 9.3% sales growth. In 2020, forecast call for a similar outlook to Pepsi, which is for 7.6% earnings growth and 4.4% sales growth.Coke has superior growth in 2019 and similar growth in 2020, while maintaining similar free cash flow profiles and superior margins to PEP. Also worth mentioning is KO stock's dividend yield, which stands at 3.5%.That said, KO stock doesn't have a screaming-low valuation and its earnings growth is somewhat disappointing given the more than 9% sales growth this year. The chart looks decent though.  Click to EnlargeSupport at $43.50 to $44 continues to hold, while KO stock is above the 200-day level and is now coiling just beneath $46. We got lucky with our sell call at $50 and now may be a time to add back to that position a bit.The conclusion? Neither KO stock or PEP stock jumps out as a massively better pick than the other. Over the next 12 months though, Coca-Cola stock seems to have the edge.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-21,"I'll be honest: I simply don't understand the bull case for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The KO stock price has held up reasonably well in recent years, admittedly. But Coca-Cola stock isn't cheap. There are obvious risks to demand going forward. Add on disappointing growth, and the numbers here don't seem to add up.Source: Coca-ColaI concede that I've long been a skeptic toward KO stock. I called it &quot;expensive&quot; 20 months ago at roughly the same price, and it's at least held up. On this site, Luke Lango made a &quot;buy the dip&quot; case last month; a few days later, Josh Enomoto highlighted the company's opportunity in China.With all due respect, I disagree. The issue from here is that many investors are valuing Coca-Cola for what it was: a wonderful business that produced steady growth and lockstep increases in its dividend. Coca-Cola stock famously has made billions of dollars for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). It's also been a great long-term investment for the rest of us.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter But times change. And those changes have notably shifted the investment case here. The KO Stock Price Tumbles After EarningsAt this point, it seems increasingly difficult to make the fundamental case for Coca-Cola stock. A multi-year transformation -- including a &quot;refranchising&quot; of its bottling operations -- has hit revenue in recent years, but it was supposed to create a leaner, more profitable company.That's a key reason why the KO stock price fell over 8% after disappointing earnings last month -- a huge move for a typically low-volatility stock. Guidance for 2019 was much weaker than expected. Coca-Cola expects earnings growth of -1% to 1% against 2018's $2.08.Investors were hoping for much more after the refranchising. The problem goes beyond results for a single year, however, as 2019 guidance implies EPS of $2.06 to $2.10. In 2013, Coca-Cola's non-GAAP EPS was $2.08. Over six years, including a massive transformation, earnings per share will barely move, if at all.But even that doesn't tell the full story.Coca-Cola stock, like so many other U.S.-based investments, has benefited from a lower tax rate. The underlying (i.e., adjusted) tax rate in 2013 was 23%. It's estimated to be 19.5% in 2019. That lower rate provides a 4.5% benefit to net earnings. Billions of dollars in share buybacks boost EPS as well. Considering this, Coca-Cola has 4.5% fewer shares outstanding than it did in 2013. In other words, KO is making less pre-tax profit than it did six years ago (the figure has declined about 8.7% by my math).And yet, Coca-Cola stock trades for 22x the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance. That multiple seems incompatible with the performance over the past few years. The Risks to KO StockTo be fair, a stronger dollar has been an issue, hitting revenues and profits overseas. Coca-Cola is projecting a significant currency headwind, with 6% to 7% impact on operating income in 2019 alone. This comes after a 4% hit in 2018. Essentially, much of the potential benefit of the refranchising has been swallowed by currency effects.That said, it's not as if the dollar is guaranteed to get weaker going forward. KO stock still looks reasonably expensive against even currency-neutral growth. Meanwhile, risks are rising.Soda consumption continues to decline in the U.S., dropping by 20%-plus over two decades according to one report. Coca-Cola has tried to diversify, acquiring Costa Coffee and sparkling water manufacturer Topo Chico last year. But a $5 billion coffee deal -- let alone a $220 million bottled water purchase -- doesn't move the needle much against a $200 billion market cap.The trend here is consistently negative, particularly in terms of diet soda. Sparkling waters from Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ) (even with some recent trouble), and private companies like Polar and Spindrift are taking share from diet soda. Neither Coke with its Dasani brand, nor Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) with its Aquafina, have been able to win much in that market. New BrandsMeanwhile, HSBC Securities highlighted an interesting stumbling block for Coca-Cola's plans for expansion. Coca-Cola has looked to new extensions, including flavored Diet Coke and an orange-vanilla offering for its full-calorie brand. But, as HSBC pointed out, those efforts are likely to upset the same bottlers who have taken over Coke's operations.Smaller products have high startup costs, as well as long payback periods. Coke's refranchising may slow it from following the brand expansion strategy that's currently popular among consumer companies. It's a bit analogous to the risk facing Coke customers McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR). Those companies have shifted costs to their franchisees too. However, those franchisees may rebel as their parents look to compete solely on price or otherwise push the limits of their profitability. Not Enough GrowthFrom here, zero growth isn't worth the risks facing the industry. As such, KO stock looks far too expensive. I asked last year if Coca-Cola might be the next giant to stumble after consumer heavyweights Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), and Altria (NYSE:MO) saw big declines.It hasn't happened yet, even with the post-Q4 selloff. But I wouldn't be shocked if it did. In fact, I'd be less surprised if KO stock fell sharply than if Coca-Cola somehow figured out how to grow in an industry destined for long-term declines.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

But then again, Aurora Cannabis stock has actually been making up for lost ground. Keep in mind that it still hasn't reached the highs achieved back in October.Source: Shutterstock Yes, when it comes to cannabis stocks, you need to have a very tough stomach as the volatility can be wrenching. Just look at the charts of other companies like Tilray (NASDAQL:TLRY), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) and Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). They are definitely all high-beta plays.So with Aurora Cannabis stock, what now? Can the good times continue? Or should investors be cautious? Well, as should be no surprise, the valuation is at nose-bleed levels. Consider that the price-to-sales ratio is well north of 50X and the market cap is over $9 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend But this is probably not much of a factor. There are a variety positives that should keep up the momentum, at least for the short-term. A Closer Look at Aurora CannabisFirst of all, ACB stock is getting a nice boost from the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada. The company has the advantage of massive scale in the market, which is expected to get bigger and bigger. The current run-rate is 120,000 kgs and this is expected to reach above 150,000 kgs by the end of the current quarter.Next, the medical business continues to show traction, with revenues of $21.6 million in the quarter. A key part of the strategy has been to move aggressively into international markets, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Mexico and the United Kingdom.ACB also has continued to invest heavily in its drug pipeline. For example, the company has 40 clinical trials and case studies that have been completed or are in progress as well as seven in pre-clinical trials.But there is another point of leverage - that is, cannabidiol (CBD). This includes a group of compounds in the sativa plant that do not produce a high but have actually demonstrated powerful therapeutic effects.The reason CBD is so important right now is the passage of the Farm Bill in 2018. It declared that this was no longer an illegal substance. In other words, this should mean the emergence of a large market, and fast. According to research from the Brightfield Group, the spending in the U.S. could hit $22 billion by 2022.As for ACB, it has been focusing on its CBD business. To this end, it has invested in hemp production in areas like the Radient facility in Edmonton, which is estimated to produce as much as 10,000 kgs per day. The company has also been bolstering its product line, especially in the wellness category. And ACB has been making smart acquisitions, such as purchasing Argopro (it's Europe's largest hemp producer). Bottom Line on Aurora Cannabis StockBut perhaps the most important development for Aurora Cannabis stock is the company's announcement that Nelson Peltz has come on board as a Strategic Advisor. He has a sterling resume as a private equity investor (he is the CEO and founding partner of Trian Fund Management), with a focus on consumer product companies like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ).He said in a press release:&quot;I believe Aurora has a solid execution track record, is strongly differentiated from its peers, has achieved integration throughout the value chain and is poised to go to the next level across a range of industry verticals. I also believe that Canadian licensed producers, and Aurora in particular, are well positioned to lead in the development of the international cannabis industry as regulations evolve, with a strong, globally replicable operating model.&quot;But Peltz will be instrumental in guiding the strategy of ACB and should be essential in finding major partners. We've already seen giants like Altria (NYSE:MO) and Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invest billions in the sector. And it seems like a good bet that Peltz will try to pull this off  with ACB.Again, the stock price is likely to continue to be volatile. But so far, the momentum looks solid as there are multiple drivers like the Canadian market, the healthcare business and CBD opportunity.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-03-28,"McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shows early signs of readying for another breakout. Trading close to its 52-week high of $190.88, the food retailer agreed to acquire an Israeli digital startup for around $300 million. This buy should further advance the company's already-solid implementation of simple store-level technology solutions. With MCD stock valued at 21 times forward earnings, investors may look for McDonald's to accelerate its revenue growth.Source: Shutterstock For a rumored $300 million, McDonald's is getting personalization and decision-logic technology developed by Dynamic Yield. That tech will enable the fast-food purveyor to more closely match its offerings to what its consumers want. Through an outdoor digital drive-through, customers get a more-immersive, personalized experience from McDonald's menu items. And by combining the trending food items of the day, time of day, current weather, and current restaurant traffic, the technology will help guide the customer through the decision-making process.Things have certainly come a long way from &quot;would you like fries with that?&quot;.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Hybrid Brick-and-MortarMcDonald's is leveraging its brick-and-mortar retail fronts with the latest technology. What better way to compete with online-only restaurants and other firms that use apps and online channels to take orders ahead of time?  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 McDonald's will also integrate this technology into its own mobile app, self-order kiosks, and other digital consumer experience touchpoints.Ahead of the acquisition news, Cowen had noted that the restaurant chain's renovations will drive continued revenue growth. With strong earnings and sales on the way, the brokerage views MCD stock as a solid defensive play that is also appealing to fixed-income investors. Though the dividend yield of 2.5% is not high, it's still better than that offered by Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Still, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) offer dividends north of 3%. Pepsi is especially attractive because its P/E is 13.8 times, compared to 24 times with MCD stock. Growth OpportunitiesMCD's 24x P/E is low when investors consider the company's growth prospects. Restaurant additions, along with the optimization through renovations and promotions, will ensure steady revenue growth. In 2017 and 2018, the stock traded in a range because McDonald's had only started driving higher traffic growth at its locations. This year, integrating the Dynamic Yield technology and offering UberEATS at most, if not all, of its locations, will fuel higher sales.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course The beauty of UberEATS is that it increases consumer awareness for the McDonald's brand. And once the customer makes that first order, getting repeat business is easier than winning initial business from those customers. MCD Stock ValuationTraffic into fast-food restaurants is on the decline, so McDonald's must differentiate itself from competitors. As more people work from home, the population ages, and habits for eating at fast-food chains change, McDonald's must continue to adapt. The technology changes will most certainly add meaningfully to the bottom line. Offering delivery and changing the customer experience for the better will also offset the macro headwinds McDonald's faces.Analyst sentiment engine Tipranks.com shows that of the 11 analysts covering the stock, eight have a buy rating and three others have a hold. The average price target is 6% above the recent share price of around $187. Using finbox.io to model a fair value for MCD stock with a 5Y DCF growth exit model, assume revenue falls for the next two fiscal years. In this scenario, macro headwinds are hurting all fast-food chains. If revenue recovers in year 5, then McDonald's stock is trading close to fair value. In this downside scenario, MCD has a fair value that is around 5% below the current share price.Buying MCD stock today is low risk. The company continues to put its customers at the forefront of growing the business. And few firms ever fail to grow when enhancing the customer experience to drive repeat sales higher. That is the case for McDonald's stock.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-29,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips During the first quarter of 2019 Coca Cola s NYSE KO stock price has lagged many other stocks Year to date despite the impressive market rally in the broader market Coca Cola stock is down 1 5,The Sweet Dividend Alone Makes KO Stock Worth Another Look
2019-03-29,"During the first quarter of 2019, Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) stock price has lagged many other stocks. Year-to-date, despite the impressive market rally in the broader market, Coca-Cola stock is down 1.5%.Source: Coca-ColaIn comparison, the return on S&P 500 with the dividends reinvested would be almost 13%. Although its stock has not rewarded shareholders so far this year, I believe that the Coca-Cola belongs to a well-diversified portfolio.Here is why:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Coca Cola and MillennialsCoca-Cola is the world's largest beverage company with 20 different brands that generate more than $31 billion dollars in annual revenues. Over the decades, many investors have regarded it as a reliable investment.For example, Coca-Cola stock tops the list of longtime favorite holdings of Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) owns 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola, worth over $18 billion. In the last quarter of 2018 when many stocks suffered sizable losses, KO was the only green stock among the top 10 holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business However, most of this decade, KO has seen declining revenues, partly because of the drop in soda sales as the U.S. consumer has moved towards healthier beverages including flavored water.Therefore, management has been transitioning the company to offer a beverage portfolio that seizes on the public's increased appetite for flavored drinks, including colas. For example, in 2016, the company announced its &quot;One Brand Strategy&quot; and introduced a common visual identity and creative campaign for all the brands.Later in 2017, it relaunched Coke Zero. This year, it introduced a U.S. wide ad campaign for its new flavor, Orange Vanilla Coke to coincide with March Madness. As a result of the changes in the product offerings, now cherry and vanilla flavored Cokes account for about 9% of the dollar volume but bring in 18% of the dollar growth.Earlier this year, the group completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee in the U.K. Wall Street believes that the purchase of the biggest coffee chain in the U.K. could lead to increased diversification away from soda drinks as well as revenues, especially prompted by growth in the Chinese market, where Costa Coffee currently has almost 500 stores.Offering hot beverages for the first time is yet another strategic step for the group as it addresses the shift in consumer taste and purchasing behavior.As you are deciding what may be next for KO stock fundamentally, you may also want to think about whether the global economy or the U.S. may be headed for a slowdown or even a recession.During periods of market volatility or economic downturn, consumer staples tend to be among the last products that consumers remove from their household budgets. In other words, defensive stocks like KO may help your portfolio when the going gets tough in the markets.On the flip side of the coin, despite the recent decline in the stock price, Coca-Cola shares still seem expensive when compared to the five year trading history. In mid-March, the stock also was downgraded from $64 to $50.  Therefore, some analysts urge investors to consider KO stock's peers, such as PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP).Nonetheless, over the past decade, the returns of both stocks would have been very similar; in fact KO investors would have been slightly better off than PEP shareholders. Reinvesting the KO Stock DividendIncome investors know that they can compound their returns through reinvesting dividends from high-yielding shares. Despite the question marks regarding future growth at Coca-Cola, its dividends make the shares rather attractive. In February, the company increased its dividend and declared a new share buyback program.The current dividend yield stands at 3.5% - another reason why I believe KO stock belongs to a capital-growth portfolio. The next dividend payment is scheduled for Apr. 1, 2019 to shareholders of record on Mar. 15. KO Stock in the Short TermFollowing the sell-off on Feb. 14, Coca-Cola stock has been range trading between $44.5 and $46.5. This band is likely to act as a strong support zone for the stock where it can form a base to make a new sustained leg up.Those investors who pay attention to moving averages and oscillators should note that the short-term technical message is giving &quot;neutral-to-buy&quot; readings.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find KO stock to be a compelling buy candidate and I'd regard any potential dip in the price as an opportunity to grab the shares for the long term. Within a year, I'd expect the shares to trade slightly over $50.If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider using a covered call strategy with approximately a three-month time horizon. In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of Coca-Cola at a limit price of $46.61 (the closing price on Mar. 27) and, at the same time, sell a KO June 21 2019 $47 call option, which currently trades at $1.15.The $47 option is slightly out-of-the-money, offering some downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in KO stock. This call option would stop trading on Jun. 21, 2019 and expire on Jun. 22. The Bottom Line on Coca-Cola StockAfter considering the pros and the cons for the stock, if you are also of the opinion that the management will be able to strengthen the story of Coca-Cola, the iconic beverage company, and its balance sheet and that the stock is ready for a rebound on either technical and fundamental grounds, you may want to add KO shares to your portfolio in the second quarter of 2019.In 3-4 years, patient value and dividend growth investors are likely to be rewarded handsomely.In case you do not want to own Coca-Cola stock by itself, but would rather invest on a sectoral basis, you may also consider an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds KO,  such as the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP) or the Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSEARCA:PBJ). Or you could even consider investing in Coca-Cola indirectly by owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Since then, NBEV stock gained more than 2,000%.Source: Shutterstock The handful of analysts that follow this money-loser think NBEV's thinly traded stock has got more room to run and have an average 52-week price target on the stock of $9.NBEV stock appears to be benefitting from the growing demand for products made from a Polynesian fruit called Noni, which its fans claim can treat all types of ailments, thanks to its recent $85 million cash and stock acquisition of Morinda Holdings. Morinda's is a multi-level marketer like Amway with a network of 3o0,000 &quot;independent product consultants,&quot; mostly in Asia.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CBD Has Got the Potential To Be HugeHowever, what has gotten investors -- especially retail ones -- especially excited is the benefits that NBEV may reap from the sales of beverages infused with a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis called cannabinoid oil (CBD).  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises The company has even announced plans for a line of CBD beverages named after the late Reggae legend Bob Marley. A couple of caveats need to be explained.First, publicly traded &quot;pot companies&quot; including NBEV are staying out of the U.S. market until the legal status regarding cannabis and related products is crystal clear. Indeed, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb killed the buzz of CBD fans when the Farm Bill was passed in December which legalized domestic hemp production. He noted that CBD to food products including beverages remains illegal. Though the FDA is developing regulations to address the issue, it's unclear how long the process will take.To be clear, the CBD beverage market may be huge. Market researcher Zenith Global, expects the U.S. market for Cannabis-infused beverages to hit $1.4 billion by 2024. Unfortunately for NBEV, some of the giants of the beverage business including Anheuser Busch-InBev (NYSE: BUD), PepsiCo. (NYSE: PEP) and Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) are also &quot;buzzed&quot; about the sector as well. NBEV's Recent Rocky HistoryNBEV also has experienced its share of setbacks and last year was especially difficult.&quot;2018 was an extremely challenging as we spent almost the entire year recovering from inventory shortfalls due to working capital constraints,&quot; Chief Executive Brent Willis said in the company's earnings press release, without specifying a cause. Those impacts completely distorted the underlying strength of the firm.&quot;According to Willis, NBEV didn't lose a single &quot;major&quot; customer and recovered from its financial issues and replenished its inventory during the last six weeks of the year. He explained further that the company now has the resources and personnel across 60 countries &quot;to capture the full potential of what we believe are unparalleled opportunities worldwide.&quot; Short Sellers FavoriteSkeptics, though, abound. The company also is a favorite of short-sellers who hold about 31% of the float. NBEV also is really volatile and will continue to be that way for the foreseeable future.My bottom line on NBEV stock is simple: It's a stock that most investors should avoid given its volatility and the fact that is a small fish competing against some of the biggest whales of the beverage industry.As of Dec. 31, 2018, NBEV's accumulated deficit was $22.6 million, making the road to profitability difficult at best.As of this writing, Jonathan Berr did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Who among us doesn't have a friend or two who have &quot;invested&quot; in pot stocks, or a cannabis venture of sorts, legally, of course?  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises Jumping in on any trade early when the concept is still a rising hot star is easy because all boats float. We all remember how popular Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) was in September as it hit $300 per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's all a dusty mess and it's hard to sift through it to uncover the potential gems. Now that some time has elapsed and the peaks in the stocks have eased, it has become easier to identify which companies will lead the way.It is almost never the case that the companies who started the movement get to thrive in the end. The cannabis industry, although it's as popular as bacon, is still unproven as a public business concept. So from an investment perspective it's a more of a bet than a fundamental thesis. Don't hate me for saying this, because this is not the same as me denying its potential. The Best Marijuana StocksWithin that context, CGC has the best odds of winning since it has the fattest balance sheet, thanks to the $4 billion cash infusion it received from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). So, CGC will have the best tools to bring to fruition whatever potential the cannabis industry has.The process of incoming investments from companies like STZ -- and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) into Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) -- is an important part of the thesis. This helps investors uncover potential winners. This way we get to leverage their due-diligence and research. In this case, I can rest assured that STZ did a lot of homework before they sank a big pile of cash into CGC.Investing in the pot stocks is insane from the traditional sense. They have massive valuations. Marijuana stocks' market capitalization is in the range of 300 to 1. This won't be a value-based investment. To justify buying Canopy Growth stock, we'd have to look way past this or look to next year's results. Bottom Line on Cannabis StocksThere will need to be a huge explosion in the marijuana legalization trend, big inroads in the drinkable products, and a bigger scope of adoption by the medical community. All of this to happen quickly is a tall order. But the consensus is that the pursuit is worth it since there will be a giant pot of gold … pun intended.For the short-term, CGC stock is technically trading in a tight range. Those usually end in a breakout from that zone but the direction is unknown. However, CGC has recently defended its February lows, and it did so above a recent cluster of support from the December drubbing.This favors the odds of a bounce to breach $49 per share. That would bring in momentum buyers to $55. But there will be resistance along the way, at levels such as $45 then $47.In summary, the marijuana stock trade at this stage is mostly a general concept. The bullish thesis on cannabis is very broad, so it's easy to embrace and difficult to short. This also contributes to levitate investor enthusiasms. Nevertheless, this is a viable long-term thesis and Canopy Growth stock would be my pick of the proverbial litter.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

We also have a Keurig coffee machine, and I'm enjoying a pod coffee as I write this … but that doesn't mean I'm going to buy KDP stock.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Since it was formed at the end of July, KDP stock has outperformed its larger rivals, Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). But its results still lackluster, and a downgrade from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), which sees the single-serve coffee fad fizzling, recently sent it down by 4%.Even at that price, it's no bargain. The company's dividend of 15 cents gives it a yield of 2.19%. In a slow-growth area like beverages, you buy stocks for dividends, not growth. Despite the caffeine jolt of the Keurig merger, this remains at heart a third-rate soda company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The BackgroundKDP was formed last year when JAB Holdings, which had taken Keurig Green Mountain private in 2015 for $13.9 billion, used it and cash to buy publicly traded Dr Pepper Snapple Group. DPS stock holders got a special dividend of $103.75 per share.  * 7 Marijuana Companies: Which Pot Stocks Should You Buy? The resulting company is the 4th largest U.S.-based beverage company, behind Pepsi, Coke and Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), the beer and wine outfit. It's the 10th largest beverage company in the world, less than half as large as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Nestle S.A. (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), the leaders in coffee.About one-fifth of the revenue comes from distributing other drinks, through a group called Allied Brands. After the merger, Allied lost one of its biggest sellers, Fiji Water, which decided to build its own distribution network, and bought Big Red, another Texas soda, for $200 million.It was the distribution network that attracted the German Riemann family to the company. It controls a host of coffee and restaurant brands through its JAB Holding and holds 87% of  Keurig Dr Pepper. Where's the Growth?The stock got out of the gates quickly and outperformed its larger rivals until it got hit with the double-whammy this year. First came its 2018 earnings report, delivered at the end of February, and then came the Morgan Stanley downgrade.The numbers weren't bad. They just weren't great. Earnings for the quarter were  $266 million, 19 cents per share, on revenue of $2.81 billion.  Wall Street turned thumbs-down on the numbers, the stock falling to as low as $25 per share.A report last month that it was working with Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) on an electric cocktail machine, which sounds like the Keurig Kold machine discontinued in 2016, lifted the shares until the Morgan Stanley analysis sent them back down. After the smoke has cleared, you have the third-leading sugary soda company which, while it has a solid distribution network, is still inferior as a stock to its leading rivals. Instead of paying 50 times earnings for a company with $7.4 billion in revenue, and a paltry dividend, investors might pay just 14 times earnings for Pepsi with its 3% yield or 31 times earnings for Coke and its yield of 3.44%. The Bottom Line on KDP StockKDP stock was always a bet on growth, and its growth prospects from here are not outstanding.If Keurig really has topped out, you've got a bunch of sugary sodas and a distribution network that trails rivals and likely always will. I enjoy a cup of coffee and a sugary drink as much as the next man, but as for buying the space, look elsewhere.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-16,"In the months after Ramon Laguarta stepped into longtime PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) CEO Indra Nooyi's shoes, the market has rallied behind him. In the past three months, Pepsico stock has risen over 12%, compared to high single digits for the major indices.Source: Shutterstock Not even the move toward healthier products and away from Pepsi's core products of soda, sweetened beverages and chips has hindered Pepsico stock's ascent toward 52-week highs. On top of this, the company has increased its dividend, which sits at 3%. If performance continues to exceed expectations, it's not unlikely that another increase is on the horizon.It may be unexpected for a large food and beverage conglomerate to be generating such high returns, but under both Nooyi and Laguarta, Pepsico remains committed to its shareholders. Its diversified portfolio of world-renowned brands -- including Frito-Lay, Tropicana, Gatorade and Quaker -- continue to provide an attractive steady growth story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pepsico Stock Has a Positive OutlookThere has been a lot of momentum coming off a strong a strong fourth-quarter and end to 2018. Laguarta intends to capitalize on PEP's organic growth trend and guided to 4% organic revenue growth in 2019. While EPS might take a slight hit due to investments in the business and an increase in its effective tax rate, 2019 should be viewed as a year of transition as Laguarta leaves his mark on Pepsico.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Frito-Lay in North America has been the biggest driver of growth and is Pepsico's largest sector by profit. It's a consistent revenue generator and has &quot;industry-leading margins and returns on invested capital.&quot;The market expects this business line to capture new demand, in especially in premium snacking. Brands like Simply, SunChips, Smartfood and Off the Eaten Path, will be in focus, so it is important that investors track the category's performance in the upcoming quarters to make sure that Pepsico is continuing to compete effectively across the entire snacking category. Pepsico Delivers on DividendsIn most of their key markets, PEP is the No. 1 or No. 2 overall food and beverage supplier. They have been very successful in marketing their products at a local level and adjusting marketing messages based on the market. Earnings should confirm that this dominance continues.They have rewarded shareholders with their success as well. On the dividend front, Pepsico stock has not disappointed. The company delivered compounded dividend growth of 9% over the last six years, returning $45 billion to shareholders.Over that same time period, organic revenue growth has averaged 3.8% and core operating margins have expanded by 1.6%. Laguarta expects to continue that growth by investing in its broad portfolio, and 2020 should be an even stronger year with high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth. Pepsico Stock ValuationThe one drawback on Pepsico stock is its valuation. Trading near 52-week highs and at a 14x P/E and 2.7x sales, Pepsico doesn't look cheap. However compared to The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), which trades at 30x P/E and 6.3x sales, Pepsico stock doesn't look expensive either.For a leader in the international food and beverage sector that has a history of raising dividends, this could be a steady return generator if the company continues to meet guidance targets on growth and earnings. Otherwise, I could see a single-digit pullback on disappointing earnings.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-18,"For most people today, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a brand and a significant piece of Americana. Many even consider it their prime choice among beverage-makers. However, what it isn't -- unfortunately -- is a viable investment. I'm sad to say this, but KO stock is incredibly frustrating.Source: Coca-Cola  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Historically, Coca-Cola stock just exists to pay out its fairly generous 3.4% dividend yield. Certainly, though, this is not the platform to get rich on. Over the past five years, KO shares have gained less than 15%. With a performance like that, this legacy firm isn't going to endear itself to the younger crowd.Even more maddening, KO stock performed admirably late last year. This was in the face of a broader market meltdown that gutted several relevant names. Finally, it appeared that management was making substantive progress toward its re-branding efforts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the numbers told a different tale. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 slumped badly against the year-ago level. KO stock is currently on the recovery path after Q4's devastating numbers. The question, of course, is whether you should trust this rally?If any investment suffers from this-time-it's-different syndrome, it's KO stock. However, risk-tolerant buyers may want to check out these three underappreciated tailwinds: KO Stock Can Rule a Still-Popular Soda MarketYou've heard it a million times: soda is a dying beverage category. Moreover, as younger people eschew sugary drinks for healthier alternatives, that leaves little room for KO stock and rivals like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Seemingly, the Q4 figures add weight to this bearish argument.If that wasn't bad enough, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi cater to an older demographic. According to a 2016 Adweek report, Coke was the favored beverage among those aged 35 to 44 years. And for Pepsi? Try the retirement community -- those aged 65 years and up.But on the flipside, several soda brands are making a comeback, including Slice soda and Jolt Cola. As I mentioned earlier this year, this product revival is too young to make an accurate assessment of its success. However, if demand didn't exist, investors wouldn't risk their money on such a speculative venture.Moreover, more recent data indicates that American consumers still love carbonated drinks. KO's management team is looking to advantage this trend with their premium Smartwater brand. This might turn out to be a great move for Coca-Cola stock. With Smartwater, the company can apply the desired carbonation with the equally-desired &quot;healthy&quot; tag. Millennials Are the Healthy Generation? Think Again!As we just discussed, a major impediment to Coca-Cola stock is the millennial generation. Several sources refer to this demographic as the healthier generation: they smoke less, they exercise more and they make better nutritional choices.But what if I told you that this was all BS? Well, it is. And don't take my word for it; instead, listen to the Pentagon.According to the Department of Defense, more than 70% of Americans aged 17 to 24 are ineligible for military service. Why? The two most-cited reasons are health and inadequate physical fitness. As a result of this dearth of qualified recruits, some military branches are lowering standards for enlistment!So what's causing this disconnect between perception and reality? I genuinely believe that millennials think they're making healthier choices; hence, their flawed answers to survey questions. But expanding waist sizes and pools of unqualified military recruits tell the real tale: millennials are actually the least healthy generation.That's a big plus for Coca-Cola stock because it's not the product that's the impediment, but the marketing. Change the marketing -- which the company is already doing -- and KO will eventually score the coveted millennial demo. Coca-Cola Isn't Just About SodaWhile KO stock has frustrated investors to no end, I hope that my contrarian arguments provide some food for thought. The soda market, as ugly as it might look now, isn't quite so terrible when you drill into the details.But despite the brand name, Coca-Cola stock isn't just about soda. The company offers the full spectrum of beverages, ranging from premium water to natural juices to the sugary concoctions.I've mentioned this before, but one segment to watch closely is Coca-Cola's acquisition of Costa Coffee. While analysts have criticized KO for paying a hefty premium for Costa, the buyout provides a viable channel into China. Taking a chunk of Chinese market share will do wonders for overall growth.On the surface, that's not easy considering giant rivals like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are already operating in the region. However, don't dismiss Coca-Cola so easily. Through its Japan-based Georgia Coffee brand, KO has substantial experience delivering successful results in the Asian market.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Let me emphasize that KO stock will likely require patience. However, the fundamental tools are in place for a surprising -- and sustainable -- recovery.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-22,"Every year, the market produces a few head-scratchers. So far in 2019, one of those candidates is beverage-maker Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP). Since the beginning of January, Pepsi stock has taken a commanding lead, gaining over 17%. But is such a move sustainable given its key industry?Source: Shutterstock Known throughout the world as a fierce rival to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), both companies specialize in sugary, carbonated beverages. Here's the problem: sugary, carbonated beverages don't resonate with millennials. Moreover, Pepsi attracts the plus-65 crowd, which doesn't provide much confidence for future growth prospects of Pepsi stock.At the same time, results speak louder than forecasts or perceptions. In this case, PEP answered critics with a strong beat for the first quarter of 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAgainst a consensus earnings-per-share target of 92 cents, PEP delivered an EPS of 97 cents. This also beat out the year-ago level earnings by one penny. On the revenue front, the beverage-maker rang up $12.88 billion, beating the $12.7 billion consensus estimate. As a result, Pepsi jumped nearly 4%.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees No doubt, this was a great showing, especially for a company whose industry has a credibility problem. But is this bullishness in Pepsi stock justified? Although the sector appears ugly, the finer details tell a different tale. Pepsi Enjoys a Viable MarketplaceOne of the most commonly-cited criticisms against a rising Pepsi stock price is the consumption behaviors of millennials. According to multiple sources, young Americans are making better dietary and health choices and avoiding harmful ones.And that's true to an extent. For instance, smoking trends in the U.S. have fallen off a cliff. Plus, we're seeing beverage-makers adjust to current trends, shifting toward healthier alternatives and shelving the sugary stuff.However, outward appearances are not what they seem. After all, if young Americans were truly making substantively healthy decisions, our armed forces wouldn't have problems recruiting them. Unfortunately, the Defense Department has been forced to lower their standards in part because millennials are out of shape.Dig a little deeper, and you'll realize that no, Americans really aren't making better choices; instead, they think they are. For instance, smoking is on the decline, but vaping is on the uptick. And while vaping is a genuinely cleaner alternative to smoking, it's not inherently a healthy practice.As it relates to Pepsi, a Rasmussen poll from earlier this decade indicated that slightly more than half of Americans admit to having a sweet tooth. More recent polls suggest that our national obsession with sweet or sugary concoctions haven't changed. Despite consumer trends toward healthy food products, candy sales continue to increase. We're still consuming chocolate at a pronounced rate relative to other nations.In other words, the current and emergent generations are health-conscious; however, they are not healthier. Marketing Opportunities and Pepsi stockWhat the earnings report for PEP demonstrated quite clearly is that it does not have a product problem. Look at what drove overall revenues for the company: Pepsi sodas. This is the very product category that retail reports suggested would sink Pepsi stock because no one drinks soda anymore.Really? Tell that to the folks who drove PEP stock convincingly higher.But it's not just that consumers are drinking more soda, or that the doom-and-gloom forecasts for this industry were premature. People consumed a substantial amount of Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar. What incentivized them to make that choice? Marketing.In all seriousness, Diet Pepsi and these zero-sugar beverages are probably the most damaging beverages you can legally obtain. I mean, what's making these drinks so sweet if there's no sugar? Most likely, it's some weird laboratory concoction with a name you can't pronounce.But from the perspective of Pepsico, do the health implications matter? Not at all. Again, we're not a healthy generation: we have the same dietary vices as those preceding us. We just like to be told we're healthy, even if the source has as much credibility as a used-car salesman.Therefore, PEP has a viable channel for continued growth, largely because they have an effective marketing team. Look, the company isn't just selling soda in a soda-unfriendly environment; it's also selling junk food like Lay's potato chips.Essentially, PEP is exporting ice to Eskimos, and the Eskimos can't get enough of it. The bull case for Pepsi stock is alive and well.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-23,"Last year was terrible for the equity markets, as most stocks bottomed on Christmas. But not Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- it made a new low just after its last earnings report in February. Luckily for the bulls, it has since mounted a 7% rally off those lows. And more importantly, it's rallying again today on another earnings report card.Source: Coca-ColaManagement delivered a strong quarter in spite of currency headwinds. KO is supposed to be a boring company, but it managed to report 6% organic growth. They even had a few success stories with new flavors.It wasn't long ago when experts had rang the death knell for soda, yet here is Coke proving them wrong. They even guided a bit higher going forward. So they didn't leave much reason to sell the stock on the headline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNevertheless, KO stock came into the earnings event this morning absolutely flat for the year. This morning's rally, if it holds, will be the base for the year. For the past 12 months, Coke stock is in line with the S&P 500, so maybe it plays catch up for this year to right the shorter-term metric.This morning's pop in the stock almost but not completely closes the open gap to $49.50. This is a small concern for the short term, but the zone just above it could be the doorway for more green.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt If the KO stock bulls can maintain the rally and close above $50 per share, they could spark a bullish pattern to target $52 or higher. But that won't be easy, as it would need the help of the broader equity markets. This is not a momentum stock so it's won't move as fast as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), for example. So big moves need bigger reasons. This report, while good, is not enough alone. KO stock needs market-wide follow through to reach new all-time highs too.So what now? Looking Ahead in KO StockFundamentally, KO stock is twice as expensive as Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP). Even in absolute terms, KO's 32 trailing price-to-earnings ratio is bloated. This is roughly twice as expensive as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and 30% more expensive than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).If I already own the shares, I am happy about the rally but it's not reason to add to my position. For those looking to start a new position in Coca-Cola stock, they need to determine their time frame. If it's a fundamental position to hold for years to come, then there is no sense in fishing for the perfect entry point. Over the long haul, KO will do well -- especially since it pays a 3.3% dividends to boot.But those who prefer to actively trade Coke stock shorter term have a few lines to know. The first is that this morning's zone is in theory resistance. Onus is on the bulls to breakout through so they would invite momentum buyers.Conversely, there is a long-shot bearish scenario that could unfold on the long-term chart. If for any reason KO falls below $44 per share, it could trigger a large bearish pattern that could target $39 per share. This is not a forecast, it is a possible scenario that bulls need to know.Coca-Cola is a consistent stock that will not cause great harm to portfolios. But that alone is not a reason to follow a spike on impulse. I'd rather wait a few days to see how the bulls are able to handle these prior-fail levels that have lingered since January of 2018.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-23,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in March 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Cannabidiol (CBD) is emerging as a red-hot category of the marijuana industry. CBD consists of compounds in the cannabis sativa plant that do not produce a high. In fact, over the years, CBDs have been shown to have powerful therapeutic effects.Now it looks like the U.S. market could open up in a big way for this type of cannabis and several CBD stocks are gaining traction. The reason: In December, Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which declared that CBD would no longer be treated as an illegal substance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo how big could this opportunity be?  Well, according to research from the Brightfield Group, the market in the U.S. could hit $22 billion by 2022.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend No doubt, this could move the needle for marijuana stocks -- and here's a look at seven that stand out:   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Cronos Group (CRON)Cronos Group (NYSE:CRON) operates a vertically integrated cannabis platform, with a presence across five continents. In terms of the CBD opportunity, the company recently struck a strategic partnership with Gingko Bioworks, which has raised $430 million. The company's founder, Tom Knight, is known as the &quot;father of synthetic biology&quot; and his innovations -- such as with software to print DNA -- should allow for the creation of cannabinoids at a massive scale. This is critical because it can be difficult to produce pure forms that are cost-effective and precise.CRON also has the advantage of substantial financial resources to commercialize its cannabinoids. Last December, Altria (NYSE:MO) invested $1.8 billion into the company for a 45% stake. The deal is certainly a validation of CRON but it will also allow for much broader distribution and improved product development.Of course, a company like MO does engage in substantial due diligence before making an investment. In the company's Q4 earnings call, CEO Howard Willard said: &quot;We believe the growth opportunities are significant and will extend across the globe as cannabis markets open. Selecting the right partner in this category was critical and we've done just that. Cronos strong management team has built unique capabilities to compete globally across the medicinal, recreational and nutraceutical categories.&quot;   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Aurora Cannabis (ACB)Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), a Canadian based cannabis producer, has been building up its CBD business. Part of this has been with its investments in industrial hemp production, such as with the Radient facility in Edmonton. It is expected to get as much as 10,000 kilos per day.Next, ACB has been focused on revving up its product offerings. On its Q2 earnings call, Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley said the company is poised &quot;to launch a broad line of CBD based wellness product in the near future.&quot;What's more, ACB has been aggressive with its dealmaking. For example, it has increased its equity position in Hempco and purchased Agropro, which is Europe's largest hemp producer.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Something else to keep in mind: Legendary billionaire investor Nelson Peltz has joined the company as an advisor. This is certainly a major vote of confidence. He not only has deep access to investment capital but a strong network of potential partners, especially in the consumer goods industry. Some of his investments include stakes in PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ).   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Charlotte's Web (CWBHF)The inspiration for the founding of Charlotte's Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF) was a CNN documentary -- in 2013 -- about Charlotte Figi, whose health was significantly improved because of a hemp extract.Fast forward to today: The company is the No. 1 brand for the hemp-derived CBD market in the U.S. It definitely helps that it has distribution across more than 3,000 retail locations.And yes, growth has been strong. In Q3, revenues jumped by 57% to $17.7 million and adjusted EBITDA came to $5.4 million, up 31%.To better capitalize on the CBD opportunity, CWBHF issued $71.5 million in stock. This will be for cultivation and production to meet surging demand. Here's what the company's CEO, Hess Moallem, had to say: &quot;In general, broader consumer awareness of the benefits of cannabinoids, namely cannabidiol (CBD), and whole plant hemp extract is driving increased uptake in both our retail channels and within our e-commerce platform.&quot;In other words, it seems like a pretty good bet that the growth will continue for some time.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE)Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) is a clinical-stage biotech company that develops cannabinoid therapies for a variety of rare diseases. They include:  * Fragile X Syndrome (FXS): This is a developmental disability that has been known to cause autism spectrum disorder. FXS impacts 71,000 people in the U.S. and there are no drug indications for it.  * Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEE): This is an epilepsy syndrome that involves severe cognitive impairment. About 45,000 children and adolescents have this in the U.S.  * Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): This includes autism and Asperger's syndrome. ASD affects less than 1 million pediatric and adolescent patients.     * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend ZYNE's main candidate is Zygel, which is a CBD formulation gel for transdermal delivery. As for the FXS treatment, there is expected to be a pivotal data release in the second half of this year. And if the trial is positive, then the company will file a New Drug Application (NDA) for Zygel in the first half of 2020.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Canopy Growth (CGC)Since 2016, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has been building its CBD business, with a focus on consumer packaged goods. The company has since created a vertically integrated platform for that includes a set of technologies that have pending patents. What's more, the hemp division is expected to yield 7,000 kilos of hemp-derived CBD on an annual basis. Granted, this cannot be used in the U.S. market. Yet CGC is likely to be a solid partner. For example, the company struck a deal with Martha Stewart's Sequential Brands Group, so as to develop CBD remedies for pets.It helps that CGC has substantial resources, which came from a mega $4 billion investment from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). STZ has a strong global footprint -- with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada -- as well as a set of well-known consumer brands, such as Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Pacifico. All in all, there is quite a bit of synergy for CGC.In the meantime, the company is growing at a staggering pace. In Q3, its revenues soared by 282% to $83 million.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization:GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH)The origins of GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH) go back to 1998. It was then that Dr. Geoffrey Guy and Dr. Brian Whittle co-founded the company to focus on developing therapies using cannabinoid formulations to target areas like epilepsy, glioma and schizophrenia.As of today, the lead product is a liquid formulation of a CBD, called Epidiolex, which received FDA approval in 2018 (the expectation is that there will be an approval in Europe in the second quarter). The drug targets the rare conditions of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome, which are variations of epilepsy. Furthermore, there are other indications for Epidiolex, such as Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Rett Syndrome.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend But of course, the company has other treatments.  Note that GWPH is looking to get approval in the U.S. for Sativex, which is an oromucosal spray for multiple sclerosis. It is currently available in 25 countries.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (HMLSF)If you do not want to buy individual CBD stocks, then you can consider an exchange-traded fund, such as the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (OTCMKTS:HMLSF). With this, you'll get exposure to companies like Canopy Growth, Aurora, GW Pharamceuticals, HEXO and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY).In all, there are 59 stocks in the portfolio and the net assets are about $890 million (in Canadian currency).Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-05-24,"It was a quiet trading session on Friday, with U.S. stocks rising modestly ahead of a three-day holiday weekend. Will we see more selling pressure next week or will positive trade talk give stocks a lift? When one tweet can move the market, it's impossible to say. So let's look at a few top stock trades out there. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Roku  Click to Enlarge The other day we opted to cover PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) over Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), but promised to look at the stock on Friday. Well, here we are and this beast has gotten even stronger. Shares are up more than 6% on the day and have risen above $95. The run has been nothing short of amazing.We've been pounding the table on Roku, calling it a buy in Q4 and Q1. Now it's almost up to $100 a share. Should you get long now?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNo. Shares are up more than 70% in about five weeks. It has almost quadrupled from its December lows (not that it deserved to be that low in the first place). But the point is still the same: you've missed the boat.I love ROKU over the long term, but to think that we won't see sub-$95 prices again is absurd. With the stock overbought in the short-term and coming into possible resistance, hedging and/or taking some profits doesn't seem like a bad idea at this point … at least until lower prices come around. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Splunk  Click to Enlarge Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is going splat, falling 7% on Friday after reporting earnings. The move forced a test of the 200-day moving average, which held as support.Aggressive bulls who feel compelled to go long SPLK stock can do so against Friday's low.I would love a lower open near the 200-day on Tuesday that quickly reclaims Friday's close and goes green. Preferably, SPLK would also reclaim the 50% retracement at $120.78 in the process.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer If it falls under Friday's low, SPLK can go even lower. On a rally, we need to see if it can climb back to Friday's highs near $130, and/or the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Autodesk  Click to Enlarge  Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is off by more than 5% on Friday after disappointing earnings results. Shares are bouncing off that $157.50 to $158 area, but are now meaningfully below the 50-day moving average for the first time since early January.Below $155.56 -- the 38.2% retracement -- aggressive bulls who are getting long on Friday's decline may want to consider stepping out. It would put ADSK below several key support levels and suggest that sellers have not yet exhausted themselves. In that case, look for a possible test of the 200-day.Reclaiming the 50-day would repair some of the damage, but beware that this level may act as resistance. That would give short-sellers an entry, with a retest of the $158 area in mind. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Novartis  Click to Enlarge Novartis (NYSE:NVS) stock is up almost 4% after getting approval for its $2 million-plus gene therapy treatment.The move has NVS hitting new highs in Friday's session. The stock has been largely limited by channel resistance and buoyed by channel support. As it hits channel resistance, we'll have to watch to see if NVS will break out to a new range, or be limited in upside as a result.As long as $84.50 to $85 holds as support, NVS looks good to buy on the dips.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-30,"Despite being one of the heralded FAANG stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock doesn't get valued like one. After the recent pullback in May, AAPL stock is trading at just 15 times its earnings.Source: Shutterstock Many consider Apple to be a consumer stock as opposed to a technology stock, but even with the company's pivot toward services, it's still operating in the tech world. Its main product in hardware is a smartphone (it also makes smartwatches) and its streaming and television service offerings primarily utilize digital technology.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War However, even if we call Apple a consumer company, it's difficult to understand why AAPL stock is trading on par with very traditional consumer cyclical stocks like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have been skeptical about Apple before, but valuation changes things. After the decline of AAPL stock price, investors can own shares of  a great company for a reasonable price. Investing Alongside the BestPurchasing great companies at fair prices has been an investing philosophy that has worked quite well for legendary investor Warren Buffett. He is Apple's second-largest shareholder through his company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A).In an interview in late February, Buffett said that, &quot;If it [AAPL stock] were cheaper, we'd be buying it. We aren't buying it here.&quot;Apple stock price is now getting close to the mid-$170 range, where AAPL stock was trading in February. It's worth keeping an eye on AAPL stock to see if the shares slide further. If they do, it could be a great buying opportunity for investors.Because of the valuation of Apple stock, AAPL stock does seem to be a value-type name.  But there is good reason to believe that, while AAPL won't match the growth stats of the Jobs era, there are a few catalysts that could rev up Apple's numbers in the coming quarters. Apple Shifts to ServicesAfter Apple's quarterly revenue declined 5% last quarter, Apple is determined to reverse that trend by focusing on its Services business.Apple's Services revenue has already hit all-time highs.  And in the wake of the release of new products like Apple News+ and Apple TV+, there are new levers for Apple to pull.That said, Apple isn't completely giving up its bread and butter. It's finding new ways to better monetize its existing products,  helping to lift its top line. Juicier growth numbers may be coming from the Services business, but there is still money to be made in hardware.For example, after four years, Apple finally redesigned and repriced the iPod Touch. iPod Touch prices start at $199 (compared to $329 for the basic iPad). It's a great starter product that gets consumers hooked on AAPL's  new services. That may not get investors excited, but it demonstrates the positive incremental changes the company is making. A lot of little revenue boosters like that could end up making a big impact on Apple's profits. The Bottom Line on AAPL StockTim Cook's legacy is on the line. This is the year that Apple stock price either stalls or breaks higher. In the next couple of quarters, investors will see just how much the new services are contributing and how much traction they are gaining with customers. Apple TV+ , which rolls out in the fall,  could help reinvigorate AAPL stock.The fact is that Apple still has an incredible brand, and there is reason to believe that some of the worst is behind the company. Mispricing missteps have been corrected and AAPL is adopting new measure that should boost its growth. China could still be a stumbling point for AAPL, but at its current valuations, Apple stock probably prices in fallout from the Trade War.Trading at 15 times earnings with a number of new products in the pipeline, AAPL stock looks attractive.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-07,"If you're a contrarian in the cannabis space, you're likely very intrigued with New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV). Not only is the underlying plant one of the hottest commodities in the market, cannabis is going mainstream. A particularly attractive subsegment is cannabidiol or CBD-infused drinks. With New Age Beverages specializing in this sector, NBEV stock immediately catches the eye.Others have embraced the idea of CBD beverages. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Hexo (NYSEAMERICAN:HEXO) have secured deals with big-time beverage makers. But as InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley noted, NBEV was the first to hit the market. Almost always, that's better than being the first to have the idea. And with the competition lollygagging, NBEV launched the Marley brand last fall.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSubsequently, NBEV stock soared from $1.53 to just under $10. That paradigm shift occurred over a matter of days.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far But Brumley is cautious on the longer-term outlook for New Age Beverages stock, and for good reason. Management recently forked over some funds and possibly resources to acquire healthy-products maker Brands Within Reach. Supposedly, it's an &quot;incredible deal.&quot; But to Brumley's point, we just don't know the specifics.That immediately raises suspicion. More critically, though, CBD-infused drinks are currently a tough sell. Although the concept is appealing, the retail market itself is filled to the brim with competitors. Plus, the market size is very modest.Investing heavily into this segment will seemingly yield very little reward. As such, investors took their profits and dumped NBEV stock after the announcement, with shares down 15% in the days since the June 3 announcement. To compare, the cannabis-focused ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEArca:MJ) is little changed while the beverage-heavy First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEArca:FXG) is up almost 5% in the last few days. NBEV Stock is Fundamentally Stretched WideIn my view, New Age Beverages stock is an awkward play. Despite some obvious challenges, I believe in CBD-infused drinks for the long term.For one thing, the cat's out of the bag politically. In an unusually vitriolic time, both Republicans and Democrats have found surprising consensus in marijuana-related issues. While the federal government still classifies weed as a Schedule I drug, economic tensions also help the green sector in eventually overturning this classification.After all, President Trump can't keep playing hardball with China and Mexico without incurring domestic pain. And that translates into angry voters come 2020.Second, CBD specifically levers compelling evidence for medicinal effectiveness. Sure, medical doctors downplay this evidence because prescribing plants isn't exactly super-profitable. But they can't deny that many patients reported benefits with consuming CBD.Therefore, I'm willing to extend patience to names like Canopy Growth or Hexo. But NBEV stock? That's a tough one. If NBEV simply concentrated on cannabis-related products, I believe the investor community would give them considerable leeway. Cannabis is an unprecedented market, so it makes sense that it receives unprecedented flexibility.But NBEV stock isn't just a CBD competitor. Its acquisition of Brands Within Reach, which includes brands like Nestea and Evian, provides the proof. Instead, New Age Beverages seeks to dominate the broader healthy beverages market.In other words, NBEV has very normal ambitions. Because of that, investors will have normal expectations.One of those expectations is margins: prospective stakeholders will seek outsized profitability metrics. If you look at established beverage-makers like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP), or Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), they all feature strong margins.As a rule of thumb, beverage-makers should have on average higher margins than food companies. However, NBEV lags significantly in this department. No Outstanding Catalyst for NBEVAnother headwind I anticipate is that no outstanding catalyst bolsters the case for NBEV stock. I'm more convinced about this now after having looked at their website.Like any beverage company, NBEV has their core brands displayed front and center. The problem is, I'm not inspired by any of it. Nor have I heard of any of the brands they carry (outside their recent acquisition).  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Of course, my anecdotal observation isn't the end all, be all of anything. But I do a considerable amount of grocery shopping. Plus, I'm in the market for healthy beverages. If I can't recognize at least one of these brands, you gotta figure New Age Beverages stock has an uphill battle to climb.And this segues into my final point: I think NBEV stock has a credibility problem. They're competing in a very broad and saturated market. I'm not sure if they have the resources to withstand choppy waters that are surely coming.Although I like the CBD angle that New Age carries, I think there's too many questions. It might work out as a trade, but I'll be watching from the sidelines.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc has appointed Laxman Narasimhan as its new chief executive officer, succeeding Rakesh Kapoor. An outsider should herald a fresh start for a group that was once a superstar, but has more recently become a laggard.Reckitt has eschewed some of the obvious candidates for the role, such as Tesco Plc’s Dave Lewis or Unilever’s Nitin Paranjpe. It has instead chosen Narasimhan, who joins from PepsiCo Inc., where he was global chief commercial officer.He’s an unknown quantity outside of the U.S. He had a career spanning almost 20 years at McKinsey, before moving to Pepsi. While he was well-regarded there, its change of CEO might have left him as one of the senior executives who missed out on the top job and was therefore looking for opportunities outside of the soft drinks maker.And Reckitt has some particular challenges. It has endured a tumultuous few years, following the $16.6 billion acquisition of Mead Johnson in 2017.Narasimhan should at least bring a burst energy to the group. Kapoor was increasingly worn down by Reckitt’s problems.The first task of the incoming leader is to revive sales expansion, which has stalled. He must also complete the integration of Mead Johnson. It did seem as if it was improving, but hit another bump in the road last year, in the form of disruption to a plant in the Netherlands. Not having been involved in the purchase, Narasimhan can take an impartial view on the best way to tackle what increasingly looks like the wrong deal to have done.Narasimhan must both fit in with Reckitt’s culture, and evolve it. It has a particular hard-driving approach, where cost-cutting to bolster margins is at the forefront. That has gone out of fashion with investors, who want a better balance between top line and bottom line growth. The new CEO will have more scope to warn that margins must come down to facilitate the investment needed to turbocharge sales.Kapoor reorganized Reckitt into two divisions: one focused on household products, such as Cillit Bang cleaner, and the other on consumer health treatments including Nurofen painkillers. As well as being CEO, Narasimhan will directly lead the health arm.But the outgoing CEO hadn't yet taken that to its logical conclusion: separating the two units, possibly through a sale of hygiene and home. While Kapoor had earmarked this as a job for mid-2020, it will fall to his successor to complete the task.A split is not a given: new leaders don’t usually like to take an ax to their empires. There is also a question mark over whether Narasimhan can break up the group, even if he wanted to.As my colleague Chris Hughes has argued, this reinvention could be hampered by the aftershocks from the Justice Department’s indictment of Indivior Plc, the pharma business Reckitt spun off back in 2014. The drugmaker faces a $3 billion fine after U.S. prosecutors alleged it lied about the dangers of its opioid addiction treatment.That Narisimhan didn’t have any hand in the Indivior spin off means he has no baggage associated with the original deal, which would impede finding a solution. Having been based in the U.S., he should also have experience of dealing with regulators there.Indeed, this underlines the benefit of appointing an outsider – to both the company and the broader European consumer goods sector – he has much more latitude to take the difficult decisions that Reckitt needs to regain its stellar status.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jennifer Ryan at jryan13@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-06-17,"In a frothy market you can get a mighty high multiple if you're in the right niche. Like marijuana. That's the story of New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV). NBEV stock tripled last September after announcing a drink containing CBD.  Its drinks even have a picture of the late Bob Marley on them.But pot isn't NBEV's real business. Canned beverages are its business. Things like coffee, tea and kombucha. Sodas with strange combinations like watermelon and coconut, the kind of stuff you'll try at a soda ranch on Route 66.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince that September explosion, where it briefly traded at almost $9, NBEV stock has lost its fizz, settling into a trading range of between $4-6 per share. But its market cap, $350 million, remains impressive for a drinks company with March quarter sales of $58 million, and no profit.But still. Pot! What NBEV Is Up ToNew Age Beverages has used its moment in the pot limelight to bulk up the product line. The highlight was this month's purchase of Brands Within Reach, for $6.4 million, only $500,000 of it cash.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Brands Within Reach has brand licensing and distribution rights for some mainstream beverages, like cold Nestea and Illy coffee. The idea is that this gets New Age in the door at mainstream retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), which then might look at its more esoteric brands.This came just six months after buying Morinda Holdings, another small company but with distribution in 60 countries.  The idea there was to expand the market for its CBD products.The Morinda combination is already in the numbers due to be reported August 8, where sales of $70.8 million are expected. Following on the first quarter take of $58 million, that's good growth and, if the pattern persists through the year, it could lead to sales equaling the stock's current market cap by this time next year.That's important, because New Beverage CEO Brent Willis knows he's in the drinks business, not the pot business. He promised to focus on execution after buying Morinda, but the chance to buy into serious beverages with just stock was too good to pass up. What Next for NBEV Stock?Some analysts got very bullish on New Age after the Morinda buy, predicting imminent profits and a steady rise to $9 per share, which would be double its current level.InvestorPlace's Josh Enomoto disagrees. He sees the Brands Within Reach acquisition as a turn away from CBD, the source of its frothy valuation. He also sees the current brands as nothing special.Personally, I like the Brands Within Reach deal. NBEV now has both brands that can get it into the door of big retailers and global distribution for its CBD products. But drinks remain a risky business, a land of giants in which NBEV is a mouse. If Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsico (NYSE:PEP) or even Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) decided there was something to this CBD thing, they could blow NBEV out of the water quickly. The Bottom Line on NBEV StockI think the owners of Brands Within Reach know all this, so there's an overhang of almost $6 million in stock, itching to be sold right now.Much of the rest of the common stock is held by speculators looking for a quick payout. Institutions hold just over 13% of the common, against almost 26% held by insiders.  I think they will bail, too, at the first sign of bad news.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today In other words, NBEV stock has a sell-by date, and execution alone won't stave it off.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

ACB stock has been languishing.Source: Shutterstock During the past couple weeks, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) has logged a return of 32% while Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) is up about 17% and Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has gained 11%.Unfortunately, ACB stock has been in an extended downtrend, going from $10 in March to $7.48.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor the year so far Aurora Cannabis stock is still up an impressive 43%. When it comes to cannabis stocks, there is usually quite a bit of volatility and this is not likely to change any time soon. * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal The Pros And Cons of ACB StockThe bearishness with ACB has been the result of various factors. Although, perhaps the most important is the string of disappointing earnings reports. Note that the Canadian market has proven more difficult with the transitional to legalized marijuana. There have been challenges with the supply chain and retail expansion. What's more, black market sources have remained a persistent issue.But hey, such growing pains should be no surprise. If anything, the recent weakness does make ACB stock look relatively attractive. Consider that the consensus price target is $14.27, which implies 91% upside from current levels.So what are some of the catalysts to get ACB stock back on track? Well, first of all, the company is a top producer in the Canadian market. During the latest quarter, the production nearly doubled to 15,000 kilograms. But with the acquisition of MedReleaf and a myriad of other investments, the potential annual capacity is a hefty 570,000 kilograms.The early experience in the Canadian market is crucial. Aurora is building a solid infrastructure, which will allow for economies of scale. This make it so the company can better compete as cannabis becomes more commoditized in the Canadian market. In fact, Aurora is already becoming a streamlined low-cost provider.But another key - especially for the long haul - is the medical business. The pipeline includes 40 in-process and completed clinical trials and case studies. There has also been continued growth in the patient base, which grew by 5% in 77,136 in the latest quarter. Other Opportunities for ACB StockAnother important development is a recent partnership with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), which is the world's largest martial arts organization. The agreement calls for an exclusive multi-year focus on clinical research using Cannabidiol (CBD), which is the compound in the cannabis sativa plant that does not produce a high. In other words, there is much potential for breakthroughs with new treatments.With the passage of the Farm bill, the CBD opportunity in the US looks promising and should be a strong catalyst for growth. During the latest earnings call, Aurora chief corporate officerCam Battley had the following to say:&quot;We are well positioned to pursue multiple angles through our deep research and product development capabilities, our regulatory expertise as well as our extensive global hemp infrastructure which we intend to expand through acquiring the shares in HempCo, not already owned by Aurora. CBD for both medical and wellness applications has incredible potential and we intend to fully leverage our capabilities, our infrastructure and our partnership potential to maximize shareholder value creation.&quot; Bottom Line on ACB StockIn mid-May, Aurora brought on board as a strategic advisor Nelson Peltz, who is the CEO of Trian Fund Management. He has decades of experience with consumer markets, with investments in companies like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ).Peltz's involvement is a strong validator. He should also be essential in finding strategic partners.Of course, even with the advantages, ACB stock still has lots of risks. But for investors looking for an interesting cannabis play, this one definitely is worth considering.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-05,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Investors have one week left to prepare. After next week, the earnings calendar heats up.Earnings season arrives at an interesting time for the market. One concern over the last 6-8 weeks was whether the U.S. stock market could manage without a steady stream of earnings reports. After all, corporate earnings continue to be strong; a heavy earnings calendar thus contained quite a bit of good news.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut with myriad external risks -- a flare-up with Iran, an ongoing trade war, negative interest rates in Europe -- it seemed possible, and maybe likely, that U.S. equities would struggle without steady reminders of domestic strength.That hasn't happened. Instead, U.S. indices are at or near all-time highs after the best first half in over two decades.Can the gains hold? Is there more upside ahead? Even with a light calendar next week, earnings reports will provide a clue. A consumer giant will highlight strength in that sector and perhaps give a check on what investors are willing to pay for quality. Results from a key industrial supplier will be a snapshot of demand on the business side of the economy. And a major airline should provide a little of both. The fireworks won't start next week -- but investors should pay close attention to the preamble. PepsiCo (PEP)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, July 9, before market openThere are two interesting aspects to the earnings report from PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) on Tuesday morning. First, will Pepsi earnings highlight more concerns in an already-struggling consumer packaged goods (CPG) space?Competition from smaller companies and private labels have hit a number of well-known brands, with shares of stalwarts like Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) seeing big declines in recent years.PepsiCo has avoided those stumbles despite pressures on its soda business. But if Pepsi -- and its Frito-Lay business -- post weak results, investors may rightly wonder if the industry is getting simply too tough for even its premier operators.Those investors should watch the reaction to the report as well. Investors right now are paying 22x forward earnings for PepsiCo stock. That's a huge multiple for a company expected to generate revenue growth of 4% and earnings that will rise just 7%. If investors finally put a ceiling on that multiple, it might be a sign that defensive stocks on the whole finally are ready to stall out. Fastenal (FAST)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 11, before market openFastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) provides a barometer for a different part of the U.S. economy. The industrial distributor sells primarily to commercial clients. As such, Fastenal and larger rival W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW), who reports later this month, can provide a check on confidence and spending among U.S. businesses.Many of those businesses are in cyclical industries, most notably construction. And after a stretch where it looked like many of those businesses were preparing for an imminent recession, Fastenal results on Thursday morning look particularly important.A big quarter from Fastenal means that company checkbooks are open. It might signal a wave of optimistic outlooks as the earnings calendar ramps up. Meanwhile, valuations of many housing and construction stocks have returned to 2018 highs. They will need that kind of optimism to keep the rally going. Delta Air Lines (DAL)Source: via DeltaEarnings Report Date: Thursday, July 11, before market openDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will be the first major U.S. airline to report second quarter earnings. And so the entire industry will be watching its results on Thursday morning.Here, too, both the results and the reaction bear watching. Delta's results will highlight demand trends across the industry -- from both consumer and commercial customers. Airlines are notoriously cyclical; any weakness in Delta earnings could raise questions about overall demand in the economy.That's particularly true here since Delta doesn't fly the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which likely has provided a short-term boost to its earnings. If Delta misses, it doesn't have the same built-in excuse as several of its competitors.But there's a valuation question here, too, even if DAL looks 'cheap' at 8x forward earnings. Cyclical stocks like airlines generally look very cheap at the end of the cycle. And investors in cyclical sectors well beyond airlines have been noticeably reticent to jump in. (They've instead seemed to prefer more defensive names like PEP.)As such, the combination of an earnings beat and a big move in Delta stock could be a very good sign for the market. It would show a strong underlying economy -- and an investor base more willing to believe that strength will continue for some time to come.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.The post 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week appeared first on InvestorPlace.",3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week

2019-07-08,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders clearly expect to hear more good news when the beverage and snack giant reports its fiscal second-quarter numbers on Tuesday morning. Pepsi stock is up 9% since its most recent quarterly report. It has also rallied nearly 18% since the Q4 2018 Pepsico earnings. By consumer-staples standards, that's a monumental run up.Source: Shutterstock It's also not a terrible bet. Although the big move does present some valuation-based challenges for Pepsi stock, it's been years since Pepsico earnings have missed. Indeed, it's only failed to beat quarterly bottom-line estimates once in the past three years alone.Still, the sheer scope of the multi-month gain sets the stage for potential profit-taking. Should the Pepsico earnings report present anything less than ideal, a beat may prove irrelevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pepsico Earnings PreviewFor the most recent look, analysts collectively expect the company to report earnings of $1.50 per share of Pepsi stock. Additionally, forecasts call for sales of $16.42 billion. That bottom line would be up versus the operating profit of $1.49 per share that Pepsico booked in the comparable quarter from a year earlier. Furthermore, revenue at that level would mark a 2.1% improvement on the year-ago top line of $16.1 billion.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Adverse currency-exchange rates have been and continue to weigh results down. However, please note that rivals like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) have lamented the same headwind. During the first fiscal quarter of 2019, disadvantageous foreign exchange rates reduced Pepsico's per-share profit by 2%. 3 Things to WatchWhile a multi-faceted company, investors will only be able to respond to the most noteworthy changes in the company's business. Three items presently matter more than any other. As such, they need to be weighed carefully during and following the Q2 Pepsico earnings report.1.Organic SalesOrganic revenue is a figure that strips away the misleading impact of changes in currency-exchange rates. It also removes changes associated with business acquisitions or divestments. In other words, it is a more accurate picture of a corporation's true health and Pepsico stock specifically.For Q1, Pepsico saw organic sales growth of 5.2%. Assuming the company maintains this stride, it's a repeatable target.2.Full-Year GuidanceWith its Q1 Pepsico earnings report, PEP modeled full-year organic revenue growth of 4%. And though it also cautioned per-share profits could decline by 1% in 2019, that would be entirely due to investment being made in its growth. Perhaps more importantly, Pepsico guided for $9 billion in operating cash flow and $5 billion in free cash flow. Management is planning on giving $8 billion of that back in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.Changes to that initial outlook have the potential to move Pepsi stock, for better or worse.3.Revenue Mix Vs. Profit MixNorth America's beverage arm is the company's biggest by revenue, producing 32.2% of Q2 2018's top line. It's not Pepsico's breadwinner in terms of income though. That honor belongs to North America's Frito-Lay snack-food unit. This arm accounted for 23.8% of the year-ago revenue but contributed 39.6% of the company's total operating earnings.While it's unlikely to change much, you should look out for any variances of each unit's sales and earnings contributions. Even small fluctuations could signal trouble and potential disruption of Pepsi's low-margin business. Looking Ahead for Pepsi StockRegardless, investors mostly have to embrace that judging Pepsico stock right now isn't a simple exercise.Just a few days ago, analysts with Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted that FY2019 is an &quot;investment year.&quot; Specifically, management hopes to bolster growth through capability enhancement, manufacturing, and go-to market capacity additions. Further, advertising and marketing investments should increase consumer awareness.It's a work in progress and will be difficult to ferret out any specific impacts just yet. However, the market may respond to a qualitative feel on how this spending is setting up future growth.On the other hand, that qualitative feel for Pepsico stock may not matter at all right now.While it would be unlikely Pepsico fails to continue moving fiscally forward, that might not be enough for Pepsi stock.  Click to EnlargeOne has to zoom out to a multi-year chart of Pepsi stock to fully appreciate it. However, the rebound since May of last year has been more than dramatic. In fact, the 37% jump over this timeframe is unprecedented.It's also carried Pepsico stock back to a familiar resistance line that tags all the major price peaks going back to 2011.Now valued at a trailing price-earnings ratio near 23 and a forward-looking of 24, we've got to get real: there's little plausible room for more upside even if the beverage and snack company does everything it's expected to do. Prior to 2015, a trailing PE anywhere but the mid-teens was unusual. Therefore, you should approach Pepsico stock with caution.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc., trying to navigate a generational decline in cola consumption, has found one surprise niche: Mountain Dew for gamers.The beverage giant’s caffeine-boosted “game fuel” drink, aimed at video-game enthusiasts competing in tournaments, is selling so well that it can’t keep its re-sealable cap in stock.“Everything they make, we buy, and we’re selling every bit of product we make,” Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said of the drink’s specialty cap made by a European supplier.As it deals with the decline in overall soda consumption, PepsiCo is also getting a boost from its water business -- including its “pH balanced“ Lifewtr and its LaCroix competitor Bubly. Those brands helped the company mitigate a slide in sales of Gatorade, which has also struggled as consumers turn away from sugar.The company reported quarterly sales and earnings that beat estimates on Tuesday. Sales in PepsiCo’s key North American beverage unit were up, despite sluggish volume, as the company got a boost from higher prices for drinks. The shares were little changed in New York.The company generates significant revenue from food, and Frito-Lay, its salty-snack unit, also posted sales growth, including a double-digit bump at convenience stores in the U.S., according to Johnston.The strong “game fuel” sales come as PepsiCo tries to revitalize the Mountain Dew brand by pushing it to customers who want energy drinks. Energy has been a strong sub-segment of the beverage industry, with rival Coca-Cola Co. launching Coke Energy earlier this year, which adds to the stake it owns in Monster, a top-selling brand along with Red Bull.PepsiCo distributes the energy drink Rockstar, but has had a limited presence in that corner of the market, according to Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta said during a conference call Tuesday that PepsiCo will use its Mountain Dew brand to go after the energy drink market. Game Fuel sells at a premium to regular Mountain Dew, according to prices available on Amazon.com.“We’re trying to move Dew into the energy category in small steps,” he said.(Updates with details from CFO interview throughout.)&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Giammona in New York at cgiammona@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa WolfsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",PepsiCo Finds Elusive Soda Success With Mountain Dew for Gamers

But Square (NYSE:SQ) ultimately won the day's top-performer honors. Shares of the fintech name rallied more than 6% after Raymond James analyst John Davis upgraded SQ on optimistic expectations about the company's soon-to-launch business debit card.Holding the market back more than any other name was telecom outfit Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which was down a couple of percentage points following a downgrade from Citi.

Here's why. Lennar (LEN)In late June, Lennar was put under the trading microscope. A sharp single-day setback dragged the homebuilding stock under several key moving average lines, and there was no intraday rebound effort. The selloff was so significant, nobody was willing to buy the dip.The next day, Lennar shares only had to kiss their 200-day moving average line to start a feeble recovery effort. But, it was a recovery effort nonetheless. What happened in the meantime is even more concerning than what happened then.  Click to Enlarge  * The weakness from late June has since been renewed, with Tuesday's close of $47.37 being the lowest in weeks.  * Tuesday's slide from a reasonably healthy open was also on above-average volume suggesting more would-be sellers are waiting in the wings.  * While the late-June low near $47, plotted with a yellow dashed line on the daily chart, the 200-day moving average remains the make-or-break line in the sand. EQT Corporation (EQT)As of the latter half of May, EQT looked like it was in real trouble. A brief encounter with the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts, put the stock into a pretty steep dive.The selloff was halted at what turned out to be a pretty predictable support area though, and the rebound effort started to take shape. It has been choppy, but thanks to Tuesday's gain, the first of a key ceiling has been wiped out of the way. And the nature of the effort is even more compelling than the effort seems to be with just a cursory look.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019   Click to Enlarge  * The big crossover worth noting from yesterday is the move above the blue 20-day moving average line.  * Tuesday's gain was also an outside day, where the open was below Monday's low, and the close was above Monday's high. These drastic intraday swings suggest a major change of heart.  * Although progress has been modest since the latter part of June, the 'up' days have been on decidedly stronger volume than the 'down' days.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart, all the recent action is put in perspective. EQT is pushing up and off the lower edge of a descending wedge patterns, and any advance could be capped at the upper boundary near $23. PepsiCo (PEP)Finally, PepsiCo shares have been playing with fire for weeks now. Although the 24% gain from January's low was a nice run, it also left PEP shares overbought and ripe for profit-taking.The stock hasn't slipped over the edge of that cliff yet. With yesterday's stumble though, it has become dangerously close to doing so. One more bad day could do the trick, and the backdrop has already turned uncomfortably bearish.  Click to Enlarge  * It was already struggling to do so, but as of Tuesday, PepsiCo shares are decidedly below the blue 20-day moving average line.  * The undertow is made even more bearish in that the volume behind the &quot;down&quot; days since late June has not only been above average, but growing. The Chaikin line's decline on the weekly chart says the same thing.  * On the weekly chart, the looming bearish MACD crossunder and the impending Chaikin line cross below the zero level leave PEP just days away from two major sell signals.  * The final line in the sand is right around $130.75, where PepsiCo has made lows a couple of times since late last month, and where the purple 50-day moving average line will soon be.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-11,"Consult the Analysts and BloggersPepsiCo (PEP) released an upbeat earnings report on Tuesday (July 9) topping the Street consensus. Its quarterly organic revenue growth reached 4.5% (4.8% year-to-date) – slightly higher than the 4.4% analyst forecast. Its quarterly revenues were reported to be $16.45 billion exceeding the $16.43 billion target. Core Q2 EPS stand at $1.54, above the $1.50 expected by analysts. These positive figures were highly acclaimed by Wall Street analysts. Dara Mohsenian, from Morgan Stanley, reiterated his buy rating on the company stressing the fact that earnings data exceeded analysts’ consensus. He writes: “We expect a muted positive stock reaction at Pepsi, with solid organic sales in Q2 at the higher end of expectations, a solid gross margin beat, an EPS beat even with reinvestment (A&M +12% yoy), and increased FY EPS visibility.”Bryan Spillane from Merrill Lynch has followed suit and maintained his buy rating for PEP setting a price target of $135 with 2.47% upside (the stock’s price as of July 11 is $131.74). It should be noted that Pepsi has already recorded a one-year high of $135.24.Spillane points to a solid 2nd quarter marked by better-than-expected organic sales growth, particularly in Frito Lay NA and North America beverages. It seems that Pepsi is on track to a faster growth rate like some of the better performing food and beverage companies. This gives room for optimism in the coming quarters.  Good Signs for the FutureThe analyst price target on PEP currently (July 14) stands at $133.75 indicating a 0.35% upside. Analyst consensus on the stock is moderate buy. Analyst Ratings & Price Targets on PepsiCoInvestor sentiment is positive as well. Out of 58,404 individual investor portfolios on TipRanks, in the last 7 days (as of July 14), the number of portfolios holding PEP went higher by 0.1%  Investor Sentiment on PepsiCoBlogger opinions (July 14) and predictions are clearly on the bullish side as well. On June 28, almost two weeks before the release of Pepsi’s positive earnings data, Sydnee Gatewood gave Pepsi a financial strength rating of 6 out of 10 and profitability and growth scored of 7 out of 10, mainly thanks to strong margins and returns that outperform more than half of its competitors, consistent earnings and revenue growth.Meanwhile Chris Neiger, a 5-star blogger recently drew his readers’ attention to the fact that PepsiCo has been a trustworthy dividend stock for decades. The company, he added, has raised its annual dividend for 47 consecutive years and currently pays a yield of about 3%. On top of that, Pepsi's stock has also outpaced the market over the past year, rising by more than 20%, outdoing even the S&P 500’s phenomenal rise of 18%. Blogger Opinions & Predictions on PepsiCoFurther data clearly shows where all this positive sentiment is coming from. Pepsi has a high total market cap of $184.7 billion making it one of the world’s largest food and beverages companies. Apart from its famous Pepsi beverage, it manufactures a variety of water carbonated soft drinks and snacks, which strengthen the brand in cases of weak beverage sales. As mentioned above, so far this year, its stock soared by 20%. Its main competitor, Coca-Cola (KO) was able to climb by no more than 9.8%.  What Can Investors Expect?Pepsi’s weakest point in recent quarters was low revenue from the North American beverages market. However, this market seems to be improving. This quarter it rose by 2.5% compared to 2.2% in the preceding quarter. In a statement right after the release of Q2 earnings data, CEO, Ramon Laguarta, expressed his full satisfaction with Pepsi’s performances and declared that the company was on track to meet 2019 financial targets.These targets consist of 4% annual organic revenue growth and 1% decline in adjusted EPS. For this to happen, all-year cash from operation ought to be $9 billion. Free cash flow should be no less than $5 billion.Will Pepsi achieve these goals? Some analysts are concerned about the company’s operating margin which has shrunk 2.2%. In addition, core operating margin dropped by 1.2%. Only time can tell whether Pepsi can ride the momentum of a successful Q2 and finish 2019 in a better state. Investors are advised to keep close track of its stock and exploit opportunities that may cross their path.",Is It Time to Open a Pepsi and Enjoy Your Stock?

2019-07-18,"After starting the year out on a dour note, the markets made a complete reversal. These days, the major averages -- like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite -- continue to hit new record highs. The Dow Jones isn't doing too shabby either.But as the overall market surges higher, many stocks are quickly moving out of bargain status and perhaps into the expensive category. For those investors looking for value stocks, pickings are slim.Or are they?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe truth is, there are plenty of value stocks still out there to be had. Sure, you may not find them among the FANGs, but bargain hunters can still find great deals on value stocks with low P/Es, strong earnings profiles, sales and even strong dividends.And considering that over the long haul, value tends to beat growth, now could be the best time ever to load up on some of these value stocks.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now With that, here are three great value stocks to buy this July and hold for a long time. Goldman Sachs (GS)Trailing P/E: 8.9The vampire squid is becoming a kinder and gentler, well, vampire squid. Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has become one of the best value stocks around. Today, shares can be had for a trailing P/E of just 8.9. That's dirt cheap considering its future potential.The reason behind the numbers is simple and comes from its former vampire squid name. Stock, currency, and derivatives trading used to make up the bulk of GS revenues in previous years. Those operations are still there to some extent. But thanks to regulation, Goldman has had to look for other ways to grow. Without those, investors have sort of abandoned the major financial name.However, Goldman has found the solution in consumer banking to the mass affluent. The firm's personal lending and deposit account platform, Marcus, has been extremely successful -- gathering more than $46 billion in deposits and issuing $4.6 billion in loans. Meanwhile, its deal to buy out wealth manager United Capital Financial Partners adds technology, investment management, and additional mass affluent assets into its umbrella. The idea is that Goldman is going back to its roots as more of a banking institution than a trading one.This is wonderful for investors. These are the kind of operations that throw off plenty of steady cash flows. And they already have, thanks to strong numbers, Goldman was able to increase its dividend and announce a massive $7 billion buyback program.However, investors continue to ignore the potential. That makes Goldman Sachs a great value stock to buy today. Micron TechnologyTrailing P/E: 5.09Modern life runs on semiconductors. However, there is a big difference between the chips needed for self-driving cars and the one in your garage door opener. For Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), the fact that it focuses on the boring, analog side of that equation hasn't been so good in recent years.Analog chips are so standard that pricing for them is actually traded like a commodity. There's a spot market for these chips … just like a barrel of oil or bushel of corn. So, with supplies of DRAM and other basic analog chips being in a glut, Micron has been largely ignored -- unlike say, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) -- and has become one of the cheapest value stocks around. You can currently snag MU stock for P/E of around 5.At that bargain price, you should snag all you can.For starters, the glut of DRAM may end as soon as the trade war goes. Already, Micron has seen a boost since President Donald Trump announced that firms can start selling chips to China's Huawei. Without trade issues, China should once again start consuming DRAM with reckless abandon.But what is really exciting is that MU has lucrative chipsets. At the same time, Micron continues to improve its memory chips to make them less like commodities and more irreplaceable to manufacturers. This includes its 3D XPoint technology -- which allows for very rapid storage and release of data. The kind of chip that is perfect for autonomous cars and A.I.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Over the long haul, these chips will help reduce Micron's dependency on boring DRAM and allow it to profit from higher margins and demand. In the meantime, investors can score this value stock for basically free while they wait for the turnaround. PepsiCo (PEP)Trailing P/E: 14.6By nature, most consumer staples are considered value stocks. That's because many of them aren't fast-growing anymore and are mostly known for their dividends. So, when you can find a steady-eddy consumer stock, trading for a low valuation that also has some serious growth behind it, you have to consider it for your portfolio. And that sums up PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) to a &quot;T.&quot;PEP doesn't need an introduction. We all know the global provider of sweet beverages and salty snacks. The firm giant is pulling in billions in annual revenues across more than 200 different countries. But despite its size, Pepsi is still growing -- with management looking to score 4% to 6% organic growth this year.How PEP will do that comes down to continued improvements to its product mix. That includes new organic, healthy snacks as well as the continued foray into ready-to-drink coffee and sparkling water.Meanwhile, CEO Ramon Laguarta has continued to act on his promise of a &quot;faster, stronger, better&quot; PepsiCo. That includes investing a hefty dose of tech, consuming intimacy initiatives and looking to cut costs. So far, Laguarta's moves are working. Last quarter was simply smashing for PEP.And yet, the market still doesn't seem to care.That has made PEP a wonderful value stock to buy. With a P/E of just under 15, investors aren't pricing in any of the firm's growth potential. And with its 2.88% dividend, you're paid while waiting for that potential to be realized.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-07-19,"PepsiCo has struck a deal to buy South Africa's Pioneer Food Group for $1.7 billion, the companies said on Friday, lifting Pioneer's shares and boosting a sector that has been hit by drought and tough trading conditions.  The U.S. drinks and snack group said on Friday that Pioneer's product portfolio was complementary to its own and would help PepsiCo to expand in sub-Saharan Africa by adding manufacturing and distribution capabilities.  ""Pioneer Foods forms an important part of our strategy to not only expand in South Africa, but further into sub-Saharan Africa as well,"" PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.",PepsiCo to buy South Africa's Pioneer Food for $1.7 billion
2019-07-19,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. agreed to buy South Africa’s Pioneer Foods Group Ltd. for about 24.4 billion rand ($1.8 billion), adding local brands such as Weet-Bix breakfast cereal and Ceres fruit juice to ignite a push across the continent.The deal gives the U.S. drinks giant a hub from which to expand more aggressively in sub-Saharan Africa, said Eugene Willemsen, who is moving to Cape Town from PepsiCo’s New York headquarters to oversee the region. “This transaction is all about growth. We are looking to expand our footprint,” he said by phone on Friday.PepsiCo offered 110 rand a share for Pioneer, a premium of about 56% over the last closing price before deal speculation began in earnest on Monday, the companies said in separate statements. Zeder Investments Ltd., Pioneer’s biggest shareholder with a 27% stake, will vote in favor of the deal, alongside investors holding more than half the foodmaker’s stock.Pioneer’s shares soared 30% to 101.03 rand as of 11:28 a.m. in Johannesburg, while Zeder jumped by 23% to a seven-month high. Fellow South African food producer Tiger Brands Ltd. gained as much as 6.5%, the most since November, before falling back. Bloomberg News reported the deal on Thursday.The acquisition gives PepsiCo several brands and manufacturing facilities in countries including Nigeria and Kenya as well as South Africa. The deal is the first major international purchase under new Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta, who took the helm in October, and builds on a $3.2 billion buyout of Israel’s SodaStream International Ltd. last August.For Pioneer, the takeover comes at a time when the Pretoria-based company has been struggling to cope with a consumer-spending slump in its home market, fueled by high unemployment and rising living costs. The foodmaker in May reported a decline in first-half profit as the weak economy hurt operating margins, and said the trading environment is likely to remain challenging.“Don’t be surprised if more clever foreigners buy South African assets on the cheap,” Syd Vianello, an independent analyst, said on Twitter. PepsiCo “also needs milled maize to make some of their snacks.”Pioneer said Monday that it’s in negotiations that could affect the stock price. The tie-up revives a partnership between the two companies that ended four years ago. Under that agreement, Pioneer bottled Pepsi products in South Africa.UBS Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Centerview Partners Holdings LP acted as financial advisers to PepsiCo.

2019-07-19,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. is making the most of cheaper South African valuations in its $1.8 billion swoop for Pioneer Foods Group Ltd., analysts and investors said.And while the takeover offer is opportunistic, the premium of about 56% is also attractive to investors, who saw Pioneer shares slump to the lowest since 2013 before bid speculation emerged, they said.“No one knows how long this downturn was going to last, or how long it would take the share price to go back to 110 rand, which is what PepsiCo is offering,” said Peter Takaendesa, a money manager at Cape Town-based Mergence Investment Managers.Less than three weeks ago, Pioneer was trading at 68 rand, the lowest since March 2013. The stock jumped by a record 31% Friday, pulling biggest shareholder Zeder Investments Ltd. up 23%, while sector peer Tiger Brands Ltd. gained as much as 6.5%. Read more about PepsiCo.’s offer for Pioneer here.Here’s more of what analysts and investors are saying:Michele Santangelo, a money manager at Independent SecuritiesThe premium offered is certainly attractive to Pioneer shareholders. The offer is also opportunistic given that the share price of Pioneer has been trading at levels last seen in 2013.The offer has highlighted that there is value in the South African market and those with capital looking for expansion are taking notice.Henre Herselman, a derivatives trader at Anchor Private ClientsThe fact that PepsiCo are paying such a premium sends the message that they are quite keen to get this deal done.It’s great to see some investment interest in South African shares. But on the other hand, I have to ask the question: are the foreign entities buying out the last South African gems and externalizing the earnings?Takaendesa at MergenceThere is a lot of margin pressure between Pioneer and Tiger Brands because of the aggressive competition in the sector, and because the companies cannot recover input costs from the weak consumer. Overall, from that point of view, it is a good deal for Pioneer shareholders.This is a small transaction for PepsiCo from a size point of view, and if they are comfortable to take a long-term view, they will get value for money.The company has been impacted by the cyclical downturn in the overall economy that has affected the share price, but the market structure has not changed significantly.Pioneer and PepsiCo have worked together before, and PepsiCo knew the business, and that may have been the attraction for the deal.I don’t think it will be a full-on investor deluge into South Africa, but this does send a good message out there that there are good companies in South Africa and they present a huge opportunity for people to come in and get good businesses at cheap prices.To contact the reporter on this story: Adelaide Changole in Nairobi at achangole2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Blaise Robinson at brobinson58@bloomberg.net, John Viljoen, Jon MenonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",PepsiCo Snaps Up a South African ‘Gem’ in Pioneer
2019-07-19,"PepsiCo Inc.  said Friday it has reached an agreement to acquire South AFrica's Pioneer Foods in an all-cash deal valued at about $1.7 billion. The company is playing 110 rand ($7.90) per share, equal to a 56% premium over the 30-day volume weighted average price prior to an announcement on July 15. &quot;This acquisition will help PepsiCo gain a solid beachhead for expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa by boosting the company's manufacturing and go-to-market capabilities, enabling scale and distribution,&quot; the company said in a statement. Pioneer owns a range of cereals, juices and other African staples, including brands that are popular in Africa including Weet-Bix, Liqui-Fruit, Ceres, Sasko, Safari, Spekko, and White Star.

2019-07-22,"(Bloomberg) -- A technology startup near Ontario’s leafy border with Michigan says it has the answer to the world’s plastic pollution problem: sawdust.Origin Materials is getting ready to pay sawmills in the area $20 a ton for the scraps left over in the process of turning logs into lumber, which it will use to make recyclable plastic bottles that remove carbon-dioxide from the sky because they’re made from sustainably sourced wood waste. Nestle SA, Danone SA and PepsiCo Inc. plan to sell water in Origin’s recyclable plant-based bottles in early 2022.It’s one of the many unconventional ways conceived by scientists to reduce the world’s reliance on plastics made from petroleum, which emit as much climate-damaging pollutants as 189 coal plants each year from production to incineration. Other so-called bio-based plastics are being developed from sugar, corn, algae, seaweed, sewage and even dead beetles.“Consumers are caring about plastic in a way that they haven’t in a long time, maybe ever,” said John Bissell, 34, who founded Origin Materials in 2008 and has spent 10 years working as an engineer developing alternative plastics that don’t contribute to climate change. “Everyday things like bottles and clothing can now become carbon negative, but remain otherwise functionally identical.”That may be true in theory, but phasing out petroleum-based plastics will be an uphill battle. Use of the material has become so ingrained for societies around the world that about half of all new oil demand through 2040 will come from petrochemicals, an industry that relies on plastics for most of its business, according to BloombergNEF. The $500 billion global plastics market is responsible for 5% of greenhouse gas emissions, Friends of the Earth data show. Some projections see that ratio tripling in the next 30 years.Plant-based plastics, especially varieties made from sugar cane, are starting to seep into the mainstream as companies try to respond to consumers who are increasingly angry about the ecologically devastating impact of plastics. London-based Bulldog sells its male skincare products in plastic tubes made from sugar cane. Last year, Danish toymaker Lego A/S started including botanical pieces, like leaves, bushes and trees, made entirely of plant-based plastics in its box sets.It’ll take getting big food and beverage companies on board to really alter the equation. Nestle alone produces 1.7 million tons of plastic packaging a year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, enough to make over 51 billion bottles. Beverage makers like Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi use a lot more than that. Coca-Cola rolled out its so-called plantbottle in 2009, but it’s still 70% petroleum based.“There is no doubt that awareness around plastic waste has become more prominent in the last two years,” said Simon Lowden, president of PepsiCo’s global snacks group, which announced in 2016 it would seek to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2030. As part of a strategy to find more sustainable packaging, Pepsi last year joined Nestle and Danone’s NaturALL Bottle Alliance to find ways to reduce the carbon footprint of beverage bottles. All three plan to buy 100% plant-derived bottles from Origin Materials when its Ontario plant gets up and running at the end of 2020 with a starting capacity of 300 million bottles a year.Origin Materials developed a way to extract cellulose from wood waste to make para-xylene, a hydrocarbon usually derived from oil used to manufacture PET, one of the most common plastics today. Since trees and plants naturally capture CO2 through photosynthesis, using sustainably sourced sawdust and wood chips more than offsets any pollutants released in the manufacturing process, according to Bissell.However ingenious the techniques to make plant-based bottles may get, though, they’re still plastic. Not all varieties are recyclable or biodegradable. And ultimately unless they are recycled — and worldwide only one out of every five bottles is — plastic bottles inevitably end up in landfills where they may spew pollutants into the air, or worse, find their way into the oceans where most could take hundreds of years to degrade, killing birds, fish and whales in the process. When incinerating, bio-based plastics may be little better than oil-based ones because the carbon stored in them is released.Since David Attenborough’s Blue Planet 2 documentary in 2017 showed albatrosses feeding their chicks plastic by accident, plastic’s environmental impact has “gone from a niche topic of conversation and engagement to something that features in all our conversations,” said Mark Lancelott, a sustainability expert at PA Consulting Group Ltd.The London-based consultancy has seen a “significant increase” in requests from food and beverage companies on how to manage plastic waste.After the European Union and New York announced bans this year on certain single-use plastics, many companies are getting nervous about how far those regulations could go, added Katherine Lampen, a London-based partner in Deloitte’s sustainability advisory team, which advises big consumer packaged good companies.“They are concerned that the future viability of their business could be reduced due to a heavy reliance on the material,” she said.Skeptics of the bioplastic push say they’re not resolving the underlying problem. It would be better to focus on improving rates of reuse of plastic or glass packaging, with waste collected by the producer, according to Juliet Phillips, an ocean campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency, a non-governmental organization.If production of plant-based plastics were to be scaled up, “land-use demands could bring about competition with agriculture, accelerating deforestation concerns and biodiversity loss,” she said.For Bissell at Origin Materials, the plastic industry has become too important for global commerce to work on only one front to improve sustainability, especially considering soaring demand in emerging markets where reuse programs tend to be underdeveloped.“The end of life of plastics is really important. I'm not too sure that I'd argue that it's more important than climate change. That feels like maybe not the right trade off to make,” he said. &#92;--With assistance from Hayley Warren.To contact the author of this story: Aine Quinn in London at aquinn38@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Daliah MerzabanNicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Sawdust Might Be One Answer to the World’s Plastic Problem
2019-07-22,"The market started to follow through on Thursday's rebound effort, opening higher on Friday. When push came to shove as the closing bell for the week approached, however, traders panicked again. The S&P 500's loss of 0.62% left it at 2976.61 … the lowest close in nearly two weeks.Source: Shutterstock Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) did the most net damage, losing 1.5% of its value, with investors taking Mizuho's profit-taking advice to heart. Snapchat parent Snap (NYSE:SNAP) logged the most noteworthy loss on Friday though, falling 3.6% as investors hesitate heading into its earnings report this week. The 170% rally since its late-2018 low suggests confidence, but leaves the stock subject to profit-taking no matter what its quarterly report looks like.At the other end of the spectrum, Boeing (NYSE:BA) flew 4.5% higher after the company announced plans to take a $4.9 billion charge related to its 737 debacle. Although bad news on the surface, the market may have been pricing in worse.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Flying, Overvalued Stocks in Danger of Crashing As the new week's trading action gets started though, none of those names are top trading prospects. Rather, it's the stock charts of Southern Co. (NYSE:SO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) that merit the closest looks. PepsiCo (PEP)A week and a half ago PepsiCo was put under the microscope, as it was putting pressure on what was quickly taking shape as an important support level. That floor ended up stopping the weakness before it got started. That recovery effort, however, faltered just as quickly when a familiar ceiling was revisited. Friday's tumble was the one that broke PEP stock out of that rut, for the worst. In fact, two key technical floors were shattered, opening the door to what could be a sizable selloff.The floor in question is, or was, $130.59, marked in yellow. PepsiCo was held up there a couple of times since late June. Friday's close failed to find support there.  *   Click to EnlargeAt the same time, the setback on Friday dragged PEP shares below the 50-day moving average line, plotted in purple.  * Zooming out to the weekly timeframe puts the rally and subsequent rollover in perspective. The June stall took shape at a technical ceiling that has been in place since late 2015.  * The weekly chart also indicates the stock's coming out of an overbought condition, none of which haven't resulted in some sort of pullback.  Fastenal (FAST)With nothing more than a passing glance, it would be easy to chalk up the recent weakness from Fastenal to market-driven bearishness. And, perhaps that's all it is. Fastenal is inching dangerously close to a more significant breakdown though, and one more misstep could open the selling floodgates.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio   *   Click to EnlargeThe good news is, the make-or-break levels are crystal clear, as is the most likely floor should the budding selloff manage to take root.  * The support area to watch is right around $30. That's just below the white 200-day moving average is, and where May's low was. That area has also been resistance in recent months, making it more meaningful.  * That said, FAST stock is putting pressure on that floor under pretty bearish circumstances. Last month, it met rather decided technical resistance at its purple 50-day moving average line (highlighted).  * The current weakness appears to be an effort to drag Fastenal all the way back to a floor currently near $26, which tags all the major lows going back to the beginning of 2016. Southern Co. (SO)Southern Co. didn't end last week on a particularly high note. The stock fell 1.5% on Friday, peeling back on above average volume. Nevertheless, the bigger trend remains a bullish one. The support line that has been steering SO shares upward since February remains intact, and Southern Co. stock remains above its pivotal moving average, plotted in pink on the daily chart.The flavor and support for the rally is changing though, for the worst. It took a bump into a familiar resistance line to get the ball rolling, but SO is now in more trouble than it may seem to be on the surface.  Click to Enlarge  * The problematic ceiling is plotted in white on the weekly chart, though it has been made more problematic by the fact that it was bumped when the RSI indicator also reached an overbought condition.  * Friday's bearish volume was above average, but not just more than the norm. It was the most daily distribution we've seen since April, hinting there are many would-be profit takers waiting in the wings.  * While the deck may be stacked against Southern Co. shares here, the pivotal line is the purple 50-day moving average line currently at $54.95.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Boeing.

2019-07-22,"With Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock close to its 52-week high, investors might be concerned that there's more downside potential than upside. That's especially true with an earnings announcement coming up on Tuesday, prior to the opening bell.Source: Shutterstock On top of that, some KO stock shareholders are nervous because 2019's earnings reports thus far have been less than stellar for a number of blue-chips. For several key reasons, however, I'm choosing to look at the bright side of this famous company's prospects. In short, no need exists to panic-sell just because earnings season is here again. Coca-Cola Stock Price Is Actually UndervaluedBeing close to its 52-week high doesn't necessarily mean that the Coca-Cola stock price is overvalued; in fact, KO stock is lagging its competitors. Compared to the broader beverages market, Coca-Cola shares have underperformed by 8.2% year-to-date. They've also lagged behind the soft-drink giant's blue-chip peer group (including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE:KDP)) by 6.5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Additionally, the KO stock price isn't too lofty compared to its main competitors: checking in on the company's forward price-earnings ratios, we see that it stands at around 24. That's a good value in relation to its peers in the beverages market. It just goes to show that you can't look at the price chart in isolation.Some elements just don't show up in the KO stock price. Always a Dividend DarlingThrough multiple generations, KO stock has provided a safety net for stakeholders in the form of a healthy dividend yield. That's another factor that isn't reflected in simple price-action charts. The Coca-Cola dividend-king tradition continues to this day. Recently, the company's board of directors declaring a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share.That might not sound like much, but the current dividend yield for KO stock is 3.1%. It's a compelling reason to ignore earnings fears and hold on to this multi-generational income producer. Given that this constitutes Coca-Cola's 57th consecutive annual dividend increase, I feel that any earnings surprise -- positive or negative -- would be nothing more than a bump in the road for this Warren Buffett favorite. Estimates Are Low, and That's a Good ThingWhen analysts set the bar low, skittish investors tend to abandon ship. But I see it as a setup for a pleasant surprise. Analysts collectively expect Coca-Cola's second-quarter earnings to increase by only a penny. That's a mere 1.64% increase over the same quarter the year prior. Not only that, but earnings for this year are projected to increase by just 0.48% compared to the previous year. That's not exactly a massive hurdle to clear.Besides, owners of KO stock have every reason to believe that the company will outperform this time around. Indeed, Coca-Cola has met or beaten earnings estimates every quarter since 2012; over the past four quarters, the average earnings surprise was 2.87%. And, with Coca-Cola's first-quarter 2019 revenues having increased by 5.2%, the outlook (in my eyes, at least) is looking brighter than ever for good old KO stock. The Bottom Line on Coca-Cola StockCoca-Cola stockholders tend to be more conservative investors: less worried about hype and market noise, and more attuned to solid company fundamentals. KO stock has been a classic dividend king and safety net for many years. Earnings hoopla and hubbub are no reason to abandon it now.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-23,"Shares of consumer packaged goods giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) surged to all-time highs today after the company reported better than expected second quarter numbers. Revenues came in ahead of expectations, and boasted a very healthy 6% organic sales growth rate. Earnings also topped expectations, boosted by core operating margin expansion. The full-year revenue guide was lifted slightly, and the full-year EPS guide was maintained.Source: Shutterstock Broadly, it was a very good report. In response, KO stock shot up more than 5%, an unusually big post-earnings move for this normally quiet and subdued stock.Unfortunately, I'm unconvinced that this rally in KO stock can continue with much gusto in the near term. KO stock now trades at its richest valuation in recent memory. And while the company has found a long-term winning strategy that should power continued stable profit growth, most of that profit upside is priced in for the foreseeable future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat's the investment game plan here? Avoid KO stock for the time being. Buy on dips. The stretched valuation implies limited upside near term. But the company's long-term growth prospects do imply that the Coca-Cola stock price will eventually head higher. Second-Quarter Numbers Were Really GoodCoca-Cola's second-quarter earnings report was good on all important fronts.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio First, and foremost, Coca-Cola's top-line momentum remains the best it has been in recent memory. For two consecutive quarters, Coca-Cola has reported 6% organic sales growth, on volume growth of 3% or better. The core Coca-Cola product line-up has rebounded (4% volume growth in the quarter, led by the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit volume growth for Coke Zero), while new product lines are performing very well, too (25% of revenue now comes from new or reformulated beverages).Second, margins are healthy. Comparable operating margins did slip year-over-year. But, that slippage was entirely due to currency headwinds. Ex those currency headwinds, core operating margins actually expanded more than 100 basis points year-over-year, due to sustained gains in operational efficiency.Third, the guide was strong. Organic sales are expected to rise 5% this year. That would mark the second year in a row of 5% organic sales growth - a strong mark for a company that is this big and this mature in a very stable market. Margins ex currency headwinds are expected to keep marching higher. Profits are, too.Broadly, Coca-Cola's second quarter earnings report was very good, and it's no surprise that KO stock rallied to all time highs in response. Coca-Cola Stock May Not Rally Much FurtherAlthough Coca-Cola Q2 results imply that this company is firing on all cylinders, the KO stock price does not project to rally much further from here.Bulls think that its relative underperformance year to date positions the Coca-Cola stock price for continued gains. Shares are up just 15% since the start of this year. That compares unfavorably to a 20% gain for the S&P 500 and an 19% gain for PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) stock.But this underperformance is the result of Coca-Cola's rich valuation. Heading into the year, KO stock was trading at 22.5 times forward earnings. PEP stock was trading at just 19.5 times forward earnings.In this sense, PEP stock has been playing catch-up with Coca-Cola all year long. Today, the KO stock price is still more richly valued than PEP stock. Yet, according to Ycharts.com, the two companies have the same projected long-term earnings growth rate around 6%. Indeed, KO stock's present 25 times forward earnings multiple is the biggest forward earnings multiple this stock has had in the past decade.As such, Coca-Cola is trading at a premium relative to peers and its historical standard. This rich valuation has limited gains in the KO stock price over the past seven months. It will continue to limit gains for the foreseeable future, too. Long-Term Strategy Implies Long-Term SuccessIn the big picture, Coca-Cola has stumbled upon a winning strategy in a stable growth industry. This implies that KO stock will head higher in the long run.Zooming out, Coca-Cola is one of essentially only three relevant non-alcoholic beverage companies in the world. Of those three, Coca-Cola is the most potent, with the most reach and the most resources. Coca-Cola leverages this advantage to identify next-generation beverage trends, acquire brands within that trend and push those brands through its global distribution network. This strategy ensures that Coca-Cola's product portfolio is always relevant. Further, it helps ensure that the company maintains and potentially even grows share in the steady growth beverage industry.The beverage industry is a mid-single digit growth industry. Assuming Coca-Cola maintains market share, then this company projects as a mid-single digit revenue growth business over the next several years. Margin headwinds should be offset by buybacks. And earnings per share growth should net out in the mid-single digit range, too.Assuming mid-single digit annualized EPS growth from this year's projected EPS base of $2.10, then 2025 EPS could be about $3. Based on a historically average 21-times forward multiple, that implies a 2024 price target of $63.Thus, in the long run, the KO stock price has upside to levels above $60. Bottom Line on KO StockThere are two good things about the KO stock price here. First, it has healthy upside potential in the long run. Second, the company is firing on all cylinders today.There's also one bad thing about Coca-Cola here: shares appear overextended after a big second-quarter earnings rally.The implication of these three observations is simple. Avoid KO stock for the time being (because it's overextended). But buy shares on any big dips, because they will march higher over the long haul.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-26,"Do you know the definition of a perfect business? It's one that makes or saves its customers money. Do you know the definition of a perfect stock? It's a stock of a company that makes or saves its customers money. Although I'm facetious, why not invest in businesses that are doing good while making money? InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs investors become more focused on subjects like responsible investing and ESG issues, the companies that add value to the world and its customers are likely going to deliver market-beating returns over the long haul.   * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now MSCI estimates that over the next 20-30 years, millennials could invest as much as $20 trillion in ESG-related investments in the U.S. Many of those investee companies are likely to pursue business strategies that make the world we live in a better place. For now, however, I'd like to focus on seven stocks to buy that will save you money, time, or both.  Stocks to Buy: PepsiCo (PEP)Source: Shutterstock It might be a stretch to say that PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) saves its customers money. However, with the company's recent December 2018 acquisition of Sodastream, it not only saves its customers both money and time, but it also saves the planet. Pepsi paid $3.2 billion for the at-home sparkling water brand that helps consumers turn boring old tap water into exciting carbonated beverages. Pepsi captures the at-home market while its customers spend less time at the grocery store, pay less for their non-alcoholic beverages, and reduce the amount of plastic put back into the environment. &quot;With its customizable options, SodaStream empowers consumers to personalize their preferred beverage in an environmentally friendly way and provides PepsiCo with a significant presence in the at-home marketplace,&quot; stated CEO Ramon Laguarta. &quot;I'm confident we can accelerate progress on our shared goal of curbing plastic waste and building a more sustainable future.&quot;It's a win-win. Since Pepsi closed its Sodastream acquisition on December 5, PEP stock is up 11.2%.  Costco (COST)Source: Shutterstock The most tangible proof I have that Costco (NASDAQ:COST) saves you money is the property and casualty insurance I got in February 2018 when my wife and I moved to Halifax from Toronto. The company's insurance partner saved us a significant chunk of money, although it's fair to say that some of those savings came from being in a smaller city with lower odds of accident or theft.Nonetheless, because a majority of Costco's profits are from its annual memberships and not the profit margins on the products it sells, the company works feverishly to pass these savings on to its customers. If Costco can get a great deal on orange juice one month, it doesn't take the additional gross profits. Instead, it lowers the retail price in its stores, passing the savings on to the consumer. By ensuring that you're saving money on the items you often buy at the grocery store, Costco will be able to continue raising its annual membership fees without upsetting the customer too much.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund I don't think Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) can say the same thing after price increases sent its stock price down by double digits July 18. COST is stock to buy. Intuit (INTU)Have you seen the funny QuickBooks ads featuring Danny DeVito? Who doesn't like the movie and TV star? The ads do a good job reminding small business people that they need to spend less time doing billing, communications, or ordering, and more time working on their business, perfecting growth strategies, marketing, etc. While I haven't seen the viewership numbers on DeVito's ads, I'm going to assume they have been a hit for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), QuickBook's owner. As someone who freelances for 100% of my income, I can honestly say that I have thought about using QuickBooks for my small business. Anything that can save me time, aggravation, and possibly money is worth using.In Intuit's Q3 2019 report ended April 30, QuickBooks generated $887 million in revenue, 18.7% higher than a year earlier. Although it was only 27% of Intuit's overall sales in the third quarter, its growth rate was much higher than its consumer segment (Turbo Tax, Mint) growth rate of 10.3% in the quarter. I use Turbo Tax and am considering QuickBooks in the future for the simple reason that these products save me time, money, and aggravation. It's a stock to buy. Stocks to Buy: GrubHub (GRUB)Food delivery services such as GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and Uber Eats may do nothing for consumers except put restaurants out of business. That's a negative take on food delivery companies based on the recent news that GrubHub has been charging restaurants for phone calls -- between $5 and $9 a call -- that didn't result in food orders. I told my wife this piece of news and she quite rightly said, &quot;How do restaurants stay in business with those kinds of fees?&quot; A more positive view of GrubHub is that it saves busy people time by not having to go out for food or cook after a long day at work. How much money it saves is another question altogether.There are plenty of sites that discuss how to save money using GrubHub promo codes. One of them is Gigworker.com, a site dedicated to the gig economy. It provides ways to take advantage of these promo codes to save money on your orders through the food delivery service. However, because there are delivery fees with most orders placed through GrubHub, I would suggest that some of the savings from promos are lost through delivery fees and tip.   * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season At the end of the day, GrubHub is designed to save you time, while making restaurants money. H&R Block (HRB)Although H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) stock has seen better days -- its all-time high of $37.53 was reached in November 2015 -- there's no denying that the tax preparation company continues to file a lot of America's tax returns. H&R Block prepared 23.6 million tax returns worldwide in fiscal 2019, 1.2% more than a year earlier, generating $3.1 billion in revenue and $616 million in operating profits. Here in the U.S., the number of tax returns prepared by HRB increased by 1.5% while the number of U.S. DIY (Do-it-Yourself) returns increased by 5.9%. DIY tax returns accounted for 39% of H&R Block's tax returns prepared in the U.S., up from 38% a year earlier. The reason HRB is a stock to buy?On July 1, H&R Block announced that it acquired Toronto-based fintech company Wave Financial for $405 million. Wave helps entrepreneurs better manage the financial aspects of their business, including invoicing, payroll, and accounting.Given Intuit's push into the small business marketplace, Wave gives HRB a competitive product to win business away from the maker of QuickBooks. Long-term, the Wave acquisition could be looked upon as a transformational move that takes HRB to the next level. As a result of Wave, HRB now provides a good risk/reward profile.    Amazon (AMZN)Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, along with all the other e-commerce services Jeff Bezos and company provide, take a toll on the environment. It's estimated that Amazon emitted 19 million metric tons of carbon in 2017, the equivalent of five coal-fired power plants. There is no question, however, that consumers can save money and time using the company's products and services. My wife's cousin is a consultant in the small Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. Thanks to Amazon Prime, she's able to spend far less time driving into town to pick up stuff for the household. As someone who doesn't make money unless I'm working, I understand the desire to cut out these time drains. Time is money as they say. So, if you feel bad about the impact your purchases are making on the world at large, take some of the money you'll make from AMZN stock and donate it to an environmental cause like Greenpeace.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Now, if Amazon could figure out how to eliminate its carbon footprint drain, the stock would go to $5,000 in no time, which would be a win-win.  BlackRock (BLK)Source: Shutterstock Keep it simple, stupid. The KISS principle definitely applies to asset managers like BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) iShares and Vanguard, who have captured a big chunk of the retail investor's assets in the U.S. and other places in the world by providing ETFs; an inexpensive investment that captures large swaths of different sectors, countries, market caps, etc. Not only do passively-managed ETFs save investors time and money from traditional active investing, but they also provide a diversified portfolio of stocks that deliver healthy returns over the long haul. To make things even simpler, iShares have several asset allocation EFT fund-of-funds that save investors time and money. Take the iShares Core Growth Allocation ETF (NYSEARCA:AOR). It invests in seven different iShares ETFs that give investors a diversified core portfolio charging just 0.25% annually.  The seven ETFs give you a 60/40 allocation between equities and fixed-income investments, with 60% of the assets in U.S-domiciled investments with the remaining 40% outside the U.S., including both developed and emerging markets.Sure, it doesn't have any alternative investments, but by keeping it simple, BlackRock's saving you time and money. It's a stock to buy.Oh, and a $10,000 investment a decade ago, is worth almost $24,000 today.     At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-29,"Plastic bottles continue to be a problem for companies struggling to make it clear they care about combating climate change...and nabbing that ESG rating. But could the solution be sawdust? Dusted Origin Materials is an Ontario-based company that has found a way to make plastic bottles using sawdust, a sustainably-sourced material. Both Pepsi and Nestle plan to sell water in the plant-based bottles by early 2022, and Origin is busy buying as much dust from sawmills as it can get. Cycles and recycles Plastic water bottles can be recycled, which is certainly a good thing. But the recycling process is not perfect. Many plastic bottles are made from petroleum, which emit climate-damaging pollutants such as carbon dioxide. Recently, petrochemical companies have become concerned about nurdles, which are the resin peas used to make plastic bottles, and which can emit harmful waste when not properly recycled. Bottle It In That companies are trying to find ways to not only be more environmentally conscious but finding ways to be more efficient in the ways they go about that, shows the increasing importance of ESG investing to corporations. Even Coca-Cola has launched the World Without Waste initiative, wherein it will recycle a bottle or can for each one it sells by 2030. Reportedly, Coke did so at least partly because investors kept bringing up plastics during earnings calls. -Michael Tedder Johannes Christo/REUTERS",Pepsi Turns To Sawdust For Help With Its Plastic Problem

2019-07-30,"While the selloffs aren't enormous, it's clear that investors are getting defensive ahead of the Fed's announcement on Wednesday. Amid the rate-cut drama is a plethora of earnings results. Let's look at a few top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Under Armour  Click to EnlargeUnder Armour (NYSE:UA, NYSE:UAA) stock is getting smacked on earnings, falling over 12% on the day. However, the stock is well off its session lows, as UAA stock bounces from its 200-day moving average and 50% retracement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Companies I'd Love to See Go Public Now near $24, we find the stock at an interesting juncture. Either shares rally through the significant level of $25 or they fall below $22.If it's the former, it could trigger a rally up to the 50-day moving average at $25.74, and possibly fill the gap up to $27. If it's the latter, it will lose the 200-day moving and 50% retracement. It could open up UAA to a drop to the 61.8% retracement at $20.80. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: PepsiCo  Click to EnlargePresuming that the Fed follows through with a rate cut, it should be good news for equities. Stocks of all kinds -- tech to dividend champions -- should benefit, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) included.However, the stock has been trading quite poorly as of late. Shares are struggling to reclaim the 50-day and 20-day moving averages, with the latter crossing below the former and signaling that short-term momentum is turning bearish. Downtrend resistance (blue line) is also forming a series of higher lows.It gives bears a low-risk shorting opportunity.If PEP closes over the $131.50 to $132 area, they can cover their positions. If PEP falls below $130, it opens up the stock to a test of its monthly lows near $128.40. Below that and it could trigger a fall down to the $124 to $125 area. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Invitae  Click to EnlargeWe've been talking about Invitae (NASDAQ:NVTA) all year long, from its breakout over $15 to the really bullish action throughout the last two months. Can it get to $100 like Citron suggests?Now, shares are hitting new 52-week highs just over $27. If it breaks out, a run into the upper $20s and possibly up to $30 is possible. On the downside, I want to see $25 hold as support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Capital One  Click to EnlargeCapital One Financial (NYSE:COF) has been stuck at its lows all session, muddling about as its lower by more than 7% on the day as it discloses a big-time data breach.The price action doesn't bode well for a bounce, particularly as the charts get a bit sloppy from here.$90 has proven significant over the past few years, while the 38.2% retracement for the one-year range is at $89.28. Below this area could trigger a move down to the 50-week moving average at $87.29.The problem with COF stock? While $90 is propping it up, it's below both uptrend support (blue line) and prior downtrend resistance (purple line). The latter has been present for years now, but gave way after last week's massive rally.I would not be a buyer of COF in the short-term unless it reclaims the 10-week moving average and prior downtrend resistance. There are better, more well-defined setups out there than CFO. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Pfizer  Click to EnlargeNow this one's a curveball. On Monday, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) announced a merger deal with Mylan (NYSE:MYL), but only saw slight selling pressure on the day. While the selling did pick up into the close, not many were expecting a near-7% decline on Tuesday.The move has PFE stock plunging through its 50-week moving average and well below its 10-week moving average. I don't know if it will get there, but buying PFE at $37 seems somewhat interesting. It'll give PFE a 3.9% dividend yield and bring it back to prior resistance. It will also give bulls a well-defined risk/reward.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Should Pfizer firm up before that, let's see if it can reclaim $40 or if this mark acts as resistance.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

The company, in the midst of a difficult turnaround, might struggle with such a disruption. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell 3.9%, as investors fear the impact that the recent rate cut might have on its lending business margins.There were a few names that managed to make forward progress in the midst of the fairly indiscriminate selloff. Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) was up nearly 2% during Thursday's regular-hours session.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY)It has more to do with oil prices than with Occidental Petroleum in particular, and if it's going to last, it's going to do so because the energy sector as a whole is going to help lift it. But, no other oil and gas name besides OXY stock has made as much technical progress this week. Among the sector, it's possibly the top prospect right now.  *   Click to EnlargeOccidental was already in an uptrend, but yesterday's outside day, where the open was below Wednesday's low and the close was above Wednesday's high, speaks volumes about billion conviction.  * The volume surge on Thursday also says there are more bulls waiting in the wings, willing to buy on a dip.  * Just within the past couple of weeks, the purple 50-day moving average line and the blue 20-day moving average line have started to serve as a floor, laying the foundation for more forward progress. Verizon Communications (VZ)Verizon Communications has been on the radar for a while now. Although it logged a heroic 2018 despite headwinds felt by most other names, that strength has started to buckle this year. Lower highs have been the norm, and VZ stock has put repeated pressure on critical floors.This week's stumble, however, has largely put the final touches on a long-brewing pullback.

2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For 47 years, the Business Roundtable has lobbied on behalf of corporate America. Much of that time, it maintained a fiction(1) -- that the sole purpose of a corporation was to maximize profits on behalf of shareholders. This philosophy has been under assault for several years now, and this week the Business Roundtable announced it wants to put it to rest.In a widely circulated memo, the 200-member organization reversed itself, writing that &quot;shareholder primacy” is no longer the sole purpose of a corporation. Instead, corporations must include a commitment to “all stakeholders,” which includes customers, employees, suppliers and local communities.Some kudos are in order for JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, and chairman of the Business Roundtable, for driving these changes. He has been discussing the need for a more inclusive form of capitalism, both in public speeches and in his letters to shareholders, for some time.But turning this aircraft carrier around won’t be easy, in large part because of the group's own history. Indeed, the Roundtable has spent most of the past four decades advocating against the interests of those exact stakeholders. To cite some of the more notable examples:&#92;-- It fought the rise of labor unions and pro-union legislation;&#92;-- Helped to defeat antitrust bills;&#92;-- Prevented the formation of the Consumer Protection Agency;&#92;-- Opposed corporate governance changes to make boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders;&#92;-- Fought proper accounting of stock options given as compensation to executives and insiders;&#92;-- Opposed increases in the national minimum wage (it now favors increases);&#92;-- Lobbied to prevent restrictions on executive compensation;&#92;-- Fought legislation that would create cleaner energy and address climate change;&#92;-- Pushed for corporate income-tax cuts;&#92;-- Supported anti-consumer Supreme Court decisions, including the fiction that corporations are legal people, and that campaign donations equal speech.   The Roundtable might respond that this is all in the past. Let’s hope so. But the organization has an even greater challenge: Scan the list of 181 signatories to the recent memo and it's a Who’s Who of corporate behavior that has burdened and disadvantaged the very stakeholders they will now champion.Consider a few of the signatories:&#92;-- Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.:  Two of the most valuable companies in the world are famously effective at using various tax dodges to avoid paying their fair share. I can recall when the Internal Revenue Service went after maneuvers that serve no valid business purpose other than tax avoidance. Consider that what isn't paid in tax by those who avoid them must be made up for by those who do -- mostly average Americans who also happen to be customers of these companies.The share of federal tax revenue paid by corporations has dropped by two-thirds in the past seven decades -- from 32% in 1952 to 10% in 2013; and corporate income tax as a share of gross domestic product has fallen from about 6% in 1946 to about 1.5% today.&#92;-- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co.: Show good faith -- working with card-issuing banks as needed -- by simplifying the incomprehensible small print in the cardholder agreement and spell out in clear language the terms and penalties for late payment. Second, do the same for mandatory arbitration clauses that take away the right of customers to seek redress in public courts.&#92;-- Ameriprise Financial Inc., Morgan Stanley and Principal Financial Group Inc: The brokers and insurers on the list have been zealous opponents of the fiduciary rule. Instead, they prefer a less stringent rule that allows them to sell products that are better for them than for their customers. Until those firms -- and Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan are in this group -- embrace a higher duty of care, their gestures toward stakeholders are hollow. Oh, and they should drop the requirement that customers agree to mandatory arbitration clauses as one of the conditions for opening a brokerage account.&#92;-- Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc.: For years these companies have been helping the American public achieve record levels of diabetes and obesity by selling health-damaging sugary drinks. They should acknowledge and warn customers of the consequences of consuming too much of their products, and accept the same kinds of taxes and health warnings now affixed to cigarettes.&#92;-- Deere & Co.: The maker of farm machinery has led the fight against customers, insisting that they not make repairs to the equipment they own, and denying them access to parts and instructions. Repairs can only be made by Deere service technicians in what has come to be known as a “repair monopoly.” Apple, by the way, does the same thing.&#92;-- Walmart Inc. and McDonald's Corp.: Both were steadfast opponents of increases in minimum wages for years. Although both now offer higher minimum pay, it was only after a tightening labor market forced them to increase wages. But this wasn't a case of corporate altruism -- their stores were messy and employees were sullen, and pay increases were part of plans to keep ill-treated customers from defecting. (McDonald's is not a signatory to the Roundtable memo).For the Roundtable commitment to be meaningful, the signatories are going to have to alter their behavior in ways large and small, and maybe even in ways that aren't always optimal for maximizing short-term profits. Still, we should be encouraged. But the proof will be in the follow through and the actual actions of the Roundtable members.(Corrects to clarify section on credit-card companies to indicate the role of banks in setting terms for customers.   )(1) In “The Shareholder Value Myth,” Lynn Stout explained how the entire theory is based on a misreading of a 1919 court case -- Dodge vs. Ford – at the time, both privately held, non-public companies.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-09-09,"As one of the leaders of the  cannabis sector, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) stock has had its share of ups and downs over the years. Lately, the firm has had  a lot more negatives than positives, and much of that pain has been self-inflicted.As a result,Canopy's  big backer, Constellation Brands, (NYSE:STZ) had a major falling out with Canopy. Constellation seemingly forced out Canopy's CEO, and has now overhauled its whole management team. Consequently,  CGC has reworked its strategy.Source: Shutterstock In recent months, traders have dumped CGC stock, due to both the lousy marijuana stock environment and Canopy's particular issues.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's not surprising that traders are nervous, given that the firm still doesn't have a permanent CEO or positive earnings per share at this point. However, give credit where it is due. The company's new CFO, Mike Lee, is making a solid pitch to the market. Lee, for those unfamiliar, previously worked for beverage companies, including E & J Gallo Winery and Pepsico (NYSE:PEP). Most recently, he served as a senior VP in Constellation's wine and spirits business, making him a natural pick as Constellation tries to right CGC's ship.Lee just took over as acting CFO at the beginning of June. Despite his brief tenure, Lee  made a strong argument for sticking with CGC stock earlier this month at the Barclays Consumer Staples conference. Let's start with his explanation for one of the bears' biggest concerns about Canopy Growth stock: CGC's weak profitability and its large operating losses.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy  Canopy Explains Its Weak Profit MarginsA big bone of contention surrounding CGC stock has been its weak profit margins. Canopy's gross margin slumped from the 40% range to  barely 20% in recent quarters.Lee said that some folks have not really understood what's been going on. When Canopy launched, he says, the company had three large growing facilities available. It could either go &quot;pedal to the metal&quot; to get production rolling full blast from day one or take a more measured approach. CGC went for the first option, grabbing a big chunk of the initial market share.As a result, however, its operations had some serious inefficiencies. Canopy is now reworking its production. But its overhead costs remain high, which makes its whole profit/loss picture look ugly. Once its facilities are reconfigured to a more optimum set-up, however, Lee says that Canopy will get back to 40% gross profit margins. He expects that to occur &quot;in the near future.&quot;At the moment, he says,CGC is generating gross margins in the mid-to-high 30s range once those extra costs are backed out. And with optimization and a better product mix, its margins will surge back over 40% again, the CFO stated. This metric will be a key test for CGC stock in coming quarters. The new management team has laid out a clear and credible path to improved profitability. Let's see if it can deliver. Big Vaping PushCanopy likes to talk about how Canada is entering the recreation 2.0 stage of the market. That is, the cannabis sector is becoming a much wider playing field as new products such as edibles come online. A big part of Canopy's strategy revolves around vaping. Unlike its peers, who are marketing third-party products, Canopy has had its team develop in-house capabilities that could be a huge boon for CGC. According to Lee, its new CFO:&quot;So, we're coming out with plus or minus 15 SKUs, multiple devices, a variety of price points. And I can't steal the thunder from announcements coming later this year, but we think that it's going to be a very competitive portfolio of products that, yes, we think will grow the category, perhaps convert some of the illicit market into the legal market […] so it's very important.&quot;Building a proprietary product portfolio is appealing.  It results in much higher margins, after all, since the proceeds don't have to be shared with a middleman. Given its efforts to develop its own vaping products,  CGC has a built-in catalyst. Traders can look forward to its forthcoming announcements on vaping later this year.And, as Lee rightly notes, one issue with the marijuana market in Canada so far is that many people keep buying product through back channels. If Canopy can help spur  more people to buy cannabis legally, it would help clear the inventory backlog that has been a thorn in the side of so many marijuana stocks this year. The Verdict on CGC StockInvestorPlace contrubutor  Luke Lango recently explained why he is still bullish on the long-run outlook of CGC stockThe big picture here is that you have a cannabis industry that is in the top of the first inning of a multi-year, global growth narrative […] Judging the long-term fate of a cannabis company because they missed sales or earnings estimates last quarter seems … foolish.I don't own any CGC stock at this point. I expect the cannabis  industry to continue to have challenging months ahead as it struggles with oversupply. But for a long-term investor who is willing to endure potential losses for the time being, Canopy Growth looks like one of the better options.Constellation is a well-funded backer, and it appears that it's putting a competent management team in place to run things going forward. Let's see who takes over as its CEO, but in the meantime, the new CFO is offering a reasonable plan that could pay off well in coming years.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has bounced back by 16.3% so far in September after a brutal sell-off over the past few months. I recommended Canopy Growth stock back on Au. 30. I felt the stock had been oversold given how little its fundamental picture has changed.Source: Shutterstock A brand new report on Canadian cannabis market share seems to confirm the idea that Canopy is dominating the nascent Canadian market. Experienced investors know a first-mover advantage is extremely valuable in the long-term.One of the biggest reasons why CGC stock has dropped in the past few months is because its losses have been heavier than expected. However, the early market share numbers suggest Canopy's strategy of aggressively investing in ramping up its business is already paying off.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The NumbersBank of America found Canopy has a 25% market share of all cannabis listings in Canada. The study included 1,980 listings, 101 brands and 39 different cannabis producers.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Canopy Growth Corp has the largest share of the Canadian market by a long shot. Analyst Christopher Carey says Canopy's market share is roughly double the 13% market share of its closest competitors, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) and Organigram (NASDAQ:OGI).Carey says establishing that first-mover advantage is critical.&quot;Establishing distribution - early and big - can be significant in creating long-term market share moats for a business competing in new consumer categories prone to fragmentation,&quot; he said.Unfortunately, the market share study wasn't all good news for Canopy Growth stock. The 25% &quot;share of listings&quot; represents product already on shelves throughout Canada. Bank of America also looked at &quot;sell-in,&quot; or total retail purchases of cannabis. Sell-in represents the future share of listings. In that statistic, Canopy has dropped to second place with 22%, trailing Aurora at 27%. The Future of CannabisCarey says investors shouldn't get too worried about Canopy losing sell-in share. In the June quarter, Canopy's harvest jumped 183% quarter-over-quarter, much of which was hot-selling THC flower.Carey is expecting this spike in harvest will translate to a 33% quarterly increase in Canopy sell-in in the fiscal second quarter of 2020. That big push could push Canopy back ahead of Aurora in sell-in share.Obviously having that top market share spot is ideal, but as long as Canopy remains at or near the top, investors should be rewarded in time. Certainly, investors want Canopy Growth to be the Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) of cannabis, but it will be just fine if Canopy Growth stock ends up the PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) of Canadian cannabis.In fact, PEP stock has generated a total return of more than 2,630% over the past 30 years. KO stock has a total return of 2,570% in that time. How to Play Canopy Growth StockThe latest Canadian market share numbers were certainly good enough to keep Carey in the bull camp when it comes to CGC stock.&quot;Canopy remains a company, if a still imperfect story, with a chance at becoming a leading global player in cannabis, especially given its industry leading [balance] sheet and partnership,&quot; he said.Bank of America has a &quot;buy&quot; rating and $27.66 price target for Canopy Growth stock.If you are a cannabis investor that believes the industry is just getting started, I think you can't go wrong owning Canopy Growth stock. My only recommendation would be to hedge your bets by owning ACB stock and at least two or three other cannabis stocks as well.As much as you love Canopy Growth stock and think Canopy will end up as the Coke or Pepsi of cannabis, it is still extremely early in the cannabis game. Especially in the event of U.S. legalization, there will be plenty of demand to support multiple market winners.It's likely most of the smaller names can't beat out Canopy Growth Corp and Aurora directly. But they might make appealing buyout targets down the line.I would recommend all cannabis investors buy Canopy Growth stock, ACB stock and at least two more of their favorite cannabis plays for a more diversified approach to the market.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock is more expensive than PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) in most value metrics for the two companies' valuations in relation to their sales, earnings and cash flow.Source: Elvan / Shutterstock.com For example, KO trades at 24 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio. It also is valued at 25.1 times enterprise value to EBITDA. By contrast, PEP trades at 23 times earnings and has an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 17.1.Another example is that the market values KO stock's enterprise value at 8.2 times its sales, whereas PEP is at 3.4 times EV-to-sales.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Differences with Dividends and YieldsKO stock has a slightly higher dividend yield than PEP. Coca-Cola stock yields 2.9% and PepsiCo's yield is 2.8%.However, KO spends more of its earnings on dividends, paying out 77.4%. PEP pays out only 68.4 % of its earnings-per-share in dividends.If PEP paid out 77.4% in dividends like KO, its dividend per share would be 13.1% higher -- $4.32 annually. So at today's price of ~$136.36, PEP's dividend yield would be higher than KO's -- 3.17% vs. KO stock's 2.94%.Moreover, KO has grown its dividends at only 6.85% during the past five years. PepsiCo dividends have grown faster at 9.88% over the same period. And remember PEP pays out less of its earnings, so its growth rate would be even higher on a comparable payout basis.  * 10 Big IPO Stocks From 2019 to Watch  PEP's Total Return Has Been Better Than KO, Despite Being CheaperNormally you would think that since KO stock is more expensive than PEP its stock performance would have been better than PEP's. But over the past year, KO stock has risen 19% and PEP has risen 20%. So PEP has outperformed Coca-Cola by 5.37%.Even more interesting is that PEP's total return has also been better. Remember that KO has a higher dividend yield than PEP -- 2.94% (KO) vs. 2.81% (PEP). If you add in the actual dividends declared over the past year, KO has paid out $1.59 per share in dividends. One year ago KO's price was $46.02, so the dividends paid earned investors 3.46%.PEP declared $3.765 per share in dividends over the past year. Based on the year-ago price of $113.85, these dividends earned investors 3.31%.On a total return basis, Coca-Cola stock earned investors 22.46% (19 % price appreciation plus 3.46% in dividends). But PEP earned their investors 23.34% (20.03 % plus 3.31%).So, even though PEP is cheaper than KO stock and has a lower dividend yield, investors in PepsiCo would have made 3.89% more on their investment than those in Coca-Cola stock, including dividends. Why Has PEP Outperformed KO Stock?The answer here is mixed. In Q2, Coca-Cola grew its EPS 12% over the past year in Q2. PepsiCo's EPS grew 13%.But both companies also measure their earnings on an &quot;organic&quot; basis, which strips out currency effects and other non-comparable distortions. KO's organic EPS was up 6% but PEP had 0% growth.The measure I like to look at is free cash flow (FCF). This is a measure of actual cash flow returns. Based on my analysis, Coca-Cola had an amazing 46.5% increase over the past year. PepsiCo's FCF grew a respectable 35.7%.But even that measure is not a perfect comparison. For example, PEP spent a much larger amount of money on capital expenditures, in both dollar volume and as a percent of sales, than Coca-Cola -- effectively investing for future performance. If the two capex numbers are put on a comparable basis, PepsiCo's FCF growth would be as good as Coca-Cola's.So by some measures, Coca-Cola performed better than PepsiCo, and in others, PepsiCo outperformed. There is no clear winner here.Maybe the difference between the two companies is how they see the future. Future Guidance for the Companies Is Very SimilarKO indicated that its EPS is likely to be -1% to +1% higher in 2019 over 2018. PepsiCo has guided to a 1% lower EPS number for 2019.These are not big differences.  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession In fact, the only real difference I can see between the companies is that that PEP's stock is significantly cheaper than KO's stock valuation. I pointed this out at the beginning of this article. SummaryPEP's stock is cheaper and outperformed KO stock. There is not much difference in their financial performance.I suspect PEP is therefore likely to perform better than KO stock on a total return basis over the next year.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-30,"(Bloomberg) -- China could be the panacea for an orange-juice industry grappling with sliding sales in developed markets, at least for low-cost producers not caught up in trade wars.Citrosuco fits that description. The Brazilian company produces twice as much as the entire Florida industry, at about a third of the cost. For decades, it has sold the commodity to well-known brands in Europe and the U.S. including PepsiCo Inc.’s Tropicana. But in China, local retailing and bottling startups have emerged as the best way to target a new generation of consumers.Chinese demand for fresh juice first surfaced this year, and last week Citrosuco hosted a group of Chinese influencers from industries including food and beverage and fashion to tout its health and sustainability credentials.“We’ve been trying to sell orange juice to China for a decade, without success,” Chief Executive Officer Mario Bavaresco Junior said in a interview from the company’s Matao plant, the world’s largest. “Now, we’re trying to do that in a different way -- not offering the commodity itself anymore but as a product with origin tracked.”Given the vast majority of U.S. orange juice is consumed in North America, the commodity hasn’t been caught up in Washington’s tariff spat with Beijing to anywhere near the same extent as soybeans or cotton. But the trade war has accelerated the process of China opening up to new markets and products, which is of particular benefit to non-U.S. producers.For now, Citrosuco’s Chinese sales are only 10% of what it ships to top customer Europe. But Bavaresco said the company, owned by Brazil’s Fischer and Votorantim groups, is just scratching the surface. “It’s an unimaginable market in terms of size. We just need to figure out how to catch it.”Orange-juice sales in markets such as the U.S. and Europe have been slowing as health-conscious consumers avoid sugary drinks and experiment with new beverage offerings. At the same time, Florida’s orange industry has battled greening disease, which has shrunk growing areas and pushed up costs.Citrosuco, which grows half of the fruit it uses to make juice, says it produces oranges for about $4 a box, compared with Florida’s average cash cost of $14.In addition, ICE Futures prices for orange juice have slumped more than 30% in the past year to the lowest levels in a decade. But producers that sell outside the U.S. are somewhat cushioned from the New York benchmark, with premiums of about $400 a metric ton in bilateral contracts this year, Bavaresco said.While China is potentially the biggest prize for Citrosuco, the company is also looking elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East to boost sales, Bavaresco said.It’s also seeking to adapt to increasing demand for low-calorie food. In partnership with Israeli startup Better Juice, the company aims to develop an enzyme technology capable of reducing as much as 80% of sugar in orange juice. In another venture, it’s looking to supply fiber that can replace part of the fat in hamburgers.&#92;--With assistance from Marvin G.

2019-10-08,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. has joined the charge to make green bonds more mainstream as the soda giant priced its debut sale of the debt.The company offered $1 billion of senior unsecured green securities, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The 30-year bonds will yield 92 basis points above Treasuries, after initially discussing 110 basis points, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. That’s the larger end of its targeted range, and at the lower end of price talk, the person said.Pepsi plans to invest the proceeds in sustainable development goals as defined by the United Nations, including eco-friendly plastics and packaging and cleaner transportation, according to a filing Monday. The packaged food and beverage company already has about $34 billion of debt outstanding, but this is its first green bond.The company’s existing 30-year bonds due 2049 currently trade about 94 basis points wider than similarly dated Treasuries, according to Trace bond price data. CreditSights analysts James Dunn and Ben Morgan said earlier Monday that the new notes would likely price closer to those outstanding, especially given the green attributes of the bonds.‘Fits In’Also working in Pepsi’s favor is that it’s a well-known, highly-rated issuer that’s in the market often and people understand, said Tony Trzcinka, a portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management, which specializes in sustainable finance.“It’s important on the corporate side for most investors that these are benchmark-type issues with seasoned issuers that are investment-grade quality,“ Trzcinka said. “It’s something that fits right in, so it’s a very easy bond to buy.”Investors had placed orders worth as much as $3.65 billion, according to another person with knowledge of the matter. Pepsi had been aiming to sell between $750 million and $1 billion of the bonds, the person said.Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc.managed the deal, with Morgan Stanley serving as green structuring adviser, according to a bond prospectus.Proceeds from the deal are also marked for tree planting and for projects that will improve Pepsi’s operational water-use efficiency, according to a statement Monday. The company said it has named Simon Lowden as its first chief sustainability officer, who had been global foods president.Gaining PopularityGreen bonds are a small fraction of the $5.8 trillion U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market, but increasing in popularity as companies develop initiatives to combat climate change. Over $120 billion worth of green bonds were issued in the first half of 2019, up from $85 billion in the last six months of 2018 according to BloombergNEF.Pepsi’s rival Coca-Cola Co. earlier this year amended a loan issued in June 2015 to include a sustainability element, and both companies have pledged to use more recycled plastic in their bottles over the next decade. Sustainable debt tools like green bonds are a potential way for beverage companies to fund transition activities toward a more environmentally and socially sustainable future, said Daniel Shurey, head of green finance at BloombergNEF.“A key example would be using a green bond to finance the improvement of water and wastewater management, which is a material environmental factor for beverage companies,” Shurey said in an email Monday.(Updates with bond managers in eighth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Michael Gambale and Craig Giammona.To contact the reporters on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.net;Caleb Mutua in New York at dmutua@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Shannon D.

2019-10-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Why should society permit the existence of food companies that contribute to poor health? The standard answer is that people should be allowed to make bad choices about what they eat and drink. But that’s a slippery defense when the consumers are children and the choices they face are loaded against their wellbeing, as Thursday’s British government report on childhood obesity makes clear.The snacks industry — from Mondelez International Inc. to Coca-Cola Co. and from Nestle SA to the Kraft Heinz Company — needs to rethink its purpose, and strategy, if its license to operate is to endure.Former U.K. chief medical officer Professor Sally Davies, the report’s author, cites multiple causes for a saddening rise in obesity among England’s 10-11-year-olds since 1990. The giant food brands are only part of the problem but that hardly absolves them from leading the solution. As Davies says, cheap unhealthy food tends to be the most readily available. Portion inflation is rampant. Advertising or sponsorship is pervasive. Healthy options are often unaffordable for those on low incomes, while the unhealthy options are cheap.Davies’s recommendations include some radical ideas. The U.K. public may be banned from eating and drinking on public transport. Industry faces calorie caps on food portions consumed “out-of-home,” tiered VAT on unhealthy food, plain packaging and the end of tax deductibility of marketing costs for unhealthy products. These may just be proposals. But the direction of travel is clear.This is what happens when an industry fails to self-regulate to mitigate its worst effects. Governments wake up. The food and drink industry is a big employer and a big taxpayer. Even so, the economics favor intervention. The medical costs of obesity, coupled with lost productivity, are 3% of global GDP, according to McKinsey research from 2014. Today’s unhealthy children are tomorrow’s sick workforce.The U.K. Food and Drink Federation, the lobby group, says “punitive action” might hinder continuing the progress the manufacturers have already made in cutting salt, sugar and calories from their products over the last four years. It says the industry must “take the consumer with us.” The question is whether it is taking itself and its customers to an early grave. The industry needs to see this problem as an opportunity not a threat. First, it should be clear about its role in society. Making treats that people want to eat can be a good reason for a corporation to exist, but not when it adds to a public health crisis. This doesn’t mean PepsiCo Inc. ending production of Doritos. But it does mean defining responsibly what the target market — and age group — is for such products. And it requires combining marketing with education.At the same time, food manufacturers should redouble their efforts to innovate healthier, cost-effective alternatives to sugar and salt. This is a chance for the food giants to think about the huge market for healthy snacks. Food technology has a vital role here and it’s best mediated by the private sector. R&D has already helped, as with the development of Nestle’s so-called hollow sugar.This week the OECD proposed reforms to corporate taxation, which would allow governments to tax digital companies that generate revenues in countries where they have no physical presence. The food industry faces a similar revenue challenge. Its products will be subject to extra taxes in certain markets until they start to use their well-funded research labs to help meet national health objectives.It’s not clear that the sector sees obesity as a strategic issue yet. Unilever NV is recycling plastic packaging but still aiming to sell lots more Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. The debate among investors about what stocks to divest centers on fossil fuels right now. If food companies don’t act, they’ll join tobacco and oil in the sin bin.&#92;--With assistance from Lara Williams.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2019-10-11,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) announced its third-quarter results on Oct. 4. They were healthy enough that I've put the beverage and snack food company on my list of seven beverage stocks to buy now. But before I get into the seven names on my list, I thought I'd explain why I'm so high on beverage stocks. The truth is, a lot of interesting stuff is happening in the beverage world at the moment, not the least of which is a fight by traditional beverage makers, non-alcoholic and alcoholic alike, to get into cannabis-infused drinks. The payoff could be enormous for those brands that resonate with the public. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, long-time partnerships seem to be fracturing as larger beverage businesses look to find growth wherever they can. The gloves have come off.Big or small, you've got to have a vision for sustainable growth or you're going to be left in the dust.  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality Here are the seven beverage stocks I believe will do just that. Beverage Stocks to Buy: PepsiCo (PEP)Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com PepsiCo released its Q3 2019 results Oct. 3 and they were very healthy. On the top line, Pepsi had organic growth of 4.3%. In terms of profits, Pepsi generated $2.86 billion in operating profits in the quarter, $11 million higher than the same quarter a year earlier. This is despite PEP spending $2 billion on its business through the first nine months of the year and an estimated $4.5 billion for the entire fiscal year. &quot;While adverse foreign exchange translation negatively impacted reported net revenue performance, organic revenue growth was 4.3% in the quarter,&quot; stated CEO Ramon Laguarta. &quot;We are making good progress against our strategic priorities and our businesses are performing well … Given our performance year-to-date, we now expect to meet or exceed our full-year organic revenue growth target of 4%.&quot;One of the big reasons for its success so far in 2019 are the sales from Bubly, the sparkling water brand it launched in 2018. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, it is taking market share from LaCroix, which saw its sales fall by 14% in the four weeks ended July 14, compared to a 96% increase for Bubly in the same period. Pepsi is investing in the brand and LaCroix is feeling the heat.Over the past year, Bubly has generated more than $170 million in revenue and grabbed 7.7% of the sparkling water market in short order. With free cash flow expected to be $5 billion or more in 2019, look for the company to buy back more than $3 billion of PEP stock.  Canopy Growth (CGC), Constellation Brands (STZ)Source: Shutterstock If you blinked, you probably missed the news Oct. 2, that Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) was buying 72% of BioSteel Sports Nutrition, a company that specializes in sports nutrition and hydration products for high-performance athletes like Dallas Cowboy running back Ezekiel Elliott.  With an option to buy the remaining 28% of BioSteel in the future, I see this acquisition as a no-brainer for the Canadian cannabis company backed by Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). When the news first broke, I was all over the story because, unlike the $600 million Canopy spent on Hiku, BioSteel has &quot;big&quot; written all over it.Not only does Canopy get a beverage and nutrition company that it could grow on its own, separate from its cannabis business, but BioSteel is also a great vehicle to roll out CBD-based products to athletes and non-athletes across North America. The CBD industry is projected to grow to $17.3 billion over the next seven years. Add these drinks to the CBD-infused chewables and chocolates and you've got a recipe for significant revenue generation.   * 10 Winning Stocks to Buy and Stick With for the Long Haul Take Constellation's distribution reach, Canopy's understanding of cannabis and hemp and BioSteel's market leadership, and this investment seems like a slam dunk.  Boston Beer (SAM)Source: LunaseeStudios / Shutterstock.com The good news for owners of Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) stock is that it's up 54% year-to-date through Oct. 8. The bad news is that it was as high as $445 in early September. Not to worry. Just when you think CEO and founder Jim Koch is down and out, he figures out how to keep Boston Beer growing. Are you familiar with White Claw? It's the leading hard seltzer in the U.S., brought to consumers by the same people who sell Mike's Hard Lemonade, and outselling Budweiser and every craft beer in the process.  A fad, you say. Don't tell that to Koch. He's got Truly, the second-place brand in terms of market share at 30%, half White Claw's, but still pretty darn impressive. On Oct. 4, thanks to the company finding the internal capacity to produce Truly in-house instead of using third-party co-packers, UBS Group analyst Sean King upgraded his rating on the stock from $305 to $390. &quot;Truly's stellar growth in fiscal 2019 failed to translate into meaningful earnings growth year-to-date as the company's heavy reliance on co-packers weighed on margins,&quot; King wrote. &quot;We now believe that this headwind will ease into fiscal 2020 with greater internal capacity coming. The extent of vertical integration and outlook for Truly growth will be key determinants of earnings growth for Boston Beer in fiscal 2020.&quot; Here's what I know. I live on Canada's east coast. You can't find either product on store shelves. Down in the U.S., it's estimated that only 20% of restaurants and bars carry White Claw indicating just how much business is still on the table.I see $400 again soon.  Starbucks (SBUX)Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com What would a list of beverage stocks be if it didn't contain the world's biggest coffee company.Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), like Boston Beer, always seems to find a way to reignite growth at precisely the right time, and in doing so, keep the SBUX share price moving higher. In 2019, it's up 34% YTD, including dividends. As if you needed another reason to own SBUX stock, I've come across a real doozie. According to Schaeffer's Investment Research, Starbucks is one of only two S&P 500 stocks that have moved higher in the fourth quarter for 10 consecutive years, averaging a Q4 return of 10.6%.While there are other S&P 500 stocks that have better average returns in the fourth quarter -- Delta (NYSE:DAL) has an average return of 16.6%, delivering positive returns in nine out of the last 10 years -- its consistency is important as we approach the 11th anniversary of the latest bull market. Sure, the company's admission that its 10% growth rate forecast probably won't carry into 2020 due to some one-time, tax-related issues but unless people stop drinking coffee, it will continue to do just fine. Down from its 52-week high of $99.72 reached in July, any future weakness should be met with increased buying.   * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 As beverage stocks go, Starbucks is a must-own.    LVMH (LVMUY)Source: lentamart / Shutterstock.com Most people wouldn't consider luxury goods conglomerate LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) a beverage company. However, given the &quot;MH&quot; in its name stands for Moet-Hennessy, which merged with Louis Vuitton in 1987 to form LVMH, I would beg to differ. If there were a consumer goods company that is too big too fail, I would go with LVMH every day of the week and twice on Sunday. That's why I recommended LVMUY stock in September as part of my article about one-stock portfolios to own.   As I said then, LVMH generates almost $53 billion in annual revenue from more than 70 different brands including makers of wine, champagne, cognac, and whiskey. In the first half of 2019, its Wines & Spirits group generated 6% organic growth, with its cognac and spirits business accounting for 61% of sales and champagne and wine the remaining 39%. Although LVMH believes its Wines & Spirits group is facing a difficult business environment, Hennessey managed to grow volumes by 8% in the first six months of the year thanks to strong sales of its VS and VSOP cognac. It pays to own quality. Molson Coors (TAP)Source: Drew Stephens via FlickrMolson Coors' (NYSE:TAP) Canadian division opened a new brewery in Chilliwack, British Columbia, in September. It was built to replace its Vancouver brewery that was sold in 2015. Three years in the making, it's a $300-million facility located on 36 acres, and employing 100 people. More importantly, it is the company's most modern brewery, that will reduce energy and water use by 20% and 40%, respectively. In terms of capacity, it will be able to brew more beer in a year than all of the craft beer sold in B.C. in its most recent fiscal year. While the recent resignation of Hexo (NYSE:HEXO) CFO Michael Monahan has some worried about the cannabis company's future, MKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk remains bullish about its stock. Kirk rates it a buy with a target price of $9.02. I mention Hexo because it is the company that Molson Coors Canada has partnered with to produce cannabis-infused drinks for the Canadian market. Named Truss Beverages, Molson Coors owns 57.5% with Hexo owning the rest. Molson Coors believes that the Canadian cannabis beverages market could be worth between $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion. With legalization of cannabis-infused drinks to take place on Oct. 17 and allowing for another 60 days to get the appropriate licensing, Truss should have products in stores as early as mid-December.   * 7 Funds to Buy If the Market Turns Sour Molson Coors might be a beverage underdog, but if you can afford to risk a few dollars, its gamble on cannabis that might well pay off handsomely.   Coca-Cola (KO)Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com I didn't want to pick Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) when Pepsi's already on the list but the fact that it's launching its own energy drink in the U.S. makes it noteworthy.Investors already knew about Coca-Cola Energy because the line of drinks has already launched in Spain, Hungary and 25 other markets in Europe and Australia. In addition to Coca-Cola Energy, the lineup includes a zero sugar version, a cherry flavor and a zero sugar cherry offering. Coca-Cola already had a partnership with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) that was signed in 2015 that gave Coke a minority position in the energy drink maker and made Coca-Cola its preferred distribution partner. In addition, Coca-Cola transferred its energy drink assets to Monster and Monster gave Coke its non-energy business. It was a marriage made in heaven until Coke decided it wanted back in the energy drink game. The two parties went to arbitration in October 2018. The arbitration tribunal ruled in July that Coke could continue to sell Coca-Cola Energy because it fell under the Coca-Cola brand name and didn't violate the non-compete clause. Coca-Cola has brought a number of interesting products in the past year and Coca-Cola Energy is certainly one of them. Add to this its entry into the coffee market through Costa Coffee and its growth engine might rev up its share price. At the time of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- United Parcel Service Inc. is offering everything to investors that FedEx Corp. isn’t, and that’s still seemingly not enough.The package-delivery company on Tuesday reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and maintained its full-year profit outlook. That’s a sharp contrast to FedEx’s bruising guidance cut just over a month ago, which the company blamed on a weakening global economy, and analysts blamed on idiosyncratic foot faults. UPS is trimming its capital expenditure budget by $500 million this year and next year, which will help boost its 2019 free cash flow to more than $4 billion. FedEx, meanwhile, is on track to burn cash in fiscal 2020 and Moody’s Investors Service Inc. recently lowered its outlook for the company’s credit rating. Management’s decision to nevertheless leave its $5.9 billion spending budget intact has left investors scratching their heads — particularly because the billions it has spent so far don’t appear to be yielding results.UPS on Tuesday reported another quarterly improvement in its adjusted operating margin, a sign that its own push to invest in newer planes and automated systems is paying off as it manages a deluge of less profitable e-commerce shipments. And yet, the stock fell more than 4% in early trading. The problem is, as much as UPS is widening the execution gap between itself and FedEx, it can’t escape the weakening macroeconomic backdrop.Revenue in the third quarter was marginally weaker than analysts had been expecting, and UPS warned that its profit guidance was contingent on “no further deterioration” in global trade uncertainty or U.S. industrial weakness. No one really knows what’s going to happen with trade relations. President Donald Trump signaled this week that negotiations over a partial deal with China are progressing and could lead to a signed agreement by November, but there’s little indication that the existing tariffs will be rolled back. I, for one, wouldn’t be willing to bet against a further slowdown in manufacturing, given declining shipment volumes at the railroads in the third quarter and decelerating sales growth at the likes of industrial distributor Fastenal Co.Drilling down into UPS’s results, there’s a variety of other nitpick items that take on more importance in a weaker economy. For example, while unit costs improved by 2.5% on an adjusted basis in the U.S. domestic division, the average amount of revenue UPS collected per package in that business declined by about 1%. The third quarter brought a surge in volumes, with FedEx’s decision to stop carrying packages for Amazon.com Inc. in the U.S. likely driving more of the e-commerce giant’s packages to UPS. A weakening yield will raise questions about how profitable that business can ultimately be for UPS, and whether it made the right decision by sticking with a customer that’s also increasingly a competitor.Adding to the jitters, UPS also announced on Tuesday that Jim Barber, chief operating officer and the heir apparent to CEO David Abney, was stepping down. Barber’s departure is a surprise, and it’s always going to raise eyebrows when a leadership change is announced without the simultaneous appointment of a successor. That being said, Abney has made an effort to shake up UPS’s staid culture by bringing in more executives from the outside. Earlier this year, UPS hired a PepsiCo Inc. executive, Brian Newman, to be its chief financial officer. Abney hired his chief transformation officer from Walmart Inc., his chief marketing officer from Xerox Corp. and his supply-chain solutions leader from logistics company DB Schenker. So the departure of Barber, a nearly 35-year veteran, would seem to be setting up an appointment in a similar vein. Grooming an outsider to succeed Abney would further differentiate UPS from FedEx, which is still run by founder Fred Smith and whose top executives have all been there for decades and act like it.UPS is moving in the right direction, even if the economy isn’t.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-10-23,"As the market gets crazy, boring tends to beat exciting as investors rush to safety. And you can't get more boring than ranch dressing, toilet paper and toothpaste. It's the reason why consumer staples stocks have been on fire over the last year. As political turmoil, slowing growth and other issues have made for a volatile market, many investors have found solace in consumer staples stocks. After all, people still need to brush their teeth and eat even if the economy is trending lower.To that end, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP) has had a banner year -- returning more than 20% year-to-date. And some individual consumer staples stocks have done even better than the benchmark exchange-traded fund.Perhaps the best part is, as the uncertainty continues to grow, consumer staples stocks have even more appeal for investors. For one thing, many consumer stocks fit the definition of &quot;quality&quot; and have strong stable earnings. Secondly, they tend to be dividend-paying stocks and those dividends can provide a nice cushion during periods of market malaise.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a result, many consumer staples stocks are perfect for retirees or conservative investors. So, which consumer stocks make sense today? Here are three that should find a home in your conservative portfolio. Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy: PepsiCo (PEP)Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.8%One of the best things about consumer staples stocks is that the top leaders really don't need any introductions. And that's what we have with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The soft drink and snack-food giant is as American as apple pie with its products finding its way in our fridges and kitchen cupboards. With some of the biggest brands under its umbrella -- such as Mountain Dew, Cheetos and Doritos -- PEP has become a cash flow and profit machine over the years. Last quarter alone, PepsiCo managed to see sales grow by over 4.3% and management is looking to score 4%-6% organic growth over the full year.The reason why PEP has been able to keep that growth coming comes down to its evolving product mix.The firm has been smart in its strategy to move with the times. Sugary sodas are out as consumers have switched to more natural and healthy snacks. For PEP, that's meant a shift towards teas, juices and other healthy snack foods. Key acquisitions of Sabra Hummus and Stacy's Pita Chips brands are just some examples. Additionally, PEP has found great success with sparkling water. Its Bubbly brand continues to win over consumers -- and the best part is that sparkling water comes with very high margins.PEP should be able to boost the growth even further. As it hooks millennials with its healthy and organic snacks, it's courting their children as well. According to Piper Jaffray's latest &quot;Taking Stock With Teens&quot; survey, Gen Z overwhelmingly prefers PEP's brands across several categories.In the end, PepsiCo offers a huge stable of winning brands, cash flows and a growing dividend. It's exactly what conservative investors would want in a consumer staples stock. Church & Dwight (CHD)Source: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.2%The power of consumer staples stocks lies within their ability to survive recessionary environments. The key is that daily activities still need to happen. Teeth need to be brushed and our clothes need to be washed. But what we use to do those processes can and does change during poor economic health. And that's where Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) can shine.While Church & Dwight's corporate name might not be as well-known as other consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), its products certainly are. They include Arm & Hammer baking soda, OxiClean stain-fighting solutions and Trojan condoms. The win for CHD is that many of its brands don't fall under the premium pricing umbrella. A large bottle of Tide goes for around $17 in my area. The similar-sized Arm & Hammer bottle is only about $10. Last recession, CHD benefited as many consumers migrated down to its lower-priced products. The best part is many stayed there after their fortunes changed during the recovery.Organic sales growth at the firm has managed to grow at a 3.6% annual rate over the last decade. And thanks to strong cost controls and buybacks, earnings have grown by about 8% per year in that time.Meanwhile, the firm continues to find other ways to grow. CHD has smartly used mergers and acquisitions to grow its portfolio and it's become a huge seller on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), partnering with the retailer to boost e-commerce and subscription sales.In the end, Church & Dwight isn't as big as many of its rivals, but it does offer a chance to gain growth and stability among the consumer staples stocks. Costco (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 0.9%There's no secret that AMZN and e-commerce are disrupting the model for many retailers. But for those stores that have cult-like followings and offer something different, the times continue to boom. This includes warehouse club Costco (NASDAQ:COST).Shopping at COST is quite frankly an event. Sure, there's the bulk offerings, but there's also plenty of one-time or limited deals, specialty products and its signature Kirkland brand. You literally can get everything from diamond rings to snow tires. And consumers continue to pay some big bucks to be able to access all those deals. COST memberships clock in at about 98.5 million worldwide and even better is that the current membership renewal rate is about 90%.This creates a stable and predictable base of cash flows for COST. We're talking $3.4 billion in fee revenue alone. That's also perfect for conservative investors.Thanks to rising sales and those hefty fees, COST has become a dividend machine. Since 2004, Costco has raised its payout by 540%. Even better is that COST has a history of paying special dividends to its investors. With cash on its balance sheet growing and management hinting at the cash in their &quot;back pocket,&quot; another payout could be on the way.For conservative investors, COST's level of cash generation can't be beaten in the consumer staples sector.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt was long AMZN stock.

2019-11-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Over the past four decades, consumers around the world have chugged trillions of bottles of water from brands such as Perrier, Evian, Dasani, and Aquafina. Few realize that most of what they pay for is plastic and time on a truck. Companies typically get the water for free or just a nominal fee, and bottling the stuff and getting it to consumers—as well as advertising it—accounts for the bulk of their costs.Today, increasing concern about the carbon and plastic waste generated by that process is fueling a backlash that threatens the business. Across the industry, sales are softening and some towns are even banning plastic water bottles—spurring producers to respond with alternatives ranging from canned water to flavor pods for tap water to dispensers that sell sparkling and flavored mixes.“The waters business has to cope with a number of sustainability issues that are becoming increasingly important,” Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider told analysts in October.Until the 1970s, bottled water was mostly sold in limited areas by European companies that tapped springs in the Alps. Then in 1973, DuPont patented PET plastic bottles, which were cheaper, lighter, and stronger than the glass that had been the industry standard. Combined with the rapidly globalizing economy, PET allowed water sellers to ship their wares much farther, opening up new markets. Bottlers sprung up in just about every country and the likes of Nestle, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo added water to their portfolios, helping boost global revenue in the business to $130 billion last year, according to researcher Euromonitor.These days, things aren’t quite so bubbly as consumers grow increasingly aware of their carbon footprint. Danone, the maker of Evian, on Oct. 18 reported its biggest decline in quarterly water revenue in a decade. That same day, Coca-Cola Co. said water sales were lower than it expected.With shipments headed for a second annual decline, Nestle is reorganizing its bottled water business. Buffeted by lower-price rivals and high transport costs, Nestle raised prices—which sapped sales of its mass-market offerings such as Poland Spring and Pure Life as consumers shifted to cheaper generic brands. CEO Schneider has said the company wants to focus instead on higher-end products such as flavored and sparkling waters like its Perrier and San Pellegrino brands.More than 80 U.S. colleges and a handful of municipalities have restricted sales of bottled water. In Concord, Mass., it’s illegal to sell still water in small plastic bottles, and San Francisco bars such sales on city property. In the U.K., a non-profit called City to Sea has introduced an app that points thirsty users to places where they can get free water—with a pledge from chains such as Starbucks and Costa to refill bottles at no cost.“Producers face a real risk from the environmental movement, which has strong support among young people,” says Alain Oberhuber, an analyst at Mainfirst Bank, who predicts a sharp decline in sales of bottled water over the next two decades. “They know they have to do something.”With bottled water now outselling carbonated soft drinks in the U.S., one part of that “something” is aluminum cans filled with water. Coke introduced cans of Dasani in the northeast U.S. this year and plans to try selling it in aluminum bottles in 2020. Pepsi has been selling canned Aquafina at restaurants and stadiums and is testing it in stores. And Danone is trying the idea with local brands in Britain, Denmark, and Poland.The soda giants are also seeking to monetize consumption of tap water. Pepsi last year paid more than $3 billion for SodaStream, which produces systems for making fizzy water at home. And Pepsi has introduced a brand called Drinkfinity, which sells pods that attach to reusable bottles to infuse tap water with caffeine, vitamins, or electrolytes in a variety of flavors.  Coke is rolling out a water dispenser it calls Dasani PureFill, which allows consumers to refill their bottles with free filtered water and gives the option of adding flavors or carbonation for about $1 for a 20-ounce bottle. The company is planning to test the idea—and various prices—at roughly 100 locations such as offices, hospitals, and colleges.Nestle next year plans to introduce a dispenser it calls Refill Plus, which filters tap water and can add flavors and varying levels of carbonation,  and it’s working on a paper-based bottle that it says is fully biodegradable. Danone is exploring refill stations but for now is focusing on the home market with a new device that dispenses Evian delivered in balloon-like spheres that use less plastic than bottles.Producers are counting on such initiatives to appeal to consumers who consider branded water healthier than tap. Howard Telford, head of soft drinks at Euromonitor, says such efforts will have only a marginal effect on the industry’s carbon footprint. But he says adding extras such as flavorings and fizz may help shore up profits for the likes of Coke, Nestle, and Pepsi.“It points to a future,” Telford says, “where flavor, carbonation, and functional additives—rather than disposable packaging and simple convenience—could be the main value drivers in packaged water.”To contact the authors of this story: Thomas Mulier in Geneva at tmulier@bloomberg.netCorinne Gretler in Zurich at cgretler1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rocks at drocks1@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Bottlers Want to Profit From Your Tap Water

2019-11-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Global investor enthusiasm for saving the planet has helped spur record issuance of green bonds. It’s also driving a surge in third-party verification that proceeds from the debt sales are actually destined for environmentally friendly projects, as fears of “greenwashing” mount.There have been about 480 green bonds issued by companies and governments so far this year with some form of assurance, a record high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s about 80% of all the green debt sold, and PepsiCo Inc. and Starbucks Corp. are among those paying independent reviewers for certification.“If we say something is sustainable, when our clients look under the hood it has to live up to that reputation,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, which buys green bonds. Asset managers are concerned about lack of definition of what’s truly green, Haefele -- whose firm manages $2.5 trillion in assets -- said in an interview.Borrowers don’t have to prove proceeds will be used for a particular purpose, though second opinions can help sell bonds at a time when issuance is surging. Companies and governments typically align offerings with green bond principles and standards endorsed by the International Capital Market Association and Climate Bonds Initiative. But misleading claims about environmental benefits of projects are on the rise, making assurance and second opinions increasingly important to investors.“It really comes down to credibility,” said Heather Lang, executive director of sustainable finance solutions at Sustainalytics, which sells second opinions to green bond issuers. “Borrowers want to ensure the frameworks they put in place focusing on the green use of proceeds are aligned with global guidelines,” she said in a phone interview.Sustainalytics issued 35% more second-party opinions for green bonds in the third-quarter of this year compared to the same period a year ago. That included a 20-page opinion on Verizon’s green bond framework before the phone giant sold $1 billion in green bonds in February.The benefit of getting the second party opinion outweighed the cost, according to Kee Chan Sin, Verizon’s assistant treasurer.“It’s important to tie the green bond back to Verizon’s commitment to certain things like renewable energy and carbon neutral,” said Sin in a phone interview. “For some companies it might be expensive but for us it is money well spent.”What’s Green?Borrowers are taking advantage of the varying interpretations of green finance. Spanish refiner Repsol SA became the first major oil company to sell green bonds when it raised 500 million euros ($559 million) to help cut greenhouse-gas emissions and make its facilities more efficient in May 2017. That raised greenwashing concerns and led the Climate Bonds Initiative to exclude the debt from its database.Pepsi’s $1 billion green bonds -- marked for projects like sustainable plastics and packaging -- may be excluded from the Climate Bonds Initiative database if the company doesn’t provide more information on plastics. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, also provides a green bond classification.Some borrowers are going a step further and asking auditors to review the use and management of proceeds, as well as reporting after the bond is issued. Assurance that funds raised are being allocated to the right projects could help the market grow, said Kristen Sullivan, sustainability and KPI services leader at Deloitte, which provides assurance to green bond issuers.Some investors are also doing their own audits.Large bond funds like Nuveen, which manages over $11 billion in responsible investing fixed-income strategies, are coming up with their own guidelines for identifying green bonds. The fund opted not to buy Verizon’s green debt because of “concerns around the lack of clarity on impact reporting and potential inclusion of 5G,” said Jessica Zarzycki, a co-manager of responsible investing fixed-income strategies at Nuveen.“You have to make sure what the issuer is promising is really what you are getting and everybody needs to do their homework,” said Zarzycki in a phone interview. “We’ve seen bonds that are labeled green and have second-party opinions where they don’t fit typically to our framework.”&#92;--With assistance from Olivia Whalen, Bloomberg Global Data.To contact the reporter on this story: Caleb Mutua in New York at dmutua@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, James Crombie, Allan LopezFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Green Bonds Get Rubber-Stamped as Investors Question the Label

2019-11-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. plans to launch a new supermarket brand distinct from the Whole Foods Market chain the company acquired two years ago, a sign of the retail giant’s hunger for a slice of the grocery market beyond high-end organic food.The company has posted four job listings for “Amazon’s first grocery store” in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. An Amazon spokeswoman confirmed the listings, and said the store would open in 2020. The brand will be distinct from Whole Foods and will have a conventional checkout line, unlike the cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores, she said. Amazon’s plans for the store were reported earlier by CNET.The e-commerce company purchased Whole Foods in a splashy $13.7 billion deal two years ago, but has yet to make much headway in the $900 billion U.S. grocery industry. The Whole Foods brand, finicky about what is allowed on store shelves based on its healthy image, clashes with Amazon’s desire to give customers whatever they want. Amazon rival Walmart Inc., which captures about 25% of all U.S. grocery spending, sells items such as Pepsi and Cheetos that shoppers can’t find at Whole Foods. Grocery industry analysts have speculated that Amazon might branch out with a new store where such products won’t be seen as betrayal to the brand.Online grocery shoppers prefer in-store pickup options to home delivery by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, and Amazon needs more stores to meet that growing demand, said David Bishop, a partner with research firm Brick Meets Click. In-store pickup requires more stores closer to shoppers -- about 3 to 5 miles from their homes -- than grocery delivery services, he said.“The reason Amazon needs to expand its physical footprint is an accelerated demand for grocery pickup service as opposed to delivery,” he said. “Shoppers have a greater sense of control when they pick up their groceries at the store in a secure location rather than worrying about it being left at their house.”Amazon’s sales from physical stores, the vast majority of which are purchases at Whole Foods stores, declined 1.3% from a year earlier to $4.19 billion in the third quarter. Amazon said the total doesn’t include online sales from Whole Foods, but the Seattle-based company doesn’t break out that figure.Woodland Hills is an upscale suburban neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Amazon planned to open dozens of grocery stores under a new brand, starting with an outpost in Los Angeles.(Updates with analyst’s comment in fifth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.net;Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Confirms Plans for Store Under New Grocery Brand

2019-11-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. should increase the racial diversity of its board, a group of U.S. lawmakers said, putting a spotlight on the company’s hiring and management practices.“The fact that African Americans make up 13% and Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the U.S. population but 0% of Oracle’s board and leadership team is inexcusable,” the lawmakers said in a Nov. 22 letter from the House Tech Accountability Caucus and Tri-Caucus, which includes the Black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific American caucuses.It’s the latest call for the second-largest software maker and billionaire Chairman Larry Ellison to improve diversity and inclusion. Former employees and the U.S. government have sued the Redwood City, California-based company, alleging it systematically underpaid women and people of color, and many shareholders have supported repeated requests that the board examine if there’s a pay gap between male and female employees.It’s at least the second time this year that Oracle has attracted congressional scrutiny for its diversity practices. In January, the Congressional Black Caucus and House Tech Accountability Caucus wrote to the company expressing dismay about allegations of pay discrimination.This week’s letter was signed by Democrats Robin L. Kelly, Joaquin Castro, Karen Bass and Judy Chu, who chair the various House caucuses, as well as other lawmakers.Amazon, FacebookThe Tech Accountability Caucus previously criticized Amazon.com Inc. for its tepid record of appointing people of color to its board, and Facebook Inc. for allowing marketers to use ethnic affinity to target ads for housing, employment or credit.Amazon has since adopted a policy pledging to consider a diverse slate of candidates for open board seats and added Starbucks Corp. operating chief Rosalind Brewer and former PepsiCo Inc. Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi as directors. In 2016, Facebook updated its policy to disable ethnic targeting for certain ads.“We respectfully request a prompt response from Oracle Corporation regarding our diversity concerns,” the lawmakers wrote. They requested a briefing with the company to discuss the issue, but said it would also accept a written response within 14 days, or a phone call.Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment.In a February response to the earlier congressional letter, the company said it wouldn’t “intentionally discriminate against women and people of color” and was committed to a diverse, nondiscriminatory work culture, according to the lawmakers.Short-ChangedOracle is also contending with a January lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor, which alleged the company short-changed female and minority workers some $400 million in wages.The allegations stem from a 2014 audit by a department unit that enforces equal pay and other non-discrimination matters for federal contractors. Records show that Oracle paid women and minority employees less than others and steered them into lower-level jobs, the department said in court papers. It also alleged that Oracle used H-1B visas to hire scores of Asians and paid them less than employees who were U.S. citizens.In 2017, three female engineers sued Oracle, alleging underpayment compared with male engineers doing the same tasks. An analysis conducted on behalf of the plaintiffs showed the company paid some women about $13,000 less per year on average versus male counterparts. They’re seeking to represent more than 4,000 similarly situated employees.Oracle has denied the allegations in both cases.For three straight years, shareholder Pax World Funds has filed proposals asking the company’s board to identify whether a gender pay gap exists and how to fix it. The proposals have been supported by several large investors, including funds held by BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., but failed to garner majority support. That’s largely because Ellison, who owns about a third of the stock, has opposed the measure.(Updates with shareholder proposal in third paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.net;Anders Melin in New York at amelin3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Peter EichenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle’s Largely White Board Draws Congressional Scrutiny

2019-11-27,"Twitter stock (NYSE:TWTR) has fallen out of favor. Part of this is the general &quot;bah humbug&quot; vibe that investors are giving to all social media stocks. And part of it stems from the social media company delivering a weak earnings report back in October. Not only did the company miss on earnings, but they lowered their guidance for the fourth quarter.Source: Worawee Meepian / Shutterstock.com Some analysts are suggesting that TWTR stock has now reached the oversold state. But with upward momentum only suggesting a gain of around 9% from current levels, TWTR seems like a short-term trade instead of a long-term investment.That being said, 330 million monthly active users (MAUs) give Twitter an appeal to advertisers. And since that's where Twitter makes their money, it's hard to ignore. Particularly since it is seen by users as being &quot;the least bad&quot; option among social media channels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut if you're thinking about buying low on Twitter stock, here are a couple of things to consider. Active Users Do Not Equate to Brand LoyaltyBrand loyalty is about choosing one brand at the expense of another. For example, there are many people who will choose to drink (and buy) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) products at the expense of Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) products and vice versa.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Are Bargains Right Now Social media is not like that. Twitter can boast of 330 million MAUs and 134 million daily active users (DAUs). However, the vast majority of those users are not choosing Twitter at the exclusion of other social media outlets.Many users, for example, may use Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to communicate with family and close friends. LinkedIn, which was acquired by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), is for professional use. Twitter lacks the same real or perceived niche. In many cases, users see it as a news outlet, but even there it isn't the only form of social media users are engaging with.A more interesting number would be how many unique eyeballs Twitter captures. I imagine that number would be much smaller. Purchase Intent Does Not Mean an Actual PurchaseBusinesses that market on Twitter have come to rely heavily on influencers. Influencers are individuals who have the ability to affect how users perceive brands or ideas in an online community. A 2016 study by Twitter and Annalect found that Twitter users reported an increase in purchase intent of over five times when they were exposed to promotional content from influencers.I've mentioned my marketing background in the past. Many excited marketing managers have shown me research results in which their brand scored high on &quot;purchase intent.&quot;However sound the methodology is for defining purchase intention, it is, at best, a hypothesis. For example, in a study about cars, marketers may ask you &quot;when do you intend to purchase a car?&quot; I could say I intend to purchase a car in the next 12 months. It doesn't mean I'm going to purchase a car at all.In fairness, Twitter does have a more recent statistic that cites 40% of users have purchased an item after seeing it advertised on Twitter. Twitter Gave Up Its Unique Selling PropositionWhen Twitter first hit the social media scene, its defining characteristic was a 140-character limit. The idea was that users had a short attention span so give them what they want. Many users liked that feature about Twitter (and many users still do adhere to the smaller character limit).However, marketers found it limiting. So, Twitter upped the character count to 280. In doing so, it's become hard to tell the difference between a tweet and a Facebook or Instagram post. The lines have been blurred. Which takes me back to my statement about Twitter and brand loyalty. Users are clearly seeing Twitter as one of many options. And that means they're not unique.Being unique is essential for a channel like Twitter. As I mentioned above, LinkedIn has the benefit of being utilitarian. If nothing else, people are using it to network and look for jobs. Facebook has sheer volume going for it. Twitter has neither.I know there are several marketers that would disagree with me on this point. Many would say that expanding their character limit helped Twitter grow its user base. That's fair. But the argument I made earlier is that the vast majority of Twitter users are not unique to Twitter. Social Media Is the New NormalAs much as it may seem like I'm banging on Twitter, I use Twitter quite frequently. That doesn't mean I see TWTR stock as a good investment. I have a hard time seeing the long-term value in social media stocks in general. The emergence of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) with their Snapchat app, along with TikTok is making a crowded space more crowded.At some point, like the streaming wars, I believe users will have to pick and choose which accounts they stay actively engaged with. And that's why you have to look beyond the numbers before deciding if Twitter stock is a good investment. It's not for me.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Growing up in the U.K. in the 1980s, the Christmas season was associated with particular foods and drinks. Pies made from fruit “mincemeat”; the same dried fruits cooked into Christmas pudding; grandparents passing round glasses of sherry.Believe it or not, that nostalgic memory hints at a long-term risk to the most bullish corner of the global liquor market: China’s sorghum-based firewater, baijiu.The past few years have seen extraordinary growth for baijiu makers. Kweichow Moutai Co., the maker of the most prestigious brand, overtook Diageo Plc to become the world’s biggest distiller by market capitalization in 2017. Now it’s in a whole other league, overtaking even Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and PepsiCo Inc. on that measure and within spitting distance of taking Coca-Cola Co.’s crown as the world’s largest beverage company.What’s more, this success has been built on the back not of a valuation bubble, but of relatively pedestrian assumptions about earnings.

Luzhou Laojiao Co. is cheaper on that measure than any major western distiller.What could possibly put a cloud on the horizon of this thriving market? The most serious looming risk is embodied in those nostalgic memories of a British Christmas: demographics.Throughout baijiu’s boom, it’s struggled to shake the perception that it’s primarily a drink for older men. Its former image as an unofficial currency of corrupt government officials has receded since a campaign against official graft in the early years of President Xi Jinping’s reign. Still, the connotations of rich older men exchanging drunken toasts remain, even if the drinkers in the stereotype are now more likely to be employed in the private than the public sector.“Many young people still think that baijiu isn't for them, that no matter the flavor, it's not a drink for the young,” according to a China Daily article this year. “Drinking baijiu is increasingly seen as a dated behavior by younger Chinese uninterested in banquets and bravado,” wrote Jing Daily, a site specializing in the Chinese luxury market.That association with oldsters is a problem Spain’s sherry industry has been enduring for several decades. In the 1970s and 1980s, exports to the U.K., the Netherlands and the U.S. boomed in an unprecedented manner, to the point that bodega conglomerate Rumasa was reported to account for as much as 2% of Spanish GDP.Since then it’s been in long-term decline. Sherry’s core consumers outside Spain have reached a more abstemious age or died out, while younger drinkers shun a product they associate with their grandparents. For all that many wine connoisseurs sing its praises and lament sherry’s fall from grace, it’s hard to see the glory days returning.This trajectory is a common one in the alcohol business, which lives and dies on the changing demographics of its consumers. One reason Japan’s brewers have been so desperate to acquire overseas businesses while Vietnamese ones have been M&A targets is that beer is drunk by thirsty workers, and Japan’s labor force is declining while Vietnam’s is rising. The same goes for clear spirits like baijiu. Its success is hard to separate from the fact that China’s population of men aged 40 to 60 increased by more than half over the past two decades, adding about 78 million people to the core baijiu-drinking market. That demographic is set to stagnate over the coming decade, though, before beginning an accelerating decline after 2030.To the extent that the industry is making any inroads with women and younger people, it’s in lower-cost, lighter-flavored “rice aroma” products where margins are tighter. The giant listed baijiu-makers specialize in the complex, higher-cost “sauce aroma” and “strong aroma” varieties such as Maotai and Luzhou Laojiao, which is quite a different product.This needn’t be the end of the world. The drinks market’s best defense against unfavorable demographics is “premiumization” — counting not on a larger number of consumers, but a small group paying more and more. Premiumization is already the strategy of the high-end listed baijiu companies, so there's no reason they can’t keep going with it.Still, chasing the luxury market is notoriously expensive in marketing terms, and baijiu makers for years have been able to rely on a product that sells itself.Major distillers typically dedicate a third or more of their revenue to selling, general and administrative costs — mostly marketing and distribution. Baijiu makers are far more thrifty, one reason their profit margins are so much fatter than those of peers. As their core demographic ages out of its drinking habit, though, they’re likely to have to spend more and more converting younger drinkers.Every cellar manager knows that liquors can get better with age, but the process of maturation has to be carefully monitored and cultivated if the precious drink isn’t to turn into drain-cleaner. Marketing departments of baijiu companies will have to be no less careful over the coming decades maintaining the shine on their storied brands. To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-01-17,"When it comes to Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), I'm on the fence. While I like the idea that Uber (NYSE:UBER) has a major competitor in North America to keep prices low, it's terrible if you want to make money off Lyft stock.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn December, I stated that Lyft's pathway to profitability is best achieved by raising prices. This wasn't an original idea, mind you. It came from Barclays Capital's analysis of ride-hailing trips in New York City. Although this theory provided a glimmer of hope, I wanted nothing to do with it or Uber. The fact analysts have been reasonably positive about both stocks in 2020, be damned.  What's There to Like About Lyft Stock?First, I often repeat the wise words of Canadian billionaire money manager Stephen Jarislowsky in my articles about recent IPOs because they are spot on.&quot;New issues are typically well promoted,&quot; wrote Jarislowsky in his 2005 book, The Investment Zoo. &quot;My experience is that you can buy nine out of 10 new issues at a lower price a year or two later … I generally avoid new issues….&quot;Here we sit, 10 months after Lyft's IPO, and its stock price is down 40% through Jan. 16. That provides interested investors with a much cheaper entry point.A second point to make is that even analysts such as Bernstein's Mark Shmulik, who's got a target price of $48 on Lyft stock (it's at $47 as I write this), admits Lyft's got some things going for it. &quot;The good news is that they operate in a market that appears to be rationalizing, which helps drive bottom-line margin improvement&quot; Shmulik wrote in a Jan. 8 note to clients. &quot;… Our revenue forecast remains steady at 26% Y/Y in-line with consensus.&quot;Finally, InvestorPlace's Brad Moon recently stated that out of 37 analysts, 23 rate Lyft a buy with a median target price of $70, providing investors with potential upside of 49%. In a year in which many experts expect the markets to tread water, an almost 50% return is very enticing. However, with profitability not expected until at least 2021, Lyft has got to execute at a very high level. I don't see that the risks are worth it. Instead, I would argue that if you did a screen of U.S. stocks with a market capitalization of $2 billion or higher, my guess is that those trading directly above and below Lyft stock in terms of share price would present a better investment opportunity. This time next year, I'll be sure to let readers know if I was right.  This Drink Maker Had a Tough 2019National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ), the maker of LaCroix sparkling water, lost almost 30% of its value in 2019. It now trades for about a third of its all-time high hit in September 2017.First, here's the good news. On Dec. 6, National Beverage reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents, 2 cents higher than the consensus estimate. FIZZ stock gained 12% on the news. The company noted that its November orders were ahead of the same period a year earlier. And its new Hi-Biscus flavor for LaCroix drink was flying off the shelves. The bad news is that the company got hit with a lawsuit last June that alleged LaCroix sparkling water isn't nearly as good for you as the company claims. It's because of this lawsuit and PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) commitment to spend more on Bubly, its sparkling water brand, that investors are lining up to short its stock.If I had to bet my last $5, I'd probably go with FIZZ because it makes money. The Tree House RocksThe stock directly below Lyft on my screen is TreeHouse Foods (NYSE:THS), a leading manufacturer of private-label packaged foods and beverages. It might not be a glamorous business, but it helps keep grocery-store brands on the shelves. On Jan. 13, TreeHouse announced that its deal to sell its ready-to-eat cereal business to Post Holdings (NYSE:POST) was terminated due to opposition from the Federal Trade Commission. As a result, the company will put the business up for sale once more, looking for a buyer that's not already heavily involved in the RTE cereal business. Going back to the drawing board is never a good thing. But that's business. Eventually, TreeHouse will find a suitable buyer. In the meantime, it expects to generate revenues and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2019 of $4.3 billion and $2.30 a share, respectively. Down 20% over the past 52 weeks, TreeHouse's valuation is cheaper than it's been in five years. It's not risk free, mind you, but it won't be nearly as volatile as Lyft in 2020.Ultimately, both of these alternatives aren't nearly as sexy as Lyft stock -- but who cares? All you should care about is making money over the long haul.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s not easy being green. Not as a bond issuer, a fixed-income fund manager or as an individual investor. Sure, there are Green Bond Principles for governments and companies, but they’re voluntary guidelines, which helps explain why just $271 billion of the $465 billion in global “sustainable debt” issued last year was defined as green, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. For mutual funds, the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Global Green Bond Index is one of the best approximations of the market, but it has just 457 members, less than one-fourth the number in the U.S. high-yield index, making it difficult to track and heavily weighted to a few European countries.To top it off, investors interested in climate-related investing have to wrap their heads around socially responsible investing, or SRI, and how it differs from ESG, which attempts to identify leaders in environmental, social and governance policies. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Nir Kaissar recently wrote about the two camps. Suffice to say, it can all be enough for the average investor to give up and just go with the highest-returning option, values be damned.Perhaps that’s why many of the biggest fixed-income funds that are considered some form of “green”(1)choose to simplify matters. Among the five with more than $1 billion of assets, four consider the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (or a subset of it) as their benchmark. That pits them against competitors like the $200 billion Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, the $13.2 billion Guggenheim Total Return Bond Fund and the $13 billion DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund, among more than 100 others.“The main misperception of this space is you sacrifice performance,” said Stephen Liberatore, head of Nuveen’s responsible fixed-income strategy team and manager of the $4.7 billion TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond Fund, the largest such portfolio as measured by Morningstar Inc. Showing that an ESG fund can beat the aggregate index and “a true core fixed-income peer group, not an ESG impact peer group, is what changes people’s minds over time.”Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total Return ESG Fund, with $1.5 billion in assets, is handled in much the same way. “There’s no reason for there to be a difference in macro-risk factors in the ESG version” compared with the traditional total return option, said Scott Mather, chief investment officer of U.S. core strategies. “What’s different is how we go about composing the line items, how we populate the portfolio with individual bonds.”What was evident after speaking with these fund managers is that the investing world is rushing to cater to a population of investors that I’d call the “green-curious.” That is to say, people who want to feel as if they’re making a difference with their money but aren’t willing to accept significantly higher volatility or fees to do so.Consider, for example, that some of the biggest single holdings in ESG fixed-income funds are U.S. Treasuries. To green-bond purists, that decision would seem questionable at best, given that President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord on climate change, among other things. Debt issued by countries from France to Chile to Korea has been earmarked specifically for sustainable projects. Treasuries, by contrast, are broadly sold to finance the nation’s budget deficit, projected to top $1 trillion this fiscal year.The counterargument is that without some exposure to the biggest and most-liquid bond market in the world, it would be tougher to track the aggregate benchmark and raise cash when needed. Plus, so far in 2020, Treasuries have been a winner: The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Index gained 2.4% in January, beating both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds as well as the S&P 500 Index.This will probably be the norm, at least until the sustainable-bond market in the U.S. matures. It’s true that 2019 marked new entrants, like PepsiCo Inc.’s inaugural $1 billion green-bond deal and Verizon Communications Inc.’s first-ever green bond, also for $1 billion. But that’s hardly enough to tip the scales. America still lags behind the rest of the world in adapting to interest in green investing mandates: Overall, just 9.6% of the green-bond index is from the U.S., compared with 39.4% for the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate index, by far the largest weighting in the $57.8 trillion benchmark.It’s worth noting that when it comes to climate change, the Federal Reserve has long stayed in its lane while the European Central Bank has swerved. ECB President Christine Lagarde said last month that climate change must be thoroughly debated among monetary policy makers and that even “green quantitative easing” could be an option. There’s a “danger of doing nothing. Failing to try is already failing,” she said.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in the question-and-answer segment of his press conference last week, said that the central bank would probably sign on to the Network for Greening the Financial System “at some point.” He said that it falls within the central bank’s purview to make sure the financial system is resilient to any climate risks, “but not the overall response of society to climate change. That’s not us.” For those U.S. bond investors who want something closer to a pure green fund than the big ESG options, Pimco started its Climate Bond Fund (ticker PCEIX) in December. It considers the dollar-hedged green-bond index its benchmark and has $5 million in assets  — a modest sum for a firm that oversees almost $2 trillion. Mather said he expects the fund to grow like others at Pimco, ideally quickly scaling up to the $50 million to $100 million range that he considers optimal for efficiency.Even in that fund, “green bonds are only a subset of companies addressing the climate issues,” Mather said. “We don’t know exactly how the markets will evolve and how quickly the changes will take place, and we want to basically have a strategy that can take advantage of all those opportunities.”Mather and Liberatore have both noticed a noticeable shift in buzz around sustainable investing during the past year. Certianly, BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s annual letter to America’s CEOs, which declared that the world’s largest money manager would be “making sustainability integral to portfolio construction,” amplified that sentiment.In a report this week, Moody’s Investors Service said it expects green, social and sustainability bond issuance to hit a record in 2020 because investors “are prioritizing the incorporation of ESG considerations and sustainability into their investment decisions and risk management.” That should support “further growth and innovation” and help diversify the market in terms of industries and regions.“Historically, the concept of a green bond was really the purview of a supranational,” Liberatore said. Now, they’re getting “investors’ dollars closer and closer to the actual end output and impact. That’s really the most exciting part of the space.”I can certainly see why it would be exciting for money managers to dig into projects they believe in. But the way funds are set up now reflects a prudent balance between novel opportunities and predictable performance. The sustainable debt market is still very much in its infancy, and investors need to feel comfortable walking before they can run.(1) This is using Morningstar Inc. criteria, which includes the following types of funds: ESG focus funds:Those that make sustainability factors a featured component of their processes for both security selection and portfolio construction. This group is the largest, and the funds in it tend to be active owners, engaging with companies and supporting — and sometimes sponsoring — ESG-related shareholder resolutions. Impact/thematic funds: Focus on broad sustainability themes, and on delivering social or environmental impact alongside financial returns. Sustainable sector funds: Focus on investment opportunities that contribute to, and aim to benefit from, the transition to a green economy in areas like renewables, energy efficiency, environmental services, water, and green real estate.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-02-07,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) reports its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 13 before the markets open. And despite PepsiCo stock gaining more than 27% over the past year, shareholders can't afford any bad news.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com Currently, PEP stock is trading around the $144 level, which is 33 times its free cash flow for the trailing 12 months. Therefore, the company does not a lot of room for error next week.However, I don't think that will matter, and here's why.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Earnings ExpectationsAnalysts expect earnings per share (EPS) for PepsiCo to be $1.44 in Q4 2019, and $5.51 for fiscal year 2019. That's down five cents from Q4 2018 and 15 cents from fiscal 2018, respectively -- and that's bad news.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Buy for Big Gains in 2020 The good news, however, is that analysts expect it to earn $5.95 for FY2020 -- 44 cents higher than this past year. But, it's important to note that as we've moved closer to the upcoming earnings announcement, analysts have gotten more conservative in their outlook.Three months ago, nine analysts had a buy or overweight rating on PepsiCo stock. Today, though, that figure has dropped down to seven. Worse still, the average target price is currently $140.12, about 2.7% lower than its current share price.Nonetheless, I like to consider the glass half full. Pepsi is still going to earn close to $6 a share in 2020. Furthermore, in October, it beat expectations on both the top- and bottom-line, with CEO Ramon Laguarta stating that it would &quot;meet or exceed our full-year organic growth target of 4%.&quot;That said, the company's product lines appear to be stronger than ever. Bubly Taking Market ShareCurrently, PepsiCo boasts an impressive 22 billion-dollar brands. Suspiciously absent from this list, however, is Bubly sparkling water, which the company only launched in early 2018. Using Canadian singer Michael Buble as its pitchman, the company's humorous ads have generated serious buzz -- quickly boosting its market share.In January, Nielsen named 25 consumer packaged goods brands that it thought were innovating their way to growth. Bubly made the list, as did several other beverage brands, including Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) Dunkin' Donuts Bottled Ice Coffee.The reality is that Bubly is taking market share from Lacroix. Bubly generated $300 million in annualized revenue not too long after its 2018 launch, and is expected to join Pepsi's elite billion-dollar club soon.Sure, it might only generate 2% of the annual revenue that its legacy Pepsi brand does, but having another growth vehicle in the house can't hurt. To have 22 brands generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue provides the ultimate in diversification.Therefore, I continue to expect Bubly to deliver the goods. What About SodaStream?It's been a little more than a year since Pepsi completed its $3.2 billion acquisition of SodaStream. As far back as 2012, I thought SodaStream's products could quench two thirsts: First, that people enjoy drinking carbonated water, and secondly, that they want to do so without killing the planet.&quot;With its customizable options, SodaStream empowers consumers to personalize their preferred beverage in an environmentally friendly way and provides PepsiCo with a significant presence in the at-home marketplace,&quot; PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta stated upon the acquisition's closing.This past Christmas, I bought my wife one as a gift. I can state unequivocally that it's cut down on the number of cans going into the recycling. So in my view, it's a fantastic product that everyone should own.With that said, SodaStream plans to do its best to ensure that it happens in the American market.&quot;Ramon has senior executives at chains like Walmart or Target on his speed dial, and that's the difference. We've already been added to Albertsons, the third largest US retailer,&quot; SodaStream CEO Eyal Shohat said in a recent interview.It's going to take time, but down the road, SodaStream will become a more significant part of the PepsiCo conversation. The Bottom Line on PepsiCo StockOverall, only 1.5% of U.S. households have SodaStream's. The U.S. market only accounts for 15% of the company's estimated annual revenue of $900 million in 2019. This means that if 10% of U.S. households buy a SodaStream in the next 3-5 years, its revenues will double -- and that's solely from the American market. That doesn't take into consideration its global growth.When PepsiCo reports earnings Feb. 13, you won't hear much from Laguarta about SodaStream. And that's a good thing.PepsiCo stock might be expensive today, but in five years -- having bought now -- I doubt you'll look back with regret.So, at 33 times free cash flow, PEP stock is still a buy.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-13,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. shares rallied after the snack and beverage giant reported robust sales growth at its Frito-Lay North America business, even as its 2020 earnings forecast fell short of analyst estimates.Pepsi’s Frito-Lay unit posted a 4.5% rise in 2019 organic sales -- which strips out elements like currency volatility -- its best yearly performance since 2013, the company said in its earnings report. Overall, organic revenue rose 4.3% in the fourth quarter, versus an analyst estimate of 3.7%.Still, the company projected core earnings per share of $5.88 in 2020, just shy of the $5.95 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Pepsi also sees organic sales growth at 4% this year, trailing analyst expectations. The shares pared earlier losses of as much as 1.7% to close at a record high.Pepsi is trying to tap demand for snacks like Doritos and Lay’s potato chips to offset a general decline in the consumption of sugary soft drinks. Still, sales were also up in the key North American beverage unit, which has faced pressure as consumers cut down on sugary soda and competitors flood stores with a host of new options. The business posted total revenue growth of 4% for the quarter. The same measure of European sales jumped by 15%, helped by its 2018 acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd.Pepsi is investing in more manufacturing capacity, including new plants, new lines and more distribution infrastructure. It is also spending more money on data analytics and will “build consumer intimacy,” a sign the company will look deeper at shoppers’ buying habits and preferences, its executives said on the call.The Internet has changed the way companies can market products and Pepsi is taking advantage of that. “The ability to actually understand consumers at a more individualized level is now out there,” Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said in an interview. “Then combine that with the fact that you then have the ability to market to them in a much more specialized way, in a much more targeted way, than you would in TV only.”The company expects about $11 billion in cash from operating activities and $6 billion of free cash flow in 2020, which translates to net capital spending of about $5 billion, according to its earnings statement.(Updates with share price rebound from first paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Deena Shanker in New York at dshanker@bloomberg.net;Jonathan Roeder in Chicago at jroeder@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Sally Bakewell at sbakewell1@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Pepsi’s Frito-Lay Division Growth Help Sales Top Estimates

2020-02-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s never good when a CEO has to kick off his company’s year-end earnings report, as Kraft Heinz Co.’s did Thursday morning, by saying: “While our 2019 results were disappointing ...” Disappointing is putting it mildly, though. Try miserable.To recap: It was one year ago this month that the packaged-food manufacturer suffered a $15.4 billion writedown because of damage — largely self-inflicted — to the value of two of its biggest brand names, Kraft and Oscar Mayer. A slash to shareholders’ dividends and the oh-by-the-way mention of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into some accounting practices added to Kraft Heinz’s troubles. The stock, adored by Warren Buffett, its top shareholder, has been down 38% ever since. Right up until then, this was the company that most analysts promoted to their clients and every food giant wanted to emulate — a lean, profit-margin machine operated by a bunch of private equity guys that just so happens to sell food.Kraft Heinz’s sales continued to slide in the final three months of 2019 to $6.54 billion, a 2.2% drop when excluding the effect of business divestitures. On most metrics, Thursday’s results beat the average of analysts’ estimates, and CEO Miguel Patricio said he expects to make “significant progress” this year in the company’s ongoing turnaround. But there’s been little evidence of improvement yet, and he’s nearly eight months into the job, after taking over from Bernardo Hees, one of the aforementioned private equity partners from 3G Capital. (That’s the shop that merged Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz condiments in 2015 with the financial backing of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) In a recent interview with my Bloomberg News colleagues, Patricio talked about spending more on the company’s biggest moneymakers, such as Philadelphia cream cheese and Heinz ketchup, but not by increasing the budget — this is still a 3G company, after all. Instead, he’ll be shifting around resources to prioritize the most promising products and brands, as cheese, coffee and cold cuts continue to be the problem areas. In the latest quarter, Kraft wrote down the carrying value of its Maxwell House trademark by $213 million, part of an overall $666 million impairment charge that was primarily driven by its international businesses.Of course, Kraft Heinz isn’t the only consumer-products company that’s been thrown for a loop by shoppers’ changing appetites. The move toward less-processed, healthier-sounding foods and the villainization of sugar and carbohydrates has weighed on every household name in the industry. Some have been dealing with it by acquiring the fast-growing upstart brands that have been encroaching on their supermarket shelf space. PepsiCo Inc. has done a version of what Kraft Heinz is attempting by making a big push for chips like Doritos that are holding up even as more seemingly wholesome snacks gain popularity. The soda giant reported sales and earnings that beat expectations on Thursday, with operating profit rising 3% in its Frito-Lay North America chips division; beverage sales managed to climb, too.A new CEO walking into Kraft Heinz’s mess deserves time to get a handle on things. But now it’s time to lay out a concrete strategy that shows Kraft Heinz understands the root cause of its problems, that the entire 3G ethos had the company under-investing in its products at exactly the time it needed to be doing the exact opposite. Patricio says to stay tuned for May, when he’ll unveil such a plan. Investors can’t possibly feel optimistic until they see it. To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-02-14,"(Bloomberg) -- As Asia-Pacific president of Dow Chemical Co., one of the world’s biggest producers of plastics and chemicals, Jon Penrice has 100 billion reasons to recycle.“About 8 million tons of plastics are going into the ocean annually,” he said in an interview. “If you look at plastic packaging, around 95% is not being recycled each year which is $100 billion worth of plastic, and that’s valuable for entrepreneurs.”At the center of the effort is Asia, which consumes almost half of the world’s plastic packaging, according to BloombergNEF, and imports even more waste from the U.S. and Europe. Solutions -- such as Indian vending machines that turn plastic bottles into polyester, and researchers in Singapore who are working out ways to clean up oil spills using the waste -- will be needed to meet demand for recycled plastics that’s forecast to rise faster than supply.The biggest challenge to the transition is to make recycled plastics at a price and quality that are competitive. Virgin plastic is derived from crude oil and is closely linked to the global oil price. Because the cost of recycled plastic is more stable, it becomes relatively more expensive when crude prices fall.See also: China Upended the Politics of Plastic and the World Is Still ReelingThe complexity of sorting different types of plastic is another hurdle, according to Penrice, as well as dealing with waste at source rather than producing a lot of carbon emissions by sending it half way around the world.An estimated $80 billion-$120 billion of value is lost because of packaging that goes into the environment, said Navneet Chadha, principal operations officer at the World Bank’s International Finance Corp., which helps fund private sector investment in developing countries. “We have to think of used plastic as a resource, not as a waste.”See also: World Seen Struggling to Recycle Even 50% of Its Plastic WasteBut Chadha cautioned that standards for recycled products need to be developed to avoid “unintended consequences”. Using plastic in road construction, for example, needs to be evaluated further as microplastics may be generated as the road decays, he said.Here are some of the ways plastic is being recycled in Asia:Traditional RecyclingPlastic waste is traditionally reused by collecting and sorting refuse and then melting it, a process known as mechanical recycling. Part of the problem is that a lot of garbage is tainted with food or chemicals and can’t cheaply be turned into high quality raw materials.“The biggest challenge is quality of recycled plastic,” said Jean-Marc Boursier, chief operating officer of SUEZ Group, one of the world’s largest recycling companies. “Major consumer goods companies like Danone, Pepsi or Coca Cola will not buy recycled plastic unless they are convinced that the quality is as good as virgin plastic.”SUEZ has nine plants globally that can turn a combined 500,000 tons of waste plastic into 150,000 tons of polymers, used to make shampoo bottles, car interiors and other products. The company is opening its first Asian plastic recycling plant this year in Thailand.Boursier suggests pricing the carbon savings into the recycled plastic price to take into account the environmental benefit.AerogelsA team of researchers at the National University of Singapore has developed a way to convert low-value plastic waste into aerogels -- ultra-light materials used in everything from diaper fillings to cleaning up oil spills.Around eight average plastic water bottles produce a square meter sheet of aerogel using the method, said Duong Hai Minh, an associate professor at the university who worked on the project. The researchers have sold commercial production rights to firms including Bronxculture in Singapore and DPN Aerogel JSC in Vietnam, he said.“People throw away plastic because there they don’t see any value,” Minh said. “As long as we can make it valuable, everyone will keep it and sell it.”HighwaysUsing plastic waste to build roads is gaining in popularity, not least because all types of plastic including difficult-to-recycle multilayered packaging and flexible films and coatings used to wrap chocolates and for food deliveries can be used. Dow Chemical and India’s Reliance Industries Ltd. have developed technologies that use this plastic as a binder, replacing some of the bitumen.The Mukesh Ambani-led company has built 40 kilometers of road at its refineries using plastic that can’t otherwise be recycled, and is in talks with National Highways Authority of India and other road builders about using the technology more widely, said Vipul Shah, chief operating officer for the petrochemicals business.Meanwhile Indian Oil Corp., the country’s biggest refiner, is trying to get the government to make the blending of non-recyclable plastics in road-laying mandatory, said S.S.V. Ramakumar, director of research and development.In the Philippines, San Miguel Corp. laid down its first road combining plastic scraps with asphalt last year, using surface material developed with Dow. The chemicals giant has also helped build plastic-based roads in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the U.S., according to Dow’s Penrice.See also: The Philippines Is Making Roads and Cement With Plastic Garbage“It’s relatively simple from the technology point of view: you shred the plastic waste, some sorting and selection and then you feed it into the existing asphalt machinery,” he said. “Approximately 100 tons of plastic waste can be recycled into a 40-kilometer stretch of road.”TextilesShredding plastic bottles to produce polyester for clothing is another technology that’s gaining traction in Asia. Reliance has set up reverse-vending machines that collect used bottles in exchange for discount coupons that can be redeemed at its company stores.The company, India’s largest petrochemicals manufacturer, can recycle around 2 billion plastic bottles a year, or 33,000 tons, according to Shah. Capacity will be doubled over the next 18 months, he said.BricksSome non-government organizations and companies are looking at ways to use waste plastic to make bricks and other construction materials. The Global Ecobrick Alliance is promoting use of a block tightly crammed with plastic and other recyclables. Qube, an India-based start-up, has developed a brick made entirely of plastic waste. Called the PlastiQube, it’s cheaper and uses less energy to produce than conventional counterparts, according to the company’s website.Chemical RecyclingBreaking down waste plastic into a basic feedstock like naphtha -- a process called pyrolysis -- can reprocess dirty, contaminated plastics like detergent drums and mixed polymers that can’t be dealt with through mechanical recycling.Pyrolysis will provide around 17% of the 19 million tons of plastics recycling capacity required by 2030 in major economies, according to BloombergNEF. Dow will source oil feedstock made using pyrolysis from Dutch company Fuenix Ecogy Group, while Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA have partnered with start-ups to increase use of the technology.“Mechanical recycling will continue to be cheaper,” said Boursier at SUEZ, which is setting up a pyrolysis pilot project in Bristol in the U.K. “But for complex or polluted plastic, chemical recycling will be the future.”(Company corrects second paragraph to show $100 billion is the value of all plastic packaging that’s not being recycled)To contact the reporters on this story: Saket Sundria in Singapore at ssundria@bloomberg.net;Debjit Chakraborty in New Delhi at dchakrabor10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Andrew Janes, Adam MajendieFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Diapers to Bricks: A $100 Billion Plastic Challenge

2020-03-11,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. agreed to buy energy-drink maker Rockstar Inc. for $3.85 billion as the U.S. soft drink and snacks giant seeks to expand its beverage range amid waning appetite for traditional sodas.The deal is one of the first strategic moves by PepsiCo Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta since he took over from Indra Nooyi in 2018. Pepsi and Las Vegas-based Rockstar have had a distribution agreement in North America since 2009.Pepsi and rival Coca-Cola Co. have been racing to expand their lineups of faster-growing drinks as consumers shun sugary beverages. Pepsi’s energy portfolio already includes Mountain Dew’s Kickstart, GameFuel and AMP while Coca-Cola announced Coke Energy last year, adding to the stake it owns in Monster Beverage Corp., a top-selling brand. Coke also acquired U.K. chain Costa Coffee in 2018 and has debuted a line of spirit mixers.“Over time, we expect to capture our fair share of this fast-growing, highly profitable category and create meaningful new partnerships in the energy space,” Laguarta said today in a statement confirming the deal. Dow Jones reported earlier that Pepsi was nearing a deal for Rockstar, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.High CaffeineEnergy drinks, known for their high sugar and caffeine content, have been a relative weak spot for both Coke and Pepsi. Austria’s Red Bull GmbH dominates the category, selling about 7.5 billion cans annually. About 700 million of those are sold in the U.S., compared with just over 70 million cans of Rockstar.Through sponsorships, the energy beverage industry is closely associated with extreme sports, which has been a boon for brands such as Monster. Last month, the company said its full-year sales rose 10%.Rockstar was founded by the entrepreneur Russell Weiner in 2001 and is the creator of the world’s first 16-ounce energy drink.Pepsi also entered into an agreement which will provide about $700 million of payments related to future tax benefits associated with the transaction, payable over up to 15 years, it said in the statement. The company doesn’t foresee the deal affecting revenue or earnings per share this year. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2020.Pepsi shares were down about 2.6% in New York, amid broader declines in American stock indexes.Pepsi was advised by Centerview Partners Holdings LP while Rockstar worked with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.(Updates with shares in penultimate paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Buckley in London at tbuckley25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net, Anne Pollak, Eric PfannerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",PepsiCo to Buy Rockstar Energy Drinks for $3.85 Billion

2020-03-11,"PepsiCo, Inc.

He highlighted success in its ready-to-drink coffee beverages it sells as part of a partnership with Starbucks. He also said the company needs to do a &quot;better job with Rockstar,&quot; according to The Wall Street Journal.Rockstar is also one of the biggest competitors to Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ: MNST).PepsiCo doesn't expect the transaction to be meaningfully positive to its revenue or earnings per share in 2020. The company expects the deal to close in the first half of the year.PepsiCo's stock traded lower by 3.7% to $129.10 per share art time of publication.Related Links:Pepsi To Acquire One of China's Largest Snack Brands In 5M DealPepsico Reports Q4 Earnings BeatPhoto credit: Mike Mozart, FlickrSee more from Benzinga  * Cramer Says To Sell Oil Stocks If Saudi Arabia, Russia Reconcile  * Wingstop's Free Merch Comes With One Condition: It's An Ad  * Pisani: Circuit Breakers Worked As Expected(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-17,"(Bloomberg) -- With the market for short-term corporate debt seizing up in the U.S., some of the world’s biggest companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and PepsiCo Inc., turned back to the bond market to raise cash on Tuesday.In a sign of just how badly financial markets have been thrown out of whack by the coronavirus outbreak, yields on normally ultra-safe corporate debt maturing in as little as 30 days -- known as commercial paper -- have been surging faster than yields on bonds maturing in 10 years or more.The Federal Reserve announced steps to try to unlock the commercial paper market, but some borrowers opted not to wait for that to happen. Exxon led the day with an $8.5 billion sale, while Pepsi borrowed $6.5 billion.Many of the issuers Tuesday were planning to use the debt proceeds to refinance their commercial paper, which companies rely on to cover short-term financing needs like payroll.Read more: Fed Restarts Commercial Paper Facility to Ease Market StrainUsually it’s cheaper for companies to borrow in short-term markets rather than issuing longer-maturity bonds. But the nearer-term risk of recession and rising defaults have cast doubt on some companies’ ability to finance day-to-day operations. Companies have issued less commercial paper as a result and have often resorted to drawing down credit lines instead.“There’s definitely issues in the commercial paper market, and these companies are going to hit the bond market to shore up their financing,” said Daniel Oh, a portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management.The Fed will reintroduce the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, a measure from the financial crisis to shore up short-term funding markets, according to a statement Tuesday. The Treasury will provide $10 billion of credit protection from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The Fed rolled out the facility in 2008 as global credit markets seized up.“By providing short-term credit, the CPFF will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a separate statement.Verizon Communications Inc. led the charge of almost a dozen frequent and high-quality U.S. investment-grade issuers Tuesday that managed to sell $27.6 billion of debt. They were the first to do so since Friday.Read more: IG ANALYSIS US: Exxon, Verizon, PepsiCo Lead Biggest Day of 2020Europe’s market also rebooted, starting with three covered deals, among the safest of offerings due to their asset coverage.

2020-04-20,"PepsiCo (PEP) has received Federal Trade Commission approval for its $3.85 billion acquisition of Rockstar Energy Beverages, writes the New York Post.According to the report, the deal will now close in the next few days.PepsiCo has had a distribution agreement with the popular energy drink maker in North America since 2009- which barred the company from doing anything in energy outside of Rockstar.However, this strategy was clearly not working; according to IRI in 2019 alone Rockstar volumes were down 7.9% and the brand lost -180 bps of share (volume -5.9% YTD 2020).Importantly, the deal means that PepsiCo is now free to become more aggressive in the energy drink category as it no longer has any restrictions to expand its energy drink strategy.As well as Rockstar, PepsiCo’s energy portfolio includes Mountain Dew’s Kickstart, GameFuel, and AMP. Now with Rockstar under its belt, PEP hopes to gain market share from rivals Monster Beverage (MNST) and Red Bull.“Over time, we expect to capture our fair share of this fast-growing, highly profitable category and create meaningful new partnerships in the energy space” said PepsiCo CEO, Ramon Laguarta.Meanwhile RBC Capital’s Nik Modi commented “It is no secret that PepsiCo has lagged its peers in participating in one of the fastest growing segments of the beverage industry –  Energy.”He believes the deal to acquire Rockstar clears the path for PepsiCo to create a distribution agreement with Bang Energy to further expand its energy drink portfolio.Modi recently upgraded PEP from hold to buy, while boosting his price target from $115 to $153 (13% upside potential). Investments should bolster top-line growth over the long term, he says.In total the stock has a Moderate Buy analyst consensus and a $144 average analyst price target (6%). Over the last three months, PEP has received 11 buy ratings vs 6 hold ratings.

According to IRI, total PEP March quarter dollar sales recorded a 330 bps acceleration from the December quarter thanks to salty snacks (+9%), bottled water (+21%) and sport drinks (+15%).And while on-premise sales create a ‘pressure point’ for PepsiCo, the company is significantly less exposed than Coca-Cola, says Modi.He continued: “We expect strong retail sales trends through March, but June commentary will likely be less constructive given reduced away-from-home consumption and pantry destocking (more so in beverages than snacks).”Indeed, recent data shows that while PEP bottled water sales and sport drinks declined in the March quarter, snacks went the opposite way, soaring +14.8% in the latest week from +8.7% in March.Modi only recently upgraded his take on PEP stock from hold to buy, explaining ““After a complete review of our model and assessing PepsiCo’s strategic direction under CEO Ramon Laguarta, we believe the company will be able to deliver better long-term revenue and profit growth than we had previously assumed.”In particular, he believes that marketing, digital, and infrastructure investment should start to pay dividends. With the stock down 2% year-to-date, his $153 price target indicates 14% upside potential from current levels.Modi isn’t the only bull in town; PEP scores a Moderate Buy consensus on TipRanks, with 11 recent buy ratings vs 6 hold ratings. Meanwhile the average analyst price target stands at $145 (8% upside potential).

2020-04-28,PepsiCo's first quarter earnings are out. Here is the analysis you need to know.,Why PepsiCo is doing better than long-time rival Coca-Cola during the COVID-19 pandemic
2020-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Tuesday saw two new milestones in the U.S.: coronavirus cases passed the 1 million mark and deaths topped the 58,220 lives lost in the Vietnam War, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.France plans to begin reopening shops on May 11, while Spain is preparing for a “new normal” as Europe’s hardest-hit nation removes restrictions over the next eight weeks. New infections in Germany fell below 1,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. China’s top scientists said the virus won’t be eradicated, joining a growing consensus that the pathogen will probably return in waves.New York City reported a decline in the number of people admitted to hospitals for the new coronavirus, while the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, laid out criteria necessary for some upstate regions to reopen. President Donald Trump plans to order meat-processing plants to remain open, a person familiar with the matter said.Key DevelopmentsVirus Tracker: Cases top 3.1 million; deaths pass 216,000Testing shortages undermine drive to restart U.S. economyMexico City top hospitals reach capacity, reject virus patientsVirus forces China to rethink Xi’s annual political pageantBack to school brings a bleak new normal for China’s studentsBusiness of survival fuels race for new skills to stay afloatSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus.U.S. to Reclaim Payments to the Dead (6:30 a.m. HK)The U.S. Treasury Department is planning to instruct people whose deceased relatives received coronavirus stimulus payments to return the money to the federal government, according to a department spokesman.The Treasury is aware that some individuals who have recently died received the $1,200 economic impact payments and plans to issue guidance in the coming days, the spokesman said.The announcement addresses an issue that some people began noticing earlier this month when the stimulus payments passed by Congress in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak were first deposited into bank accounts: Family members who had died in the past several months were receiving payments.South African Economy Could Contract 6% (6:15 a.m. HK)South African Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said the South African economy could contract as much as 6.4% this year due to the coronavirus outbreak and the budget deficit could swell to more than 10% of gross domestic product.In a recording of a conference call with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. clients, Mboweni said he expected the contraction to be deeper than the 5.8% forecast by the International Monetary Fund. The rebound to 4% economic growth that the lender projects for 2021 is possible, he said, but it will require significant structural changes to the economy.Starbucks Sees China Sales Falling 25% (5:12 p.m. NY)Starbucks Corp. has opened almost all its locations in China, but still sees the lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic trimming same-store sales there by 15% to 25% this fiscal year. The shares fell in late trading.Same-store sales fell 10% globally in the company’s second quarter, slightly outpacing the average estimate for a 9.7% decline compiled by Consensus Metrix. The measure -- a key gauge of success for restaurant chains -- fell 50% in China, which along with the U.S. is a priority market for the company.With the U.S. likely following China’s path to reopening, but on a delayed timeline, 2020 increasingly is looking like a lost year for the company. Since the pandemic started to affect U.S. sales only at the end of the quarter that ended in late March, impact on third-quarter results will be “significantly greater” and extend into the fiscal fourth quarter “at a more moderate level.”The company has said it will take a store-by-store approach to resuming business activity in the U.S., with locations remaining limited to drive-thru, delivery and takeout activities. Starbucks said this plan will draw on the company’s experiences in China, where 98% of stores are now re-opened and operating under modified schedules or protocols.California Considers Starting School Year in Summer (4:45 p.m. NY)California, which has closed schools for the academic year, is considering bumping up the start of the new school year to late July or early August, Governor Gavin Newsom said. The tools necessary for distance learning – laptops, tablets and reliable wireless internet – aren’t adequately available across the state, he said.“There’s been a learning loss, and you can either just roll over and just accept that or you can do something about it,” Newsom said at his daily press conference. “If we can maybe start up the school year a little earlier, that would help mind that gap a little bit.”Opening schools would also help parents get back to work as the economy restarts. Newsom reiterated that he expects some changes to California’s stay-at-home order will come in “weeks, not months,” with the next phase aimed at bringing back some lower-risk workplaces, including childcare facilities. Still, he wouldn’t commit to any hard timeline, citing an increase in Covid-19 related deaths and confirmed cases on Tuesday as a signal that the virus is still too dangerous for the state to reopen.Trump Ties Aid to Sanctuary Policies (4:30 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump indicated he wouldn’t allow federal aid for states facing budget deficits from the coronavirus outbreak unless they take action against “sanctuary cities” -- municipalities that prevent their police from cooperating with immigration authorities.“We would want certain things” as part of a deal with House Democrats to aid states, he said at a White House event on Tuesday, “including sanctuary city adjustments, because we have so many people in sanctuary cities.”“What’s happening is people are being protected that shouldn’t be protected and a lot of bad things are happening with sanctuary cities,” he added.U.S. Cases Rise 2.5%, Below Week’s Average (4 p.m. NY)U.S. cases rose 2.5% from the day before to surpass 1 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was higher than Monday’s growth rate of 2.3% but below average daily increase of 3.3% over the past week. Deaths rose 3.7% to 57,608. Deaths rose 3.7% to 57,608.New York’s cases rose 1.1%, according to the Johns Hopkins and Bloomberg News data.New Jersey, which has the second-highest Covid-19 rate, reported 402 new deaths, for a total of 6,442, according to the state’s health department.In Texas, cases rose 3.5% to 26,171, almost in lockstep with the rate of increase in testing, according to the state’s health department. Hospitalizations climbed by 119 to 1,682, or 19% higher than a week ago.Florida reported 32,846 cases, up 2.2% from a day earlier, according to the state’s health department. Deaths reached 1,171, an increase of 7.6%.Nebraska had the highest daily increase, with cases rising 16% to 3,507Fauci ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ on Vaccine (1:57 p.m. NY)The U.S. government’s top infectious disease specialist is “cautiously optimistic” scientists will develop a Covid-19 vaccine that can protect against future outbreaks of a virus he said is unlikely to disappear.“The very fact that people can mount a natural immune response that gets rid of the virus in them makes me cautiously optimistic that we can develop a vaccine that can mimic natural infection enough to induce that same sort of response that would ultimately protect people,” Anthony Fauci said Tuesday at a virtual event hosted by the Economic Club.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in the past has shied away from making predictions about treatments.Texas Cases Rise 3.5% (1:19 p.m. NY)Texas cases rose 3.5% to 26,171, almost in lockstep with the rate of increase in testing, according to the state’s health department. Hospitalizations climbed by 119 to 1,682, or 19% higher than a week ago.The increases in caseload and admitted patients come as Governor Greg Abbott moved to reopen the economy and leaders of the state’s biggest metropolitan areas warned that moving too fast could ignite a second wave of contagion.Spain Aims to Lift Lockdown in 8 Weeks (1:15 p.m. NY)Spain aims to remove most restrictions on daily life and return to a “new normal” over the next eight weeks, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.The process will be subject to data on the number of Covid-19 infections and won’t follow a strict calendar, Sanchez said in a televised address. Schools won’t return until September. Each province will ease curbs on activity at its own pace in accordance with its particular situation, Sanchez added.After a six-week lockdown that has crippled the economy, the health ministry earlier reported a drop in the number of new virus cases and deaths, continuing a trend of steady decline in the nation with Europe’s most extensive outbreak.Turkish ICU Cases Fall for Fifth Day (1 p.m. NY)The number of coronavirus patients requiring intensive care fell for a fifth day across Turkey, while the tally of patients discharged from hospitals rose to the highest since the outbreak began 50 days ago.The total figure for confirmed cases now stands at 114,653, or 2.1% higher than Monday, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said in a Twitter post. The ministry reported 92 new fatalities, bringing the death toll from the outbreak to 2,992.U.K. Reports 586 More Deaths (12:23 p.m. NY)A further 586 people are reported to have died from the coronavirus in U.K. hospitals, the government said.That’s an increase from the 360 deaths reported Monday, but U.K. death numbers are usually artificially low after a weekend.Some 3,996 more people tested positive for the disease, down from an increase of 4,310 the day before, according to figures given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday. The U.K. now has more confirmed cases than Germany, and the fifth-highest number of confirmed cases in the world.Putin Extends Russian Lockdown (11:10 a.m. NY)President Vladimir Putin ordered Russians to remain under lockdown through May 11 after the total number of coronavirus cases in the country surpassed China’s.“We have been able to slow down the epidemic,” Putin said Tuesday in a videoconference with officials and regional governors. “The peak has not yet been reached. We are facing the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic.”Putin also ordered the government to prepare a plan for gradually lifting the virus restrictions starting as early as May 12, and said ministers should draw up further programs to support the economy. Easing the measures against the epidemic won’t happen all at once, the president said.Florida Governor to Meet With Trump (10:56 a.m. NY)Florida reported 32,846 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, up 2.2% from a day earlier. Deaths reached 1,171, an increase of 7.6%.Governor Ron DeSantis is in Washington Tuesday to meet with President Donald Trump, an ally -- and technically a Florida resident -- to whom DeSantis has frequently turned for guidance during the pandemic.NYC Sees Drop in Virus Admissions (10:37 a.m. NY)New York City reported a decline in the number of people admitted to hospitals for the new coronavirus, to 112 from 122 as of April 25.The number of people in New York City Health + Hospitals intensive-care units also declined, to 745 from 766 as of April 25, according to figures presented by Mayor Bill de Blasio at his Tuesday virus briefing.In another sign of progress, de Blasio reported that the citywide percentage of people who tested positive for Covid-19 is 27%, down from 29%. Testing positivity was slightly higher at the public health lab, up to 56% from 55%.France to Reopen Shops Starting May 11 (9:46 a.m. NY)Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said a decision on whether to reopen restaurants and cafes will be examined at the end of May, and that pupils can start returning to school from May 11 but with strict rules. Public events of more than 5,000 people are outlawed until September, and working from home is encouraged for at least three more weeks, he said.Ford to Restart Production at European Plants (9:14 a.m. NY)Ford intends to restart initial production at most of its main European vehicle and engine plants beginning May 4, the company said. Manufacturing will resume in a phased approach, and employees will receive personal-care kits including masks and thermometers.Mnuchin Says Loans of $2 Million to Be Audited (9:10 a.m. NY)U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said all loans of more than $2 million in a government relief program for small businesses will be audited to ensure they were justified after large public companies and big chains sparked outrage by taking funds.Mnuchin said the loans of as much as $10 million meant to keep workers on payrolls under the Paycheck Protection Program were intended for small firms that lacked access to other capital, and the U.S. Small Business Administration will check that borrowers who took large loans properly certified it was needed because of the coronavirus outbreak.“I want to be very clear it’s the borrowers who have criminal liability if they made this certification and it’s not true,” Mnuchin said Tuesday on CNBC.The Treasury secretary also said those states that had poorly managed budgets before the Covid-19 outbreak shouldn’t be rescued by the federal government.U.S. Merchandise Trade Slumps (8:54 a.m. NY)U.S. exports and imports of goods slumped in March to the lowest level in almost three years as the coronavirus pandemic shut down economies across the world.Goods exports fell 6.7% from the prior month -- the sharpest decline since 2008 -- led by plunges in auto shipments and industrial supplies such as oil, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday. Imports fell by 2.4% on autos and consumer goods. Combined, U.S. exports and imports were the lowest since May 2017.Germany to Extend Takeover Controls to Health Care (8:48 a.m. NY)The German government plans to extend its protection against foreign takeovers to the health-care industry after the coronavirus outbreak made companies more vulnerable. Angela Merkel’s cabinet aims to lower the threshold for scrutinizing investments in the sector from outside the European Union, the Economy Ministry said Tuesday.Netherlands Sees Fewest New Cases Since March 14 (8:13 a.m. NY)The Netherlands reported 171 new cases, the lowest since March 14, which was a few days before an “intelligent lockdown” was imposed on the country. Confirmed cases rose a mere 0.4% to 38,416, marking the lowest recorded growth rate. Fatalities increased by 48 -- five more than Monday, but still below the triple-digit numbers seen for most of the month -- for a total of 4,566.FDA’s Hahn Optimistic About Plasma Treatment (7:48 a.m. NY)“There are some good preliminary data to suggest that it is a benefit, this is a therapy that we’ve been scaling up over the last two months,” FDA Chief Stephen Hahn told Fox Business. On Gilead and its drug remdesivir, he said: “We’ve been in very close contact with the company and are working closely with them to look at what those data show”U.K. Regulator Warns Banks Not to Use Loans to Win Deals (7:31 a.m. NY)“We have heard credible reports of a small number of banks failing to treat their corporate clients fairly when negotiating new or existing debt facilities,” the Financial Conduct Authority said Tuesday in the letter. “We have heard reports that banks may have used their lending relationship to exert pressure on corporate clients to secure roles on equity mandates.”Providing financial services in return for future business is not an unusual strategy for lenders. The outbreak of the Covid-19 virus triggered an unprecedented demand for banks to provide short-term liquidity and prompted regulators to ease capital buffers. The transactions could include a capital raising, a bond issuance or other types of equity mandates.European Banks Get Break on Leverage Limits (7:15 a.m. NY)A key rule on banks’ indebtedness -- the so-called leverage ratio -- will be relaxed under a European Union proposal announced Tuesday, enabling banks to hold less capital for funds they keep at central banks. Deutsche Bank AG, which had 134 billion euros in cash primarily at central banks at the end of 2019, stands to be a major beneficiary.The softening of the rule is part of the latest plan unveiled by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, that also would allow banks to save on capital when they invest in software and when they fund infrastructure and small- and medium-sized businessesSingapore Virus Trend ‘Improving’ (6:43 a.m. NY)The trend of overall cases is “indeed improving” but the government wants to make sure there is a decisive reduction in local community transmission before moving to relax circuit breaker measures, Singapore Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said at a briefing.As part of the city-state’s strategy to bring down infections in the weeks to come, the government said it has more than doubled its daily testing capacity since early April even as the number of cases. Once touted as an early success in containing the spread, Singapore now has Asia’s highest number of coronavirus cases after China and India. Much of the surge in infections has been driven by hundreds of new daily cases from migrant worker dorms.UPS, PepsiCo Pull Outlook (6:14 a.m. NY)UPS, PepsiCo, 3M and Xerox joined the growing list of companies who have scrapped forecasts because of the disruption caused by the coronavirus. “There is still a great deal of uncertainty that exists in relation to Covid-19, including how geographies, retail channels and consumer behaviors will evolve over time,” PepsiCo said. UPS is suspending share buybacks for 2020 and expects capital expenditure to be about $1 billion lower than expected.At 3M, rising demand for cleaning supplies, food-safety products and even home-improvement items helped propel sales and profit above expectations for the first quarter.Caterpillar Inc. didn’t provide an outlook for the year and said it had taken actions to cut costs, including reducing discretionary expenses and suspending 2020 base salary increases and short-term incentive compensation plans for many employees and all senior executives. Harley-Davidson Inc. is in talks with major U.S. banks to secure $1.3 billion in funding after sales declined in every market worldwideSouthwest Airlines Co. plans to sell $1 billion in convertible bonds and 55 million shares. The company is cutting the number of Boeing Co. 737 Max jets it will take through December 2021 by more than half as the travel outlook remains bleak. Max deliveries will total no more than 48 through the end of next year as the pandemic batters demand for flights, Southwest said. More than 120 planes had been expected.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Covid-19 Deaths Top Lives Lost in Vietnam War: Virus Update

2020-04-29,"Global beverage and snacking giant PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) reported first-quarter results Tuesday that were highlighted by strong organic sales growth, but the company cautioned there's a &quot;great deal of uncertainty&quot; ahead. Here's how two bull analysts reacted to the print. The PepsiCo Analysts Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian maintains an Overweight rating on PepsiCo with a price target lifted from $145 to $150.BofA Securities analyst Bryan Spillane maintains at Buy, unchanged $150 price target.Morgan Stanley: Pepsi A 'Defensive Business'PepsiCo reported 7.9% organic sales growth, which was &quot;well above&quot; consensus expectations of 3.4%, Mohsenian said in a note.While the second-quarter organic topline was guided to be down by a low-single-digit, on a net basis, topline results for the first half of 2020 are trending 50 basis points above prior estimates, the analyst said. This reinforces the defensive nature of PepsiCo's business, as higher snacking at-home trends are offsetting the loss of sales from out-of-home channels, he said. Looking beyond the coronavirus pandemic, PepsiCo's lower exposure to the out-of-channel category serves a competitive advantage against its peers, Mohsenian said. This should allow the company to take advantage of its positioning to generate long-term share gains, the analyst said.

BofA: Pepsi Strategy Update PepsiCo's management detailed the four stages of the coronavirus pandemic, including: preparation, confinement, restricted recovery and a new normal, Spillane said in a note.Pepsi believes development market consumers are at the &quot;later stage of phase two&quot; which resulted in a shift away from convenience channels and increasing breakfast and snacks at home, the analyst said. Management is taking advantage of the phase by adjusting promotions, as consumers are shopping less often but buying more at a time, he said. Finally, the company withdrew its fiscal 2020 outlook, but investors should expect the following for the second quarter, Spillane said: a deeper fall in operating profit and EPS than sales and a higher net interest expense versus prior guidance due to acquisitions and refinancing.PEP Price Action Pepsi shares were 2.17% higher at $133.36 at the close Wednesday.

2020-05-07,"Consumer stocks have been a mixed bag for investors in this bear market.On the one hand, consumer staples, which provide life's necessities, have held up far better than the broader market as Americans stock up for what could be weeks spent indoors. But consumer discretionary stocks - companies selling clothes, burgers and cars - have been every bit as bad as the S&P; 500, if not worse.But there are several consumer stocks to buy on both sides of the aisle now: staples that should continue to perform well as long as the outbreak keeps a grip on the country, as well as discretionary plays that have been knocked down into value status and have higher yields - and higher upside potential when the economy rebounds - as a result.Here are eight large-cap consumer stocks to buy for income and growth. These companies boast varied mixes of dividend and upside potential. Some of them are bounce-back plays, while others are steady Eddies that investors can hold to protect against additional market declines. However, all of them have seen their dividend yields become at least a little richer over the past few weeks.

2020-06-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the more popular sentiments expressed on Twitter over the weekend was that the astronauts who left Earth on Saturday made a good choice. After months of suffering from a global pandemic that has caused mass unemployment, school shutdowns and over 100,000 deaths, Americans are now reeling from a wave of nationwide protests following the death of a black man at the hands of Minneapolis police. What should companies say and do amid events so fraught that many people would prefer not to be on the planet?“It’s always risky for brands to weigh in on deep social unrest,” says reputation-management guru Helio Fred Garcia, president of Logos Consulting Group. Companies have learned this the hard way before — such as when Starbucks Corp. hatched an ill-advised effort to encourage people to talk about racism with their baristas in 2015 and when PepsiCo. Inc. launched a widely excoriated commercial about social activism featuring Kendall Jenner in 2017. Companies were reminded of that risk again on Saturday after National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell received fierce backlash for expressing support for the protesters. His statement was viewed as insincere by many after the experience of Colin Kaepernick, a player who has not been signed by a team since 2017 after protesting racism and police brutality.So companies can start by taking a look in the mirror. Facebook Inc., for example, needs to do some hard thinking about its policies after choosing not to flag a Facebook version of a Twitter post by President Donald Trump threatening to shoot looters. That decision has staffers so upset that some staged a virtual walkout Monday. (Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged in a post that his company must do more to “ensure our systems don't amplify bias.”) Companies should be prepared to answer questions — from employees, the news media and other stakeholders — about how they can do more to fight racism and promote diversity.Leaders should also communicate with employees who are on edge, seeking their feedback on how they can better promote diversity, address employee concerns, and fight unconscious bias and other forms of racism. But while every organization should be having these conversations internally, companies should proceed cautiously before publicly wading into the protests.Speaking out publicly comes with two risks. The first is that such efforts will be perceived as self-serving. Many television commercials referencing the coronavirus, for example, have been panned as thinly veiled efforts to use the pandemic to promote consumer spending. The second risk is that commercials or other statements of public support will only remind the public of a company’s record of inaction (the Pepsi commercial) or dubious actions (the NFL). Indeed, a 2016 study by Weber Shandwick and KRC Research found that public activism boosts a company's reputation when it is related in some way to what a company is already doing — but it backfires when it is perceived as discordant with a company's business. If a company has a well-established record of openly fighting racism, speaking out publicly now will be perceived as credible. And if a company — or its employees or stakeholders — has been drawn into the fray, the public will expect it to say something. Garcia notes that companies whose stores have been damaged in the protests will be expected to respond. Macy’s Inc.’s flagship store in New York’s Herald Square was looted Monday night, and the company would be wise to respond compassionately. Designer Marc Jacobs offered a laudable example for other retailers to follow after one of his own stores was damaged:View this post on Instagram A post shared by Marc Jacobs (@themarcjacobs) on May 31, 2020 at 9:38am PDTOf course, many other executives will be tempted to join the bandwagon to express support for fighting systemic racism. But they should start by taking action. Companies including Verizon Communications Inc., Intel Corp., Facebook, Peloton Cycle Inc. and Levi Strauss & Co. have all announced major monetary contributions to organizations that promote social justice. Such donations — along with changes to corporate practices — are the place to start.Once an organization has firmly established a record of supporting racial equality, it can authentically join the public conversation. But without such actions, attempts to generate positive publicity by tying corporations to the cause will be more likely to be perceived as shallow and self-serving, generating backlash that may leave more chief executives wanting to leave the planet.    This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Kara Alaimo is an associate professor of public relations at Hofstra University and author of “Pitch, Tweet, or Engage on the Street: How to Practice Global Public Relations and Strategic Communication.” She previously served in the Obama administration.

2020-06-08,"It's hard to believe, but stocks are within spitting distance of new all-time highs. At time of writing, the S&P; 500 is just 1% away from being positive on the year and 6% away from literally the highest point in the index's history. Many discounts in prospective retirement stocks have evaporated completely.Yet the real economy still is in rough shape. Advance estimates showed first-quarter GDP slowing by 4.8%, and early estimates by the Atlanta Fed show Q2 GDP falling by an almost inconceivable 53.8%. These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, as production will naturally bounce back as America comes out of lockdown. But it's going to be a while before things start to look normal again.High prices at a time when the economy is in freefall might seem odd. It actually gets worse when you look at stock valuations. We won't even bother with the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the forward P/E. With earnings per share so distorted by COVID-19 disruptions, any metric that uses an estimation of corporate profits for the next year will be all but useless, making stocks priced against nonexistent earnings look artificially expensive.But even the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE), based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past decade, tells a rather sobering story. At today's CAPE of 30, the S&P; 500 is 78% higher than its long-term average and priced to lose about 1.5% annually over the next eight years, according to research site GuruFocus.Yet as the old saying goes, the stock market is a market of stocks. While the major market averages are priced to disappoint, some bargains remain. And with the Federal Reserve continuing to pump liquidity into the system for the foreseeable future, the general direction will likely be higher.Today, we're going to look at 15 retirement stocks to buy at still-reasonable prices, even in the post-COVID-19 market. Not all are once-in-a-lifetime buys, but investors can rest assured that they're buying good companies at decent prices - exactly the way you want to build a retirement portfolio.

2020-06-10,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund is preparing to cut staff by about 15% after reporting record losses for the last fiscal year, according to people familiar with the matter.Rajeev Misra, head of the London-based Vision Fund, expanded the number of planned cuts in recent days to as many as 80 employees out of roughly 500, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing personnel decisions. The fund had planned to trim about 10% of its workforce as of last month, Bloomberg News has reported. The cuts may be announced as soon as Wednesday, the person said.SoftBank Group International, an arm led by Marcelo Claure, reduced its staff by about 26 out of 230, said another person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News reported last month that the group’s cuts were expected to be about 10%.SoftBank, led by billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, reported a record operating loss of about $13 billion last month as it wrote down the valuations of companies like WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. In just one year, the Vision Fund went from the main source of booked profits at SoftBank to the biggest contributor to that loss. Son originally said he hoped to raise a new Vision Fund every two to three years, but he has conceded he can’t attract money now because of the poor performance.“SoftBank is good at controlling when to step on the gas pedal and when to pump the brakes,” said Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities. “Many Japanese companies are both cautious to advance and very reluctant to retreat. It makes sense now for the Vision Fund to cut back.”Spokespeople for the Vision Fund and SoftBank Group declined to comment.SoftBank’s businesses were battered early this year with the coronavirus outbreak and its stock tumbled. Son then unveiled plans to buy back stock and pay down debt by selling off about $42 billion in assets, including part of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. SoftBank shares have doubled since their low in March. They were little changed on Wednesday.Separately, Arm Ltd., a chip technology company owned by SoftBank Group, said the chief executive officer of its China joint venture has been replaced. A majority of directors on the board of Arm China voted to remove Allen Wu, the company said.At the Vision Fund, Misra is looking to slice as much as 20% of its costs, the first person familiar with the matter said. The cuts may disproportionately affect staff responsible for supporting portfolio companies, known internally as the operating group, the person said. As many as 18 people in the group will lose their jobs, out of a total of about 50.The focus of the cuts on the operating group raises the question of why it is letting go of staff with the expertise needed to help portfolio companies through the crisis. More than 85% of the fund’s capital has already been spent and the remainder is reserved for follow-on investments, which suggests startup operators will be needed more than dealmakers.Most of the operating group’s members were hired by Claure, SoftBank’s chief operating officer, in 2018 with the goal of helping startups fine-tune their strategies to improve execution and speed their path to profitability. Claure’s mandate put him on a collision path with Misra, who ended up absorbing the team into the Vision Fund in early 2019. Gerry Lopez, a former executive at Starbucks Corp. and PepsiCo Inc., heads the group.SoftBank’s Masa-Misra Partnership Strained by Losses, InfightingSome of the Vision Fund’s staff may transition to positions at SoftBank, the person said. Two of its managing partners are already planning to move into new roles at the Japanese company. Akshay Naheta will become senior vice president, assisting Son in investments and providing strategic advice. Kentaro Matsui will transition to a senior advisory role at SoftBank.The staff cuts come just a week after SoftBank revealed that Misra received a substantial increase in compensation, despite massive losses in the business. The former Deutsche Bank AG trader earned 1.61 billion yen ($15 million) in the year ended March 31, more than double his pay a year earlier. Misra was SoftBank’s second-highest-paid executive in the period, after Claure.SoftBank Group may also see staff departures. About 30 of the 192-person workforce at the Tokyo-based business have submitted resumes seeking jobs to one of Japan’s recruitment agencies, according to another person familiar with the matter.(Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank to Expand Vision Fund Cuts to as Many as 80 Workers

2020-06-12,"Prior to the market selloff 2.0 on June 11, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) was having a tough time getting investors excited. Now that the market appears to be turning over again, PEP stock is flatter than a can of soda that has been left open for a day. But I expect the story for the company to get better once investors get time to catch their breath.Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 1,800 points in late day trading. The market's fear index has climbed over 50%. If the market is forward looking, then investors are beginning to price in what will be in all likelihood disastrous quarterly earnings. PepsiCo Is a Defensive StockThe market may also be starting to price in increasing concerns about a growing second wave of the novel coronavirus. And although I tend to believe that a mass lockdown is not in the plans, there is reason to believe that the economic recovery may begin to slow down. And that means hopes of a short-lived recession are probably a pipe dream.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut that may bode well for PEP stock. Or at least less bad. Soft drinks tend to hold up well during economic downturns. InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto commented on the company's ability to provide consumers with a pick-me-up during difficult times. I can't argue with that premise, but I think the answer comes down to dollars and cents.  * 7 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy and Hold Now Simply put, soft drinks can be less expensive. And for all of our professions of healthy eating, many consumers will place a priority on items that won't damage their budget. Grocery prices have gone up. But in good times and bad, the food that is least healthy for us will always be attractively priced. A Recession Will Shrink Already Tight MarginsThis doesn't mean PepsiCo won't be affected at all. Soft drinks have notoriously thin margins. The fight for shelf space is intense. And Mercer Capital observed that while consumers may continue to buy soft drinks throughout a recession, they are likely to buy them at grocery stores rather than convenience stores or other impulse locations where the prices (and profit margins) are higher.This would seem to support a bearish article about PEP stock that appeared in Seeking Alpha. Based on an analysis of the company's 10-Q statements, the author points out that the soft-drink category is producing the most revenue, but is not contributing very much to overall profits. The article goes on to mention that this is not a one-time occurrence. PepsiCo has been struggling with flat operating profits in the face of modestly increasing revenues. Will PepsiCo Get a Jolt From the Rockstar Brand?In March, PepsiCo announced that it was acquiring Rockstar Energy Beverages for $3.85 billion. The deal isn't that surprising because the two companies had been partnering for a decade. But the addition of Rockstar to go along with the company's agreement to distribute their Bang energy drinks in the United States could provide another source of revenue. What's Next for PEP Stock?PepsiCo reports second-quarter earnings in mid-July. Like many companies, the company withdrew its full-year financial outlook for 2020. That makes revised guidance a point of intense interest for analysts.The earnings report should also provide some additional early results for two new initiatives from its Frito-Lay business. PantryShop.com and Snacks.com launched in May to capture the stay-at-home, e-commerce demand. Since Frito-Lay is providing about 25% of the company's profits, this should be a nice catalyst for the stock price.I'm not expecting the economy to go into another lockdown phase. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said as much. And I don't believe government officials could marshal the solidarity of the U.S. people a second time around.But even if the rest of 2020 is rocky, PepsiCo is well-positioned to continue generating revenue while playing solid defense if necessary. And that means this selloff is looking like a good opportunity to buy PEP stock at a nice discount.Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

2020-06-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Quibi’s day of reckoning is coming. It’s not looking good. When the short-form video app launched in April, Quibi gave users an extra-generous 90 days of free service rather than the typical two-week or one-month trial period. Those 90 days are up beginning July 5, and it’s at that point Quibi will discover how many of its earliest, most enthusiastic signups will become paying customers. So far, all indications are that there won’t be many. Quibi is on pace to have fewer than two million paying subscribers by the end of its first year, only 27% of its original goal, according to a Wall Street Journal article Monday.For Quibi, a startup trying to compete with established media giants in the streaming wars, its first few weeks have been more difficult than most. Quibi’s pitch was that it was taking Netflix Inc.’s reinvention of television viewing one step further: It would be mobile, and its name — an attempt at a clever portmanteau of “quick bites” — alludes to the fact that all the content is split into episodes that are no longer than 10 minutes each. It was looking to attract on-the-go viewers who are short on time. But then, suddenly, no one was going anywhere. The Covid-19 pandemic hit and Quibi quickly bit the dust.While TikTok, YouTube and Instagram are near the top of Apple’s app charts, Quibi is near the bottom. Other services such as Netflix and Disney+, which are more suited to longer periods spent binge-watching on a proper TV set, have also experienced a surge in subscribers during the crisis. It’s not only that Quibi’s short-form videos are more tailored to pre-pandemic life — it’s also that some of its content just isn’t that enticing. As the only app of its kind, it might have been good enough before the crisis, as it wouldn’t necessarily have had to compete head on with Netflix types. But it’s clear now that the company could have produced a better catalog of shows and movies, instead of placing so much emphasis on the app’s use cases and Turnstyle tech feature. In trying to become a mashup of Netflix and Instagram, it borrowed the brevity of social-media content and left out the human-connection aspect just as people were craving more of both. Even as the U.S. reopens, it may be too late for Quibi to spend what would be needed to make another big push at luring subscribers.Built by Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Walt Disney Co. movie veteran who co-founded DreamWorks SKG (with Steven Spielberg), and Meg Whitman, a longtime technology executive known for growing EBay Inc. and leading Hewlett-Packard, there were high hopes for Quibi under their leadership. That didn’t prevent Quibi from becoming a target of ridicule early on in some corners of Twitter for its name and for having the audacity to charge $5 a month while serving advertisements (or $8 without ads). For comparison, Disney+ costs $7 and has no ads. Even so, enough boldface names from Hollywood and the entertainment world had signed on to Quibi to create the sense that it was perhaps an underestimated challenger. There was Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, Idris Elba, Laura Dern, Jon Favreau, Liam Hemsworth, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Chrissy Teigen, Steph Curry, and on and on. Quibi also managed to raise nearly $2 billion from large investors including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and some of the top movie studios. The pandemic’s resulting stay-at-home orders didn’t cause Quibi’s problems as much as they exposed them. The Wall Street Journal article pointed to Katzenberg and Whitman’s clashing leadership styles as one ongoing source of tension. The need to conserve cash is another, with the company’s senior executives taking a 10% pay cut. Some advertisers including PepsiCo Inc., Taco Bell, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and Walmart Inc. are already seeking to renegotiate their terms in part because of concerns over low viewership on Quibi, the article said. The Quibi team saw the app’s Turnstyle feature as a big selling point — “groundbreaking,” as Whitman has described it. When a user rotates their phone between portrait and landscape mode, they get different viewing angles of the same scene. It’s a neat feature, but one that’s just as easy for the average user to overlook or forget about, or just get lazy about using. The company is also facing a patent lawsuit over that same technology, and the suit is being financed by Paul Singer’s hedge fund, Elliott Management Corp. Before its launch, Quibi was the talk of the town, even if it was a punchline in some cases. More than two months into its launch, Quibi is forgettable. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

The eastern Mediterranean region, including the Middle East, represented 10% and Europe had 9.8% of new infections, the WHO said.The United Nations group reported 183,020 cases for the 24 hours through early Sunday, led by Brazil with 54,771 -- the biggest jump by any nation. The U.S. and India followed.The Americas also accounted for almost half of the 461,715 deaths tracked by the agency. The WHO total often lags behind tallies from John Hopkins University, which showed 465,475 deaths on Sunday.California Cases Rise 2.7% (2:20 p.m. NY)California added 4,515 cases, a daily record, bringing the total in the state to 173,824. The number of deaths increased by 71 to 5,495, according to data released Sunday.Hospitalizations in the state rose 2.3% to 3,574 patients.Trump Aides Differ on Testing Remark (1:40 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump at his Oklahoma rally said health testing for the virus is a “double-edged sword,” so he urged staff to “slow the testing down,” a comment his trade adviser called a joke while his homeland security chief described it as a sign of frustration.“That was tongue in cheek, please,” trade adviser Peter Navarro said on CNN’s “State of the Union. “It was a light moment, OK?” Navarro also said the government is filling the stockpile for a possible outbreak later this year. “I am not saying it’s going to happen, but of course you prepare it.”Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on CBS’s “Face the Nation” said Trump was expressing “frustration” about tests and rising infections. “We’ve tested more than any other country in this world. Instead, the press and others, all they want to focus on is an increasing case count.”Dubai Opens to Tourists July 7 (12:40 p.m. NY)Dubai will allow tourists into the Middle East business hub starting July 7 for the first time since the United Arab Emirates imposed travel restrictions to stem the outbreak.“Tourists required to present recent Covid-19 negative certificate or undergo testing at Dubai airports,” the Dubai Media Office said on Sunday.The city also will allow residents stuck abroad to begin returning on Monday. Citizens and residents can resume outbound travel from June 23, according to a tweet.Spain Gets Foreign Visitors (12:20 p.m. NY)Spain’s cases rose to 246,272 as the first visitors from the European Union and the U.K. entered the country as some travel restrictions were lifted.In the past 24 hours, 141 infections were detected, the Health Ministry said on its website. A total of 29 deaths were reported in the past seven days, compared with 36 in Saturday’s seven-day tally, and the toll stands at 28,323.Visitors from the EU, the Schengen area and the U.K. were able to enter Spain on Sunday after the government ended its state of emergency declared in March.Italy Cases Slow (12:05 p.m. NY)Italy registered 224 new cases compared with 262 on Saturday, based on figures released by the country’s civil protection agency. Total cases climbed to 238,499.Lombardy reported 128 cases, or 57% of the national count; the region around Milan said last week that most new cases refer to past infections that are detected by increased testing.Deaths rose by 24 compared with 49 Saturday, for a toll of 34,634.U.S. Tracing Plan ‘Random’: Researcher (11:45 a.m. NY)The U.S. lacks a clear plan for tracking the transmission of the coronavirus and to act to slow further spread, said Michael Osterholm, director for the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.“We don’t have, even at a local level necessarily, the kind of plans that say, ‘this is what we’re going to do to get shut down transmission,’” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It’s almost, in some ways, seems random.”The virus has a life of its own: “I don’t see this slowing down through the summer or end of the fall,” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to see one, two and three waves. I think we’re going to just see one very difficult forest fire of cases.”Cuomo Faults Trump on Response (11:30 a.m. NY)Governor Andrew Cuomo faulted the Trump administration’s response to the outbreak, which he described as a type of “schizophrenia” with many officials, including the president, minimizing the risks.“This was a federal crisis, the federal government should step in, aggressively, and own it,” the New York governor said on CBS’s “Sunday Morning.” “In my state, I owned the situation for better or worse. It was always a schizophrenia from the federal government. They would help when pushed to help.”Cuomo also said “it was a mistake” for Trump to decline to wear a mask, but pressed on whether it was the president’s mistake, he said: “The history books are going to have to decide.”Florida Cases Rise 3.7% (10:40 a.m. NY)Florida reported 97,291 Covid-19 cases on Saturday, up 3.7% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 3.5% in the previous seven days. Deaths among Florida residents reached 3,161, an increase of 0.5%. On Saturday, the state reported a one-day record 4,049 new cases.Protests Haven’t Added to Spread: Hopkins (10 a.m. NY)Initial studies suggest protests after George Floyd’s death haven’t seemed to increase the rate of spread of the coronavirus, but Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said it was too soon to rule out the events as a source of infections.“We know from what we’ve seen so far in the last few months that outdoors is less of a risk than indoors and that mask use has a major impact,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”The rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday is concerning, he said, because people were sitting close together, few wore masks and hands were being shaken without sanitizing. “All of those things will increase the risk of spread. We have seen in the past few months around the world that indoor gatherings have been the source of most super-spreading events.”Portugal Steps Up Lisbon Testing (8:36 a.m. NY)Portugal reported 292 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the total to 39,133, the government said. Daily new cases have ranged between 192 and 421 in June. The additional cases are mostly in the greater Lisbon region, where authorities have increased testing after new clusters were identified. The total number of hospitalized patients and cases in intensive care units both fell.Netanyahu Warns of Second Lockdown (5:28 p.m. HK)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel may have to renew its lockdown. More than 20,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Israel, including 305 fatalities. The number of cases has steadily risen, from less than 17,000 a month ago, after restrictions were significantly eased and many people ignored instructions to wear masks and maintain social distancing.“If we don’t change our behavior immediately, and began to wear masks and keep a distance from each other, the lockdowns will return,” Netanyahu said. “None of us want that.”Recovered Patients Test Positive in Study (4:42 p.m. HK)In Denmark, a study of 200 patients who had recovered from Covid-19 showed that about 20% of them tested positive for the coronavirus four weeks or more after they had been declared healthy, TV2 reported. Scientists from the Aarhus Universtity said the preliminary results could indicate that the virus has somehow been “re-activated,” but there’s nothing to suggest the patients might be contagious, said Martin Tolstrup, the doctor behind the study. The scientists will now conduct new tests to determine whether the virus is still active in the patients’ bodies.Germany’s Infection Rate Rises (2:16 p.m. HK)The reproduction factor of the virus, known as R-naught, rose to 1.79 on Saturday compared with 1.06 the day before, according to the latest daily report by German health body, the Robert Koch Institute. There were 371 new infections in the 24 hours through Sunday morning, bringing the total to 190,670, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That compares with 439 on average over the past seven days and almost 7,000 at the peak of the pandemic in late March.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Cases Rise 1.2%; Dutch Protest Turns Violent: Virus Update

2020-06-22,"(Bloomberg) -- China suspended poultry imports from a Tyson Foods Inc. plant where hundreds of employees tested positive for Covid-19, stoking concerns over the broader implications for U.S. and global meat exports.All products from the plant in Springdale, Arkansas, where Tyson is based, that are about to arrive in China or have arrived at the country’s ports will be seized by customs. The suspension announced Sunday is an about face from just a few days ago, when Chinese officials said food was unlikely to be responsible for a fresh virus outbreak in Beijing.The move is a potential new threat to meat plants across the world that have seen slaughter disruptions because of the virus. In the U.S., hundreds of workers have become ill, and dozens have died. There’s also been a recent uptick in infections at facilities in Brazil and Germany.“There are worries in China over serious coronavirus outbreaks in the U.S.,” said Lin Guofa, a senior analyst at Bric Agriculture Group, a Beijing-based consulting firm. The public is worried about imported frozen products as almost all cases in Beijing have been connected to a meat and frozen fish wholesale market, he said.A new outbreak in China had been blamed on imported salmon after the head of a food market where clusters were detected said the virus had been traced to a chopping board used by a fish seller. Fears over whether food can transmit viruses had led salmon to be boycotted in the Asian country.Trade DisruptionIf China continues to suspend shipments based on coronavirus cases reported at processing plants, it could also threaten to undermine promised agricultural purchases as part of the Washington-Beijing trade deal.Tyson said in a statement Sunday it was looking into the report and cited that the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there’s no evidence that virus transmission is associated with food. The company late Friday said 13% of its workers tested positive for the virus at plants in northwest Arkansas.Tyson’s shares fell as much as 3.5% Monday morning in New York. Lean hog futures in Chicago slumped as much as 3.9%, with the most-active August contract hitting a record low.China had backed off from its previous stance linking food to virus cases. A customs official at a briefing on Friday said the country was taking the advice of international organizations that there’s a low risk of imported food transmitting the virus, and no food restrictions would be imposed.But the move to block the Tyson shipments runs counter to that, and reverts the country back to increasing its scrutiny over imported food. Meanwhile, a German abattoir last week voluntarily halted pork exports to China after workers were found to be infected.China’s customs department said over the weekend that one poultry company in Britain reported Covid-19 cases. While the U.K. isn’t allowed to export poultry to the Asian nation, its authorities have agreed to take measures to prevent the virus from contaminating pork and beef exports to China, and will inform the Asian nation whenever exporters have any outbreaks.Testing ImportsChina’s customs authorities had started testing all shipments of imported meat for the virus, while officials in some major cities were also checking the products at domestic markets. In a statement last week, China Customs said all 32,174 samples of imported seafood, meat, vegetables, fruit and other related products had tested negative.The country’s scrutiny may end up having a big impact on global food shipments. Its surging imports of meat had helped to buoy U.S. and Brazilian producers of poultry, pork and beef, both before the nation’s virus outbreak in January and as global trade has staged a nascent recovery in recent weeks with the country exiting lockdowns.Through April, U.S. exports of poultry meat and products, excluding eggs, to China were valued at $152 million, up from only about $7 million in the comparable period in 2019, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.Still, China’s market is facing a chicken surplus from its own production and stagnating demand, Bric Agriculture’s Lin said. China also imports most of its poultry from Brazil, while the U.S. makes up just a small percentage of imports, therefore the halt will have little impact on the domestic market, he said.On Sunday, PepsiCo China said it shut a food plant in the Chinese capital after a case of the virus was confirmed earlier in the week. The company conducted tests on all employees at the plant and quarantined 480 workers, even though they all tested negative, one of its officials, Fan Zhimin, said at a local government briefing. PepsiCo China later said in a WeChat post that none of its beverage plants in the country have reported any cases of the virus.(Updates with share prices in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Beijing’s Latest Virus Outbreak Disrupts Tyson Foods and PepsiCo
2020-06-23,"Steve Stoute, founder and CEO of Translation and UnitedMasters told Yahoo Finance that the advertising industry 'puts people into boxes.&quot;",The advertising business incentivizes segregation: industry veteran
2020-06-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When it comes to responding to the current reckoning on racial injustice, a trio of outdoorsy retailers are blazing a trail their industry peers should follow. Patagonia, REI and VF Corp.’s North Face have in recent days committed to temporarily yanking advertising from Facebook and Instagram as part of a campaign to pressure the Silicon Valley social-media titan to do more to curb hate speech and language promoting violence on its platform. A coalition of civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, are behind the effort, which aims to get businesses to pause their spending on Facebook ads for the month of July. If companies are serious about finding ways to champion the Black Lives Matter movement, then surely they know earnest tweets and carefully-worded corporate statements are not enough. Flexing their corporate muscle to give Facebook a much-needed nudge, though, takes things a step further.  After recent events, Facebook has said it is actively considering revising a number of its policies and products, including reviewing how it handles content that violates or partially violates its rules. To this point, though, moral overtures from lawmakers and activists haven’t dramatically changed the compass by which Facebook navigates these issues, even though staying its course, at this point, is itself something of a political act. But maybe it would feel more urgency to change if the pressure were financial, not philosophical.   Plus, I like that this particular approach to supporting the Black Lives Matter movement encourages consumer companies to take an action that would be felt outside the walls of their own corporate headquarters. One of the more common ways of responding to the recent social unrest is for companies to make new commitments around diversifying their workforces, with the likes of PepsiCo Inc., Gap Inc. and Adidas AG among the companies that have done so. This is absolutely the right thing to do; maybe making such overhauls earlier would have led Pepsi to dump the obviously offensive Aunt Jemima brand long before last week. With a campaign of financial pressure on Facebook, corporate participants are extending their influence outside in a push for key business partners to embrace the same values. In that way, this effort has something in common with the 15 Percent Pledge, a nascent effort to get retailers to commit to ensuring that 15% of products on their shelves come from Black-owned businesses. This, too, has the potential to catalyze small changes all throughout the consumer goods supply chain. Sephora and Rent The Runway have gotten on board with this initiative, and I’d urge other big names to do the same. I suppose consumer brands might resist a temporary flight from Facebook because they believe that, whatever the politics of the moment, it is irresponsible not to do everything they can to win customers’ dollars right now after Covid-19-related closures have just dealt their revenues a devastating blow. However, they should instead think of a Facebook ad hiatus as a way of being on the right side of history while conserving a bit of cash. If that is not impetus enough, consumer giants should keep in mind that public opinion has shifted dramatically in recent weeks toward supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. That suggests most brands aren’t taking a major reputational risk by asking Facebook to do more. Of course, there are reasons to be skeptical that briefly keeping ad dollars away from Facebook will have much impact. With Facebook’s $71 billion in revenue last year, it would take big names and big numbers for this campaign to have even a tiny impact on the social media company’s income statement. And history doesn’t offer many good analogies to evaluate whether or not something like this might work. Still, it’s worthwhile for big consumer brands to try. Cleaning up Facebook would go a long way toward extinguishing hate speech and racist rhetoric in America, and big advertisers have unique leverage to try to make it happen. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Albertsons Cos. emerged from 14 years of private ownership by Cerberus Capital Management with a whimper Friday, as its shares sagged after a shrunken initial public offering.The stock opened in New York at $15.50 each having priced at $16, below the targeted price range of $18 to $20. Private equity firm Cerberus and other backers of the supermarket chain sold just 50 million shares to raise $800 million, having earlier offered 65.8 million shares to potential investors.The shares never rose more than 3.1% Friday and closed down 3.4% to $15.45 in New York, giving Albertsons a market value of about $7.4 billion.While the coronavirus pandemic has boosted the grocer’s business, the company had total debt of $8.7 billion as of its last fiscal year, according to its filings. That makes it more levered than U.S. supermarket rivals Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. and Grocery Outlet Holding Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s also behind rivals like Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co. in rolling out popular services like free curbside pickup of online orders.Chief Executive Officer Vivek Sankaran, a former PepsiCo Inc. executive who took the top job last year, said in an interview the company has gained market share in recent months thanks to a “significant increase” in new shoppers, both in-store and online, as Americans shifted to consume more food at home. He said the company will invest more to accelerate its e-commerce business, which grew 278% in the first 12 weeks of its fiscal year. Albertsons’ own private-label food brands, four of which generate more than $1 billion in sales, are another opportunity for growth, he said.Albertsons’ public debut came after a failed attempt five years ago. In 2015, the company filed for a listing to raise as much as $1.7 billion before postponing and eventually withdrawing that plan. A multibillion-dollar merger with Rite Aid Corp. was scrapped in 2018 after opposition to the deal ahead of a shareholder vote, leaving Cerberus again searching for an exit.The IPO was the first in the U.S. to price below its marketed range since GFL Environmental Inc.’s $1.4 billion offering on March 3.Grocery, SoftwareAlbertsons’ disappointing showing contrasted with the U.S. trading debut of communications software company Agora Inc., which priced its shares above its marketed range to raise $350 million on Thursday. Showing the continuing strength of technology listings, Agora shares rose as much as 179% from the offer price. The shares closed up 153% to $51.50 in New York trading, giving the company a market value of $4.1 billion.For the year ended Feb. 29, Albertsons earned $466 million on revenue of more than $62 billion, compared with a loss of $502 million on revenue of $59 billion in fiscal 2015, according to its filings.Albertsons’ business might have stabilized, but limited new store openings could make it difficult to keep growing revenue, and put rivals at an advantage, Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior analyst Jennifer Bartashus wrote in a report. It may also be difficult for Albertsons to gain market share as it trails key peers in e-commerce, Bartashus said.Analysts at Jefferies predicted in March, as the Covid-19 pandemic kept people away from restaurants, that “frenzied food-at-home buying” could add $90 billion in revenue to the packaged food industry over three months. But many shoppers have been choosing online deliveries over trying to stay socially distant in the supermarket aisles. Instacart Inc.’s valuation, for example, hit $13.7 billion in a funding round after the popularity of the grocery delivery service exploded, up from the the $7.9 billion value it fetched in 2018.Cerberus StakeNew York-based Cerberus first invested in Albertsons in 2006 in a $17.4 billion acquisition alongside CS Corp. and Supervalu Inc., neither of which remain investors. Based on a larger IPO planned earlier, Cerberus’s stake was to be trimmed to 31% from 37% after the listing. Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons won’t receive any proceeds in this week’s share sale.Apollo Global Management Inc. put in $1.75 billion in Albertsons in May through a preferred stock offering, equal to a 17.5% stake in the grocer after the conversion.U.S. IPOs have snapped back in June after equity market volatility killed off deals in March and April. A total of $13.2 billion was raised from 31 listings this month alone, including a $2.5 billion offering from Royalty Pharma Plc and Warner Music Group Corp.’s $1.9 billion deal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. June is set to be the fifth busiest month for U.S. IPO in the past decade including Albertsons’ listing, the data show.The grocer’s listing was led by Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.

2020-06-28,"(Bloomberg) -- A growing list of Facebook Inc.’s advertisers is set to halt spending on social media, undermining the company’s sales outlook and putting its stock price under further pressure.Starbucks Corp., Levi Strauss & Co., PepsiCo Inc. and Diageo Plc were among the most recent companies to say they’re curtailing ad spending, part of an exodus aimed at pushing Facebook and its peers to suppress posts that glorify violence, divide and disinform the public, and promote racism and discrimination.No single company can significantly dent growth at Facebook, which generated $17.7 billion in revenue last quarter alone. But a rising tally adds to pressure on other brands to follow suit, and when combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook deepens.“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”As more brands publicize plans to join boycotts or otherwise rein in ad spending, Facebook shares remain under pressure. The stock tumbled 8.3% Friday after Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would halt spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion. Shares closed at $216.08 Friday after reaching a record $242.24 the preceding Tuesday.Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner noted in an April earnings call the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll-back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in marketing spending. Facebook will eke out 1% revenue growth in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, according to analysts’ current projections, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.Starbucks said Sunday that it would pause spending on all social media platforms while it carries out talks internally, with media partners and civil rights groups “in the effort to stop the spread of hate speech.”Trump PostsWhile some companies are targeting social media generally, including Twitter Inc., many are singling out Facebook specifically. Zuckerberg has been more reticent to put limits on discourse, notably controversial posts by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying that he doesn’t want Facebook to be an arbiter of what’s true.That’s prompted a consortium of civil rights and other advocacy groups, including Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, to urge advertisers to stop spending on Facebook-owned platforms for July to protest the company’s policies.Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism, saying that Facebook would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub. The social network also expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech for advertising.“We understand people want to put pressure on Facebook to do more,” Facebook vice president Nick Clegg said Sunday on CNN’s Reliable Sources. “That’s why we made those additional announcements in Friday. That’s why we’ll continue to redouble our efforts, because, you know, we have a zero tolerance approach to hate speech.”The Anti-Defamation League called the changes “small.”The stampede of advertisers, combined with lobbying from civil rights groups, leaves Zuckerberg in a bind. He could take further steps to curtail harmful content, but that risks alienating free-speech advocates and supporters of Trump who have argued that Facebook is censoring political discourse and suppressing conservative voices.Distinct ExodusHe could also stand pat on a bet that this advertising pause will be short-lived, as have social media ad boycotts in the past. But this exodus as distinct, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil rights groups, he said. “The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”Will Zuckerberg budge? While major brands like Unilever and Coca-Cola have garnered most of the headlines, the vast majority of Facebook’s 8 million advertisers are small businesses, many of which rely heavily on Facebook advertising for sales. Some in the ad industry don’t believe that these businesses, particularly those in commerce and direct-to-consumer sales, can actually afford to halt spending.“Pulling off for a whole month would really hurt their business,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said earlier this week. “It’s a lot to ask for.”In its outreach to advertisers last week, Facebook has said it doesn’t intend to make decisions based on sales. “We have been consistent that we do not make policy changes tied to revenue pressure,” Facebook said on Wednesday in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. “We set our policies based on principles rather than business interests.”Whatever additional moves Facebook makes, there’s reason to believe the departure of advertisers won’t end soon. “Advertisers who have seen their own ads published against hateful, horrible content on Facebook -- racist, anti-Semitic poison -- they are finally saying ‘enough’,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Our phones have been ringing off the hook with advertisers.

2020-07-05,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, Facebook Inc. brushed off complaints from civil rights groups that it didn’t do enough to combat racism, discrimination and voter suppression flourishing on its site. Now, pressure from a boycott by major advertisers is forcing the social media giant to address their concerns.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to meet on Tuesday with leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change to discuss their requests. Facebook is increasingly playing defense against a growing group of civil rights organizations, employees and companies demanding that the technology giant do more to fight injustice on its platform.“Right now is a moment of real reckoning for the company,” said Vanita Gupta, chief executive officer of The Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights. “There’s a lot of pressure.”The advocates led the campaign to persuade advertisers including Starbucks Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. to halt spending on the platform, focusing attention on Facebook’s policies as public outrage swells over racial inequities in America following the shocking video of the death of George Floyd in police custody.Civil rights groups have long been asking Facebook to make policy and staffing changes to address their grievances. Concerns have included how the platform has promoted discriminatory advertising, allowed foreign adversaries to try to suppress the Black vote, and let white supremacy groups organize rallies.Leaders of the groups said their efforts to get the social media platform to change have often been only given lip-service, and, at times, even attacked.Facebook declined to comment, but pointed to an announcement Friday that it will attach to posts about voting a link to an information portal that explains how and when users can vote and how to register. The company has set a goal of helping to register 4 million new voters before the presidential election.Increasing ScrutinyFacebook is also under increasing scrutiny in Washington. Zuckerberg has agreed to testify before a House antitrust panel along with CEOs of other large technology platforms and the company faces antitrust investigations by two federal agencies and nearly all 50 states.Gupta and other advocates said Facebook has improved its response to concerns about Census misinformation and has curtailed discriminatory ads, but has fallen short in fighting voter suppression, election misinformation and moderating political speech.“They are making many of the changes at our urging, but are missing the core piece,” Gupta said, pointing to Zuckerberg’s insistence on leaving misleading political speech unchecked because he deems the content newsworthy.Gupta was on a call with Zuckerberg last month, along with Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, and Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, to discuss Facebook’s plans to prepare for the upcoming elections. Donald Trump had recently threatened on social media to withhold funding from Michigan over the state’s mail-in balloting plans. When Gupta questioned Facebook’s policy on political speech, Zuckerberg told her Trump’s posts represented hard “edge cases,” she recalls. Gupta said she disagreed and told him “at every turn you should be making the decision to weigh in favor of fair elections and protecting voting rights.”Civil rights advocates had been contacting Facebook as early as 2017 about issues such as hate speech and election interference, but intensified their outreach following reports that Russian operatives had exploited Facebook and other platforms to suppress Black voting, stir social unrest and help Trump win the 2016 election.Madihha Ahussain, a special counsel for Washington-based group Muslim Advocates, said that while her group initially thought they were making progress with Facebook over anti-Muslim posts, they began to realize the company wasn’t taking systematic action. They were “just listening to us and nothing is changing on the platform itself,” Ahussain said. “We were just getting the runaround.”For Robinson, the turning point came in November 2018, when he got a call from a New York Times reporter asking him to comment on startling revelations: Facebook had hired Definers Public Affairs, a former Republican-linked firm, to compile opposition research about billionaire investor George Soros’s funding of groups that were critical of Facebook -- including Color of Change -- and circulate it to reporters. Soros had attacked Facebook earlier that year as a menace to society.“It became very clear that we had to reset the terms of the relationship,” with Facebook, said Robinson. “We knew that we must have been on to something if they were trying to spend their money to discredit us.”The advocates sent an open letter to Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg calling for the creation of a C-suite position to advocate for users’ needs and work with civil rights groups. They also sought more transparency about a civil rights audit the company had initiated.Facebook fired Definers and Sandberg later apologized in a meeting with the advocates. Facebook tapped Laura Murphy, a veteran at the American Civil Liberties Union, to do the audit and agreed to release the results.Election War RoomMeanwhile, the groups were growing increasingly concerned that Facebook wasn’t prepared to spot and eliminate voter-suppression campaigns or misinformation on its platform ahead of the 2018 midterms.About two months before the election, groups including the National Urban League and the NAACP traveled to Facebook’s headquarters in Silicon Valley to see its election “war room” and discuss its election-integrity plan with company officials, including Sandberg, said LaShawn Warren, executive vice president of government affairs at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which also attended.To Warren, the Facebook team seemed more focused on eliminating inaccurate information about poll locations and opening and closing times than it was in detecting more sophisticated ways bad actors could try to dissuade voters. Her group pressed Facebook to hire more people with voter-suppression expertise.On Dec. 18 2018, Facebook released an update from Murphy detailing what Facebook had done. Facebook had also hired voting experts to help with its election-integrity work.It wasn’t enough for the groups. That same day, more than 30 organizations representing civil rights advocates, big tech critics and liberal causes wrote a letter expressing “profound disappointment regarding Facebook’s role in generating bigotry and hatred toward vulnerable communities” and called for Zuckerberg and Sandberg to step down from the board.They didn’t step down, but Sandberg and other Facebook officials continued to talk with civil rights groups about their complaints. Sandberg met with advocates and members of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington in May 2019.Facebook won praise from the groups for its plan to ban content that misrepresents the 2020 U.S. Census, but tensions flared again in October of last year around Zuckerberg’s speech at Georgetown University, in which he defended the company’s policy to not fact-checking political ads. He extolled the platform’s fight to uphold free speech, citing protests against the Vietnam War and Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”Zuckerberg had previewed his remarks during a phone call with at least one civil rights leader who expressed concern that his emphasis on free speech could come at the expense of civil rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. The leader told Zuckerberg that Facebook’s top executives had no civil rights experience. The co-founder responded that he had a lot of former President Barack Obama people on staff, the person said. The leader also cautioned him against invoking Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point, the person said.Zuckerberg’s speech won praise from conservatives, but criticism from civil rights advocates including King’s daughter, Bernice King, who argued that Facebook was avoiding reforming its content-moderation practices.Just before the speech, Politico reported that since July 2019, Zuckerberg had been meeting with prominent conservative thinkers, including commentator Ben Shapiro, Brent Bozell and Fox News host Tucker Carlson.Facebook was increasingly facing criticism for catering to conservatives in its polices and rhetoric. It was only after news broke about Zuckerberg’s meetings with right-leaning pundits that he invited the civil rights advocates to a dinner at his Palo Alto, California, home in November 2019.“I did feel that Zuckerberg listened to us,” said Ifill of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, who was at the dinner. “Listening is not quite the same, you know, as being willing to actually make change.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Confronts Civil Rights Complaints It Put Off for Years

2020-07-10,PepsiCo will report earnings on Monday. The charts point to a tightening range that will hopefully be resolved by the quarterly results.,PepsiCo Reports Earnings Monday - Here's How the Chart Looks
2020-07-10,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Earnings season is at hand. The earnings calendar picks up next week, as big banks and major consumer names report.The releases come at an interesting time for the market. Tech continues to soar, but elsewhere the news is mixed. The S&P 500 actually is down 2% over the past month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has performed even worse.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMore broadly, the rally since March certainly has not been popular. It's difficult to remember any stretch that better illustrates the old metaphor of stocks climbing a &quot;wall of worry.&quot; The question is whether earnings next week, or through the rest of earnings season, will change the market's trajectory.Indeed, first-quarter reports in April and May don't seem to have moved the market all that much. In many cases, investors simply shrugged at corporate earnings. Weak results were expected, companies delivered in kind, and the focus remained on the recovery.But with novel coronavirus cases in the U.S. rising, and a clear divergence between growth and value, tech and industrial, second-quarter reports may be different. Expectations likely are higher. Investors may forgive another round of soft results, but they will be looking for concrete signs of progress going forward.It's not clear that U.S. companies will deliver. Market bears have been waiting for a catalyst to undercut this rally, and that catalyst could be on the way.  * The 7 Best Stocks to Invest in Right Now From that perspective, earnings next week can provide a preview of what's to come. There are some big companies reporting, with these seven releases the key ones to watch:  * PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)  * JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)  * Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)  * Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  * Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) Earnings Reports to Watch: PepsiCo (PEP)Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Monday, July 13, before market openIt's the diversification of the business that makes PepsiCo earnings particularly interesting. Between the beverage and snack segments, PepsiCo has exposure across several major channels. On Monday, we should get an update on grocery demand as stay-at-home orders are lifted, and color on restaurant and takeout sales for the beverage business.But it's also a big report for PepsiCo stock itself, for one key reason: The stock hasn't moved. PEP has traded almost perfectly sideways, and in a tight range, since early April.That in turn makes the reaction to earnings interesting. Does any sort of news, even a soft quarter (analysts are expecting sales to decline almost 7%), drive the stock higher simply due to the fact that it clarifies the story? Or are expectations still too high, even for a stock moving sideways? The first key report of the week poses an interesting test for the market. JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, July 14, before market openThe biggest earnings news next week will come from the big banks. Tuesday sees releases from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) follows on Wednesday, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reporting the following day.For the group as a whole, the question is if earnings can re-inspire confidence. JPMorgan probably needs to lead the way, given a long history of earnings beats and its status as the most valuable of the big banks.But with interest rates back at zero and concerns about defaults in consumer and business loans, the big banks simply need to convince investors that the current crisis is manageable. If they do so, there's room for a rally in a group whose shares generally are down at least one-third so far this year.And, of course, confidence from big banks could echo across the market. Investors have bid up stocks even with the threat of a mid-term recession looming. If that threat seems less likely amid positive commentary from the largest financial institutions, there could be more room for the market as a whole to run. Delta Air Lines (DAL)Source: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, July 14, before market openThe travel industry desperately needs some good news. Rising pandemic fears have led the sector to pull back in recent weeks. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS) at one point had doubled from its lows, but has declined about one-third from early June highs.We'll see if Delta can deliver that good news. Personally, I'm skeptical. Despite being optimistic toward the industry at the beginning of the year, I still see pain ahead for airlines. Leverage in the business and on the balance sheet suggests share prices can keep falling. Travel demand, particularly on the business side, isn't returning any time soon.Still, it's possible Delta can change the mind of skeptics like myself. Expectations certainly are at rock-bottom. Any positive commentary from management likely would make headlines. I don't believe Delta is going to post much of a surprise on Tuesday, but if it does, it will be more than just DAL stock that rises as a result. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 16, before market openJohnson & Johnson delivers one of two big healthcare earnings releases, with UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) reporting on Wednesday.For J&J, the release is an opportunity to stem a fading share price. JNJ stock actually touched an all-time high in late April after snapping back from March declines. Since then, the stock has given back about 9%.A solid report could be enough to keep a recent bounce going. But as with PEP, the market's reaction to the report will be interesting.It would seem like a defensive business would be catching a bid in such a time of uncertainty, yet JNJ shares are sliding. If investors see that slide as an opportunity after earnings, it should bode well for companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) when they report in coming weeks. Domino's Pizza (DPZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 16, before market openSecond-quarter earnings from Domino's should be more important than Domino's $15 billion market capitalization might suggest. Particularly in concert with results from Pepsi, we'll get a better picture of how consumers have reacted in the last few weeks.For Domino's, too, this is a big report. Shares have run into resistance repeatedly in recent months, albeit at all-time highs. With the stock trading at 31x forward earnings, profits are going to have to come in well above expectations for DPZ stock to break out. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 16, after market closeInvestors who believe the rally in tech needs to cool off may get some confirmation from Netflix earnings on Thursday afternoon. Netflix incredibly has a market capitalization that now dwarfs that of Disney (NYSE:DIS). The stock trades at 60x next year's consensus earnings estimates, and free cash flow multiples are even higher.To be sure, NFLX stock is a pandemic winner. But at some point, that tailwind has to be priced in. With shares up 57% already in 2020, Netflix has added over $80 billion in market value this year. It's fair to wonder if the rally has to run out of steam at some point.Meanwhile, expectations are going to be high, particularly on the subscriber front. With literally billions of people stuck at home, Netflix had an unprecedented opportunity to pick up subscribers.If Netflix was able to capitalize on that opportunity, and NFLX stock still rallies after earnings, that bodes well for other dearly valued names as earnings season rolls on. Anything less, however, and NFLX stock could have a long way to fall -- while providing some ammunition for market skeptics on its way down. Ericsson (ERIC)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Friday, July 17, before market openInvestors won't be the only ones listening to commentary from Ericsson on Friday morning. The Swedish telecommunications manufacturer is embroiled in world geopolitics. The U.S. government reportedly is looking to back Ericsson and Finnish rival Nokia (NYSE:NOK) as they compete against China's Huawei.It would seem unlikely that Ericsson management will have much to say about the political situation on Friday. But its commentary about the 5G rollout amidst the pandemic will be closely watched by investors across the space.After all, it's possible the pandemic could accelerate 5G demand as data usage increases. But governments and telecommunications providers may also pause their plans as they deal with the economic impact of the current crisis.Investors in stocks like Nokia, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) thus will be listening closely to Ericsson's commentary on Friday. I'd expect the news will be good, as I remain bullish on ERIC stock. But the question might be whether the news is good enough to move other stocks as well.After spending time at a retail brokerage, Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-07-13,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. reported a stronger-than-expected spring as homebound consumers looking for comfort stocked up on snack foods -- and its current-quarter forecast was even more bullish.As Covid-19 raged across the U.S., Americans seeking out familiar flavors filled their shelves with salty, crunchy treats, driving double-digit sales growth for brands like Tostitos, Fritos and Cheetos. Even newer snacks like fruit-chips line Bare and Off The Eaten Path, a maker of black bean and chickpea crisps, saw double-digit growth. Beverage sales were one key weakness, as both in-restaurant and grab-and-go gas station sales lagged during the lockdowns.“Consumer eating habits continue to evolve with consumers spending more time at home, which benefits the at-home breakfast, snacking and dinner occasions,” Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta said in pre-recorded remarks about the second quarter.PepsiCo shares rose 2.3% at 11:30 a.m. in New York after an earlier gain of as much as 2.7%. The stock was little changed this year through Friday.As one of the first big packaged-food companies reporting results for the spring months, PepsiCo is being closely watched by investors for a look at how consumers are responding to 2020’s upheaval. The company is well-positioned because of its high global share of the market for snack foods, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.And snack foods, it seems, carried the North American consumer through a difficult quarter. Ruffles potato chip brand saw high-single-digit growth, while oatmeal line Quaker’s organic revenue spiked 23% in the quarter. The snack and beverage giant sees the trend toward more breakfast meals at home remaining strong after the pandemic subsides, and the company said it has marketing plans to retain any new Quaker customers it picked up during the quarantines.With an increase in online grocery shopping, PepsiCo said its 5-year-old e-commerce business is projected to have $3 billion in sales this year, up from about $2 billion last year. While it’s not yet clear how much of the gains will be sustainable, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said on a call with analysts “we’re prepared for it to stay large.”Other packaged-food companies have been pummeled by Wall Street after reporting strong spring quarters, since investors didn’t see signs they could hold onto the gains. But PepsiCo says it’s optimistic it can capitalize on these new buying habits.In fact, after reporting a 0.3% slide in the latest period for organic revenue, a closely watched indicator of growth, the owner of the Mountain Dew and Doritos brands said that metric will turn positive in the current quarter, predicting a low-single-digit boost. The company said it still won’t make an outlook for 2020.“As we look ahead for North America, we expect our overall business to perform well, assuming there is no large-scale disruption in economic activity or population mobility as a result of the recent surge in Covid-19 infections in many markets,” Laguarta said. “With this in mind, we expect our snacks and food businesses to remain resilient, albeit with some moderation in growth while our beverage businesses should deliver better performance during the second half of this year.”(Updates with details on e-commerce sales in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",PepsiCo Gains After Fritos-Hungry Buyers Stock Up on Comfort

2020-07-13,"Shares of PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) moved higher by 0.32% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt PepsiCo has.PepsiCo's Debt Based on PepsiCo's financial statement as of July 13, 2020, long-term debt is at $38.37 billion and current debt is at $6.61 billion, amounting to $44.98 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $8.93 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $36.05 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering PepsiCo's $89.53 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.5. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * PepsiCo: Q2 Earnings Insights  * Earnings Scheduled For July 13, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

It is the largest ever multistate action on clean transportation in the U.S.Thirty-seven major companies and investors have endorsed the agreement, among them DHL Express U.S, IKEA, and PepsiCo.&quot;Transportation impacts our business, our customers and our supply chain every day,&quot; said Steven Moelk, fulfillment project implementation manager at IKEA Retail U.S., in a press release.IKEA aims to have 100% of home deliveries made in zero-emission vehicles by 2025, Moelk said, and the MOU will help increase the availability of and access to medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles, &quot;which are essential to helping us achieve our goals.&quot;The PlanIn a preview of the multistate agreement, Kathy Kinsey told FreightWaves last week that the collaboration will develop and implement a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) action plan for commercial trucks to support a market transition. Kinsey is the senior policy adviser for the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), a nonprofit facilitating the group effort. She said the group will focus on &quot;market-enabling&quot; initiatives including incentives and outreach to identify and address cost, fueling infrastructure, and other barriers to electric truck adoption.The clean truck solutions could also include regulatory measures, such as the Advanced Clean Truck rule, a California rule approved in June that will require truck manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of electric vehicles starting in 2024.Although the MOU is a collaborative one, each state will ultimately decide for itself how it wants to implement the plan, according to Kinsey.Support From Shippers Earlier this month, the 37 businesses and investors sent a statement of support to the participating states' governors. The letter highlighted the long-term cost savings and benefits that can be captured by shifting to zero-emission commercial vehicles, as well as policy innovation as a necessary element to expedite the market transition. &quot;With ever more urgency as businesses navigate a shifting economy and business model in the wake of COVID-19, we support the MOU and forthcoming rulemaking as a means to strengthen the clean transportation market, boost economic development, and improve public health,&quot; the businesses wrote in the letter.Greg Hewitt, CEO of DHL Express U.S., said in the release that DHL &quot;understands the economic and health risks of climate change and transportation-related air pollution.&quot; That is why the company has committed to operating 70% of our first and last mile services with zero-emission solutions globally by 2025, Hewitt said.&quot;Transportation and logistics companies are an important part of the solution, and policies that support the uptake of electric and zero-emission vehicles present a significant opportunity for companies and participating states. We are proud to support these Governors on this important decision.&quot;Related stories:What happens in California doesn't stay in CaliforniaCalifornia regulators to fleets: Buy those electric trucksClick here for more articles by Linda Baker. See more from Benzinga  * Nikola Tesla Biopic Sees A World His Namesakes Seek To Create  * FMCSA To Request Safety Data On Last-Mile Delivery  * KLM Gets EU Blessing For Dutch Emergency Aid(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-14,"PepsiCo (PEP) has positively surprised with its second quarter earning results, delivering a solid revenue beat. Specifically, Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.32 beat Street estimates by $0.07, while revenue of $15.95B beat by $480M despite dropping 3% year-over-year.Meanwhile organic revenue growth came in at -0.3% Y/Y, versus consensus of -2.8%. Encouragingly, all segments except for Africa, Middle East & South Asia met or beat consensus estimates.However GAAP EPS of $1.18 missed consensus forecasts by $0.05. The two driving forces behind weakness remain convenience/gas and foodservice, which will likely weigh on results through year-end, says RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi.“Despite being faced with significant challenges and complexities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our businesses performed relatively well during the quarter, with a notable level of resiliency in our global snacks and foods business” commented PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta.“Encouragingly, as restrictions and closures eased and population mobility improved as the quarter progressed, we also saw an improvement in our business performance and channel mix dynamics” he added.Given the volatile environment and uncertainty surrounding Covid-19, the company is not providing a fiscal year 2020 financial outlook at this time. However, according to Laguarta, Pepsi has ample liquidity and flexibility to meet the needs of its business and return cash to shareholders.“PEP delivered relatively strong results against subdued expectations” RBC’s Modi summed up post-print. Looking out to the remainder of the year, he is expecting results to be choppy as emerging markets slow and rising COVID-19 case counts pauses and/or reverses re-opening plans in the US.“For now, we believe investors should be focused on whether or not schools will reopen this fall as that will largely influence consumer purchase behavior” the analyst wrote. Nonetheless, he reiterated PEP as one of his top large cap ideas with a $153 price target (13% upside potential).Shares in PEP are down 1.3% year-to-date, staying flat on the earnings release. Overall analysts are almost equally split between Hold and Buy ratings, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $144 indicates 6% upside potential lies ahead.

2020-07-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Corporate America is waking up to the relationship between food and race. A petition has been circulating this week urging grocery chain Trader Joe’s to “remove racist branding” and rename food items labeled as Trader Ming’s, Trader Jose’s and Trader Giotto’s. The company responded that a rebranding effort is underway. The news follows similar company announcements. The PepsiCo Inc division that sells Aunt Jemima products acknowledged last month that its 131-year-old pancake brand was “based on a racial stereotype” and vowed to change its name and image. Mars Inc followed suit and announced plans to discontinue and “evolve” its Uncle Ben’s brand of rice products. Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream also said it would find a new name for its Eskimo Pie ice cream bars.Such efforts are long overdue, but they only scratch the surface when it comes to addressing the complex ways in which racial inequities have carried over into the U.S. food system. Before the pandemic, 37 million Americans lived in food-insecure households, meaning they had “limited or uncertain access to adequate food,” according to USDA 2018 data. Black and Latinx families were more than twice as likely to be food insecure than white families. It stands to reason that, as it has in so many other realms, the Covid crisis will reflect and exacerbate these existing disparities. “The food system is part of a larger structure of inequity,” says Ashanté Reese, Professor of African and African Diaspora Studies and Anthropology at The University of Texas at Austin and author of Black Food Geographies: Race, Self-Reliance, and Food Access in Washington D.C. I discussed the root causes of food injustice with Reese, who is also the co-editor of Black Food Matters, along with Princeton University professor Hanna Garth, which will be published in October. Here’s a lightly edited transcript of our exchange.Amanda Little: What’s your take on the efforts of companies like Trader Joe’s and PepsiCo, which are responding to the anti-racism movement with name and logo changes?Ashanté Reese: Conversations around representation are important, but they’re also limited. Shifts in marketing strategy are part of what businesses do — they read the room. In this case, the efforts appear to be more about saving face than about altruism, but they can also help us begin a conversation about the deeper realities of unequal food access and insecurity in the food system.AL: You’ve done extensive research on communities with low access to fresh foods and have called into question the use of the term “food desert.” Why is this term misleading?AR: The term “food deserts” overly determines how we look at a space and treats it as a void – as if there’s nothing of value there. You hear “food deserts” and think: no supermarkets, a lot of liquor stores and fast food restaurants. The term focuses on a product versus the processes that led us there. If you are in a predominantly Black neighborhood, regardless of class – lots of sociologists write about this – there are fewer resources in those neighborhoods than even in working class or low-income white neighborhoods. The lack of supermarkets in these communities is only one part of a far more complex problem. AL: What term should we use instead?AR: If we’re talking about supermarkets, I like the specificity of [scholar] Elizabeth Eisenhauer’s term “supermarket redlining.” Redlining refers to the literal maps that banks would draw to put Black people in certain neighborhoods and refuse them loans to live in other neighborhoods. We’re now more than 70 years past the peak of redlining and we’re still seeing its impact. Eisenhauer connects that specifically to supermarkets, detailing how they follow similar patterns as residential segregation.The grocery industry has become concentrated over time in the hands of fewer and fewer retail corporations, which make decisions about where to locate stores based in part on the racial makeup of different communities – even when they are not intentionally considering race. After the 1960’s uprisings in the U.S., many businesses chose to relocate outside of Black urban neighborhoods; in the ‘70s and ‘80s you saw the continued flow of people and businesses to the suburbs and the emergence of shopping centers and strip mall models serving mostly white suburban communities.AL: What about the term “food apartheid,” which implies that food inequality is the result of a broad range of racist policies and practices well beyond redlining?AR: Yes, I learned the term from Karen Washington, founder of the nonprofits Black Urban Growers and Rise and Root Farm in New York, and it refers to the many root causes of food injustice – including poverty rates and income inequality, the prevalence and reliability of public transportation, the pressures of neighborhood violence and police brutality and the strength of local schools and school curricula. All of these and many other factors have an impact on where stores are located as well as on eating patterns and community food choices. “Food apartheid” also refers to the widely documented discriminatory policies at the USDA against Black farmers, policies that have undermined Black land tenure, farming heritage, and food security.AL: Can you describe your ethnographic field work and what you’ve learned from it?AR: I did 12 months of continuous fieldwork in Ward 7 of Washington D.C. and 24 months over four years. At the time, Ward 7 had two full-service supermarkets for 150,000 residents — far too few. I spent a lot of time in people’s homes, in their pantries and sitting around their dinner tables. I spent time at the stores and sat down with people in popular restaurants, primarily Denny’s, to eat meals.What caught my attention was less the limitations of this low-food-access environment than the creative and time-intensive ways people were navigating it. For example, if you are taking a bus or walking on foot to get your food, you consider the weight of the bags, the number of bags you carry, the frequency of trips and other details such as the safety of your walking route. Ward 7 is hilly, so few people used public transport to get to markets, and many didn’t have cars. So you carpool, you rideshare, you figure out a way to get what you need.AL: Can you comment on the disproportionate impacts of diabetes, obesity and heart disease on Black Americans — and how closely these are tied to unequal food access? Could food inequality, in turn, be causing more susceptibility within the Black community to the impacts Covid-19? AR: It is unclear whether or not increasing food access (specifically adding more supermarkets) can decrease health conditions like diabetes. There is conflicting research on this – but these conditions are almost certainly connected to racism. If you are struggling with unequal food access, you are probably also underpaid, chronically stressed and living in a redlined neighborhood or one with constrained resources well beyond limited grocery stores. You may also be living in a neighborhood with high crime or heavy policing.All of this must be factored into rates of diabetes, obesity and heart disease, and by extension to Covid vulnerability. Also consider the high percentage of workers considered “essential” who are Black. Covid has highlighted the reality that Black Americans are navigating the intersections of multiple fault lines all of the time.AL: What are the most effective solutions in education and policy that can help achieve food justice?AR: How do you take down and rebuild a whole ecosystem? The answer is bit by bit.We can begin restoring lost farmland to Black farmers. We can teach agriculture in schools as a normal part of the curriculum. We can establish and support local food councils like the Los Angeles Food Policy Council, which helps to support urban and suburban farms and food webs. We can establish stronger incentives and support for food co-ops, especially in low-food-access neighborhoods. We can make it easier to use EBT [electronic food credits in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program program] at farmer’s markets and remove the stigma attached to it.I also believe in instituting a Universal Basic Income, which could go a lot further than SNAP or WIC [a related program for women, infants and children], to provide food security to the 40 million Americans living in poverty.Also, there’s a lot of emphasis out there on educating people in low-food-access neighborhoods to eat better, and I think this misses the mark. There are restrictions connected to what kinds of food can be bought and not bought with WIC. We see the Trump administration advocating for food relief boxes that contain what people “should” eat, and I think it’s dangerous to be that prescriptive, to take away choice. It’s neither helpful nor empowering. If we believe in freedom, if we believe in autonomy, if we believe in self-determination, then these beliefs must inform the way we pursue food justice.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Amanda Little is a professor of journalism and science writing at Vanderbilt University.

2020-08-06,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the world’s most-followed sports franchises, Indian Premier League cricket, is the latest casualty of the India-China border clashes. It has lost its title sponsor, Chinese phonemaker Vivo.The Board of Control for Cricket in India and Vivo Mobile India Pvt. have decided to suspend their partnership for the IPL in 2020, the BCCI said in a statement on Thursday. The powerful BCCI, which owns the IPL, faced criticism in recent days after it said it would retain all its sponsors for its 2020 edition. Public anger against China is high after soldiers were killed in a border skirmish in June, sparking retaliation from India that banned more than 100 Chinese apps, tightened controls on Chinese imports, and made it harder for Chinese companies to invest.Started in 2008, the IPL’s valuation has risen to $6.7 billion from $4.2 billion in 2016, according to valuation-appraisal company Duff & Phelps. It features eight franchise teams competing in a fast-paced Twenty20 version of the game. Last year’s edition was watched by a record-breaking 462 million viewers. Vivo India came on as a title sponsor for five years in 2017, replacing PepsiCo Inc. for about 22 billion rupees ($293 million). Vivo also came on as the title sponsor of another Indian sporting league, Pro Kabaddi, for a five-year period.Chinese smartphone maker Oppo committed at the same time to give the IPL about 15 billion rupees for the same period. Both Vivo and Oppo have the same parent, Chinese electronics giant BBK Electronics, which sells smartphones from the low-end Realme brand to the higher end Opp.This year’s IPL is scheduled to be played from mid-September in the United Arab Emirates, as India is slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Vivo, Cricket Body Dump Sponsorship Deal Amid India-China Strife"

2020-08-07,"CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is not the most well-known tech stock out there. It's no Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), particularly with its $25 billion market capitalization. However, that won't stop CRWD stock from hitting new all-time highs. Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Despite pulling back from the July highs, CRWD stock has been an absolute beast. Shares are up roughly 260% from the March lows, as traders continue to bid the name higher. Investors got a perfect buying opportunity in CrowdStrike a few weeks ago, but it's okay for those that missed their shot. There will be other opportunities with this name. While there are plenty of earnings reports hitting the wires right now, this company won't be one of them for a while. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCrowdStrike likely won't report earnings until September. So how can this stock hit new highs? Let's explore.  Trading CRWD Stock  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comCrowdStrike is a little tricky. After coming public in June 2019, the stock was met with enthusiasm by the Street. Shares hit $100 in August, but by November, technicians were drawing in support at $45. In other words, it's been a volatile ride.   * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand While CRWD stock had regained momentum in early 2020, the novel coronavirus selloff hammered the stock down to a paltry $32 per share. It was a wicked blow, although we've seen a near-quadruple since then.But who cares about the past -- what's going on in the future here?We saw a beautiful dip to the 50-day moving average last month, that was instantly bought up and sent shares higher. I would love another opportunity to buy a dip down into the $100-ish area and the 50-day moving average. The prior all-time high comes into play near $101, while the two-times extension for the 2020 range comes into play at $103. So a pullback into this area should be met with buyers. I am more inclined to use the entire trading range dating back to the 2019 highs. That's because the 123.6% extension of this range comes into play at $118.38, within pennies of the current high. Preferably we get another dip before CrowdStrike's next rally. But either way, I expect this one to make new highs. If it can clear the current high, look for a push into the $125 to $128 zone (see chart for extensions). Above opens the door for an even larger run, potentially putting $145 in play for a longer term price target. That's the 161.8% extension of the entire range.Why do I like the odds of CRWD stock hitting new highs? Simply put, the technicals are strong. It doesn't hurt that the fundamentals are favorable, too.  Breaking Down CrowdStrike StockWhen CrowdStrike reported its most recent earnings report -- Q1 for its 2021 fiscal year -- it beat on earnings and revenue. A surprise profit of 2 cents per share came after an 85% year-over-year gain in revenue to $178 million. Simply put, the industry is in favor. Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) just hit new highs. On July 28, FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) delivered a top- and bottom-line beat and raised its full-year guidance. Think bigger picture right now. While the coronavirus is creating disruptions around the world, business still goes on. Everyone from PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) to General Motors (NYSE:GM) is working to adapt to the environment. It has management teams and employees working remotely, with this shift having the appearance of remaining stable well into next year -- and potentially permanently. With it, that has driven up the need for cybersecurity. A note from FireEye's most recent earnings release reads:Cyber security remains a top spending priority for organizations worldwide, and the uncertainty of the current environment is creating opportunities for solutions that allow customers to purchase exactly what they need, when they need it.As a result, I think CrowdStrike has a viable growth driver and that should help drive shares higher. Analysts expect 60% revenue growth this year to $770 million, followed by 32% growth in fiscal 2022 to just over $1 billion. Consensus expectations call for roughly break-even results this year before a swing to profitability in 2022. Perhaps CRWD stock disappoints, but right now the trends -- in the business and on the charts -- are pointing in the right direction.

Should today's younger investors discuss KO stock with their grandparents, they're likely to come away thinking the member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a must-own.Alas, it's not. In fact, the 21st century represents two decades of disappointment for Coca-Cola investors. From the first trading day of the year 2000 through Aug. 1, 2020, shares of Coca-Cola are higher by just over 68%, less than half the 154.26% returned by the Dow over the same period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMaking that laggard status all the worse is that Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP), the stock Coca-Cola is most frequently compared, has more than quadrupled since Jan. 1, 2000.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now In this era of rampant day trading and growth stocks delivering big gains in short order, measuring performance over two decades-plus may not seem relevant, but with consumer staples stocks like Coke and Pepsi, long-term measurement is relevant because investors prize these names for steadiness and typically hold these equities for lengthy periods of time. New Products and KO StockThere are a couple of reasons why investors get fooled into Coca-Cola over Pepsico. First, there's Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) owning a massive chunk of KO stock - one that the conglomerate has held for decades. Buffett is a great pitchman for the stock because he's frequently photographed sipping cans of Coke.Plus, Berkshire has owned the stock for so long and made so much money on it, that Buffett's feet are never held to the fire regarding the past two decades of disappointment by this name. Second, unknowing investors assume that because Coca-Cola Classic and Diet Coke are the two best-selling sodas in the world that this stock is &quot;better&quot; than Pepsico. Obviously, price action says otherwise.What Coca-Cola has a history of moving slowly into growth areas of food and beverage. Pepsico beat its rival to the punch in sports drinks and teas, to name just two, and Coca-Cola never developed a snack business to come anywhere close to rivaling Pepsi's Frito Lay unit.More recently, Coca-Cola affirmed its slow-moving ways, saying it plans to launch a hard seltzer line under its Topo Chico brand in Latin America later this year and in the U.S. in 2021. This isn't a case of better late than never.Yes, hard seltzer is a growing category in the beverage space, but it's no longer kitschy. This is a segment that's attracted big players with the resources to ward off Coca-Cola competition.Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP), just to name a few, are among the companies Coca-Cola will have to tussle with in the seltzer arena and because those firms have been in the space awhile, it becomes harder for new entrants to pilfer business. Coke Stock Isn't the Staples Name to BuyOne thing investors can bank on with Coca-Cola is dividend growth. The company's payout increase streak reached 58 straight years with a modest hike in February. The stock now yields 3.40%, which is exceptional in the current environment.However, above-average yields and reliable dividend growth are accessible throughout the staples sector. For example, Pepsi's dividend increase is measured in decades, too. That is to say investors should not buy Coca-Cola simply for the dividend because they'll be left disappointed.This year proves as much. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index is higher by 2.45% year-to-date while KO stock is lower by almost 13%.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-08-26,"The pandemic had a mixed impact on packaged food and beverage companies. The stay-at-home orders led to increased demand in the at-home channel. However, lower sales in on-the-go channels significantly hurt sales.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have been closely competing in the non-alcoholic beverage space for decades. Amid the current crisis, we will discuss the performance of these soda giants and use the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to see which stock offers a better investment opportunity.Coca-Cola (KO)The pandemic’s impact on Coca-Cola’s second-quarter performance was so immense that the company posted its largest revenue decline in at least 30 years (as per CNBC). The second-quarter revenue fell 28% Y/Y to $7.2 billion, while organic revenue plunged 26%.Global unit case volume dropped 16% due to a steep decline in the volumes in away-from-home channels, like restaurants, which account for over 50% of the company’s top line. The second-quarter adjusted EPS fell 33% Y/Y to $0.42.Prior to COVID, Coca-Cola’s soda volumes were improving due to its efforts to offer smaller packages and better beverage choices like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. But, the pandemic hurt the category and sparkling soft drinks volumes were down 12% in the second quarter with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar declining 4%.The pandemic did not spare other categories too. Tea and coffee volumes fell 31% and volumes of water, enhanced water and sports drinks were down 24%. Also, volumes of juice, dairy and plant beverages tanked 20% even as the demand for Fairlife milk and Simply juices was strong in North America.Coca-Cola has been focusing on the non-soda categories as consumers have been shifting from sugary, soda drinks to healthier options. It has been expanding its non-soda portfolio through innovation and several acquisitions, including Britain’s COSTA coffee.Coca-Cola believes that the worst might have been over in the second quarter based on improvement in the away-from-home channels as lockdown restrictions have started easing. Also, there is sustained demand in the at-home consumption. The company’s worldwide unit case volume declined by mid-single digits in July (month-to-date as of July 21) compared to a 10% decline in June and 25% in April.Coca-Cola intends to streamline its beverage portfolio by focusing on fewer but bigger and stronger brands. Of the company’s 400 master brands, more than 50% are single-country brands and these generate only 2% of the overall revenue. The company wants to get rid of such brands and direct its resources to the popular ones. (See KO stock analysis on TipRanks)Coca-Cola stock has declined 13% year-to-date in 2020. The average price target of $54.67 reflects an upside of about 14% over the coming 12-months. Despite the performance in the first half, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus for Coca-Cola based on 8 Buys and 1 Hold rating.On July 22, Morgan Stanley research analyst Dara Mohsenian upgraded Coca-Cola stock from Hold to Buy with a price target of $54. The analyst believes that the second-quarter was the bottom and there is sequential top line improvement ahead. On August 17, Mohsenian reiterated his Buy rating and said that the stock’s valuation is compelling.PepsiCo (PEP)PepsiCo has also been impacted by the current crisis. However, the company’s snack food business has helped its resilience despite several challenges. PepsiCo’s second-quarter revenue declined 3.1% Y/Y to $15.9 billion, while organic revenue was down 0.3%. The company’s adjusted EPS fell 14.3% to $1.32.Consumers spent more time at home and avoided eating out. This drove the demand for PepsiCo’s food business. PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America business grew 7% and in fact, the company gained market share in salty, savory and macro-snacks. Revenue from Quaker Foods North America surged 23%.In contrast, revenue from the PepsiCo Beverages North America segment declined 7% due to lower sales in convenience and gas and foodservice channels. Overall, the segment’s soda volumes fell 10% and non-soda volumes were down 8%. On the brighter side, the company gained market share in ready-to-drink coffee, tea and enhanced water. Also, Pepsi Zero Sugar and Bubly delivered double-digit growth.PepsiCo’s revenue from Latin America and Europe declined 17% and 9%, while revenue from Africa, Middle East and South Asia fell 1%.Meanwhile, PepsiCo’s revenue from the Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China region surged 10% due to higher pricing and strong snacks volume growth, especially in China and Indonesia, partially offset by lower beverage volumes.PepsiCo is seeking growth in the energy drinks space through its Rockstar acquisition and distribution of VPX Sports’ Bang energy drinks. It is also enhancing its portfolio of better beverage and food options. PepsiCo aims to ensure that over 67% of its beverage volumes don’t have more than 100 calories from added sugar per 12 ounces by 2025. It is also planning to cut down salt and saturated fat levels in its food offerings.PepsiCo’s second-quarter results prompted Guggenheim analyst Laurent Grandet to raise his price target to $151 from $148. The analyst feels that PepsiCo’s recent results indicate that it is among the least impacted of beverage peers during the pandemic due to its large snacks and at-home food exposure.PepsiCo has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus based on 7 buys and 5 holds. A 12-month average price target of $145.58 indicates a 6% possible upside in the stock. PepsiCo stock has risen 0.7% year-to-date.Keeping in view the recovery in several markets, PepsiCo predicts low-single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. (See PEP stock analysis on TipRanks)The better beverage stockCoca-Cola and PepsiCo are often preferred for their steady dividends. Coca-Cola has hiked its dividends for 58 consecutive years while PepsiCo has raised its dividends for 48 years. Coca-Cola has a higher dividend yield of about 3.5% compared to PepsiCo’s 3.0%.PepsiCo’s exposure to snack foods gives it an edge over Coca-Cola. PepsiCo’s second-quarter performance and year-to-date stock movement are better than Coca-Cola. But keeping in view the upside potential over the next 12 months, lower valuation and the Street consensus, Coca-Cola looks to be a better bet.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg) -- When Alicia Boler Davis was elevated to Jeff Bezos’s vaunted S-Team leadership council earlier this month she became the first Black executive to enter Amazon.com Inc.’s upper ranks -- and a candidate to run the company’s far-flung logistics empire.Early next year, the current logistics chief, Dave Clark, will step aside to lead Amazon’s consumer business. Whether Boler Davis, 51, replaces him in this pivotal role will depend in part on how well she performs in her current job, running the company’s warehouses, which employ hundreds of thousands of workers and handle billions of packages a year.It won’t be easy. The former General Motors Co. executive must keep the facilities operating smoothly during the busy holiday season amid a global pandemic that has fueled a surge in online shopping even as it laid low scores of the Amazon workers who pick and pack orders for delivery.Mike Ramsey, a Gartner vice president who tracks the auto industry, says Boler Davis’s experience running GM factories is well suited to her new role. “The fulfillment part of Amazon’s business is where everything happens,” he says. “It doesn’t matter how slick the interface is if packages aren’t delivered and done so quickly.” Amazon declined to make Boler Davis available for an interview.Boler Davis’s impressive trajectory began in Detroit, where she was born in 1969. She was raised in nearby Romulus, Michigan, by parents who married young and divorced when she was five. While her father remained part of her upbringing, money was tight for her working mother and three siblings.“We didn’t have a lot,” she told the Detroit News in 2018. “If an iron or a washer broke, I would cut some cord, get some wire, and patch it together and repair it, because I knew we didn’t have money to fix it.” The second oldest of four, Boler Davis said the eldest sister Kimberly, who went on to attend Harvard University, set the bar high for her.Boler Davis participated in a summer engineering program for high school students run by General Motors Institute, now Kettering University, which piqued a nascent interest in the field. After graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in chemical engineering, she briefly worked for The Upjohn Company, a pharmaceutical maker, and PepsiCo. Inc. She joined GM in 1994 and ran plants making Cadillac Escalade SUVs in Texas and Chevrolet Sonic subcompacts in Michigan.GM named Boler Davis a vice president in 2012, kicking off a rapid ascent. She oversaw global quality and U.S. customer experience for a little over a year, then was promoted to senior vice president and given a global mandate for both roles. In 2016, Boler Davis was named executive vice president of global manufacturing and labor relations, overseeing 180,000 employees at more than 170 facilities in over 30 countries. She reported to CEO Mary Barra, who she described as a role model.For all her success at GM, her career there wasn’t without challenges. She described being discouraged early on at the company, which was for decades largely dominated by long-tenured White men. In February 2019, she and Barra paid a 2 1/2-hour visit to a transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, to underscore the zero-tolerance policy against racism following a series of firings and lawsuits related to ugly incidents including the display of a toy monkey to taunt Black workers. Her departure for Amazon was reported later that month.Few were sorrier to see her go than Barra, according to a person familiar with the situation. The CEO considered Boler Davis a key member of her management team because Boler Davis led the company’s global network of factories, where Barra had paid her dues, the person said. GM declined to comment.Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s retiring consumer unit chief, met Boler Davis over lunch after an introduction by a mutual acquaintance, and was impressed by her leadership experience, technical acumen, and dedication to workers on the factory floor, Wilke wrote in an email to employees earlier this month. Her hiring in April 2019, to oversee Amazon’s more than 175 biggest warehouses around the world, came as the logistics unit worked to cultivate a deeper bench of executives, at times by reaching outside the company.Amazon is often compared with web and software giants, but the operations unit that Boler Davis helps lead has more in common with a sophisticated manufacturing enterprise. Amazon warehouses employ hundreds of thousands of workers who labor alongside a similar number of robots. The company built that empire by embedding the lean manufacturing principles Toyota Motor Corp. famously used to dominate Detroit, forcing GM to embrace them during Boler Davis’s days at the carmaker. She also oversees teams working on customer service, sustainability and product safety, a key topic as regulators examine how the company runs its marketplace. When longtime engineering executive Brad Porter left the company earlier this month, some of his teams working on robotics and warehouse technology began reporting to Boler Davis.As the coronavirus began spreading across the U.S., Boler Davis and colleagues chose to keep Amazon’s doors open even as many businesses closed, retooling warehouse operations and going on a hiring spree to make up for workers taking shelter at home. The company has been criticized by elected officials, labor leaders and some of its own workers for its actions during the pandemic, including for firing workers who were involved in employee organizing. Amazon has said the employees were let go for violations of company policy.Now, going into the fourth quarter, Boler Davis faces the challenge of matching Amazon’s staffing to customer demand and keeping facilities that have been extensively redesigned to protect workers from Covid-19 running smoothly through the holiday shopping season. Close observers of the company say her main rival for the top logistics job -- assuming Amazon decides to fill it -- is likely John Felton, who runs Amazon’s delivery services and was also named to the S-Team last week.Amazon’s top leadership circle has been remarkably steady over the years, made up of mostly White men, many of whom had been with the company for decades. The workforce is 27% Black, and Amazon has a more diverse makeup than most technology companies, primarily because many of the people working in the warehouses are Black. But 59% of Amazon managers are White, and 73% are men. Still, as the fourth woman on Amazon’s 26-person S-team, Boler Davis’s rise is evidence that things are starting to change.In the past, she has acknowledged being a role model for people of color. “It’s not something that I carry around and think about every day, but I certainly do focus on holding myself to a high standard of excellence,” she said in 2017. “I want to inspire others with my actions and consistently advocate for diversity and inclusion of all forms.” She has long promoted STEM education, joining Barra and Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg a few years ago to discuss career and education possibilities with young girls and working women.People who have known Boler Davis since she was a student at Romulus High School, where she was known as “Le Le,” say their former classmate remains grounded despite her glittering career. Chenauda Harris, who recalls a studious girl raised with a firm hand, encountered Boler Davis at a class reunion about three years ago.“She was the same Alicia she has always been, that’s what’s special about her,” Harris says. “She is the same humble, down-to-earth person she was in high school.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon’s Boler Davis In Mix to Become First Black Logistics Head

In Q1, PepsiCo earned $2.00 billion, and total sales reached $13.88 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, PepsiCo posted an ROCE of 0.19%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on PEPReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For PepsiCo, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Recap PepsiCo reported Q2 earnings per share at $1.32/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.25/share.See more from Benzinga  * ROCE Insights For PepsiCo  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * How Does PepsiCo's Debt Look Like?(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has signed up Bollywood mega star Amitabh Bachchan for its Alexa voice assistant, stealing a march over rivals Apple Inc.’s Siri and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Assistant as a country of 1.3 billion people adapts to voice-enabled internet services.“The baritone that has enchanted the Indian film industry for over five decades, will soon deliver a unique voice experience to the many Indian customers who use Alexa,” Amazon announced on its India blog on Monday. Users will be able to access “Mr. Bachchan’s iconic voice on Alexa by purchasing the Amitabh Bachchan voice experience,” the blog said.Bachchan, 77, is often described as India’s answer to Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro combined. His star wattage and deep voice have featured in hundreds of commercials peddling everything from PepsiCo Inc. colas, Cadbury Ltd. chocolates and even a UNICEF-backed polio vaccination campaign.Bachchan’s instantly recognizable voice has added to his star status in hit Bollywood movies, a podcast and the Indian version of the television game show “Who wants to be a millionaire?”. On Monday, the actor posted on Instagram, “ek nayi soch…ek nayi drishti…ek nayi disha,” Hindi for what was for him “a new thinking, a new view, a new direction.”Amazon first used a celebrity voice when Hollywood actor Samuel L. Jackson made a debut on Alexa. It has since added professional voice actors who recite Shakespeare, Mark Twain, proverbs and fables. Last year, rival Google Assistant added the voice of American singer John Legend. The dominant Google voice assistant has yet to debut a celebrity voice in India.As with Jackson, Amazon will apply neural speech technology to make Alexa sound exactly like Bachchan no matter what question he is answering without needing to record every word in his voice in the studio. Users can buy Bachchan’s voice as a skill to provide weather updates, recite poetry and give advice.India, with over half-a-billion smartphones and some of the cheapest data rates in the world, is rapidly adopting voice-enabled services as people take to the internet through voice rather than typing. The market for speech and voice recognition is growing swiftly in India and expected to jump over 40% this year to $58.4 million, according to a report by Dentsu Aegis Network’s India unit.Bachchan’s arrival on Alexa next year is going to thrill one particular Amazon employee: Amit Agarwal, Amazon’s India head and former assistant to Jeff Bezos. Agarwal, who is a fervent Bachchan fan, fluently spouts lines from Bachchan’s hit movies and to this day sports Bachchan’s hair style from decades ago.“Personally, as an ardent fan of Mr. Bachchan, I am thrilled and looking forward,” Agarwal told Bloomberg News.(Updates with Amazon executive’s quote from the seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bollywood Star Amitabh Bachchan Is the New Voice of Amazon’s Alexa

2020-09-28,"(Bloomberg) -- More than thirty of the largest U.S. companies have agreed to new disclosures of previously private race, gender and ethnicity workforce data as part of a push by the New York City comptroller and three city retirement funds.Amazon.com Inc., General Motors Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among 34 companies that have agreed to share the regulatory filing when they report new numbers next year, Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a statement Monday. Morgan Stanley, PepsiCo Inc., and Coca-Cola Co. have also promised data, the comptroller said. More than a dozen S&P 100 companies already release the detailed form but they are the exception, not the rule.The initiative is part of a broader push to compel workforce transparency at companies that have made explicit statements of support for equality after broad protest of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and disproportionate deaths of minorities from Covid-19. Two other groups were formed earlier this month to ensure all public companies have at least one Black director.The New York initiative began in July and is being pressed by the city’s Employees’ Retirement System, Teachers Retirement System, and Board of Education Retirement System. The comptroller and funds targeted 67 companies that made statements of support for reform after the unrest but weren’t disclosing the detailed reports they are required to make each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Women have made some gains under direct pressure from investors such as BlackRock Inc.and Vanguard Group Inc., but that has meant less focus on people of color. Black board membership has slipped and many minority workers have not been promoted into positions where they have a better shot at becoming a CEO one day. There is no current U.S. mandate to publicly disclose the race or gender of employees.About 30 companies of varying sizes, including Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc., already release copies of their private federal form on their Websites. JUST Capital, a non-profit that pushes companies for the same disclosure, says only 4% of companies release the EEOC data.Intel Corp. went a step further late last year and also revealed pay data by race, ethnicity and gender required by the EEOC. The data can be used to track progress that companies are making in reform because the collection methods are uniform.The companies named by Stringer also include BlackRock, Starbucks Corp., and Verizon Communications Inc. The companies have agreed to disclose their forms as part of their submission of data for 2019 and 2020 to the EEOC in 2021. The 2019 filings were delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.(Updates with additional companies releasing data in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Goldman and GM Among 34 Firms to Share Private Diversity Data

2020-09-28,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $136.02 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-02  * Strike Price: $138.00  * Volume: 2057  * Open Interest: 450Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * ROCE Insights For PepsiCo  * ROCE Insights For PepsiCo(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-02,"And just like that, PepsiCo (PEP) has bounced back. One quarter after the food and beverage company saw its growth trends take a serious COVID-19-related hit, with the disruption starting in February, PEP announced that sales trends had made their way back to positive territory.Organic sales gained 4% in the third quarter of 2020, versus the flat result witnessed in the previous quarter. What was behind the uptick? Solid volume growth in the Frito-Lay snack business and in the Quaker Foods division, which is grabbing market share even though more consumers are eating in.That being said, PEP missed the mark when it came to gross margin. However, Deutsche Bank analyst Stephen Powers believes that this was primarily due to M&A not being fully and accurately reflected in estimates.Also important, Powers points out that the company reinstated FY20 guidance, which has EPS coming in at $5.50, versus the Street’s $5.36 call, and organic growth of 4%-plus (versus 3.6% consensus estimate), in-line with pre-COVID guidance and reflecting continued strength in North America.This is not to say that PEP is out of the woods just yet. “That said, implied Q4 guidance is modestly below Street (with PEP typically being less inclined to over deliver late in the year so as to reinvest/set-up better for the coming year), GM pressures are likely to at least partially/directionally persist (given ongoing M&A impacts over the next three quarters), and the company's reduced 2020 capex spending vs. earlier in the year ($4 billion now vs. $5 billion prior) may represent elevated spending needs in the year to come (alongside the puts and takes of lapping peak COVID-19 impacts),” Powers explained.Going forward, Powers will be watching out for an update on PEP's developing demand expectations, how at-home strength is affecting PEP's investment priorities and its plans for energy (Bang, Rockstar, Mountain Dew and more). Possible M&A activity and PEP's ability to manage expenses as well as maximize cash, while at the same time investing in e-commerce and other long-term plans are also key points of interest for the analyst.Based on all of the above, Powers stayed on the sidelines with a Hold rating. Going by the $140 price target, the analyst expects shares to remain range bound for the foreseeable future. (To watch Powers’ track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street is torn when it comes to whether to sing this beverage giant's praises or assess with an apprehensive gaze. That said, based on 8 Buy ratings and 5 Holds the word on the Street is that PEP is a Moderate Buy. At $149.62, the average price target implies an 8% upside from current levels.

2020-10-02,"Looking into the current session, PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) is trading at $138.44, after a 1.7% drop. Over the past month, the stock fell by 0.23%, but over the past year, it actually increased by 0.07%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 5.95%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on PEPDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.PepsiCo Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 422.25 of the Beverages industry.

2020-10-02,"Just like its rivals Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc (NASDAQ: KDP), the snack and beverage giant has taken a hit during the pandemic due to restaurant closures and other pandemic-related disruptions. But, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) had a joker in its deck of cards. Namely, its diversified food and beverage portfolio allowed the company to benefit from more people working and learning from home. It was clear this was Pepsi's notable asset even during the prior quarter as, unlike its rivals, Pepsi's Q2 total core gross margin rate grew 6 basis points to 55.6%. Its supremacy became even more obvious during its latest third quarter as sales snapped back from the pandemic.Q3 Earnings ReportPepsi topped analysts' estimates both for its earnings and revenue. Net sales of $18.09 billion expanded by 5.3% in its latest quarter as demand for Tostitos and pancake mixes grew. It exceeded the $17.23 billion expected by Refinitif.Despite the COVID-19 related costs of $147 million, Pepsi managed to deliver a net income of $2.29 billion, exceeding both estimates and the $2.1 billion it made in the same quarter last year.Performance Of Growth DriversDespite eased lockdown measures, both its Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods businesses reported organic revenue growth of 6%. So, even though people started feeling more at ease and leaving their homes, Frito-Lay saw an increased demand for Tostitos, Cheetos and Doritos. Moreover, Quaker Foods' pasta and macaroni and cheese dishes even reported double-digit sales growth.ForecastsPepsi provided an update to its fiscal 2020 outlook after pulling its forecasts in late April like the majority of companies. For the remainder of the fiscal year, Pepsi is now expecting organic revenue growth of 4% which is in line with its prior outlook. But as for earnings per share of $5.50, they are 38 cents less than its original forecast.New Markets On The HorizonSales of functional beverages amounted to approximately $31.7 billion last year which is 6.9% from 2018, according to Euromonitor International data. PepsiCo is launching a drink to get a piece of its subsegment, the $1 billion sleep aid industry. In September, Pepsi unveiled Driftwell that contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation and calmness. Pepsi plans to launch its counter-stress drink online later this year and in stores early next year.PepsiCo has been on the quest to fortify its position in the health and wellness sector for several years now. In 2016, it acquired kombucha beverage maker KeVita and the plant-based energy bar company Health Warrior two years later. It already expanded the range of its sports drink megabrand Gatorade with the launch of nighttime protein powders. It is also considering a move into alcoholic drinks. PepsiCo is looking at the bigger picture. It used to keep people hyped but now it will also have products to calm them down.Going Green PepsiCo committed to shift to 100% renewable energy by 2040. Coca-Cola has set 2030 as its deadline, but it only committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by ¼ with its base year being 2015. However, PepsiCo plans to source 100% renewable electricity across all company-owned and controlled operations globally also by 2030, but its franchises and third-party operators will join the green train by 2040. Outlook Pepsi succeeded to plant more optimism about the sustainability of its growth drivers. It delivered a strong profit as snacks and sodas thrived both during the lockdown and with eased social distancing measures. The bottom line is that the soda giant is doing good, it is going green and it is bravely stepping out into new markets. It is also forecasting a full-year profit that is above market expectations. By the looks of it, Cola wars are back and in more ways than one.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Buried within a grim quarter for corporate results is a bullish trend that could explain some of the stock market’s recent resilience. An unprecedented share of companies are now predicting a brighter future.The ratio of companies saying analyst earnings estimates are too low is 3.3 times higher than those saying they’re too high, a record, according to Bank of America data going back to 2000. It’s not being driven by a small sample, either. The gross number of above-consensus guidance was the strongest for any third quarter since 2010.While coming amid a lot of bad news -- S&P 500 earnings are forecast to have dropped 21% in the third quarter -- rising estimates from the likes of PepsiCo Inc. and Sherwin-Williams Co. are welcome to traders who spent the summer wondering where the bottom was in the worst recession since the 1930s. It’s an offset to chaos at a time when politics are whipping up price volatility and hijacking many market narratives.“Initially there was a lot of uncertainty about what this Covid-19 meant, so now that we’re coming to grips with it, we’re understanding it a bit more, firms are getting a better handle on how to deal with it,” said Yesim Tokat-Acikel, portfolio manager and director of multi-asset research at QMA. “That is another constructive signal.”Though not as many companies are issuing forecasts as they did in pre-Covid periods, the volume of firms offering it has picked up. More than 160 members of the S&P 500 have made such estimates in the past three months, an improvement from less than 150 earlier this year, according to BofA.PepsiCo is an example. The company said it had a stronger-than-expected summer as consumers loaded up on snacks and beverages. It resumed offering guidance and projected organic revenue growth of about 4% for the full year. Similarly, Sherwin-Williams boosted its forecast for both the third quarter and the full year.Few firms were daring enough to say anything about the future back when the coronavirus crisis was peaking. By one measure, about 80% of firms refused to offer a forecast in the three months through mid-summer. Foggy visibility left analysts flying by the seat of their pants and pushed some strategists to suspend their year-end S&P 500 price targets. The upside from all the ambiguity is that a record number of S&P 500 firms beat analyst estimates in the second quarter and the index kept rallying.“Analysts as they came through the early coronavirus period set the bar incredibly low,” said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at PRSPCTV Capital LLC. “Now roll forward several months and we’re at a moment in time where reality wasn’t nearly as bad as feared.”The flipside of that dynamic may be what the market is facing now. As guidance improves, analysts are following with earnings upgrades, potentially setting up a higher bar for companies to clear. Expected profits for the third quarter increased by 5.6% to $33.13 a share during the course of the period, the first time in two years analysts were raising estimates into reporting season.Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. kicked off the earnings season Tuesday. Citi shares fell after costs rose and the bank warned of a slower economic recovery, though earnings topped estimates. JPMorgan also beat profit expectations.With macro uncertainties elevated in coming months, management teams might still be reluctant to provide guidance, according to Goldman Sachs’s David Kostin. A timeline of when a vaccine might become widely available is up in the air and headway on a new stimulus package from Congress has been stymied. Those factors coupled with the upcoming elections, “are all valid reasons for executives to minimize forward-looking commentary,” Kostin and a team of strategists wrote in a report.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Profit Guidance Suggests S&P 500 Firms Overstated Lockdown Woes

2020-10-16,"Lockdowns and stay-at-home restrictions have helped in driving huge demand for snacks and beverages since the pandemic began. However, the fall in consumption in the away-from-home channels and supply chain disruptions had a notable impact on snack food and beverage companies.The spike in at-home channel sales moderated in the third quarter but the demand for snacks, packaged food and beverages continues to be better than pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 fears are impacting on-premise consumption.Against this backdrop of changing dynamics, we will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to place Mondelez International and PepsiCo alongside each other and see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.Mondelez International (MDLZ)Mondelez is one of the largest snack companies and is known globally for its brands like Oreo, belVita, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Toblerone and Trident gum. It has been enhancing its snack offerings through continued innovation and strategic acquisitions.In July, the company acquired a majority interest in Give & Go, a sweet baked goods maker and owner of the Two-Bite Brownies and the Create-A-Treat brands. Mondelez acquired a majority stake in Perfect Snacks, which has a strong presence in the refrigerated nutrition bars segment, in 2019 and Tate’s Bake Shop, a premium cookie and baked goods brand, in 2018.The pandemic has adversely impacted Mondelez’s world travel retail sales, away-from-home channel and the traditional trade channel in certain key emerging markets. The gum category was severely dragged down by a drop in on-the-go consumption.In 2Q, revenue declined 2.5% Y/Y to $5.9 billion even as the company’s North America business grew 17.3% to $2.0 billion. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures, the company’s organic revenue grew 0.7%.Despite the weakness in the top-line, 2Q adjusted EPS grew 12.5% to $0.63 due to the company’s cost-containment efforts. In its 2Q conference call, Mondelez stated that it maintained or gained share in markets that represent about 85% of its year-to-date revenue. The company also said that overall business was trending better in July than in 2Q and it expects a sequential improvement in 3Q.In the first half of the year, Mondelez generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion. In July, the company announced about an 11% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.315.As part of its efforts to reduce its costs and streamline its supply chain, the company is removing 25% of SKUs (stock keeping unit). The company intends to redirect its cost savings to brand-building efforts.Focus on the e-commerce channel is also a key priority for the company, especially when consumers are increasingly shopping online for groceries amid the pandemic. E-commerce sales grew 91% in 2Q and accounted for 6% of the company’s 2Q revenue, up from 3.5% in 1Q.After several back-to-back Buy ratings in recent months, Mondelez was downgraded on Thursday by Guggenheim analyst Laurent Grandet to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $60. The analyst feels that the current valuation reflects the expected future revenue growth potential of about 3% to 4%, which is below some peers.However, the analyst continues to believe that “Mondelez is a best-in-class US food company and, while it isn’t benefiting as much as peers during the pandemic due to the nature of its categories, we expect it to continue capturing global snack market share in the years ahead.” (See MDLZ stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, the rest of the Street is bullish about Mondelez. A Strong Buy consensus is based on 12 Buys versus 1 Hold and no Sells. The stock has risen 5.9% year-to-date and the average analyst price target of $63.17 indicates an upside potential of 8.3% from the current levels.PepsiCo (PEP)PepsiCo’s snack food business, especially Frito Lay North America, has helped it in mitigating weakness in soda beverages over recent years as consumers are shifting to healthier options. The snack food and beverage giant has an extensive portfolio of brands, including 23 brands (like Frito-Lay, Cheetos, Doritos, Gatorade, Pepsi, Quaker and Tropicana) that generate over $1 billion each in estimated annual retail sales.The COVID-19 pandemic hurt the company’s sales from the away-from-channels like restaurants. However, the situation improved in the third quarter. PepsiCo’s 3Q revenue increased 5.3% Y/Y to $18.1 billion while organic revenue growth was 4.2%. Adjusted EPS grew 6.4% to $1.66.Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America divisions delivered organic revenue growth of 6% each as at-home food consumption continued to be strong amid rising COVID cases. PepsiCo Beverages North America division posted organic revenue growth of 3%.With the exception of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia division, the company experienced organic growth in all its international divisions. PepsiCo now expects organic revenue growth of about 4% and a 0.5% decline in its adjusted EPS in 2020.Nonetheless, the company continues to expand its presence in growth areas. Earlier this year, PepsiCo acquired Rockstar Energy and entered into an agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals for the exclusive distribution of Bang Energy drinks in the US in line with its strategy to expand in the energy drinks market.It also acquired Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China. PepsiCo is improving its visibility and scale in its e-commerce business, which almost doubled in 3Q.The company continues to focus on the innovation of healthier snack food and beverage categories. PepsiCo stated that Gatorade Zero, Bubly and Mountain Dew Zero Sugar together delivered over $1 billion in retail sales on a year-to-date basis. The company is also expanding the presence of Pepsi Zero Sugar, which has seen over 30% retail sales growth year-to-date.PepsiCo is a dividend aristocrat (a company that has hiked dividends for at least 25 consecutive years) and raised its annualized dividend this year to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share. This year marks the 48th consecutive year of dividend rise.On Oct.12, Citi analyst Wendy Nicholson upgraded PepsiCo to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $169 from $148. The analyst believes that PepsiCo's earnings growth can accelerate next year and its relative multiple can ""expand considerably from current levels.""The analyst noted that PepsiCo has delivered the most consistent organic sales growth when compared to fellow mega-caps Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble. Nicholson also says that while Pepsi has a lower operating margin than its peers, it has the largest potential to expand its operating margin in coming years. (See PEP stock analysis on TipRanks)The Street is cautiously optimistic on PepsiCo stock. A Moderate Buy consensus is based on 6 Buys versus 5 Holds and no Sells. The stock has risen 3.5% so far in 2020 and could rise 7.7% in the coming months as indicated by the average analyst price target of $152.27.ConclusionBoth Mondelez and PepsiCo have strong brands and extensive international presence. Mondelez has a dividend yield of 2.15% compared to PepsiCo’s yield of 2.87%. However, Mondelez stock has fared better than PepsiCo so far this year and has slightly more upside potential as indicated by the current average analyst price target. With a lower valuation as well as a more bullish Street consensus, Mondelez appears to be a better stock than PepsiCo right now.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2021-01-04,"Shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) rose by 7.60% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt PepsiCo has.PepsiCo's Debt According to the PepsiCo's most recent financial statement as reported on October 1, 2020, total debt is at $44.57 billion, with $37.88 billion in long-term debt and $6.69 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $9.09 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $35.48 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. PepsiCo has $92.04 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.48. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-01-04,"The bullish case for beverage giants Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) has come to an end at RBC, mostly due to valuation concerns.The Analyst: Nik Modi downgraded Coca-Cola's stock from Outperform to Sector Perform with an unchanged $55 price target. The analyst also downgraded PepsiCo's stock from Outperform to Sector Perform with an unchanged $153 price target.The Coca-Cola Thesis: Modi said Coca-Cola's management team deserves credit for recent initiatives, including organizational redesign, optimizing the portfolio, among other initiatives, but it will ""take time for the company to hit its stride"" given many moving pieces.For example, the organizational changes only came into effect on Jan. 1 and there will be ""growing pains"" for at least one to two quarters. Investors may not see signs of improvement until the third quarter while the full impact won't be realized until 2022.Coca-Cola faces similar headwinds as every other company as social distancing and other health measures will likely remain in place until at least the middle of the summer, the analyst wrote in the note. Meanwhile, employers will continue to hold an ""overly-cautious"" view in asking workers to return to the office.It's possible this thesis is wrong and society will enter ""a roaring 20's type scenario"" sooner than expected. In the meantime, Modi said Coca-Cola's stock is trading at around 26 times next year's EPS, marking the highest valuation level seen in five years and a 16% premium versus its large-cap peers.The PepsiCo Thesis: Modi said PepsiCo's strong exposure to snacks and management's focus on new product launches like Pepsi Zero Sugar and new Mountain Dew flavors implies recent momentum can be sustained. Other encouraging initiatives in the pipeline include investing in Gatorade Zero and positioning Bolt 24 to compete against Body Armor which is partially owned by Coca-Cola.However, PepsiCo's energy beverage line faces some near-term challenges after legal spats with Bang's parent company VPX. While a court concluded that VPX can't end its exclusive distribution partnership with PepsiCo until October 2023, the friction could pave the way for rivals to gain market share.PepsiCo's stock is trading at 24 times next year's EPS, marking a 16% premium to its five-year historical average and within striking distance of its all-time high.Price Action: Shares of Coca-Cola were trading lower by more than 3% Monday morning at $53.02, while shares of PepsiCo were lower by 2.3% at $144.92.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Google Employees Form Union  * Gene Munster Explains His Bullish Jumia Thesis(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

PepsiCo (PEP) Leading nonalcoholic beverage and snack food giant PepsiCo showed resilience amid the pandemic even as the company’s sales in the away-from-home channels were weak. Notably, the company’s food business displayed greater strength than its beverage offerings. Both Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods North America segments posted 6% organic revenue growth in 3Q 2020, reflecting higher consumption of brands like Tostitos, Ruffles, Quaker’s pasta, lite snacks and other products. Meanwhile, organic revenue growth for PepsiCo’s North America Beverages segment came in at 3% as higher pricing offset the impact of lower volumes. Overall, organic volumes of PepsiCo's food portfolio grew 3% in 3Q and outpaced the 1% rise in global beverage volumes. In recent years, the company’s snack food business has been faring better as the beverage business is under pressure due to weak soda volumes owing to the preference for non-carbonated drinks. Following its 3Q performance (organic revenue growth of 4.2% and adjusted EPS increase of 6.4%), PepsiCo predicted organic revenue growth of 4% and an adjusted EPS decline of 0.5% for the full-year 2020. (See PEP stock analysis on TipRanks) Looking ahead, the company continues to innovate and invest in better food and beverage offerings with lower salt and sugar levels. PepsiCo is also expanding its presence in the energy drinks space, which the company referred to as a “highly profitable category” on its 3Q earnings call. Last year, PepsiCo acquired Rockstar Energy for an upfront cash payment of about $3.9 billion, in line with its strategy to grow in the energy drinks market. PepsiCo, which is a dividend aristocrat (a company that has hiked dividends for at least 25 consecutive years), increased its annualized dividend last year by 7.1% to $4.09 per share. PepsiCo’s dividend yield stands at 2.89%. Despite certain favorable aspects like a strong snack food business and an impressive dividend track record, PepsiCo was downgraded to Hold by two analysts this month while one analyst initiated a Sell rating. On Jan. 4, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi downgraded PepsiCo to Hold from Buy, mainly due to valuation concerns. The analyst assigned a price target of $153 for PepsiCo stock and stated, “We believe the company will be able to maintain topline momentum via improving consumer insights and stepped up reinvestment. At 24x CY′21E EPS - a half turn away from its 5-yr peak - we are hard pressed to see material share price upside in the absence of material EPS upside.” The rest of the Street is also sidelined on the stock, with a Hold analyst consensus based on 4 Holds and 1 Sell. The average price target of $150.75 indicates an upside potential of 6.1% from current levels. Shares have essentially been flat over the past one year. Monster Beverage (MNST) Monster Beverage is one of the leading players in the global energy drinks market. The company was already facing pressure from rival Red Bull and now the competition is heating up with PepsiCo’s acquisition of Rockstar, the rapid growth of Vital Pharmaceuticals' Bang energy drink and Coca-Cola’s rollout of Coca-Cola Energy. Despite the impact of the pandemic on the foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel (which is the company’s largest channel), Monster Beverage’s 3Q net sales grew 9.9% to $1.25 billion and EPS grew 18% year-over-year to $0.65. (See MNST stock analysis on TipRanks) The company’s growing international presence continues to be a key driver. International net sales increased 17% year-over-year to about $445 million and accounted for close to 36% of 3Q 2020 net sales, up from 34% in 3Q 2019. Under a strategic partnership with Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage has been expanding the distribution of its products in the international markets. Meanwhile, the company has also been launching several new products, with 3Q introductions including Juice Monster Khaotic Energy + Juice, Juice Monster Papillon Energy + Juice, Monster Energy Ultra Watermelon, Reign Total Body Fuel Lilikoi Lychee and Ultra Energy Peach Mango. Earlier this month, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan boosted the price target on Monster Beverage to $105 from $91. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock given several new product launches anticipated in 1Q 2021. Commenting on the company’s prospects, Astrachan stated, ""Strong sales growth in part reflects successful Fall 2020 innovation (e.g., Ultra Watermelon, juices) with more anticipated in 2021, including the pending launch of Ultra Gold and three Reign SKUs [stock keeping units]. We also anticipate the company to introduce 12-ounce cans for several best-selling SKUs, which could expand usage occasions and also be mix accretive.” “We also continue to think an alcoholic beverage introduction is increasingly likely in 2021, especially given two additional trademark filings and a job posting for a manager of alcohol strategy, both in late December,” added Astrachan. Overall, Monster Beverage scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus backed by 11 Buys versus 3 Holds. Shares have gained about 34% over the past year and the average price target of $101.50 implies further upside potential of about 12.7% from current levels. Conclusion PepsiCo has an extensive portfolio of brands across the snack food and beverage space. But the dismal soda volumes continue to be a drag while the snack food business is faring well. Currently, Wall Street analysts appear to be more bullish on Monster Beverage’s long-term potential in the high-margin energy drinks space. Also, the stock offers a greater possible upside as indicated by the average price target.

PepsiCo rose 1.2% at the close on Jan. 26. Financial terms of the partnership weren’t disclosed. However, Beyond Meat (BYND) believes that the venture will provide the plant-based meat maker with access to more customers as it enters new product categories and distribution channels. For the purpose of the joint venture, Beyond Meat and PepsiCo (PEP) will create a new entity called The PLANeT Partnership, LLC (TPP). “We are thrilled to formally join forces with PepsiCo in The PLANeT Partnership, a joint venture that unites the tremendous depth and breadth of their distribution and marketing capabilities with our leading innovation in plant-based protein,” said Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown. “PepsiCo represents the ideal partner for us in this exciting endeavor, one of global reach and importance."" The joint venture will make use of what it called positive ingredients through tools and techniques such as regenerative agriculture and net water- and carbon-neutral production plants. The partnership comes after Beyond Meat earlier this month teamed up with Yum Brands’ (YUM) subsidiary Taco Bell to develop plant-based protein. Over the past year, the company has forged partnerships to enter additional international markets, including Brazil and China, to shift its sales to retail as the coronavirus pandemic is boosting the appetite for healthier eating, while outdoor dining options are limited and consumption in supermarkets is increasing. As of Sept. 26, Beyond Meat sold products at about 122,000 retail and foodservice outlets in over 80 countries worldwide. The company’s recent deals have helped BYND’s share price surge 48% over the past month. Following the steep rally, the average analyst price target of $109 now indicates downside potential of about 42% from current levels. Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh views the PepsiCo joint venture “very favorably” and believes “this represents another attractive longer-term driver for BYND to capture more share in the expanding plant-based food ecosystem.” For now, however, Parikh remains sidelined on the stock with a Hold rating as he awaits financial details of the partnership, but suspects “this likely is not impactful to BYND's results for at least a few quarters.” “We see a tricky setup from here with challenging fundamentals amidst increasing competition at retail and difficulties at food-service. However, short interest remains quite elevated at 38.1% of float,” the analyst commented. The rest of the Street has a cautiously bearish outlook on the stock. The Moderate Sell analyst consensus shows 7 Sells, and 9 Holds, versus only 1 Buy. (See BYND stock analysis on TipRanks).

2021-01-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Mike Frazzini had never made a video game when he helped start Amazon Game Studios. Eight years later, he has released two duds, withdrew both from stores after a torrent of negative reactions and canceled many more. For a company that dominates countless areas of retail, consumer electronics and enterprise computing, the multiple failures in gaming show one realm that may be impervious to Amazon.com Inc.’s distinctive business philosophy. It tried to make games the Amazon way, instead of simply making games people would want to play.Frazzini is an Amazon lifer who came up in the books section of the website, where he endeared himself to Jeff Bezos as a manager there. Conventional wisdom inside the company is that if you can run one business, you can run any other. Amazon’s deep financial resources certainly help. As head of the games division, Frazzini has acquired established development studios and pushed the company to spend nearly $1 billion for the live video streaming website Twitch. Frazzini recruited some of the top names in the video game industry, including creators of the critically acclaimed franchises EverQuest and Portal, as well as executives from Electronic Arts Inc. and other big publishers.Then, according to numerous current and former employees of Frazzini’s game studios, he ignored much of their advice. He frequently told staff that every Amazon game needed to be a “billion-dollar franchise” and then understaffed the projects, they say. Instead of using industry-standard development tools, Frazzini insisted Amazon build its own, which might have saved the company money if the software ever worked properly. Executives under Frazzini initially rejected charges that New World, an Amazon game that would ask players to colonize a mythical land and murder inhabitants who bear a striking resemblance to Native Americans, was racist. They relented after Amazon hired a tribal consultant who found that the portrayal was indeed offensive, say two people who worked on the project. The game, previously planned for release last year, is now scheduled for this spring.This story is based on interviews with more than 30 current and former Amazon employees, most of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity citing fears of litigation or career repercussions. A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment or make Frazzini available for an interview.Amazon is spending nearly $500 million a year operating the video game division, two people familiar with the budget say. That amount doesn’t include Twitch or a new project under different management, which is building a service to stream games to a computer, phone or Amazon Fire TV.To develop games, Amazon tried to bend a creative and collaborative process to its will, and the results offer lessons to Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google, whose efforts so far have been similarly ineffective. Successful video games are a combination of art, entertainment, technology and very large budgets. Big tech companies only really figured out the last two.Many of the game developers who joined Amazon found themselves repelled by the corporate culture. The company is driven by data, and employees are expected to write six-page documents to get major decisions approved. In game development, on the other hand, a phrase often uttered around the office is “finding the fun.” It refers to altering and polishing small aspects of a game to figure out what makes the experience enjoyable. The results are measured only in emotion, which is why many developers say it’s critical for the people in charge to have experience making games.At Amazon’s core is a set of 14 leadership principles. They include “customer obsession” and “frugality.” For a company man like Frazzini, they offer a scale by which every member of the team is measured. “If you don’t come in line with that approach, you’ll struggle at Amazon,” says Jason Child, who spent more than a decade in Amazon’s finance department. Adapting to the corporate culture counts for much more than expertise, he says. “If someone is a guru in video games and they go to Amazon, would they be successful? Probably not.” Jeff Bezos is more of a book guy, but the directive to go into video games came straight from the top. The Amazon chief executive officer indicated he was willing to spend exorbitant sums of money and offer development teams as long as they needed, say three people who worked directly with Bezos. All that mattered was that they make the most ambitious games possible, ones that would draw gamers into the Amazon Prime ecosystem and showcase the technical capabilities of its cloud division. Allowing 10,000 people to play in a single game session was given to the new team as a lofty target. Two projects under this directive became known around the office as the “Bezos games.”Bezos views games as yet another way to sell subscriptions to Prime and hook customers on its other offerings, including television shows and movies. As other e-commerce companies catch up with speedy free shipping, Amazon has sought to add more perks to Prime to justify the price of membership. Frazzini helped kick off the games initiative in 2012 and soon became boss. He had risen from the books department to run the section of Amazon’s store that sells video games shipped by mail. At first, the new group planned to make games for the Amazon Appstore and release them on Android phones, including the ill-fated Amazon Fire Phone, as well as the Fire TV. By 2014, the company decided to move into games for PCs and eventually consoles. It was a dramatic change. Mobile games can be made by small teams in just a few months, whereas bigger ones take hundreds of people toiling away for years.Frazzini set up a new game development operation at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle. They would later call it Relentless Studios, using one of Bezos’s favorite adjectives for the company. To help run it, Frazzini tapped Louis Castle, who founded the influential game company behind the Command & Conquer series.Amazon hired celebrated developers like Kim Swift, designer of the puzzle game Portal, and Clint Hocking, director of the shooter Far Cry 2. It also formed two more studios in California. The splashy hires kept coming, including Madden guru Richard Hilleman and online gaming pioneer John Smedley. Today, only Smedley remains. All declined to comment.At first, new recruits thought they were entering some sort of fantasy land. Many were paid double the market rate of other game makers in the area, on top of lucrative packages of Amazon stock that just kept rising in value. Teams had deadlines, but they proved to be flexible, and overtime requests were infrequent, more than a dozen former employees say.One aspect of working at Amazon felt similar to traditional game companies. The studios cultivated a “bro culture” in which women often weren’t given the same opportunities as men, former employees say. Four female game developers say their worst experiences of sexism in the industry were at Amazon. They shared stories of being ignored and undermined by male executives and say they were eventually driven out of the company. One former employee says male colleagues completely ignored her comments in meetings. Another says a member of senior leadership impeded her career growth after she disagreed with him and that he created new management positions above her and filled them with men.Other employees registered less consequential complaints about all the company jargon thrown around the office. Frazzini regularly expounded on the Amazon leadership principles. One of those was “Hire and develop the best,” which was flattering to employees but didn’t tell the full story. “The philosophy Amazon takes is: Hiring expertise is secondary to having leaders who follow the Amazon principles,” says Child, the former employee. “Amazon does hire experts from various industries, but then they expect those folks to adopt the Amazon way.”The game studios even established their own separate set of principles, although the credos frequently changed and sometimes were in tension with one another, say four people who worked there. Each game world should accommodate as many players as possible, yet also be fun to play solo at the same time. They had to be huge financial successes on a Call of Duty scale but also innovative and unlike anything the world had seen before. To experienced game developers, these rules seemed like a surefire way to not release anything.Amazon didn’t give employees much financial incentive to release anything, either. Most big game companies pay staff bonuses based in part on the critical and commercial response to their games, but Amazon’s stock plan only rewards employees for time spent at the company. That led some to prioritize job preservation over anything else, say three former employees. They say they watched colleagues avoid arguments and only seek to placate bosses like Frazzini, even when they disagreed. (This was in defiance of the Amazon principle “Have backbone; disagree and commit.”)Frazzini’s lack of experience in video games showed during project review sessions, a standard industry ritual when the boss plays early prototypes and offers feedback. His comments were of the focus-group variety, recalls a former Amazon developer: “Why is it this color?” and “Seems fun. When will it be ready?” On a different occasion, says another developer, the team cringed as Frazzini struggled to differentiate between hyper-polished conceptual footage and live gameplay, a sign he didn’t understand the technology.Some meetings got sidetracked when Frazzini, armed with the latest VentureBeat article about whatever game was making the most money that month, demanded they chase a new trend, four developers say. The team wound up designing lesser versions of popular games, a desperate strategy laid out in a recent Wired article. Riot Games Inc.’s League of Legends inspired an Amazon project called Nova that was canned in 2017. Epic Games Inc.’s Fortnite led to another Amazon game, Intensity, canceled in 2019. Activision Blizzard Inc.’s Overwatch begot Amazon’s Crucible, which would suffer a similar fate.Amazon’s most successful gaming property isn’t actually a game. Twitch draws some 26 million people a day to watch live video of other people playing video games. Frazzini helped secure the acquisition in August 2014 for $970 million, which would later prove to be a bargain. Various attempts by Facebook, Google and Microsoft Corp. to build their own live-streaming networks for games have failed.Soon after the Twitch deal, Bezos devised a plan to closely pair Amazon Game Studios with the video site, say two people who met with the CEO. Twitch would serve as a free marketing vehicle for Amazon games, and the games, in turn, would offer Twitch viewers features they couldn’t get anywhere else.The two teams held daylong brainstorming sessions, but the summits didn’t amount to much, according to people who attended. One concept they did pursue together was a series of celebrity events to promote their games and sell subscriptions to Amazon Prime. They held one in New Jersey featuring the Clerks filmmaker Kevin Smith. Attempts to land other stars, including Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, for a second event in Las Vegas were unsuccessful. They invited Smith back and then shelved the series.The Twitch chief, Emmett Shear, was reluctant to assign his employees to projects for the game studios, two people who worked with him say. One proposal, pushed by Frazzini in 2017, asked Twitch to help build a digital game store, the former employees say. The idea would allow Amazon to avoid paying a 30% sales commission to Steam, the most popular storefront for PC games. Twitch employees weren’t thrilled because Amazon didn’t have any big games with which to attract shoppers. Frazzini’s employees assigned to collaborate on the project protested because bypassing Steam would shrink their market, four former employees say. Withholding a game from Steam, they argued, is the equivalent of refusing to sell a book on Amazon. When the project was due for more staffing resources, Shear resisted, and it was left to languish inside Amazon Game Studios.Frazzini was more fixated on another project anyway. Amazon’s designers and programmers needed a game engine, a collection of tools used to build games. For most studios, there are really only two options. Epic’s Unreal Engine is Coke, and Unity Software Inc. is Pepsi. Amazon, in effect, decided to make an RC Cola. In 2014, it licensed technology from the German company Crytek for a homemade engine called Lumberyard. Frazzini then assigned a team of engineers to build the engine and released it to the public in 2016 for free. The tools are intertwined with Amazon Web Services, setting up Lumberyard as a way to draw a new class of software developers to the business. Frazzini, who reports to Web Services Chief Andy Jassy, also mandated that all Amazon games be built with Lumberyard, rather than pay for Unreal or Unity.Lumberyard became a bogeyman around the office. Some features required esoteric commands to function, and the system was painfully slow. Developers played Halo or watched Amazon Prime Video while waiting for Lumberyard to process art or compile code, several former employees say. A common refrain around the office, according to a former employee: “Lumberyard is killing this company.”From the outside, though, Amazon’s game operation was scaring competitors. It had some of the world’s brightest minds, a deep budget and the most sophisticated internet infrastructure on earth. It was building a proprietary engine, and at TwitchCon in 2016, Amazon said it was working on three new games: Breakaway, Crucible and New World. (Nova, the League of Legends copycat, was still under lock and key.) Over the coming years, all but one would be canceled.In the summer of 2018, Frazzini nabbed his biggest hire yet. Christoph Hartmann, the new vice president of game studios at Amazon, had spent two decades at Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., where he published blockbusters such as BioShock and Mafia. It was a somewhat controversial hire, as Hartmann was also responsible for some high-profile failures, such as The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, which led to the developer’s demise.Still, Frazzini positioned Hartmann as a fixer to staff. Hartmann loosened the mandate to make everything with Lumberyard, and some teams began prototyping games using Unreal Engine. Hartmann also pressed Amazon to publish titles made by other companies. It signed one such deal with the Korean publisher Smilegate to release a game in 2021.Soon after Hartmann’s appointment, Amazon came close to capturing a much brighter star in the media world. The company informed staff in 2018 that Jason Kilar, a former Amazonian and onetime Hulu CEO, was rejoining to oversee the Amazon games division and presumably become Frazzini’s boss, say two people who were there at the time. For unexplained reasons, Kilar never arrived. (The almost-hiring was first reported by technology news site the Information.) In April 2020, he joined WarnerMedia as CEO.With Frazzini still at the helm, the game studios began aligning themselves with Amazon’s far more successful film and television properties. The company said in 2019 that it was working with the Chinese developer Leyou Technologies Holdings Ltd. on an online game based on the Lord of the Rings as a complement to the upcoming Prime Video series. That same year, Amazon released its first-ever console game, a racing simulation based on the Prime Video show The Grand Tour, a car review series starring the original British stars of Top Gear. The game bombed. It drew so few players that Amazon took the unusual step of removing it from storefronts a year later.The embarrassments kept coming. In May 2020, Amazon released Crucible, the hero shooter inspired by Overwatch. “One of the things that we hear most often from people who try Crucible is that it feels unique,” Frazzini said in an interview at the time.Gamers weren’t interested. Reviewers at IGN called it “tedious,” and PC Gamer declared: “Amazon’s long-awaited hero shooter wasn’t worth the wait.” Twitch didn’t offer much support, either. A week after release, fewer than 1,000 people were watching Crucible videos on Twitch. Former employees of the live-streaming unit say Twitch was often reluctant to alter a game’s fate through promotion. After all, Twitch can’t save a game nobody wants to play. Amazon pulled Crucible from wide release in June and then killed it in October.Amazon shifted many of the Crucible developers to work on New World. The project was originally pitched as a survival game in which people would play as colonists in a fictional version of 1600s America, fighting enemies that looked a lot like indigenous people. The original code name for the game was Roanoke, named after Sir Walter Raleigh’s failed settlements in the 16th century. When developers at Amazon pointed out to Frazzini’s deputy, Patrick Gilmore, that the setting and villains could be considered racist, he expressed disbelief, according to two people who worked there. Gilmore didn’t respond to a request for comment. The disagreement, former employees say, fit a pattern of executives neglecting advice from staff.Developers eventually removed the Native American imagery from New World. The game was set for release this past August, but after Crucible’s scathing reception, Amazon pushed the debut back to this year. Still, several Amazon employees are optimistic about the title. It has received positive buzz from streamers and is the kind of ambitious project Bezos is known to support, employees say.Frazzini is fond of saying anything can be measured, according to two people who worked closely with him. This philosophy, common in Silicon Valley, is anathema to game industry veterans. “Nobody who’s successful starts with metrics,” says Seamus Blackley, who helped design the original Xbox. The Microsoft game console was the last winning incursion into the video game market in the past two decades, despite expensive attempts including Apple Arcade, Facebook Oculus and Google Stadia.Fairly or not, Frazzini gets a lot of the blame for Amazon’s gaming failures at a time when overall spending on video games during the coronavirus pandemic is up significantly. After the cancellation of Crucible, an outgoing employee entered the Seattle office to collect personal belongings and found a crass message in big blue letters scrawled on a whiteboard: “Fraz is cancer.” Orbiting the note was a handful of “+1”s written in assorted colors.The biggest new game product from Amazon has nothing to do with Frazzini. Amazon Luna lets subscribers instantly play console-grade games without the need to buy pricey hardware or wait hours to download a large file. The team released a version for Android devices in December, and the service remains in early access limited to customers who request an invitation.The Luna project is overseen by David Limp, who runs the devices division that produces the Echo and Kindle. In its current iteration, Luna offers more than two-dozen games, none of which are made by Amazon Game Studios. “I hope that they have a hit,” Limp said in an interview in September. “But in addition, I think it’s equally important for us to build a system, and I think Luna has the starting points for that.”In many ways, the approach to games mirrors the one that eventually led Amazon to some success in Hollywood. It tried a bunch of different things—develop a streaming service, set up a studio, produce TVs and films, build a set-top box—and selected an Amazon insider, Roy Price, to run it. Price produced a handful of bad shows before Transparent won Amazon its first Golden Globe in 2015. Then came Oscars for Manchester by the Sea and more Golden Globes for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Price was ousted in 2017 over sexual harassment allegations, and Bezos took the unlikely step of looking outside of the company, to Hollywood, for his replacement, Jennifer Salke. She cemented Amazon Prime Video as an important part of the company’s business strategy. People sign up for Prime to watch The Boys, and they buy more stuff on Amazon.Amazon could still do the same in gaming. Luna demonstrates a continued commitment, as do the investments in New World and as-yet-unannounced projects including a secretive new game from Smedley, who laid the foundation for massively multiplayer online games in the late 1990s with EverQuest. After Amazon’s misadventures in gaming, there’s at least one passage from the leadership principles the company will still hope to prove: “Leaders are right a lot.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Can Make Just About Anything—Except a Good Video Game

2021-02-01,"PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) is mounting a full-throttle marketing push for Super Bowl LV, albeit without its flagship Pepsi-Cola brand. What Happened: While a great deal of media coverage of this year's Super Bowl marketing has noted the absence of the Pepsi-Cola brand, the PepsiCo portfolio will be on full display during the Feb. 7 broadcast. The company's Cheetos brand will be represented with a commercial starring Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Shaggy in a noir spoof involving Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix, while talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and actress Mindy Kaling bump up against a mysterious figure called ""#FlatMatthew"" in an advertisement for Doritos 3D Crunch.

2021-02-05,"Super Bowl LV may have familiar faces, with quarterbacks Tom Brady leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Patrick Mahomes in charge of the Kansas City Chiefs, but this year's matchup on Sunday will be anything but typical. For starters, the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, where the game will be held, will only have 25,000 fans, less than half its total capacity. Even in between plays, the commercials will have a much different vibe. Anheuser Busch Inbev NV's (NYSE: BUD) is promoting vaccine awareness instead of airing commercials showcasing its core Budweiser beer. Beverage behemoth Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) told CNBC it made the difficult decision not to show any ads, as it focused on ""investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times."" Fortunately, there will still be some commercials that will — hopefully — make you laugh. Restaurants: Casual fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) will make its Super Bowl debut with a commercial titled ""Can a Burrito Change the World?"" Fresh off a year of strong momentum in which the company's digital initiatives proved to be extremely popular, the restaurant chain feels now is the time to help promote a message. Chipotle Chief Marketing Officer Chris Brandt explained in a press release the company wants to ""help shift attention toward creating positive change for the challenges our food system faces and educate consumers on how they can make difference."" Another newcomer to the Super Bowl commercial realm is privately owned Jimmy John's. Actor Brad Garrett plays the role of Tony Bolognavich, a Mafia-like owner of a sandwich chain who starts to worry about Jimmy John's superior, customizable and affordable items. Most likely, the big story will be the battle of the restaurant delivery apps. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) is going big with a commercial featuring a throwback to the '90s with ""Wayne's World"" stars Mike Myers as Wayne and Dana Carvey as Garth. They collaborate with a more present day phenomenon, Cardi B. There are TikTok dances involved, too. ""Wayne and Garth are the happiest characters we've ever played, and it just seemed like the world really needs them right now,"" Carvey told The Hollywood Reporter. Rival DoorDash Inc (NYSE: DASH) is tapping Cookie Monster and other Sesame Street characters in a feel-good commercial aiming to raise awareness of the company's five-year, $200-million commitment to support merchants. ""The essence of the spot is about optimism — giving something back to our communities in hopes of brightening their days and building groundswell for our neighborhoods,"" while also aiding Sesame Workshop, David Bornoff, head of consumer marketing at DoorDash, told CBS MoneyWatch. Related Link: Here's How You Can Score Some Free Food During The Super Bowl Food: M&M maker Mars' commercial, titled ""Come Together,"" shows how a bag of M&M's can be used in conjunction with an apology to make amends with others.

The recipient responds, ""That's my name,"" after which the first woman pulls out another bag of M&M's and says, ""I'm sorry your name is Karen."" PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) is going all-out with its food products. Its Cheetos brand will no doubt rival M&M's for the funniest food commercial. Throughout different scenarios, Mila Kunis denys she is eating a bag of Cheetos that are her husband Ashton Kutcher's, replying each time, despite evidence to the contrary, ""it wasn't me."" Cue Shaggy's entrance. Yes, that Shaggy. A Doritos commercial will feature Mindy Kaling and Jimmy Kimmel, and a Frito-Lay commercial will showcase former Super Bowl stars. Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) is also looking to join the party with a commercial promoting mixing Pringles flavors. On a more serious note, the Unilever N.V. Common Stock's (NYSE: UL) Hellman's mayonnaise commercial featuring Amy Schumer is about raising awareness about food waste. Beverages: For the first time in nearly four decades, Super Bowl fans won't watch a Budweiser commercial. But that doesn't hold true for other alcohol products under the Anheuser brand. One example is a commercial promoting Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade, the beverage born after ""2020 handed us all those lemons."" Stella Artois returns to the Super Bowl with a commercial featuring Lenny Kravitz, who delivers a message of love. PepsiCo isn't advertising its core Pepsi product during commercials, but the company is splurging on a commercial for its Rockstar energy drink brand featuring rapper Lil Baby, and Pepsi tapped iconic wrestler-turned-actor John Cena to promote its new Mountain Dew Major Mellon drink.

The possibility of COVID-19 threat coming to an end is brining hopes that Disney will achieve a robust recovery soon and return even stronger. Meanwhile, Disney+ gives the company a viable tool it can use to market its own intellectual property, while benefiting its margins with rising subscription fees. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) already showed how that approach can create massive cash flow but it is also not showing any signs of stopping with many new entrants making streaming to be a very competitive field.Disney executives will discuss their 2021 outlook while probably still being cautious about the eventual recovery of other parts of its empire. PepsiCo Vs Pepsi PepsiCo's business was dramatically reshaped by the pandemic, but the beverage and snack food giant is on pace to grow organic sales by approximately 5% in 2020 after all, matching the strong rate it achieved in 2019. That success explains why investors are more optimistic about Pepsi than about Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) who is also scheduled to report earnings this week. Besides a stronger beverage volume, Coke also couldn't match Pepsi's food segment.Pepsi is well positioned to boldly step into 2021 but investors will want to see the prospect of rising cash returns, with a dividend that was recently boosted by 7 %. Twitter Like many social media businesses, Twitter has enjoyed strong growth through the pandemic as it become more relevant than ever. User and engagement metrics each spiked over the first nine months of 2020, followed by advertising dollars as Twitter's third-quarter sales were up 14%. But the fourth quarter was challenging due to majordisinformation issues related to the presidential election. If Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) managed to crush estimates with its political controversy, Twitter should be able to maintain its positive momentum, which is CEO Jack Dorseyalready predicted back in October. The upcoming report will reveal if politics boosted engagement levels, further and whether Twitter managed to grow sales by at least 18% as Wall Street is predicting. General Motors Last week, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) managed to beat earnings per share expectations but missed on revenue, while revealing it plans to invest $29 billion in electric and self-driving vehicles through 2025, more than doubling its initial investment plans. It also announced it would cut production of its popular F-150 pickup truck on account of a global semiconductor shortage, a day after GM cut production at four of its plants for the same reason. On Wednesday, General Motors Company is expected to report net income of $2.4 billion or $1.67 a share, on sales of $36.1 billion before the market opens, based on a FactSet survey of 16 analysts. In the same period a year ago, the company reported a net income of $2.4 billion on sales of $30.8 billion. The stock has risen 37.4% since the company last reported earnings on November 5th and Honda (NYSE: HMC) and Nissan (OTC: NSANY) are also scheduled to report earnings, providing us with news on both the traditional and electric vehicle front.

2021-02-10,"PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) officially rebranded its Aunt Jemima brand as Pearl Milling Company, the creator of the original self-rising pancake mix. Aunt Jemima's History: Pearl Milling Company's roots as a manufacturer of pancake mix dates back to the 1800s. The food company rebranded as Aunt Jemima in 1890, a reference to a popular song at the time called, ""Old Aunt Jemima,"" that was typically performed by a white man in blackface, according to The Wall Street Journal. The pancake brand hired Nancy Green in 1893 to be its spokeswoman and play the role of Aunt Jemima at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. The Quaker Oats Company bought the pancake mix company in 1926 and launched Aunt Jemima syrup 40 years later. PepsiCo gained control of the pancake empire through its 2001 acquisition of Quaker Oats. Related Link: Beyond Meat Soars After Announcing Joint Venture With Pepsi Rebranded As Pearl Milling Company: PepsiCo said it acknowledges the origins of the pancake brand are ""based on a racial stereotype"" and the company's rebranding is part of its ""journey toward racial equality."" Despite a new name, the pancake brand will continue offering the ""same great recipe that you know and love."" ""The evolution will help carry the 130-year-old brand into the future,"" PepsiCo said. ""These initiatives comprise a holistic effort for PepsiCo to walk the talk of a leading corporation and help address the need for systemic change."" PepsiCo also said it will announce details of a new $1 million fund to ""empower and uplift Black girls and women."" This is on top of a $400 million, five-year investment to support Black businesses and communities. PepsiCo is inviting the public to share their thoughts on the rebranding.

The beverage company reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47, beating the Street consensus by a penny. During fiscal 2020, PepsiCo’s (PEP) revenue rose to $70.37 billion from $67.16 billion year-on-year. Earnings climbed 2% in constant currency terms to $5.52 per share during the same comparative period. Additionally, the softdrink company ramped up its annual dividend by 5% to $4.30 per share. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, PepsiCo forecasted a mid-single-digit increase to organic revenue and a high single-digit increase in earnings in constant currency terms. (See PepsiCo stock analysis on TipRanks) Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott recently initiated coverage on the stock with a Sell rating and a price target of $136 (1.23% downside potential). Callum noted that while the US savory snack market has been growing, PepsiCo profits have not expanded in three years. Furthermore, growth in the company’s snacks vertical has been completely offset by weakness in its beverages business. The rest of the Street has a Hold consensus rating on the stock. That’s based on 5 Holds versus 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $150.20 implies about 9% upside potential from current levels.

2021-02-11,"PepsiCo Inc has joined rival Coca-Cola in predicting revenue growth in 2021, saying on Thursday it expects pre-pandemic lifestyles to resume as economies reopen and COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out.

2021-02-11,"Shares of PepsiCo Inc. edged up 0.1% in premarket trading Thursday, after the beverage and snack company reported fourth-quarter profit that topped expectations, revenue that rose above forecasts and raised its dividend. Net income rose to $1.85 billion, or $1.33 a share, from $1.77 billion, or $1.26 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, core earnings per share grew to $1.47 from $1.45, above the FactSet consensus of $1.46. Revenue increased 8.8% to $22.46 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $21.80 billion.

Latin America revenue fell 5.2% to $2.41 billion, but beat expectations of $2.29 billion, while Europe revenue rose 3.8% to $4.04 billion to top forecasts of $3.93 billion. ""We ended the year on a strong note with our global beverage business having accelerated while our global snacks and food business remained resilient in the fourth quarter,"" said Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta. Separately, the company raised its annual dividend by 5%, to $4.30 a share from $4.09 a share, effective with the dividend to be paid in June.

2021-02-12,"Several food and beverage companies reported earnings on Thursday and despite a somewhat boring reputation in the ""meme stock"" generation, a name like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) offers ""slow and steady growth,"" according to Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. The Case For PepsiCo: Shares of PepsiCo fell about 2% after reporting a strong fourth quarter report in which management confirmed the company is on track to meet its long-term goals. Investors may want to take advantage of the stock's weakness as it is one of a few companies that offer long-term high-single-digit growth rates. ""Although the stock is down a little bit today off earnings, it's a stock that has essentially doubled in the last decade, and I think it has every chance of doubling in the next decade,"" Schlossberg said on CNBC. PepsiCo's growth prospects stem from its ability to continue executing on what works today. The company can leverage its ""tremendous dominance"" in salty snacks in regions like Asia that will experience a boom in middle-class growth. Related Link: What's On The Beyond Meat And PepsiCo Menu? The Case For Kraft Heinz: Food giant Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC) is similarly positioned to grow over the many years ahead, Schlossberg said. Backed by a cleaner and more agile business and free cash flow generation of more than $5 billion, shares have ""every chance"" to return back to the $50 per share level that was last seen in 2018. ""The key thing with all of these stocks is that you're buying them for very steady, slow growth and dividend capture,"" he said. PEP Price Action: PepsiCo stock is at $134.19 a share.

2021-02-12,"XL Fleet Corp. (NASDAQ:XL) is yet another company that has come to market as a result of the SPAC boom last year. The company began being publicly traded on Dec. 22, and XL stock has been on a volatile ride since its inception. The company’s share price spiked to as high as $35 immediately following the SPAC transaction, and have since settled down closer to where shares opened on Dec. 22 around $15. XL specializes in providing an “electrification as a service” business model. The company currently has over 200 customers, with more than 3,000 of its systems deployed. This brings me to the first key reason I like this early-stage EV company. This Isn’t an Early-Stage EV Company XL is unlike many of its competitors which are simply business model ideas that have gone public via a SPAC to raise funds. This company has proven its business model works, and has large cap blue chip customers as clients. The likes of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), and Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) happen to be large customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double XL has actually been in operations for around 10 years. This company has built a solid clientele, with meaningful revenues. The company’s business consists of providing hybrid/plug-in electrification drive systems for class 2-6 vehicles. The installation of these drive systems can take place on any standard OEM platform and don’t impact the warranty of the underlying vehicles. These drive systems provide fuel efficiency savings of up to 50% for these heavy duty vehicles. Additionally, greenhouse emissions are reduced by up to one-third. With so many blue chip players looking to meet greenhouse emission reduction targets, this is certainly going to be a booming business for a while. Thus, XL primarily provides a transitory technology taking ICE vehicles toward full electrification. That said, this is a company that has taken the execution risk component out of the equation. I like the medium-term value this stock provides right now at these levels. What Happens When Fleets Switch Over to Fully Electric Options? Significant risks with this business model do exist for long-term investors. Currently, the company’s core business focuses on turning ICE vehicles into hybrids to allow for short-term greenhouse emissions reductions. Longer-term, the company’s clientele will most likely invest in new fleets of purely EV options for its delivery services. These risks have been reflected in the company’s relatively small order backlog of around $12 million, and its lack of consistent and large repeat orders as in the past. However, expectations are that it will take decades for a majority of the cars on the road to be fully electric. The runway for XL is sufficiently long to make a long-term argument for owning this stock. This goes double if one believes XL can maintain its market position in this competitive market. (Yes, there are a number of competitors in this space). Additionally, XL appears to have a plan in place for the longer-term full electrification of fleets. XL has said it plans on introducing its own fully electric system by 2022. Such a move could be a game-changer, as investors are looking to buy what’s going to be hot 10 years from now, not necessarily what’s going to get us through the next ten years. Targets Extremely Aggressive for XL Stock The reality is investors in XL stock need to take a major leap of faith with this company, in some respects. The projections of a revenue increase from $21 million in 2020 to $647 million by 2023 is aggressive. Forget aggressive. This is an insanely high bar to pole-vault over. Yes, I think the secular trends in the electrification space are incredibly powerful. However, I do think a high degree of speculation is required to own a stock that is attempting to increase revenues more than 30-fold over a three year period. Thus, I would recommend investors bullish on this company stay patient. Personally, I’d like to see a few quarters of outperformance first before jumping on this bandwagon. That said, this SPAC-produced company is one with real, concrete potential right now. For those with a very long-term growth portfolio and a few shekels put aside, this could be an interesting small position to add.

2021-02-12,"Jumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA), which operates an e-commerce platform and mobile payments system in Africa, has suddenly become a darling on Wall Street. Note that JMIA stock has gone from $8 in September to about $65. The market capitalization is roughly $5.8 billion. Source: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com The company was smart to capitalize on this run-up. In early December, Jumia pulled off an “at the market” offering of shares, raising $243.2 million. This was certainly critical as the balance sheet needed a boost. About eight years ago, Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec started Jumia. They both had extensive experience working a McKinsey, such as for clients on areas like e-commerce and packaged goods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This proved to be spot-on for developing Jumia, and the founder had little trouble raising money. While growth was strong in the early years, the company would ultimately get overextend forcing Jumia had to leave various countries as well as cut back on costs. 8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double But despite all this, the platform is still robust. Jumia has 6.7 million annual active consumers and 110,000 active sellers. The platform also has a wide array of top brands like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Unilever (NYSE:UL), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). This has been key for generating engagement. For the most part, the African market has been neglected by the large e-commerce players. Instead, the focus has been more on India and parts of South America. Yet Africa is certainly an attractive opportunity. The population is 1.3 billion and there are 523 million Internet users. Consumer spending is over $4 trillion. There are also 17 million small and medium-sized businesses. The Jumia Stock Growth Story Growth has been choppy for Jumia. During the latest quarter, the GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) was actually down 28% on a year-over-year basis to 187.3 million euros, but it is important to keep a few things in mind. First of all, Jumia has been changing the mix of its product line towards higher-margin items and has streamlined the business model. Next, the company has been taking steps to realize efficiencies. In fact, a big part of this has been the leveraging of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In other words, the strategy is to pursue profitable growth. And for the most part, the company is getting results. In the quarter, there was a 22% improvement in gross profits on a year-over-year basis. Something else to note: The mobile payments business is showing lots of momentum. As seen with the companies like Square (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), this can be a lucrative category – and can be big in terms of driving shareholder value. In the quarter, Jumia reported its payments platform grew by 50% to 48 million euros. Bottom Line on JMIA stock The hope is that Jumia will become the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa. Yet this is probably too optimistic. If anything, as the African market starts to show more progress, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) will probably target the opportunity. Such companies do not necessarily need to be first-movers to get a big share of the market. Besides, when it comes to JMIA stock, it looks as if the valuation is stretched. Of course, we’ve recently seen speculative activity come into the markets, such as with GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC). JMIA stock is trading at a nose-bleed 26 times revenues, so it’s probably best to hold off and wait for a more reasonable valuation for the time being.

2021-02-17,Investors in PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) just received their biggest update of the year from the snack and beverage giant.  The fourth-quarter report detailed how Pepsi was able to grow through the pandemic in 2020 to win market share in food and soda niches.  The update also showed why the company has abruptly ended stock buyback spending for the time being as it aims to end a two-year slide in profitability.,3 Big Questions PepsiCo Just Answered for Investors
2021-02-17,"Last week, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) revealed their fourth quarter results. Although these two rivals are very comparable in terms of value, stock, and dividends, their business models are significantly different. These differences were emphasized by their Q4 results. Coca Cola just closed a rough fiscal year characterized by sharply reduced consumer mobility in which it lost market share and saw rare declines in sales volume, earnings, and cash flow. Its focus on away-from-home drink sales made it extremely vulnerable to the pandemic compared to more diversified PepsiCo. Coca Cola Had A Mixed Quarter Coke's business is heavily dependent on food-away-from-home consumption and that market is still far from going back to normal. Although things should improve later in the year, for now, the pandemic is still dragging the company down. The Q4 revenue came in at $8.6 billion, 5.5% from last year's results and slightly worse than expected. Weakness in the EU, Mideast/Africa region and North America was a bit offset by a slight improvement in Latin America. But on an organic basis, revenue fell by 3% worldwide versus the 3.7% expected, which is a rare piece of truly good news in the report. The figure is also better than the 4% slump it reported in the third quarter as COVID-19 continues to keep people away from restaurants, sports events, and concerts. Sales volumes continued to drop, but trends improved compared to the most recent quarters. If anything, Cokeended its market share slide in the fourth quarter, which points to a brighter year ahead. Moving further down the report, the company's margins improved on a YoY basis, but only in line with the consensus as the adjusted operating margin of 27.3% drove slightly better-than-expected earnings. The takeaway is that Coca-Cola's revenue and earnings shrank on both a quarterly and annual basis in 2020. But despite the tough environment, Coke's finances did benefit from aggressive cost cuts, resulting in just a minor earnings shortfall for 2020. Cash flow for the year was also down but still positive enough to support rising dividend payments. In order to preserve financial flexibility, management dramatically reduced stock repurchase spending. As for 2021, management expects mid-to-high-single-digit revenue growth and mid-to-low-single-digit EPS growth. Pepsi Was Growing On the other hand, Pepsi, whose business is tilted toward retail revenue has been steadily growing its beverage and snack food businesses all year long amid the COVID-19 apocalypse. PepsiCo actually grew its revenue in the fourth quarter and in 2020, which puts it in a much better position. It generated $22.46 billion in revenue, which represents an 8.8% quarterly growth and 4.8% annual growth. The revenue strength was driven by a 5.7% surge in organic sales. Moving down the report, Pepsi's earnings are similar to Coke's with GAAP missed by a small margin, but with the end result is quite different as its earnings are up for the year whereas Coke's are down. PepsiCo is also forecasting growth in 2021. The Key Difference Is Size Along with Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite and Fanta, The Coca Cola Company has a growing portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks that includes Vitamin water, Minute Maid, Costa Coffee and others, along with owning a stake in energy drink maker Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and growing sports drink company BodyArmor. But due to its huge portfolio of food brands, PepsiCo is a much larger and better diversified company. Both stocks are great dividend payers with long histories and great track records behind them. Both companies have sound balance sheets, which put them on a par in terms of safety and payout. But PepsiCo delivered stronger results along with better growth prospects. Outlook Coke's business is closely tied to consumers attending in-person entertainment events, so things can't go back to normal before COVID-19 leaves the picture. Management warned of volatility given the uncertainty about further outbreaks and the shaky outlook of the global economy. Yet despite sales still trending lower through early February, the beverage titan is feeling confident enough to reinstate its annual outlook after withdrawing it earlier last year. The beverage giant's revenue trends are expected to continue lagging Pepsi, which has already recovered the momentum it lost during the early days of the pandemic. Coca-Cola might have a strong brand and international presence, along with a slightly higher dividend yield of the two but the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner of fizzy wars.

2021-02-18,"The Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) hosted multiple food and beverage sector companies Wednesday at a virtual conference, which continues through Friday.vHere is a summary of key highlights from each company. Kellogg: 'Right On Schedule' Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) was first to present at the annual CAGNY event on Wednesday. Kellogg CEO Steven Cahillane delivered a presentation focusing on what has and hasn't changed since last year's event. Kellogg said last year it expected 2020 to be highlighted by top-line growth, profit margin expansion and a continued focus on initiatives to sustain incremental growth moving forward. ""And in 2020, we did just that,"" the CEO said. ""We returned to balanced financial delivery right on schedule."" J.M. Smucker: Cost Savings Program J M Smucker Co (NYSE: SJM) is targeting $50 million in annual cost reductions in fiscal 2022 through 2024, J.M. Smucker President and CEO Mark Smucker said in his presentation. This will be achieved through a combination of minimizing discretionary expenses, reducing non-working marketing initiatives, optimizing the supply chain and restructuring the corporate structure. Management plans on splitting its capital deployment evenly between investing in growth and returning cash to shareholders. The company also guided to free cash flow generation of $975 million to $1.025 billion in fiscal 2021 and a long-term goal of $1 billion annually. International Flavors & Fragrances: Long-Term Outlook International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE: IFF) is a producer of flavors, fragrances and cosmetic actives. The company's presentation focused in part on its long-term financial outlook. IFF guided to: organic sales growth of 4% to 5%, EBITDA margins of around 26% in 2023, free cash flow generation of around $2 billion in 2023 and net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than three times within 24 to 36 months once the acquisition of DuPont's Nutrition & Biosciences is complete. Related Link: Kraft Heinz US President Talks Pandemic Food Trends, Planters Sale Nomad Foods: Superior Growth Nomad Foods Ltd (NYSE: NOMD), a specialty UK-based frozen food company, said in its presentation it is one of the very few food companies that delivered sustained annual organic revenue growth from 2017 through 2020. The company's total shareholder return since 2017 of 174% ranks supreme among its peers with McCormick & Company, Incorporated (NYSE: MKC), ranked second at 103%. Management's new 2021 guidance consists of 3% to 5% revenue growth, 1% to 2% organic revenue growth and 11% to 15% adjusted EPS growth. PepsiCo: Targeting Growth In The $1 Trillion Market PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) has delivered a 4% average organic revenue growth since 2013, which is at the low-end of management's long-term target of 4% to 6% growth, the company said in its presentation. The company's recent investments to deliver superior growth is based on a combination of growing its core brands (i.e., Pepsi, Gatorade), innovating in consumer-centric categories (Bubly Sparkling Water, 3D Doritos) and addressing strategic gaps (SodaStream, Muscle Milk Protein). PepsiCo estimates the global beverages opportunity at around $570 billion and the company estimates its market share at 9%. The global snacks market stands at around $550 billion and the company estimates its share at 7%. Performance Food Group: Optimistic As COVID-19 Pandemic Wanes, Business Will Build Performance Food Group Co (NYSE: PFGC) is a foodservice distribution leader that delivers more than 200,000 products to clients across the U.S. The company moved quickly in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to raise capital as part of a strategy that is ""one-third defensive, two-third defensive,"" CFO Jim Hope said in the presentation. ""At this point in time, we are increasingly optimistic that the pandemic's impact on the economy will wane over the next several months,"" the executive said. ""As a result, we believe the need for our defensive positioning will reduce and the liquidity can be used for business-building activities."" Hershey: Better-For-You Snacks And Growth Plans Hershey Co (NYSE: HSY) detailed a longer-term focus on expanding its portfolio to include more options with reduced sugar and/or includes organic and plant-based alternatives. The iconic company will simultaneously focus on building its existing products. Part of the growth strategy will focus on acquisitions that satisfy three criteria, including: 1) exposure to incremental consumers or occasions, 2) a company that offers high margins with strong growth prospects, and 3) preference to be EPS accretive within one to two years.

2021-03-08,"On Monday, shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $133.03. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-04-16 Strike Price: $140.00 Volume: 0 Open Interest: 4105 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-03-24,"Shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $139.71. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-10-15 Strike Price: $155.00 Volume: 200 Open Interest: 39 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-04-05,"PepsiCo (PEP) stock has rebounded quickly from its recent pullback which saw the share price briefly dip below $130 per share. With a deep economic moat, high margins, and a solid dividend, PepsiCo remains a high-quality stock that could provide a great opportunity for more cautious investors. PEP is currently trading around $141 per share, just a few dollars below its all-time high, but given how overheated the market has been in anticipation of the post-pandemic recovery, investors should not expect massive gains in the coming year. However, the possibility does remain for gradual, yet stable gains over the long term and as market participants debate whether a sell-off or a further rally is what comes next, this blue-chip name could provide a great safe harbor for investors. Why PepsiCo Stock Is Bouncing Back The recent double-digit sell-off in PEP stock was a consequence of the correction seen across the NASDAQ. With investors becoming skittish about tech stock valuations, the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) index fell sharply in February and early March. PEP obviously isn’t a tech company, but it’s still one of the top 15 stocks in the index by portfolio allocation. In short, markets threw out this baby along with the bathwater. However, shares have quickly bounced back as investors have realized that the sell-off was irrational and that little has changed in terms of the fundamentals of this recession-resistant stock. Now, as it climbs back up towards all-time highs, where is the stock heading from here? Let’s weigh its merits as a high-quality name against the concerns about its valuation. Modest Returns Going Forward After gaining around 18.7% in the past year, could this stock produce similar returns over the next 12 months? Given that the past year has been about the recovery from the pandemic-led market crash in 2020, double-digit returns seem unlikely, but the potential for moderate returns over the next 12 months still remains. For starters, PEP remains a high-quality stock with a stable full of global food and beverage brands through its PepsiCo Beverage, Frito-Lay, and Quaker Foods divisions. The company boasts high profit margins and deep economic resources. This will help the company not only grow its earnings at a high single-digit rate of around 8% between 2021 and 2022, but it will also allow PEP to continue to pay and grow its solid dividend. Yielding 2.87% at current prices, the dividend has grown an average of 7.8% over the past five years. Even if the stock’s current moderate price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.6x doesn’t benefit from additional multiple expansion, the modest earnings growth, coupled with the dividend yield, could continue to result in satisfactory returns for long-term investors. What Analysts Are Saying About PEP Stock According to TipRanks, PEP comes in as a Moderate Buy based on 4 Buy, 3 Hold and 1 Sell recommendations. The average analyst price target of $150.67 implies upside potential of around 7% from current levels over the next 12 months. Analyst price targets range from a low of $136 per share to a high of $161 per share. (See PepsiCo Stock analysis on TipRanks) Bottom Line: A Top Shelf Stock For Long-Term Investors After recovering from the recent NASDAQ correction, PepsiCo shares are approaching prior all-time highs. Shares may have gained 20% in the past year, but given its moderate earnings growth projections, investors shouldn’t expect a similar level of gains over the next 12 months. However, with its status as a high-quality dividend stock, there’s likely enough at play to keep long-term investors happy. This may not result in blockbuster gains, but it could mean moderate returns for PEP stock going forward.

2021-04-16,"PepsiCo Inc.’s first-quarter earnings and revenues topped consensus estimates on Thursday. The snacks and beverage company posted a 6.8% year-on-year growth in net revenues to $14.8 billion, which came in ahead of analysts’ estimates of $14.55 billion. Adjusted core EPS of $1.21 per share beat consensus estimates of $1.12. PepsiCo Inc’s (PEP) Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We are pleased with our results for the first quarter as we successfully overcame challenges related to difficult year-over-year comparisons, uneven recoveries across many of our international markets and weather-related business disruptions in the U.S.” The company’s organic revenues rose 2.4% year-on-year with its Frito-Lay division gaining market share in both salty snack and macro snack categories in the United States with the introduction of products like Doritos 3D Crunch and Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix. PEP’s beverages business in the United States saw an organic increase in revenues of 2% year-on-year driven by a double-digit growth in revenues for Bubly sparkling water and ready-to-drink coffees under the Starbucks brand. The company experienced uneven growth in international markets with China, Russia and Brazil showing organic double-digit growth in revenues in 1Q while the Indian and Mexican markets showed mid-to-low single digit growth for the quarter. (See PepsiCo Inc stock analysis on TipRanks) PEP reiterated its non-GAAP outlook for FY21 and expects a mid-single-digit rise in organic revenue and core EPS to increase in the high-single-digits. The company expects to return around $5.9 billion to stockholders, comprising of share buybacks of $106 million and dividends of $5.8 billion. PEP has already completed its share repurchase program and does not anticipate to buyback any additional shares for the rest of FY21. On April 12, Wolfe Research analyst Greg Badishkanian initiated coverage of PEP with a Hold rating on the stock. Badishkanian views “a lot of momentum” behind PEP’s business but believes that the company is “too defensive for the current market”. Shares have gained 7.4% in the past month. Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 3 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target stands at $151.83 and implies an upside potential of 6.7% to current levels.
