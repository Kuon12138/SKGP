2019-01-22,"Utility stocks had a great 2018 ... for the most part. Yes, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) broadly finished the year with a marginal gain. But mounting U.S. and global worries helped push the sector to a spectacular 20% run between the February lows and the mid-December highs.

Heading into 2019, it looks as though utility stocks could be among the better performers this year, too, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.

&quot;For equity investors, risk is high and the margin of safety is low because stock valuations are elevated compared with history,&quot; Goldman Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin and team wrote in a Nov. 19 note to clients. &quot;We forecast the S&P; 500 index will generate a modest single-digit absolute return in 2019.&quot;

Although the bank believes cash is an excellent place to allocate some of your capital in the year ahead, when it comes to actual stock picks, utilities are high on its list - so much so that it raised the sector to &quot;overweight.&quot; Why? Several analysts are predicting a slowdown in GDP growth in 2019, and historically, when that happens, utilities tend to outperform the markets as a whole, in part because the sector has traditionally had a low beta to the S&P; 500.

Goldman also suggests that investors need to buy quality companies with stable earnings and revenues to prepare for the year ahead. Utilities fit that to a T, and typically deliver better-than-average dividend yield to boot. So with all that in mind, here are the 10 best utility stocks to buy for 2019.

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Here’s the latest wrinkle in the battery boom: National Grid Plc is paying consumers to tap electricity from their power-storage systems.The utility has about 40 customers in the program now in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and said expanding it to include Tesla Inc.’s Powerwall users may boost participation before the typical summertime peak in power consumption. National Grid is targeting 280 customers across the two states by early next month.The program may help the utility reduce capital costs by letting it access stored power from customers of Sunrun Inc. and other providers during periods of high demand. A single Tesla Powerwall battery in Rhode Island could earn as much as $1,000 a year, according to a spokesman for the automaker.“By using this technology at peak periods, we reduce our electric loads when power is most expensive,” said John Isberg, a vice president at National Grid. “This should provide environmental benefits and reduce infrastructure-investment costs.”Utilities in the Northeast have been among the early movers in incorporating solar and battery-storage systems into power grids. New England’s grid operator in February approved the addition of 145 megawatts of solar capacity, including some from Sunrun paired with batteries. And in Vermont, utility Green Mountain Power introduced a program this year to let 250 customers get two Tesla Powerwall batteries for $30 a month.National Grid’s program comes as costs for batteries have plunged, making storage systems a popular complement to rooftop solar. Outages triggered by extreme weather and wildfires across the country have also boosted demand for batteries.“We’re just getting to the point where they can provide these services cost effectively,” said Paul Wassink, a senior engineer at National Grid.To contact the reporter on this story: Brian Eckhouse in New York at beckhouse@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Will Wade, Joe RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Power Companies Want to Tap the Tesla Batteries in Your Home

2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- About $400,000. That’s how much two New York City deli owners say National Grid Plc may cost them by refusing to supply natural gas to a new burger restaurant they’re planning in Brooklyn.The men are victims of a complex face-off between the utility that supplies gas to the metropolitan area and state regulators. New York and New Jersey have denied approvals for the $1 billion Williams Cos. pipeline expansion that National Grid has said is needed to boost their gas capacity.Williams Cos. has vowed to reapply for approval but, in the meantime, National Grid is declining to approve any new contracts to supply gas. It’s a decision that could hamstring new businesses and housing, say support groups in New York and on Long Island.The deli owners learned in early July the utility wouldn’t accept their application for gas. Now they say they may have to cancel their plans. “We have already hired employees, who are sitting and waiting, asking ‘When can we come into work?” Muhammad Quereshi, one of the men, said in a telephone interview. The denial, he said, leaves them to pay back $400,000 in business loans they expected would come from the new restaurant’s profits.Nobody knows how many businesses are affected yet, but any business that wants to come in and requires natural gas -- in particular, restaurants -- will face difficulty trying to get it.London-based National Grid won’t say how many applications it hasn’t processed. Annually, the company normally receives around 8,000 applications from commercial, industrial and residential consumers requesting natural gas service, according to Domenick Graziani, a spokesman. The utility declined to discuss The application by Quereshi and Shahbaz Warraich, saying customer information is confidential.In the past, National Grid has said that if the pipeline project isn’t cleared by winter 2020, applications in the region can’t be processed.In May, New York denied a key permit for the Williams Cos. pipeline, with the Department of Environmental Conservation saying it would result in water quality violations, including those caused by kicking up hazardous metals and disturbing seabed habitats. The denial was “without prejudice,” meaning the company can reapply.Pipeline’s Proposed PathEnvironmental groups have argued that the Northeast Supply Enhancement, as the pipeline is named, is unnecessary and would further New York’s reliance on fossil fuels. Williams and National Grid say the project is needed to meet demand during the winter months, when consumption of the heating fuel peaks and prices can spike.Business advocates say that while they understand the need for environmentally-friendly alternatives to gas, the technology for renewables isn’t there yet to meet the energy needs of the region. The decision not to approved the pipeline extension is also thwarting a regional transition from heating oil to cleaner-burning gas.&quot;Renewable projects are a long-term play, but they’re not here yet,&quot; said Kevin Law, president and CEO of the Long Island Association. &quot;They can’t turn on lights, heat our homes or cool our buildings for many years to come.&quot;In notices sent to its customers, National Grid is encouraging ratepayers to sign a pre-written letter in support of the project to be automatically sent to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has been a leading voice opposing pipelines. &quot;To be clear,&quot; National Grid’s notice says, “we need this additional supply to support all new requests for natural gas, for residential, multifamily and business purposes.&quot;The utility cutoff will “undo a lot of the success we’ve had in growing the Long Island community in the last 10 years,” Law said.New York City and Long Island aren’t the only areas in the state facing the issue. Westchester County was put under a moratorium on new natural gas service by Consolidated Edison Inc. in March. At the time, the County projected that the construction of 16,000 homes could be suspended.The issue has forced some developments to be redesigned to accommodate new methods of heating, said Mitchell Pally, CEO of the Long Island Builders Institute.Pally said he expected several projects to leave the area since “it’s hard enough to develop in Long Island. Without an adequate and sustainable energy source, it will be much more difficult.”“It’s definitely stopping development at a very base level,” said Thomas Grech, president and Chief Executive Officer of the Queens Chamber of Commerce.To contact the reporters on this story: Millicent Dent in New York at mdent13@bloomberg.net;Sydney Price in New York at sprice86@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, ;Debarati Roy at droy5@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Natural Gas Standoff Hamstrings NYC Business Upstarts, New Housing"

2019-08-14,"(Bloomberg) -- The operator of Britain’s power distribution system sought to shift blame for once-in-a-decade blackouts last week to local networks as the government laid out a more detailed investigation into the power failure.National Grid Plc Chief Executive Officer John Pettigrew said his company’s system returned to service seven minutes after two major generation plants unexpectedly stopped working on Aug. 9. He said it was grid operators downstream of his company’s network of distribution lines that decided to shut off supplies to hospitals and rail stations, causing hours of delays long after power returned to the grid.Pettigrew’s remarks in the Financial Times and on British Broadcasting Corp. radio on Wednesday spread the blame for the outages and underlined National Grid’s reputation for responsibly managing the network. The incident raised questions about the competence of grid managers to handle a transition away from fossil fuels as the opposition Labour Party argues in favor of taking parts of the system back into government hands.“I’m not pointing the finger, I’m just saying I think it’s sensible to do a broad investigation,” Pettigrew told the FT.For more on the London blackout, click hereA government investigation conducted by the Energy Emergencies Executive Committee will probe some of those issues.

2019-10-17,"(Bloomberg) -- A skinny Brooklyn brownstone was ready for occupants in mid-August. The beds in each unit had comforters, the drawers in the kitchens had utensils, and the living rooms had baskets of toys for the children who were about to move in. “It looks like someone just stepped out to the street to go to the bodega,” Scott Stepp, director of development at Providence House, a nonprofit that provides housing for homeless mothers.The homes had one problem: Providence House couldn’t get National Grid Plc, the local utility, to hook up the gas to the buildings. That’s because National Grid and New York state are fighting over an underground pipeline—and the future of energy.National Grid, which provides gas to more than 20 million people, has been at loggerheads with state regulators over a plan to build a new project under the mouth of the Hudson River. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is backing an ambitious push towards renewable energy sources and has opposed new pipelines for natural gas. Local environmental groups have also mounted an offensive against new fossil fuel infrastructure. National Grid, in response, has resisted turning on the gas for any new customers, including the homeless women and children, without pipeline approvals from the state.This problem has the potential to play out in cities across the U.S., where the need for new and upgraded gas pipelines meets growing environmental pushback that makes it hard, if not impossible, to expand and improve existing systems. Natural gas was once touted as the greener alternative to oil, and a boom in domestic supply that drove prices down has prompted thousands of households to convert from oil heat. But facing an ever-warming planet, environmental groups and policymakers are pushing harder to move people away from gas and into options like electricity-based heating and cooking, which can help lower greenhouse-gas emissions.“It really does illustrate the kind of inflection point that we’re at,” says Jackson Morris, eastern region director of the Climate and Clean Energy Program within the Natural Resources Defense Council.To reach the Paris Climate Agreement goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, many companies, states and countries plan to zero-out carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. With gas, Morris says, “you get some incremental reductions” in emissions when compared to oil heat, but not enough to make meaningful progress in slowing the pace of climate change. States like New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and California will need to transition to other energy sources, such as wind and solar, in order to meet aggressive emission goals. That’s why governments don’t want to support pipeline infrastructure for a fuel that they’re moving away from.Planning for a greener tomorrow comes with costs today. In New England, a lack of pipelines now leads to annual winter price spikes. In the last two years, a Boston import terminal has received tankers carrying super-chilled, liquefied natural gas from Russia—a particularly perverse solution since the U.S. is currently a leading global exporter of gas. A lack of infrastructure makes it all but impossible to get enough gas from Appalachia to Boston. In New York, there are plans to transport gas by truck.The situation in New York is underscored by the state’s new climate law, which set the nation’s most aggressive goal for getting nearly all electricity from emission-free sources by 2040. The plan also calls for an 85% reduction in economy-wide emissions from 1990 levels by 2050 and creates incentives to phase out oil and natural gas from home heating systems. Buildings account for 26% of New York’s greenhouse-gas emissions, the second-biggest source behind transportation. But at the moment, New Yorkers are still heavily reliant on gas for energy—40% of statewide electricity comes from gas and 60% of household heat. A lack of good infrastructure is pushing utility companies to import supplies from overseas in a way that makes no economic sense, given it adds transportation costs that consumers ultimately pay. “And it’s bad for the environment,” says National Grid Chief Executive Officer John Pettigrew. His utility would prefer to upgrade pipelines and build new ones. “Lots of people are trying to jump to 2050, but we’ve got 30 years to work these challenges out.”Environmentalists don’t want to wait. Groups like the Sierra Club and 350.org have been fighting new pipelines, and they’ve had a lot of legal success. Armed with experienced lawyers and record funding, the keep-it-in-the-ground movement has turned its attention to pipelines that require various federal and state permits that are easily litigated. But for this pipeline under the mouth of the  Hudson, litigation hasn’t been necessary because state regulators are doing the delaying themselves.A spokesman for Williams Cos., the company trying to build the pipeline, said in an email that the project is critical for the New York region’s economic growth and blamed delays in gas hookups on the state’s decision to reject a permit.President Donald Trump has tried to prevent states from being able to block interstate gas lines. The White House announced an executive order in April aimed at short-circuiting state regulators who have held up gas lines by refusing permits. Policy analysts expressed doubt about how effective Trump’s measure would prove to be, and a month later New York rejected the water permit application from Williams.Some state and local governments are forcing the issue. Berkeley, California, became the first city to tackle it head-on with a ban on gas connections to new buildings, and a handful of other cities such as Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco are considering similar laws. In New York, chaos erupted as opposition to new gas pipelines confronted rising demand from consumers who still want to cook and heat with natural gas. National Grid projects a 10% increase in demand for natural gas from its customers in downstate New York over the next decade because of economic growth and homes that want to switch to gas from oil heat. Despite Cuomo’s environmental ambitions, the trend toward using electric-based heat and stovetops simply hasn’t taken off yet because it costs more. “We want to connect customers but the system hasn't got the capacity,” Pettigrew says. “Outside the pipeline, there are no long-term solutions.”As it frantically searched for solutions so the homeless women could move in, Providence House looked into electrifying its buildings. But the retrofit would have cost an additional $200,000 and taken at least nine months. The nonprofit took its case to the state’s Public Service Commission, which monitors utilities in New York, and appealed to National Grid in order to get their gas turned on. It looks like the move is paying off: In late September, the agency ordered National Grid to turn on the gas. In one of the two buildings, homeless mothers are now on track to move in six weeks later than expected; the move-in date for the second home remains subject to a final regulatory approval.Other New Yorkers are still waiting for gas, with winter looming. Politicians are pressing National Grid to connect more customers, pipeline or not. Last week, Cuomo demanded the utility start supplying gas to the 1,157 homes and small businesses left waiting, threatening the company with millions of dollars in penalties. National Grid said it planned to comply.That still leaves a backlog of around 20,000 new customers waiting for gas. At Cuomo’s direction, regulators are expanding an inquiry into the utility company, questioning National Grid’s claims that it couldn’t supply gas for customers without access to a pipeline wasn’t scheduled for completion this winter anyway. To contact the authors of this story: Cynthia Koons in New York at ckoons@bloomberg.netRachel Adams-Heard in New York at radamsheard@bloomberg.netChris Martin in New York at cmartin11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Emily Biuso at ebiuso@bloomberg.net, Aaron RutkoffLynn DoanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",A Battle Over the Future of Energy Plays Out in New York

2019-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- New York Governor Andrew Cuomo gave National Grid Plc 14 days to figure out how to address natural gas shortages before he moves to revoke its license to operate in the state.The Democrat said in a letter Tuesday that the utility owner’s moratorium for new gas hookups affecting 20,000 homes and businesses in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island shows that it failed to provide “adequate and reliable” service.“The ‘moratorium’ is either a fabricated device or a lack of competence,” Cuomo wrote. “The very lack of supply you now point to as the reason for your denial of service to thousands of customers exhibits your failure to plan for supply needs.”The 14-day deadline is the latest salvo between the governor and National Grid. They’ve been feuding since New York rejected a $1 billion expansion to a Williams Cos. gas pipeline, which the company says is crucial to meet rising demand. In response, National Grid imposed a freeze on new gas hookups.In a statement, the company said it will respond to the governor by the deadline. “We continue to work with all parties on these critical natural gas supply issues on behalf of all our customers in downstate New York,” National Grid said.Shares dropped 0.4% to an intraday low of $11.36 before rebounding to $11.42 in London. READ MORE: New York’s Cuomo Raises Idea of Revoking National Grid’s LicenseLast month, Cuomo issued an emergency order requiring National Grid to reconnect about 1,100 consumers. Still, the company has a backlog of about 2,600 applications for service on hold. They represent about 20,000 businesses, houses and apartments, according to the firm.In his letter, Cuomo said National Grid was either “grossly negligent in relying exclusively on the speculative construction of a private pipeline” or “deliberately defrauded the people of the state.” He called on the company to come up with “meaningful and immediate remedial actions” by the deadline.Meanwhile, Consolidated Edison, which has imposed a similar moratorium for gas hookups in Westchester County, north of New York City, says there’s plenty of gas for customers in the city.ConEd CEO John McAvoy said he can meet demand for as long as five years, and the company won’t necessarily impose a moratorium on new hookups at the end of that period. However, the utility no longer sees the same growth opportunities in the gas transmission business as it did five years ago, and doesn’t expect to make additional significant investments.(Updates with comment from ConEd in last paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Mark Chediak.To contact the reporters on this story: Gerson Freitas Jr. in New York at gfreitasjr@bloomberg.net;Will Wade in New York at wwade4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Pratish Narayanan, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Cuomo Gives National Grid Two Weeks to Fix N.Y.

2019-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- National Grid Plc agreed to immediately lift its ban on new natural gas hookups in New York state, backing down in its extraordinary standoff with Governor Andrew Cuomo.After a months-long feud, the company says it’s now found ways to serve all its customers in Brooklyn, Queens and on Long Island for the next two years, according to a statement Monday. London-based National Grid will also pay $36 million in penalties, energy efficiency measures and clean-energy projects.Cuomo called it a “victory” for utility customers. “We will not allow any business - big or small - to extort New Yorkers in order to advance its own interests,” he said in a statement.The deal ends an unprecedented showdown that stalled thousands of construction projects in one of New York’s most populous regions as the utility refused to install gas hookups. It laid bare how fraught America’s relationship with gas has grown as states push to move away from heating oil but are leery of building infrastructure that could prolong dependence on fossil fuel.National Grid rose 1.1% in London.“I’m not that surprised that there’s a resolution,” Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates LLC, said in an interview. “It will make people feel a lot better, but in the long term we still have to see what the solutions are.”The fight started in May after New York rejected a $1 billion pipeline expansion, which the company said was crucial to meet rising gas demand. Days later, National Grid announced it wouldn’t process any new applications for gas service until the pipeline was approved. After months of sparring, Cuomo threatened to revoke National Grid’s license if it didn’t fix the shortage by Nov. 26.New York has rich deposits of gas. But in addition to blocking the pipeline, the state has outlawed fracking, making it difficult to produce gas locally. Such moves have crimped supply in the region, analysts say. Clean-energy advocates counter that there’s already enough gas wasted in inefficient boilers, stoves and elsewhere to accommodate new demand without new pipelines.As part of its agreement with the state, National Grid agreed to develop a long-term plan to meet gas demand in the state by June. Regulators will appoint an independent monitor to oversee National Grid’s cooperation with the agreement.Read More: New York Feud Over Gas Hurtles Toward a Utility’s ExpulsionIn a statement, National Grid’s interim U.S. President Badar Khan said the company regrets that it didn’t provide more notice or explanation to the company’s customers about the moratorium.“We appreciate the opportunity to work with the Governor’s office and the Department of Public Service to address these challenging issues,” he said.(Adds analyst comment in sixth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Gerson Freitas Jr. in New York at gfreitasjr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Joe Ryan, Christopher MartinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","National Grid Lifts N.Y.

2020-05-26,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. met almost three-quarters of electricity demand with renewable sources on Saturday afternoon as sunny and breezy weather coincided with low consumption.Renewable energy from wind, solar and hydro peaked at 73% of the U.K.’s generation mix, according to Enappsys Ltd. Levels of green power were so high that National Grid Plc had to turn off thousands of megawatts during the weekend to balance the grid.The grid operator issued three system warnings that it needed to switch off some small wind and solar installations to stabilize the grid. A public holiday this weekend saw demand for power drop, falling to 12,344 megawatts at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, a modern-day record low for the U.K. system, National Grid data show.A low carbon power system is what Europe is striving for but it doesn’t have all the pieces in place to make it work just yet. Lower demand caused by the pandemic has left grids overloaded with green generation, raising the threat of blackouts.It’s a pattern that’s also playing out in the U.S. where lower demand has meant that a bigger proportion of electricity needs can be met using renewables. Wind and solar farms have an upper hand in many regions because they don’t need to buy fuel.National Grid has been warning about the difficulties of managing the network when demand is about 20% lower than usual due to coronavirus-related restrictions. Last weekend was the first time the network operator has used its so-called optional downward flexibility management service.It has rolled out new tools for the summer to help reduce supply or increase demand. The extra measures will cost 493 million pounds ($553 million) more than last summer.Read here about the impact lower demand is having globallyThe U.K. hasn’t used coal since April 9, a record-long streak. On Saturday, the combination of wind and solar meant the carbon-dioxide intensity of the power system fell to an all-time low of 33 grams a kilowatt-hour, according to data from Drax Electric Insights.The influx of green power means that wholesale costs are falling. Power for Saturday fell to a record minus 10.13 pounds a megawatt-hour. That’s the first time the day-ahead auction has been negative. Several hours change were traded at negative prices during the weekend.Most solar generation in Britain and small smaller wind farms are connected to local networks not owned or controlled by National Grid. The system operator has had to put new agreements in place to be able to turn down these generators. Ofgem granted an emergency measure to disconnect these smaller installations if needed on May 7.National Grid needs some generation like nuclear or gas running to keep turbines spinning and power flowing through the grid at the right frequency. Solar and wind can’t provide the same service and so need to be switched off if there’s not enough demand.(Updates with context in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Green Energy Fed 73% of Electricity in U.K. This Weekend

2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg) -- A project using giant Tesla Inc. batteries was used to help balance supply and demand in Britain’s electricity market for the first time this week.The plant is made up of six Tesla megapack batteries that can store energy from renewable sources to be used at times of peak consumption. The National Grid Electricity System Operator uses the balancing market to fine tune supply and demand to make sure they match exactly.The cost of balancing the power market surged this summer as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic reduced supply and made usage harder to predict. National Grid spent 718 million pounds ($932 million) balancing the network from March to July to cope with low demand and high supply of renewable generation -- that’s 39% higher than usual.A new computer system used by National Grid has allowed burgeoning technologies like batteries to be used in the balancing market more easily. Ideally batteries can draw electricity from the network when wind or solar supply is plentiful or even beyond what’s needed, and store it for use at times of peak demand.In years to come growing battery capacity will add flexible back up for grid operators as the use of fossil fuels is completely phased out.The 7.5-megawatt Holes Bay energy storage plant in Dorset in southwest England is operated by Fotowatio Renewable Ventures BV and Harmony Energy Ltd.Even so, big battery plants are still only about one-10th the size of a gas-fired unit. National Grid changed the rules last year to allow capacities as small as 1 megawatt to take part in the balancing market.National Grid is trying to “open the market to a wider range of providers and technologies, increase competition for balancing services and bring better value for consumers – and it will take us a step closer to being able to operate the grid with zero carbon by 2025,” said Roisin Quinn, head of national control and chief engineer at National Grid electricity system operator.(Adds context in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Six Giant Tesla Batteries Keep British Lights on for First Time
2020-09-22,"(Bloomberg) -- A spike in electricity prices last week in the U.K. is raising questions about how well the network operator is balancing the grid and at what cost to consumers.Electricity prices surged to more than 10 times the average following a market warning from National Grid Plc on Sept. 15. The network manager said calm weather and warm temperatures were set to lower the supply buffer it keeps to ensure there’s enough power in the system. At the same time, the company was paying a nuclear station not to generate.The incident is threatening to elevate the highly technical practices of grid managers into a political issue. Some analysis suggest National Grid made mistakes in the process that could lead to higher bills for consumers.The contract with EDF was “a particularly clunky way of dealing with variable demand,” Alan Whitehead, the opposition Labour Party’s shadow minister for energy and climate change, said in an interview. “What has undone them is that demand has bounced back much more quickly than they thought.”Analysis by trading house, Hartree Solutions, show that halting one unit of Electricite de France SA’s Sizewell B nuclear reactor, added 73 million pounds ($94 million) to wholesale power prices during the 20 weeks of the contract. If the reactor had been generating on Sept. 15, the market warning wouldn’t have been needed, the analysis shows.National Grid said its decisions were made to protect the grid from blackouts.“We are confident the actions we have taken, including the Sizewell contract, have minimized the impact on consumers, with the potential implications of emergency actions and the associated disruption being even greater,” a National Grid spokesperson said.Electricity demand fell as much as 20% below normal levels during lockdown as people stayed at home and offices and manufacturing shut. National Grid became increasingly worried about how to manage a system with much lower demand than normal.On May 7, the network operator agreed a contract with EDF to cut output from its Sizewell B nuclear reactor to avoid oversupply. The contract originally ran for six weeks and cost 17 million pounds to 23 million pounds. It was extended to 20 weeks and now ends on Sept. 24. EDF declined to comment.Electricity demand has mostly recovered and is now just 1% below normal levels, according to BloombergNEF data. This raises the question of whether National Grid should have kept the contract with EDF for so long.“A price surge of this magnitude, as a result of National Grid failing to foresee the higher demand we are now experiencing is not acceptable,” said Alexander Stafford, a Conservative MP who sits on the business and energy select committee. “The considerable cost to the consumer of this judgment must be closely examined.”National Grid has said that the cost of fine-tuning supply and demand will be 500 million pounds ($646 million) more than usual this summer because of lower consumption during the lockdown. The power regulator Ofgem was already scrutinizing looking at that issue and may probe deeper.“We regularly review the performance of the Electricity System Operator,” an Ofgem spokesperson said. “We also do ad hoc assessments when we think events warrant it.”(Adds comment in 11th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.K. Power Price Spike Raises Questions for National Grid
2020-09-30,"(Bloomberg) -- National Grid Plc outlined a plan for an offshore grid that will link new wind parks and interconnectors, saving consumers 6 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) by 2050.The network operator’s vision tackles the problem of how best to bring electricity produced at offshore facilities to the grid. Pairing multi-purpose interconnectors with wind capacity could bring a 50% reduction in how much grid infrastructure needs to be built in the next three decades.The U.K. is the largest market in the world for offshore wind and has set a target to build 40 gigawatts by 2030, a four-fold increase from now. Achieving this would cost as much as 50 billion pounds and require one turbine to be installed every weekday during the whole of the 2020s, according to Aurora Energy Research Ltd. Linking all this capacity to the onshore grid is likely to be both costly and difficult.The plan would connect a number of individual wind farms located in a similar geographical area, via the shared use of offshore transmission infrastructure.Last week, National Grid and Dutch grid Tennet BV announced a plan for a cable to connect offshore wind farms in both nations. The U.K. network manager’s plan involves more agreements like this one.Read more about the U.K., Dutch wind farm link here“Offshore wind power is a key part of government plans for the U.K. to meet net zero by 2050,” said Fintan Slye, director of the National Grid electricity system operator. “Our project is assessing the most beneficial approach to offshore networks, examining a range of different technical and engineering solutions to grid connections.”National Grid is consulting on its plan until Oct. 28.“The grid must be able to cope in an era of rapidly increasing volumes of renewable power, intermittent generation, flexible electricity markets, undersea interconnectors, battery storage, and households both taking electricity from and supplying it back to the grid,” said Danielle Lane, Vattenfall AB’s U.K. country manager.By 2030 Vattenfall will have enough offshore wind capacity to supply 5 million homes.(Adds comment in final paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.K. Plans to Create Offshore Grid to Connect Wind Farms

2020-12-05,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. power prices rose to a four-year high after the U.K. grid operator warned that its safety buffer of supplies is almost eroded for Sunday night.National Grid Plc said it’s “monitoring the situation closely” in a warning published on Twitter. The network operator stopped short of issuing an official alert called an Electricity Margin Notice, last triggered on Thursday, which is published when the normal safety margin for operating the system shrinks below the level permitted by the government.It’s unusual for there to be problems meeting demand on a weekend when consumption is typically lower as offices and industry shut. That shows how close to the edge Britain’s power system is this winter. National Grid has been expecting more supply warnings this year, Chief Executive Officer John Pettigrew said in an interview with Bloomberg last month. The margin between power supply and demand is the narrowest the U.K. has seen in about four years, he said.Read more of the interview with National Grid’s CEO herePower for delivery on Sunday evening traded as high as 350 pounds ($470) a megawatt-hour in an auction on Saturday on Epex Spot SE. That’s the highest for the 5-6 pm period since November 2016. The peakload contract jumped to 96.29 pounds a megawatt-hour, the highest since 2018, the data show.National Grid is struggling to keep the system balanced as demand rises with colder weather and wind generation is forecast to be low. The forecasts show the situation continuing next week. National Grid identified next week as one of the crunch points in its winter outlook.Britain gets about 8% of its power supply from huge cables connected to Europe. One of these so-called interconnectors runs to France. The low electricity supply situation could be compounded by a planned strike by Electricite de France SA workers on Dec. 10. If the strike impacts nuclear output and France can’t export any power to Britain, National Grid could face an even tougher challenge to keep the lights on.When supplies are low first National Grid will ask all available coal and gas plants to run. If there’s still not enough, it can ask some large consumers to turn down their demand to try to balance the system that way. After that the network operator will ask local grids to start temporarily cutting off power to consumers.Read more about the steps National Grid takes hereFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.K. Power Prices Jump After National Grid Warns of Supply Risks

2021-03-15,"(Bloomberg) -- National Grid Plc held talks with Electricite de France SA about temporary supply curbs at its Sizewell nuclear plant, but discussions ended with no agreement. Last year, the U.K. grid operator paid Sizewell to turn down to help balance the grid when demand was low due to pandemic-related lockdowns. Discussions this year included conversations with companies involved in measures taken last summer to manage the reduced power demand, National Grid said in a statement.These conversations weren’t formal and National Grid has “not signed a commercial agreement with EDF to turn down output of Sizewell this summer. We do not expect to need to sign a similar agreement in 2021,” the company said in the statement.Demand usually starts to drop in spring and is at its lowest in summer. Blackouts can happen when there’s too much demand or too little. National Grid needs ways to cope with such low demand on the network especially when it’s happening at the same time as high wind or solar levels.Both units at EDF’s Sizewell plant are scheduled to be halted for planned maintenance for about 6 weeks through the end of May, according to the company’s transparency website.(An earlier version of this story was corrected to show that talks are ongoing, but that no deal has been reached.)(Updates with National Grid comment from second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",National Grid Agrees 6-Week Deal to Cut EDF’s Sizewell Nuclear Power

2021-03-18,"(Bloomberg) -- National Grid Plc agreed to buy PPL Corp.’s U.K. electricity distribution business for 7.8 billion pounds ($10.9 billion), a move that will transform the company as it prepares for a low-carbon future.The biggest U.K. utilities transaction in a decade highlights how crucial grids have become as nations figure out how to navigate the shift to electricity from fossil fuels.Distribution grids, the local networks that feed directly into homes and businesses, are at the heart of the energy transition. Smart homes with electric heating systems, as many as 30 million electric cars, and small-scale renewable generation will all be connected to local grids in coming decades.“This makes an awful lot of sense for the U.K. and National Grid in terms of the energy transition,” Chief Executive Officer John Pettigrew said in an interview. “We believe that the growth that we’re likely to see in the distribution sector is going to be stronger and more certain and longer than other elements of the energy sector.”In a separate deal, PPL is picking up Narragansett Electric Co. from National Grid for an equity value of $3.8 billion. The transactions mean PPL will shed its international unit and can focus on running U.S. utilities. The Allentown, Pennsylvania-based company said in August it was pursuing such a move, with an eye to increasing shareholder value.The sale follows those of U.S. rivals that sold or spun off non-utility assets in recent months while holding on to less-risky regulated power companies. Exelon Corp. said last month it would separate its power-generation business, and Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. is seeking to sell non-fossil fuel assets. Dominion Energy Inc. in July sold its gas pipeline and storage business to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.PPL will likely continue this transition with the cash it’s gaining from National Grid, said Nikki Hsu, a utilities analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.“They probably will be acquiring more assets,” Hsu said.Future SalesNational Grid also announced it intends to sell its majority stake in its gas grid business later this year, as the fossil fuel comes under increasing scrutiny from investors and activists.The WPD sale drew interest from a wide range of companies. The government’s climate pledges are what’s attracting investors to distribution grids, according to Randolph Brazier, director of innovation and electricity systems at the Energy Networks Association.“Ultimately, it’s driven by net zero,” he said. “Because people are connecting all these new technologies to the distribution grid.”Local network businesses are about digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization. They’re all underpinned by net zero, he said.Net-Zero TargetCompletion of the WPD deal, which will be funded with bridge financing through debt, is expected within the next four months and completion of the NECO aale is expected before the end of the first quarter of 2022. National Grid said it plans to start the sale process of its gas unit in the second half of this year.Once the deals complete, the National Grid portfolio will be 70% electricity and 30% gas, Pettigrew said. The fossil fuel is quickly becoming the next target of climate policies aimed at effectively eliminating emissions by 2050 in the U.K.Western Power provides electricity to more than 7.9 million U.K. customers in the Midlands, South West and Wales.National Grid has a commitment to reach net zero for scope one and two emissions. It plans to cut scope three emissions, on the energy carried through its networks to customers by 20% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline.Reducing the carbon in the fuel carried in its gas network is possible through hydrogen. The utility is currently looking at how it can switch from piping gas through its networks to clean-burning hydrogen to heat homes.“We view the transaction as a positive step for National Grid,” John Musk, analyst at RBC Europe Ltd said in a note. Adding that the market will need time “to digest” the deal.Shares rose 0.5% to 835.6 pence a share at 2:34 p.m. in London.(Updates with comment from analyst in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",National Grid Makes $11 Billion Deal in Move to Green Future
