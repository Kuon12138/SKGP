On January 4, Axalta (AXTA) announced a three-year global alliance with Plenham—the parent company of Bodyshop and IBIS Worldwide. The alliance aims to share business improvement ideas, innovation, best practices, new process establishment, and knowledge through media and social interactions.

The alliance is expected to help Axalta leverage its global refinish expertise to enhance Plenham’s worldwide media platforms and networks. The partnership will likely start with the IBIS USA 2019 symposium in San Diego on February 13–15.

Jim Muse, Axalta’s Vice President of Global Refinish sales, said, “I am confident that this new alliance between Plenham and Axalta will significantly benefit our customers and the overall global collision repair industry.

Axalta is trading 10.2% below the 100-day moving average price of $26.50, which indicates that the stock is on a downward trend. Analysts are positive about Axalta.

## Corteva sold its herbicide product line

On January 3, American Vanguard (AVD) announced that it acquired the Quizalofop product line of herbicides from Corteva Agriscience—DowDuPont’s (DWDP) agriculture division. However, the parties didn’t disclose any of the financial aspects of the deal.

The product line includes soybeans, canola, and pulses sold in the US and Canada. As part of the transaction, American Vanguard will get technical registrations, commercial sales information, and the transfer of existing product supply arrangements.

Eric Wintemute, American Vanguard’s chairman and CEO, said, “Our acquisition of the QPE product line from Corteva Agriscience provides our crop protection business with a portfolio of valuable herbicide brands that hold significant leadership positions in the North American market. These products are complementary to existing glyphosate, glufosinate and 2,4D use, and are highly regarded for weed and grass control by providing a broad window of application and excellent crop safety.”

DowDuPont’s stock prices gained 3.2% and closed at $54.73 for the week ending January 4. Despite the gain in the stock price, DowDuPont traded 9.8% below the 100-day moving average price of $60.71. DowDuPont’s 100-day moving average has fallen from a high of $72.06 to the current levels, which indicates weakness in the stock. DowDuPont struggled in 2018 with a decline of 24.9%. However, DowDuPont has started 2019 on a positive note. DowDuPont’s 14-day relative strength index of 52 indicates that the stock isn’t overbought or oversold.

## APD to build second hydrogen facility in California

On January 7, Air Products and Chemicals (APD) announced that it plans to build a second liquid hydrogen plant in California. The decision came on the back of the increase in demand from various consumer markets, specifically from the growing demand for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. APD also said the project development work is already underway and expects the plant to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2019. However, APD did not specify the financial aspects of building the plant.

Liquefied hydrogen is used in several industries like electronics, material handling, float glass, edible fats and oils, chemical and petrochemical, and so on. In September 2018, APD announced its plan to build a liquid hydrogen plant in La Porte, Texas.

Marie Folkes, APD’s president for the Americas segment, said, “Current customer demand for liquid hydrogen is driving the need for this new investment as we are experiencing growth from many traditional market segments, for which a reliable source of this product is vitally important. Additionally, this new capacity will be available for the steadily increasing demand from hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.”

In 2018, APD declined by 2.5% and outperformed the S&P 500. With several projects scheduled to be commissioned in 2019, APD’s growth path looks intact.

To make it into our lineup, dividend stocks had to first beat the 2% average yield of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. We then looked for firms that are leaders in their industry and that have solid prospects for expanding their sales and profits, while also generating enough cash to pay investors. And we aim to avoid dividend traps -- stocks with high yields but weak underlying businesses and poor prospects. We've recently made a change to the list, pulling CVS Health (CVS). Although the stock has performed well, it broke its streak of dividend increases, which was one reason we recommended it. We'll introduce its replacement in a minute.

2019-09-03,"The market was higher and lower on Friday, but when all was said and done, it essentially ended the day flat. The S&P 500 finished last week's action essentially flat, gaining a tiny 0.06% … the usual modest action we see before a three-day weekend, on the usual modest volume.Source: Shutterstock General Electric (NYSE:GE) may have been the ultimate reason stocks finished the week on a (barely) high note. It gained 1.8% on Friday, rallying on a partial legal victory that should ease its vulnerability to a lawsuit that alleges accounting fraud. The suit now must prove there was forehand knowledge of accounting problems that have become nightmarish for the organization and its shareholders.And, the market managed to overcome the drag that Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) proved to be on Friday, when it slumped more than 6%. There was no news, but a major selloff in crude oil and natural gas tripped up most names in the industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality As the new, shortened trading week gets going though, it's the stock charts of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY) and Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE:APD) that deserve the closest looks. Here's why, and what to look for next. Weyerhaeuser (WY)Weyerhaeuser suffered the same rough end to 2018 most other stocks did. But, it hasn't enjoyed the same rebound most other names have mustered so far in 2019. Rather, the stock has seemingly been stuck on a range.Slowly but surely though, that's changing. While WY stock may remain trapped between support and resistance, it's also starting to find support in places where it hadn't. In the meantime, a handful of momentum indicators have flipped to a bullish mode.  *   Click to EnlargeChief among the momentum-driven clues is the moving averages, and the purple 50-day moving average line in particular. It has moved above the 200-day moving average line, marked in white, for the first time in months.  * Since peaking in April, and really since late last year, Weyerhaeuser shares have been getting squeezed into the narrowing tip of a converging wedge pattern, framed by yellow dashed lines on both charts.  * The upper boundary of the wedge pattern may break soon, but even if it does, there's another ceiling just above. The $27.60 area was established as a proven technical resistance area in the first quarter of the year. Air Products & Chemicals (APD)With nothing more than a passing glance, it would be easy to just say Air Products & Chemicals shares are bouncing around, moving sideways after a big runup over the course of the first half of the year. And, perhaps that's all that's happening at this time.A longer, more detailed examination of the chart since the end of July, however, reveals there may be more going on than it superficially seems. A pullback may be brewing, and the stock's vulnerability could be even more pronounced because of the 44% advance that took shape between January and July.  * 10 Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy   *   Click to EnlargeThe biggest red flag is the streak of lower highs that has taken shape since the late-July peak, plotted as a yellow dashed line on the daily chart.  * Additionally, notice how APD stock has broken back under the purple 50-day moving average line, as has the blue 20-day moving average line, for the first times since March.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart we not only see a bearish MACD indicator, but the Chaikin line has taken a huge trip from a very high level in May to back under zero now. It's a sign that the volume trend turned decidedly bearish, and started to do so even before shares peaked and reversed.  * Should things get worse, the most plausible support level is around $160, where the stock bounced around in a narrow range for all of 2018.  Western Digital (WDC)Finally, the rebound Western Digital stock has been working on since the beginning of this year has really taken hold. It's not yet over a key hump, and has another one to test following that. But, we're starting to see support where we need to see it most, and starting to see momentum indicators solidify in a major way.  *   Click to EnlargeThe major highs going back to November are rather well aligned, marked as a red dashed line on both stock charts. That's the ultimate line in the sand. Notice it may be the neckline of what eventually turns into a head-and-shoulders pattern.  * In the meantime, the more immediate ceiling is just under $58, marked as a yellow line on both stock charts, where shares have peaked a few times since the latter half of July.  * Not only is the purple 50-day moving average line now above the white 200-day moving average line -- a so-called golden cross, indicative of sustained momentum -- the 50-day line offered the support needed to force last week's bounce out of a pullback.  * Any real breakout wouldn't face its next significant technical test until it finds the turbulence around the $85 it went through in 2017 and early 2018.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-29,"Income investors love dividend stocks for their regular payouts; any stock-price appreciation is just gravy. The Kiplinger Dividend 15, the list of our favorite dividend-paying stocks, delivers on the first front, yielding 3.4%, on average, compared with a 1.9% yield for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and a 1.7% yield for the 10-year Treasury bond. What's more, over the past year, our list has slathered on the gravy, too, returning 13.6%, on average, counting dividends and price appreciation, compared with a 4.3% return for the S&P; 500&#92;. Big gains don't come without some strings attached. Like many stocks that have ridden this record-long bull market, some of the names on our list appear to be richly valued now. And although dividends buttress returns when a stock's price slides, pricey stocks could take a big hit in the event of a stock market plunge. Perhaps more salient for dividend investors, major boosts in the share price diminish a stock's yield, as is the case with Blackstone Group and Realty Income--two stocks originally chosen for our list because, among other things, they historically provided yields above 4%. Although they've slipped below that bar, we're not yet ready to jettison them for performing too well, and we believe that their yields can return to historical averages. We're keeping an eye on them, but we're making no changes to the list at present. The Dividend 15 are divided into three categories: stocks with a long history of stable dividends, stocks with the potential for rapid growth in their payouts, and high yielders. Find a dividend stock that suits your needs, or select a mix. SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the Most",The Kiplinger Dividend 15: Our Favorite Dividend-Paying Stocks

The assets will be transferred to the venture once the projects starts up.Standard Chartered Plc and Banque Saudi Fransi are advising on the talks with local and international lenders, they said. Standard Chartered, Banque Saudi Fransi and Aramco declined to comment.The $8-billion venture, announced in August 2018, has a 25-year contract to own and operate the project for a fixed monthly fee and will serve Aramco’s Jazan refinery and terminal on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast. Air Products will own at least 55% of the business, with Aramco and ACWA Power holding the rest.Saudi Arabia is seeking to transform its oil-dependent economy by developing new industries, and is pushing into petrochemicals as a way to earn more from its energy deposits.

2020-01-24,"Air Products & Chemicals Inc.  reported Friday a fiscal first-quarter profit that beat expectations, but revenue that missed and provided a downbeat outlook. The industrial gases company's stock was still inactive in premarket trading. Net income for the quarter to Dec. 31 rose to $475.6 million, or $2.14 a share, from $347.5 million, or $1.57 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $2.14 topped the FactSet consensus of $2.10. Sales grew 1.4% to $2.25 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $2.29 billion, as misses in industrial gas sales in the Americas and in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region offset a beat in Asia. Volume growth and higher pricing was partially offset by lower energy pass-through, unfavorable currency moves and a contract modification to a tolling agreement in India. Looking ahead, the company said it expects second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.10 to $2.20, which is below the current FactSet consensus of $2.24, but reiterated the full-year guidance of $9.35 to $9.60, which surrounds expectations of $9.44.

2020-04-24,"Buy low, sell high — that’s the mantra for making money in the stock market, right?And the first part of the process sounds simple enough: Find a cheap stock with a low price-to-earnings ratio, buy it — then wait for it to rise in price.Problem is, some stocks are cheap for a reason. No matter how cheaply you buy them, there’s no guarantee they’ll go up. So how do you improve your chances of finding a winner?TipRanks uses a system called Smart Score. Crunching data on Wall Street sentiment, buying activity by insiders and hedge funds, and other factors — including, yes, low P/E — TipRanks assigns each stock a smart score rating indicating a level of confidence that it will outperform the market, on an easy to understand scale of 1 to 10.Those stocks at the tippety top of the scale score a perfect 10 — and over the last nine years they’ve outperformed the average S&P 500 stock by nearly 50%.We’ve pulled up three ""perfect 10"" stocks that tick every box, to find out why they are poised to make gains even in today’s difficult market environment.Change Healthcare (CHNG)The first ""perfect 10"" name on today’s list is Change Healthcare, a software company that provides solutions for analysis, connectivity, communication, payment, and workflow optimization for healthcare providers. Change’s products connect patients, payers, and providers in the health system. In the current pandemic situation, a company that connects the data dots for the healthcare system should find itself in demand.Change reported its fiscal third quarter results in February, its third since going public, and beat the earnings estimates by 10%. EPS came in at 33 cents, and revenue was $808.2 million.In recent weeks, Change has taken concrete steps to makes its data services useful for the healthcare industry generally, opening a COVID-19 Updates and Resources hub, and a CARES Act Advisory resource hub, to make information available to interested parties who will be impacted by governmental measures taken to combat the epidemic.5-star analyst Steven Halper, of Cantor Fitzgerald, is impressed by CHNG’s prospect and policies, especially given the pandemic situation, writing, “While COVID is likely to be a near-term headwind to its financial results, the company has launched a number of solutions aimed at addressing customers' COVID-related issues... We maintain our view that CHNG should continue to increase its market share due to its differentiated data-driven and network-based approach.”In line with his bullish view, Halper gives the stock a Buy rating with a $20 price target that suggests an impressive upside of 96%. (To watch Halper’s track record, click here)Credit Suisse analyst Jailendra Singh agrees that CHNG is a stock to buy. In comments on the stock, Singh points out the company’s favorable debt position and the positive forward outlook for profits after the epidemic, when the healthcare system restarts elective procedures and sees a consequent surge in demand for data and payment processing services.Singh’s Buy rating is backed by a $16 price target, which while less bullish than Halper’s still points toward 57% upside growth.Looking at the Smart Score factors, CHNG receives a Strong Buy consensus rating, and investor sentiment over the past month shows rising interest in this stock. Shares have dropped in price this year, pulled down by the general bear market, giving investors a chance to buy low. CHNG is priced at $10.22, and the average price target of $16.71 indicates a 68% upside potential for the coming 12 months. (See Change stock analysis at TipRanks)Hannon Armstrong (HASI)Next up is Hannon Armstrong, a financial services company focused on climate change. Where some just talk about the need to support green initiatives, Hannon Armstrong puts its money where its mouth is, investing in, and funding ventures in, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable infrastructure. As of December 2019, the company was managing more than $6 billion in assets.While such green initiatives frequently have a reputation as money sucking black holes, Hannon has selected its investments well and consistently returned quarterly profits. In recent weeks, Hannon has announced a $150,000 cash donation for COVID-19 relief efforts in its home state of Maryland. The company also raised its dividend by a half cent, to an even 34 cents quarterly. The new dividend makes the annualized payment $1.36 and went into effect this month. At 5.2%, the yield is significantly higher than the market average, and simply blows away Treasury bonds. Hannon has a 7-year history of dividend reliability.On the financial front, Hannon has announced bond offers, of $400 million in 6% Green Bonds and of $350 million in Senior Unsecured Notes. Issuing debt on that scale while during such a volatile time for markets is a bold move – but also shows a high level of corporate confidence.Christopher Van Horn, reviewing the stock for B. Riley FBR, writes, “We estimate that COVID disruptions could be less volatile than what is being priced into shares and given the financial nature of the biz model, we think pipeline remains on track. While we would not be surprised to see certain projects pushed out, the pipeline of over $2.5B is significant.”In line with his upbeat view of Hannon’s prospects, Van Horn rates the stock a Buy. His $42 price target implies an upside of 59%. (To watch Van Horn’s track record, click here)Oppenheimer analyst Noah Kaye agrees. In fact, he gives HASI shares an identical $42 price target. Backing the bullish views, Kaye writes, “We believe appetite for green bonds remains relatively strong and will be looking for pricing terms on the notes to validate our view. While we do believe a persistence of current macroeconomic conditions could stress components of the balance sheet portfolio, we expect earnings to be relatively resilient given the portfolio's diversification…”Hannon’s ’10’ Smart Score comes from its Strong Buy consensus rating along with rising stock purchases by both investors and insiders. Hannon has received 5 Buy ratings in recent weeks, opposed to a single Hold. With a share price of $26.46 and an average target of $35.83, the stock shows a robust 12-month upside potential of 35%. It’s a solid outlook, for a green stock that has maintained sound investment profile. (See Hannon’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Last on our list for now is Air Products and Chemicals, a provider of chemicals and gasses for industrial use. Based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, APD remains an important Rust Belt industrial employer, and brings significant revenues to its region. In its fiscal Q1 (ending in December 2019), the company registered a top line of $2.254 billion, up 1% year-over-year.Like Hannon above, APD pays out a dividend – and has kept its dividend payments reliable for the last 20 years. The payout ratio, 62%, shows a commitment sharing profits with investors, while the yield of 2.6% is noticeably higher than the ~2% yield found among S&P stocks. APD has raised its quarterly dividend payment 3 times in the past three years.Covering the stock for Wells Fargo, 5-star analyst Michael Sison is clearly impressed. His Buy rating is backed by a $265 price target, indicative of a 20% upside potential. (To watch Sison’s track record, click here)In his report on the stock, Sison writes, “While risks of COVID-19 and significant drop in oil prices still persist, we believe APD has enough levers to drive EPS growth in FY20 and FY21 despite the likelihood of slower economic growth… In our view, the key driver to growth is a strong backlog of projects coming on stream in the next couple years, which should support over 50% of growth… We believe APD is among the better positioned chemical companies in CY1Q, with industrial gas companies generally being much more resilient relative to other chemical companies…”Air Products’ '10' Smart Score shows positive points almost across the board.

2020-09-30,"On Wednesday, shares of Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $295.82.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2022-01-21  * Strike Price: $300.00  * Volume: 102  * Open Interest: 0Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 22, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-06,"Hydrogen-powered cars and trucks have been a grail among alternative energy advocates for decades decades. There were hydrogen companies in the 1990s that were extolling the benefits of hydrogen over electric vehicles (EVs).
The trouble was, building a hydrogen-powered vehicle is complicated – that means it’s also expensive. Also, there’s no infrastructure for hydrogen vehicles. There are no hydrogen filling stations and you can’t fill one up at your house like an EV.
Plus, hydrogen is somewhat dangerous to store, so filling stations would need to have some safety standards. And no one is that familiar with hydrogen, so there’s a learning curve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
But technology has helped push hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) much further along in recent years. And the fuel cell technology has been used in other industries where some of the challenges for HFCVs don’t exist.

No, it’s not the sexiest name. But it was established in 1940, when it was more common to name your company for what it did rather than capturing the zeitgeist. Plus, this is an industrial-facing company, so consumer appeal doesn’t really factor here.
And this company does just what it says on the label. APD makes and sells atmospheric gasses, such as carbon dioxide for carbonating soda and water. It sells oxygen gas to hospitals and first responders and liquid oxygen to NASA and refinery hydrogen. It has a technology for making liquified natural gas (LNG). You get the idea.
It has also expanded its operations to become a global presence, selling into 50 countries at this point.
Due to its lowkey business, APD is still reasonably priced compared to flashier tech-forward companies. The stock is up 32% in the past year and delivers a 1.8% dividend.

Bloom Energy (BE)

A decade ago, BE was featured in a 2010 60 Minutes segment that asked if it was an “energy breakthrough,” though the company was founded nearly a decade before that.
Then, it didn’t IPO until mid-2018. These cutting-edge technologies can have such long runways.
BE’s unique selling point is a fuel cell that allows its industrial-sized generators to run on natural gas, biogas or hydrogen without combustion. These units can also store energy and distribute AC or DC power.
What’s more, the entire system is scalable. Each unit delivers 200 to 300 kilowatts of power, and customers can add units as needed.
Given the challenges presented by our aging grid and the need in more industries for “always on” systems, back-up and uninterruptible power are no longer options, but competitive necessities.

BE is up 221% in the past year, 83% year to date. The wildfires in California have stoked interest but this uptrend is growing, not subsiding.

The fundamental technology that makes hydrogen power work is what’s called a proton exchange membrane (PEM), which utilizes hydrogen and oxygen in an electrochemical reaction.
This PEM has been the greatest challenge for the hydrogen industry. If you can’t build a motor, the rest of the associated challenges are moot. BLDP specializes in the building the motors and then sells them to other companies looking to put them in their products.
Again, the challenge is managing a “chicken and egg” dilemma. You can’t create demand for hydrogen without supply, but you can’t create supply without demand.
BLDP has been tactical in its approach to this quandary, and found markets that generate solid income so that it can reach for bigger markets while establishing its name.
This Canadian firm has been waiting for the hydrogen heyday for decades and it’s now in the spotlight, with strategic deals in Europe and China with auto manufacturers.
The stock is up 174% in the past year, 120% coming year to date. If hydrogen has a big break, BLDP will be one of the key winners.

Cummins (CMI)

When you think of heavy-duty engines, Cummins is a name that comes to most people’s minds right away. CMI has been around for 101 years and continues to build its reputation for reliable, quality engines that drive economies around the world.
And these days, CMI isn’t just about heavy-duty diesel engines. CMI has begun developing electric and even hydrogen power systems.
In fact, the company has been working in hydrogen development for two decades. Last year CMI expanded its move in this direction with the acquisition of Canada-based Hydrogenics, a leading hydrogen fuel cell company.
Since CMI is a more indirect play on this sector than other stocks here, and given that it’s a far more established corporate player with a hefty $32 billion market cap, this stock won’t be scoring massive gains.

This company is a next-generation distributed power generation company that uses a proprietary molten-carbonate fuel cell technology.
FCEL is unique in its division that actually generates and distributes clean-energy hydrogen. While fuel cells will have a robust market moving forward, one piece of the hydrogen puzzle that still needs solving is finding a way to generate and distribute hydrogen to fueling stations.
Companies that establish themselves in this market and grow their distribution systems from here will be the big oil companies of the future.
FCEL is up a whopping 447% in the past 12 months, but it’s actually down 11% year to date. This may be a small company but has been around since 1969, so it has a solid underlying business.

Hydrogen has become the investment equivalent of fiberoptic when it comes to the alternative energy boom. During the dotcom run, fiber optics was a cutting edge technology that was going to transform society.
And it did. Just a little bit later than proponents expected.
We’ll see how things play out for hydrogen. But we’re also in a much different place when it comes to our ability to adopt and commercialize new technologies when compared to two decades ago.
PLUG specializes in converting battery-powered equipment to hydrogen-generated fuel sources. And it has a proven model of integration. In warehouses, PLUG can power big forklifts and other equipment, and also provides power stations for filling the machines up. Scaling that up could prove to be a very powerful skill.

2020-11-11,"Shares of Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) increased by 7.05% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Air Products & Chemicals has.Air Products & Chemicals's Debt According to the Air Products & Chemicals's most recent financial statement as reported on July 23, 2020, total debt is at $7.91 billion, with $7.07 billion in long-term debt and $838.90 million in current debt. Adjusting for $3.92 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $3.99 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Air Products & Chemicals's $24.78 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.32. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-12-15,"In a report on the alternative fuel market, analyst Rupert Merer, of National Bank of Canada, looks at the possibilities and potentialities of the hydrogen as both an energy resource and a commodity. At the heart of the matter, he writes, “Stakeholders across energy markets have reached the consensus that climate change is a problem and decarbonization of our energy supply mix will require a multifaceted approach which includes H2. It is estimated that H2 could supply 15% to 25% of global energy needs…” Merer adds, of hydrogen’s potential benefits, “H2 has the ability to reduce emissions in sectors where decarbonization is otherwise challenging, such as freight logistics, collective transport and industrial heating.”So what is hydrogen, and why is it important? Hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the observable universe, and is a common building block in complex organic molecules. It’s found in both wood and petroleum derivatives – there is a reason those are commonly called hydrocarbons – and along with oxygen, it is part of the ordinary water molecule. Without hydrogen, life as we know it would not be possible.With this in mind, using TipRanks database, we locked in on three stocks that some of Wall Street’s top analysts have tapped for gains in the growing hydrogen environment. Ballard Power Systems (BLDP)The first stock on the list is Ballard Power Systems, a hydrogen fuel cell manufacturer based in British Columbia, Canada. The company focuses on proton exchange membrane technology, one of several competing technologies in the hydrogen fuel cell market. Ballard’s PEM fuel cells are distributed worldwide, and to date, the company has produced and shipped over 400MW worth of fuel cell products. Ballard’s fuel cells are used in transportation technology, to enable fully electric busses, commercial trucks, trains, and forklift vehicles.Like many manufacturers dependent on the transportation sector, this has been a hard year for Ballard. The disruptions caused by the coronavirus have hit the company form two directions: first, the usual foul-ups in the supply and distribution chains – but also, Ballard markets its products to commercial users, who have themselves been locked down due to corona. In short, Ballard saw revenues fall in the first part of 2020, and they have yet to recover. Q3 revenues came in at $25.6 million, in line with the first and second quarters of the year.Ballard’s share price, however, has been going up and up and up all year, despite some short-term periods of volatility. Overall, the shares have grown 170% year-to-date. The gains show the cachet of hydrogen in a market that is actively seeking renewable, less polluting, and non-emission energy sources. Hydrogen checks all three boxes.Covering Ballard for Roth Capital, 5-star analyst Craig Irwin sees the company in a sound position for rapid future growth.“BLDP exited 3Q20 with $361m in cash and no debt, and with only $100m-$120m in capital needed to generate positive earnings. Mgmt was clear that it intends to more actively evaluate M&A targets across the entire H2 and FC value chains [...] We remain optimistic on the LT uplift to revenue supported by the new China FC subsidy program, and would be buyers on any weakness,"" Irwin opined. To this end, Irwin rates BLDP a Buy, and his $25 price target implies room for 29% growth in 2021. (To watch Irwin’s track record, click here)Wall Street is broadly in agreement with this analysis. Over the last couple of months, BLDP has received 3 Buy ratings and 1 Hold from Street analysts. With an average price target of $24 per share, the potential upside stands at ~24%. (See BLDP stock analysis on TipRanks)Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products and Chemicals is primarily known as a provider of industrial gasses – which makes it a natural for the hydrogen industry. In its pure form, hydrogen is gaseous at ‘normal’ conditions. APD earlier this year capitalized on that natural fit, and contracted to acquire 5 hydrogen production plants in an agreement worth $530 million. Along with the new plants, APD also sealed its position as a major hydrogen supplier for PBF Energy.APD's acquisitions show it is serious about becoming a long-term provider to the hydrogen industry. APD is already an important supplier to hydrogen refiners, providing a pure gas that is usable as in transportation fuel technology. In the recently fiscal 4Q20, APD missed earnings targets but beat the forecasts on revenues. The FQ4 top line hit $2.32 billion, up 2% year-over-year and also 2% over the estimates. Argus analyst Bill Selesky likes APD’s overall position in the market, noting: “Despite weak results in fiscal 4Q20 due to the pandemic, we believe that performance will begin to improve. We also believe that APD is extremely well positioned to manage through this period due to its stable cash flows, lower-than-average debt, and investment-grade credit rating.”Selesky gives APD shares a $360 price target, suggesting 33% growth ahead, and maintains a Buy rating on the stock. (To watch Selesky’s track record, click here)Air Products has 11 recent reviews, breaking down 10 to 1 in Buys and Holds, and giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The average price target is $311.10, indicating a potential 15% upside from current levels. (See APD stock analysis on TipRanks)BP PLC (BP)Last but not least is BP, the petroleum giant. This company has a reputation within the industry as a leader in moving toward non-petroleum, renewable energy sources, and has in the past conducted initiatives in wind, solar, and hydrogen energy. Last year, the company joined the Global Hydrogen Council. As a major player in the natural gas market, BP is well-positioned to also become a provider of ‘blue’ hydrogen, or H2 derived from natural gas sources.BP is also conducting a project at its Lingen refinery in northwestern Germany, converting the facility to produce hydrogen from water. The project is in collaboration with Orsted, and when it comes fully online in 2024 will be able to produce up to one metric ton of clean hydrogen per hour.Taking a lead in the renewable energy market is one way that BP is moving to shore up its future position. The hydrocarbon industry won’t last forever, and 2020 has been a particularly difficult year. Shares are down 36% year-to-date, and quarterly revenue has fallen from $74 billion in Q1 to $44 billion in Q3. Q3 did, however, see the company post a $100 million net profit, after heavy losses in Q2.Sam Margolin, 5-star analyst with Wolfe Research, wrote of BP after the quarterly report, “Our instinct is that the underlying O&G story is more influential to near term stock performance, although the Lingen announcement is positive for BP as it reflects the company’s ability to partner with industry leaders to advance its net-zero plan.”Margolin is bullish on BP, and his stance comes with an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. His price target, of $31, implies an upside of 41% in the year ahead. (To watch Margolin’s track record, click here)All in all, BP has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 6 reviews that include 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are selling for $21.94 and the average price target of $29.80 suggests room for 36% upside potential in the next 12 months.

Despite the increase in sales this quarter, the decrease in earnings may suggest Air Products & Chemicals is not utilizing their capital as effectively as possible.

Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q1, Air Products & Chemicals posted an ROCE of 0.04%.

2021-03-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Sun-scorched expanses and steady Red Sea breezes make the northwest tip of Saudi Arabia prime real estate for what the kingdom hopes will become a global hub for green hydrogen.As governments and industries seek less-polluting alternatives to hydrocarbons, the world’s biggest crude exporter doesn’t want to cede the burgeoning hydrogen business to China, Europe or Australia and lose a potentially massive source of income. So it’s building a $5 billion plant powered entirely by sun and wind that will be among the world’s biggest green hydrogen makers when it opens in the planned megacity of Neom in 2025.The task of turning a patch of desert the size of Belgium into a metropolis powered by renewable energy falls to Peter Terium, the former chief executive officer of RWE AG, Germany’s biggest utility, and clean-energy spinoff Innogy SE. His performance will help determine whether a country dependent on petrodollars can transition into a supplier of non-polluting fuels.“There’s nothing I’ve ever seen or heard of this dimension or challenge,” Terium said. “I’ve been spending the last two years wrapping my mind around ‘from scratch,’ and now we’re very much in execution mode.”Hydrogen is morphing from a niche power source — used in zeppelins, rockets and nuclear weapons — into big business, with the European Union alone committing $500 billion to scale up its infrastructure. Huge obstacles remain to the gas becoming a major part of the energy transition, and skeptics point to Saudi Arabia’s weak track record so far capitalizing on what should be a competitive edge in the renewables business, especially solar, where there are many plans but few operational projects.But countries are jostling for position in a future global market, and hydrogen experts list the kingdom as one to watch.The U.K. is hosting 10 projects to heat buildings with the gas, China is deploying fuel-cell buses and commercial vehicles, and Japan is planning to use the gas in steelmaking. U.S. presidential climate envoy John Kerry urged the domestic oil and gas industry to embrace hydrogen’s “huge opportunities.”That should mean plenty of potential customers for the plant called Helios Green Fuels. Saudi Arabia is setting its sights on becoming the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen — a market that BloombergNEF estimates could be worth as much as $700 billion by 2050.“You’re seeing a more diversified portfolio of energy exports that is more resilient,” said Shihab Elborai, a Dubai-based partner at consultant Strategy&. “It’s diversified against any uncertainties in the rate and timing of the energy transition.”Blueprints are being drawn and strategies are being announced, but it’s still early days for the industry. Hydrogen is expensive to make without expelling greenhouse gases, difficult to store and highly combustible.Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. The current cost of producing a kilogram is a little under $5, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.Saudi Arabia possesses a competitive advantage in its perpetual sunshine and wind, and vast tracts of unused land. Helios’s costs likely will be among the lowest globally and could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, according to BNEF. That’s cheaper than some hydrogen made from non-renewable sources today. It’s more expensive to produce renewable energy in Europe, and the continent’s anticipated demand while implementing a Green Deal should exceed its own supply, Terium said. That $1 trillion-plus stimulus package will try to make the continent carbon-neutral.“By no means will they be able to produce all the hydrogen themselves,” he said. “There’s just not enough North Sea or usable water for offshore wind.”Terium, who is Dutch, joined Neom in 2018 to design its energy, water and food networks. His enthusiasm for technologies such as electric vehicles and digital networks wasn’t matched by Innogy’s investors, but it is by the backers of Neom.The most important of those is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 35-year-old de facto ruler, who envisions Neom as a zero-emissions exemplar helping transform society and the economy. The hydrogen plant is part of that vision. But while Neom’s $500 billion price tag prompts questions about whether it will go ahead exactly as planned, the hydrogen effort doesn’t depend on the megacity’s overall success.There are other challenges, too: The country produces one-eighth of the world’s oil supply, but its operational renewables capacity is small by regional standards, and it’s starting from zero with green hydrogen.The government is partnering with Acwa Power, a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia-based power developer partly owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, and Air Products and Chemicals Inc., a $58 billion company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to build the green hydrogen plant.The trio is splitting the costs of Helios, which will use 4 gigawatts of solar and wind power.“As the first gigawatt plant, we will have an advantage in developing further innovation,” Terium said. “This is not going to be the end of the game.”For starters, Helios will produce 650 tons of hydrogen a day by electrolysis – enough for conversion to 1.2 million tons per year of green ammonia. Air Products will buy all of that ammonia, which is easier to ship than liquid or gaseous hydrogen, and convert it back upon delivery to customers.Enough green hydrogen will be produced to maintain about 20,000 city buses. There are about 3 million buses operating worldwide, and Air Products wants to be a mainstay in depots switching to hydrogen, said Simon Moore, vice president of investor relations.“We’re not going to wait until this project comes on-stream in 2025 to think about additional capacity,” he said.Fuel-cell vehicles could capture as much as 30% of bus-fleet volume globally by 2050, with growth coming primarily from China and the European Union, according to BNEF. Moore declined to identify Helios’s clients.Hydrogen will cost more than polluting alternatives at first, but enough governments and businesses face stringent carbon targets that need the gas to meet them, Moore said. Thirteen nations have hydrogen strategies in place, and another 11 are preparing theirs, according to BNEF.Germany said it needs “enormous” volumes of green hydrogen, and it hopes Saudi Arabia will be a supplier.“The interest Saudi Arabia has had from investors leads us to believe that there is a sound economic case for hydrogen, even at current prices,” a spokesman for the Energy Ministry said.At the same time, the government is trying to boost its own scant use of renewable energy. Currently, under 700 megawatts operate nationwide -- less than 2% of Spain’s installed capacity. The nation plans to meet half of its power needs from renewables by 2030 and has several projects under construction or soon to start.Saudi Arabia also is one of the few countries regularly burning crude to make electricity. The highly polluting practice reached a four-year peak in August, and critics say the energy used by the Neom plant should be diverted into the national grid instead.Yet the focus remains on exports. Petrostates stand to lose as much as $13 trillion by 2040 because of climate-change targets, and Saudi Arabia is among those expected to be most affected.The hydrogen plant will produce 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at most, hardly a match for the 9 million barrels of crude the kingdom pumps daily. Even so, finding a way to corner part of the clean-fuels market represents a necessary economic lifeline.“It’s sponsored at the highest possible level, so if any project happens, it’s got to be this,” Elborai said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Saudi Arabia’s Bold Plan to Rule the $700 Billion Hydrogen Market
