2018-12-28,"Volatility was the name of the game for stocks in 2018. The market plunged to severe lows in both February and December, but all-time highs in September. The Standard & Poor&apos;s 500-stock index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both on the precipice of bear markets late in the year. However, we enjoyed a surprising &quot;Santa Claus&quot; rally that saw the Dow climb more than 1,000 points - its biggest single-day point gain ever - on Dec. 26. When you&apos;re evaluating stock picks for 2019, expect more of the unexpected. Continued volatility seems unavoidable considering unsolved trade tensions and heightened worries about the Federal Reserve and interest-rate hikes. The flip side? &quot;Despite the volatility that we have witnessed in the global markets, for 2019 our analysts are maintaining a pro-growth, pro-cyclical bias,&quot; RBC Capital writes in its 2019 outlook. Many Wall Street analysts, in fact, predict upside in 2019. That includes Deutsche Bank, whose 3,250 target for the S&P 500 next year implies more than 30% upside for the market! With this outlook in mind, here are some of the analyst community&apos;s top stock picks for 2019. These are stocks, large and small, that boast a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; analyst consensus and significant upside potential.

Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) says that it will be leaving behind its old headquarters in Deerfield, Mich., as it heads to a new headquarters currently being built in Chicago, Ill. This will have to taking 400 employees with it as part of the move.

Mondelez 400 employees will find their new headquarters at 905 W. Fulton Market. They will occupy a five-story building that sits near the center of the district. This will put them near the headquarters of other major companies, such as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).

Employees don't have to worry about the Mondelez headquarters moving just yet. The company isn't ready to actually switch to the new building. Instead, it will be holding off the change until April of next year. It's worth noting that MDLZ has singed a 15-year lease for the building.

A big late 2018 sell-off in equities spurred by recession fears, followed by a blowout December jobs report which put to rest those recession fears, implies that the outlook for stocks to rise over the next several months is quite favorable. Broadly speaking, the financial markets should be a tide that lifts most boats in the first half of 2019.

In simple terms, the fundamentals underlying Starbucks stock aren't that good and the valuation is still stretched, a combination which more often than not results in a weak stock.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



To be sure, Starbucks is a great company. This is the global coffee giant. Growth will remain good and steady over the next several years. Margins should remain stable. The dividend is safe. The balance sheet is secure. These are all good things that will keep SBUX  on a long term uptrend.

But, gains in the near to medium term will be muted by operational risks and a stretched valuation. With that in mind, let's take a look at four reasons to avoid Starbucks stock for the foreseeable future.

### 1&#92;. Coffee Isn't As Popular as It Used to Be

A big problem for Starbucks is that today's kids don't drink as much coffee as their parents, and that's because they are more health-conscious than their parents and are opting for more health-oriented drinks like teas and cold-pressed juices.

According to a YouGov survey, coffee is far more popular than tea among every age demographic except for the 18 to 29 year-old demographic, where the two have equal popularity. Also, the cold-pressed trend is as strong as ever among younger consumers, while drinks like kombucha have soared in popularity over the past several years.

Under the hood, what you have here is a secular shift among younger consumers towards healthier and more active lifestyles. Coffee has always been in the gray area in terms of being good or bad for people. Consumers are increasingly shunning gray area items like coffee, and instead adopting healthier alternatives.

This trend won't let up anytime soon. Granted, Starbucks has a huge presence in the tea market, so they are braced for this impact somewhat. But, there will be a swath of consumers over the next several years who quit Starbucks entirely in order to be &quot;healthier,&quot; and that's a sizable operational risk for Starbucks stock.

### 2&#92;. Competition Is Bigger Than Ever

The big thing that has weighed on SBUX over the past several years is bigger competition from quick service restaurants like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and indie coffee houses like Peet's. This headwind won't ease anytime soon.

McDonald's is only getting more aggressive in the breakfast drinks and snacks game. The more aggressive they get, the more price-sensitive consumers will turn their morning Starbucks runs into morning McDonald's runs.

Moreover, if the economy does slow meaningfully, non-price-sensitive consumers will turn into price-sensitive consumers, meaning there could be a mass exodus from Starbucks and to McDonald's.

On the indie front, things aren't prettier. Instagram culture is as strong as ever. Indie coffee shops have Instagram appeal. Starbucks does, too, but not to the same extent.

As such, so long as younger consumers remain obsessed with sharing their favorite morning drinks through pictures, indie coffee shops will keep rising at the expense of Starbucks.

### 3&#92;. The China Growth Narrative Looks Weak

A huge, and arguably the biggest, peg of the Starbucks stock bull thesis is robust growth potential in China. But, that peg of the SBUX bull thesis looks weaker and weaker by the day.

First, the trend isn't your friend here. In 2011, Starbucks China was posting comparable sales growth in excess of 20%. Last year, comparable sales growth was just 1%. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy is growing at its weakest rate since the financial crisis, and GDP growth is expected to keep falling over the next several years. Thus, the trends here are deteriorating and only getting worse.

Second, Starbucks isn't immune to competition overseas. McDonald's has a big presence in China and in other emerging markets. If economic weakness in those markets persist, McDonald's will likely steal share from Starbucks due to its lower price appeal.

Also, there's a nascent but rapidly growing and lower-priced coffee chain in China called Luckin Coffee that presents a huge risk to the Starbucks China growth narrative.

### 4&#92;. Valuation Is Still Stretched

Despite all the aforementioned operational risks from slowing growth and rising competition, Starbucks stock still trades at a premium valuation.

The stock's forward multiple currently hovers around 24. That is a big multiple on it's face. It is far bigger that the market average forward multiple of 15. It also bigger than the restaurant sector's average forward P/E multiple of 22.

To be sure, it is below the five year average valuation on Starbucks stock, which is 25 forward earnings. But, it's only a hair below that average, while the fundamentals are far worse than where they were over the past five years.

As such, the valuation on SBUX remains unnecessarily stretched.

### Bottom Line on SBUX Stock

Long term, Starbucks stock will be just fine. But, near to medium term gains will be capped by increasing operational risks against the backdrop of a still unnecessarily stretched valuation. As such, Starbucks stock looks like a name to avoid for the foreseeable future.

As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

## Stock performance

As of January 8, McDonald’s (MCD) stock is trading at $180.22, which represents a rise of 8.2% since the company’s announcement of its third-quarter earnings results on October 23.

The company is trading 22.7% higher than its 52-week low of $146.84 and 5.6% lower than its 52-week high of $190.88.

In the third quarter, McDonald’s outperformed analysts’ EPS and revenue expectations. Also, the company’s same-store sales growth for the quarter came in at 4.2%, beating analysts’ expectation of 3.6%. Along with the company’s impressive third-quarter results, investors’ optimism surrounding its initiative to modernize its restaurants—including the implementation of self-order kiosks, the remodeling of its restaurants, and the expansion of its deployment of the Experience of the Future initiative—drove the stock’s performance. The company’s stock price was also positively affected by Morgan Stanley’s upgrade on November 29. The upgrade led MCD to hit a 52-week high of $190.88 on the day.

## Year-to-date performance

In 2018, McDonald’s stock price rose 3.2%. In comparison, its peers Starbucks (SBUX), Wendy’s (WEN), and Jack in the Box (JACK) returned 12.1%, -4.9%, and -20.9%, respectively. The broader comparative index, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY), which invests 7.9% of its holdings in restaurant and travel companies, returned 0.3% in 2018.

Since the beginning of 2019, McDonald’s has returned 1.5%, while Starbucks, Wendy’s, and Jack in the Box have returned -1.3%, 3.5%, and 4.9%, respectively.

Next, let’s look at analysts’ recommendations for McDonald’s.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Analysts’ EPS expectations for 2018

In the first three quarters of 2018, McDonald’s (MCD) adjusted EPS rose 18.5% to $5.88. An expanded EBIT margin, a lower effective tax rate, and share repurchases drove the company’s EPS during the period. However, some of the growth in its EPS was offset by a fall in its revenue.

During the period, the company’s EBIT margin improved from 38.4% to 43.6% due to increased revenue from a more profitable franchised business and sales leverage from positive SSSG (same-store sales growth). The company’s effective tax rate stood at 25.7% compared to 32.8% in the previous year. McDonald’s repurchased 26.7 million shares for $4.3 billion in the first three quarters of 2018.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, analysts expect McDonald’s to post adjusted EPS of $1.89 to take its total EPS for 2018 to $7.75, a rise of 16.4% from $6.66 in 2017.

During the same period, McDonald’s peers Starbucks (SBUX) and Wendy’s (WEN) are expected to post EPS rises of 13.6% and 32.6%, respectively, while Jack in the Box’s (JACK) EPS are likely to fall 1.8%.

## Analysts’ EPS expectations for 2019

Analysts expect McDonald’s EPS growth to slow in 2019. For 2019, McDonald’s is expected to post adjusted EPS of $8.23, an increase of 6.2% from $7.75 in 2017. This EPS growth will likely to be driven by the expansion of its net margins and share repurchases.

Analysts expect McDonald’s net margin to expand from 28.8% in 2018 to 30% in 2019. At the end of the third quarter, the company had $7.98 billion left under its share repurchase program. Share repurchases drive a company’s EPS by lowering its number of shares outstanding.

In 2019, Starbucks, Wendy’s, and Jack in the Box are expected to post EPS rises of 12.8%, 16.2%, and 15.0%, respectively.

## Stock performance

The weakness in the broader equity market due to the increase in the interest rate by the Federal Reserve and concerns over the government shutdown led Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock to fall to $385.84 on December 24. However, since then, the company’s stock has been on the upswing.

On January 8, Chipotle was trading at $497.37, a rise of 28.9% from its December 24 closing price. The company is trading 100.9% higher than its 52-week low of $247.52 and 6.3% lower than its 52-week high of $530.68.

## Chipotle’s stock price drivers

As reported by Yahoo Finance, Peter Saleh and Ben Parente of BTIG have identified Chipotle as one of their top picks for 2019. In a research note, BTIG wrote, “We believe Chipotle has multiple levers at its disposal in 2019 to drive both top and bottom line outperformance, including menu innovation, digital sales growth, loyalty, menu pricing and improving new unit economics.” Also, on January 8, KeyBanc raised its 12-month price target for Chipotle from $500 to $525.

On January 2, Chipotle launched a line of new Lifestyle Bowls, which include the Keto Salad Bowl, the Paleo Salad Bowl, the Whole30 Salad Bowl, and the Double Protein Bowl. It’s launched these healthier options to support customers’ New Year’s resolutions. 

All these factors have contributed to the rise in Chipotle’s stock price.

## Stock performance in 2018

In recent years, Chipotle stock has been negatively affected by a series of food safety issues. The company was first hit by an E. coli outbreak in December 2015. The food safety issues caused Chipotle stock to fall from its all-time high of $758.61 on August 5, 2015. However, investors’ optimism about the appointment of Brian Niccol as the company’s CEO in March and the company’s strong performance in the first three quarters of 2018 helped the stock rise 49.4% in 2018. Year-to-date, the company’s stock has risen 15.2%. Chipotle’s peers Shake Shack (SHAK) and McDonald’s (MCD) returned 5.1% and 3.2% in 2018, respectively.

Next, we’ll look at analysts’ recommendations on CMG.

## Analysts’ recommendations

Of the 33 analysts that cover Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), 39.4% have given the stock “buy” ratings, 45.5% have given it “holds,” and 15.2% have given it “sells.”

On average, analysts have set a price target of $470.46 on the stock, which represents a potential fall of 5.4% from its current price of $497.37.

As we discussed in the previous article, BTIG, which has a “buy” rating on Chipotle, has identified Chipotle as one of its top picks for 2019. On January 8, KeyBanc raised its 12-month price target for Chipotle from $500 to $525. Barclays raised its price target from $400 to $450 on December 19. On October 26, Wedbush increased its price target from $380 to $400, Stifel cut its price target from $450 to $440, and SunTrust Robinson cut its price target from $510 to $500.

## Peer comparison

Among the 12 analysts covering Shake Shack (SHAK), 33.3% have given it “buys,” 50.0% have given it “holds,” and 16.7% have given it “sells.” Its average price target of $53.09 implies a potential upside of 8.3% from its current price of $49.04.

Among the 31 analysts covering McDonald’s (MCD), 78.1% have given it “buys,” and 21.9% have given it “holds.” Its average price target of $195.50 implies a potential upside of 8.3% from its current price of $180.60.

## Valuation multiple

As of January 8, Chipotle is trading at a forward PE multiple of 41.6x compared to 32.5x on December 24. The increase in Chipotle’s stock price has increased its valuation multiple. As of the same day, its peers Shake Shack and McDonald’s have forward PE multiples of 67.4x and 22.0x, respectively.

Chipotle is currently trading at 58.3 times analysts’ 2018 EPS expectations and 41.6 times analysts’ 2019 EPS expectations. Its EPS are expected to rise 29.2% in 2018 and 40.3% in 2019.

Next, we’ll look at the factors that could drive Chipotle’s EPS in 2019.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Analysts’ EPS expectations for 2018

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) posted adjusted EPS of $7.16 in the first three quarters of 2018, representing a rise of 36.4% from $5.25 in the corresponding three quarters of 2017. Revenue growth of 8.1%, the expansion of its net margins, and share repurchases drove the company’s EPS.

During the period, the company’s net margin expanded from 3.9% in the corresponding three quarters of 2017 to 5.5%. A fall in food, beverage, and packaging costs, a fall in other operating costs, and a lower effective tax rate improved Chipotle’s net margin. However, some of the expansion was offset by increased labor costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses.

Analysts expect Chipotle to post EPS of $1.32 in the fourth quarter to take its total EPS for 2018 to $8.53, a rise of 29.2% from $6.60 in 2017.

In comparison, Shake Shack (SHAK) and McDonald’s (MCD) are expected to post EPS rises of 19.4% and 16.4%, respectively, in 2018.

## Analysts’ 2019 EPS expectations

Analysts expect Chipotle to post EPS of $11.96 in 2019, a rise of 40.3% from $8.53 in 2018. Revenue growth and the expansion of its net margin are expected to drive the company’s EPS.

In 2019, analysts expect Chipotle’s revenue to rise 7.9% to $5.21 billion. This revenue growth is likely to be driven by the opening of new restaurants and positive same-store sales growth. Management expects to open 140–155 new restaurants in 2019.

Chipotle’s net margin is likely to expand from 4.9% in 2018 to 6.3%. This expansion is expected to be driven by the company’s improved gross margin, lower selling, general, and administrative expenses, and lower effective tax rate.

During the same period, the EPS of Shake Shack and McDonald’s are expected to rise 7.1% and 6.1%, respectively.

2019-01-11,"Apple and Starbucks Fell as Goldman Sachs Warned of China

## Apple and Starbucks

Today, the stocks of the US tech giant Apple (AAPL) and coffee store chain Starbucks (SBUX) fell. At 11:15 AM, Apple was down 0.8% while Starbucks was trading with 1.3% losses for the day. While the broader-market weakness could be a factor driving these two stocks down today, let’s take a look at another important factor.

## Goldman Sachs warned of China

Goldman Sachs (GS) analyst Karen Holthouse said in a note to investors, “The recent AAPL [Apple] announcement (while potentially also product-driven) cited trade concerns/macro, and MCD [McDonald’s] acknowledged softer trends in the region at a late November event,” reported CNBC. She added that Goldman Sachs’ “macro team also expects a continued slow down in GDP, at least partially driven by consumption.”

Holthouse thinks Starbucks could be the next US firm to warn investors of China’s slowdown. She downgraded her rating of Starbucks to “neutral” from “buy” and also cut the price target to $68 from $75.

On January 2, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, in a letter to investors, lowered the company’s guidance for the quarter ended December 29, citing weakness in China among other internal factors. A continued slowdown in China might affect the future growth of many other companies.

Today at 11: 25, the S&P 500 Index (SPY) and NASDAQ Composite Index (QQQ) (VTI) both were trading with 0.4% losses. YUM! Brands (YUM) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD) were down 1.7% and up 0.1%, respectively.",Apple and Starbucks Fell as Goldman Sachs Warned of China

2019-01-11,"Why Goldman Sachs Downgraded Starbucks Today

## Goldman Sachs’s downgrade

Today, Goldman Sachs downgraded Starbucks (SBUX) from a “buy” to a “neutral” due to concerns about its expansion in China, Starbucks’s second-largest market. Goldman Sachs also lowered its price target from $75 to $68. The new price target represents a potential upside of 5.9% from the stock’s January 10 closing price of $64.19.

As reported by CNBC, Goldman Sachs analyst Karen Holthouse wrote in a research note, “The recent AAPL [Apple] announcement (while potentially also product-driven) cited trade concerns/macro, and MCD [McDonald’s] acknowledged softer trends in the region at a late November event. The GS macro team also expects a continued slow down in GDP, at least partially driven by consumption.”

## Other analysts’ recommendations

Of the 33 analysts that follow Starbucks, 48.5% are favoring “buys,” 48.5% are favoring “holds,” and 3.0% are favoring “sells” on the stock. On average, analysts have given SBUX a price target of $68.44, which represents a potential upside of 6.6% for the stock.

Since the company’s investors meeting on December 13, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Stifel, JPMorgan Chase, BMO, Wells Fargo, and RBC have all raised their price targets on its stock. On January 10, Morgan Stanley raised its price target from $64 to $70. Barclays raised its price target from $65 to $69 on December 19.

## Stock performance

The downgrade appears to have negatively affected Starbucks stock. Today, it was trading down ~2.7% in premarket trading hours. Since the beginning of 2019, it’s fallen 0.3% as of its January 10 closing price. During the same period, its peers McDonald’s (MCD) and Dunkin’ Brands (DNKN) have returned 2.2% and 9.5%, respectively.

2019-01-14,"Did you hear that? That was the world's largest company, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), firing a warning shot about slowing growth in the world's hottest economy, China. Everyone heard the shot when it was first fired on January 2. Stocks across the board dropped. But now, less than two weeks later, everyone has seemingly forgotten about that warning shot, and stocks are in rally mode.

That's fair. Stocks, by and large, are undervalued, and other risk factors are improving, such as the Fed becoming more dovish and U.S.-China trade talks progressing nicely. But, China's economy is still cooling, and that's bad news for companies with broad exposure to China, regardless of how other risk factors are playing out.

One such company is retail coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). For all intents and purposes, due to dried up growth everywhere else, the Starbucks stock growth narrative is entirely centered around China. Given Apple's warning shot, that's a worrisome position to be in. Indeed, Goldman Sachs recently downgraded Starbucks stock to Neutral due to the company's broad exposure to the slowing China economy. Goldman actually warns that Starbucks could issue a warning like Apple about slowing growth in the near future.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Are Run By Billionaires 



Goldman hit the nail on the head with this downgrade. To warrant its current valuation, Starbucks stock needs everything to go right. But, because of Apple's warning, we know everything isn't going right in the most important region for the coffee giant.

Thus, the current valuation seems due for compression based on weakening growth trends, and that's reason enough to stay away from Starbucks stock in the near term.

### Worrisome Exposure To China

The core of the near-term bear thesis on Starbucks stock is that the company has a worrisome level of exposure to China, and that if growth in China falls apart, SBUX's long-term growth narrative will substantially weaken, causing the stock to drop meaningfully.

It's not all bad news in China, though. This is still a 6%-plus growth economy. And, while Apple recently issued a big warning about slowing growth in China, Nike (NYSE:NKE) announced two weeks prior that its China business was red hot.

My fear, however, is that Starbucks is on the Apple path in China, not the Nike path.

Over the past several quarters, Nike's business has been heating up globally. Apple's business has been cooling. So has Starbucks' business. Thus, Nike's ability to maintain strong growth in China is more a function of outstanding operational momentum than anything else. Starbucks doesn't have that. Instead, Starbucks is more comparable to Apple in that growth is positive, but slowing from its multi-year trend.

From this perspective, the present situation for Starbucks in China is most likely one defined by slowing growth. That's a big problem. Growth everywhere else is all dried up due to rising competition and saturation. Comparable sales growth in the U.S. has dropped from 5% and up a few years back, to 2% last year, with transaction volume actually down year-over-year. Europe, Middle East, and Africa comps have followed a similar trajectory, also with negative transaction volume growth last year.

Thus, the SBUX growth narrative is all about China. If China falls apart, so does this growth narrative, meaning that if China numbers are weak next quarter (as they should be), then Starbucks stock will drop meaningfully.

### Valuation Has Room To Fall

In relation to what is likely substantial sales pressure in China, the valuation on Starbucks stock is a tough pill to swallow.

Starbucks stock trades at 24x forward earnings. That's below the stock's five-year forward multiple of 25. But, the company is also growing much less quickly today than it has over the past five years. Thus, a lower valuation is warranted.

With respect to its peers, that 24 forward multiple actually seems stretched. The forward P/E multiple across the whole restaurant industry hovers right around 22. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) trades at 22x forward earnings. Dunkin' (NYSE:DNKN) trades at 23x forward earnings. Yum (NYSE:YUM), Jack In The Box (NASDAQ:JACK), and El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) all trade around 18 to 23x forward earnings.

Thus, relative to other mid-to-large cap restaurant names with fairly slow but stable growth, Starbucks stock still trades at a premium -- despite worrisome exposure to China. That means that if China's numbers do come in below expectations, SBUX stock could get hit by sizable valuation compression.

  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into 



### Bottom Line on SBUX Stock

Starbucks stock is a solid long-term holding given the company's staying power in a stable growth global retail coffee industry. But, at the present moment, the valuation seems overstretched with sizable operational risks on the horizon. That means the near to medium term outlook for this stock skews bearish, despite stable long term fundamentals.

2019-01-15,"Enormous volatility in shares of Mexican fast casual eatery Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has created tremendous buying and selling opportunities in Chipotle stock over the past year.

First, Chipotle stock fell to $250 in February 2018. That was an opportunity to buy. Then, CMG nearly doubled by August and eclipsed the $500 mark. That was the time to sell.

It fell all the way back nearly $400 by October. That was another buying opportunity. It rallied back to nearly $500 in December. Time to sell again. Then, it dropped to below $400, which was yet another opportunity to buy.

  * 8 Dividend Stocks With Growth on the Horizon 



Now, CMG has again rallied to above $500. This big rally above $500 will end no differently than prior similar rallies. It will inevitably fade. Quite simply, the fundamentals don't support a $500 price tag for Chipotle stock just yet, while the technicals indicate that the stock is overbought in the near term and due for a pullback.

In other words, this is another opportunity to sell the rally in Chipotle stock. Eventaully, CMG will rally above $500 and hold that level. But, not today. Today, this stock should ultimately fall back into the $400's relatively soon.

### Chipotle Has Healthy Drivers

When it comes to the qualitative growth narrative underlying Chipotle stock, you have some good and some bad.

On the good side, Chipotle's comparable sales growth trajectory is turning around and margins are finally rebounding. This is due to multiple company-specific initiatives that have reinvigorated growth. Namely, the company is aggressively expanding its presence in the digital food ordering and delivery market, which is a red hot market that is still growing by leaps and bounds.

Also, Chipotle is innovating on its menu for the first time in a long time. In so doing, the company is bringing in new customers through new items like diet lifestyle bowls.

Alongside these new innovations, the Chipotle brand has also finally developed a voice for itself through a unique &quot;Get Real&quot; marketing campaign that emphasizes the authenticity and uniqueness of Chipotle's food ingredients and preparation.

All of these developments are positive for Chipotle stock. They should drive continued positive comparable sales growth and margin expansion for the foreseeable future, and keep Chipotle relevant in the crowded quick service restaurant space.

### There Are Big Risks, Too

On the bad side, the crowded quick service restaurant(QSR) space is only getting more crowded.

McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), long known for producing what the public perceived as &quot;cheap&quot; food, is stepping up its game on the health front by rolling out fresh beef patties and eliminating antibiotics from its global supply chain.

Movements like these, which are happening everywhere and not just at McDonald's, somewhat erode Chipotle's moat as a unique fresh food QSR.

Also, the poke and acai bowl trends remain the fad in the healthy QSR space , meaning that Chipotle's burritos continue to lose share among health-oriented consumers. Wage pressures are also picking up, with inflation and wage growth hitting multi-year highs, and that's a major headwind for margins.

It's also worth mentioning that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making a big push in the QSR and convenience store space with cashier-less convenience stores, and that is a potential long term threat for Chipotle.

Overall, the Chipotle narrative has some good, and some bad. Above $500, Chipotle stock reflects just the good, and that makes the stock unnecessarily risky.

### Chipotle Stock Isn't Supported Above $500

When it comes to the fundamentals underlying CMG, they are, much like the narrative, a mixed bag.

Comparable sales growth trends are improving and running in the positive mid-single-digit range. But, all of that growth is from price hikes, not traffic growth. That isn't sustainable.

Eventually, price hikes will run their course. Once they do, comparable sales growth will normalize lower. They will likely settle in the low-single-digit range. LSD comps plus some unit expansion should drive ~7.5% revenue growth per year over the next several years.

Margins are trending higher. This will continue because they are rebounding from a depressed base. But, restaurant level margins are up only 170 basis points year-to-date to 19.3%.

I say &quot;only&quot; because, at their peak, RLMs were above 27%. Chipotle won't get back to those RLMs. Average unit volumes likely won't eclipse their previous peak, and even if they do, it will be because of price hikes and not traffic. If prices are going up, that usually means wages and other costs are going up, too. Thus, it's net neutral on the margin line.

Going forward, Chipotle is a company characterized by sub-10% revenue growth and mild margin expansion. In combination, that should realistically drive earnings per share to $30 by 2023. A restaurant average 22 forward multiple on that implies a fiscal 2022 price target of $660. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of just under $500.

Chipotle stock is currently above $500. Thus, the stock is already trading above a reasonable 12 month forward price target. That's an unfavorable position to be in, fundamentally speaking.

Also, due to the huge rally from below $400 to above $500 in about two weeks, CMG is entering technically overbought territory ahead of earnings. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the stock is above 70, or in overbought territory. The stock price is also more than 10% above its 50-day moving average, a large divergence which historically implies a near term peak.

### Bottom Line on CMG Stock

Long term, Chipotle stock will be just fine. But, in the near term, this stock is both fundamentally overvalued and technically overbought.

That combination implies a bearish outlook for CMG over the next few weeks, and I wouldn't be surprised to see this stock fall back into the $400's relatively soon.

2019-01-16,"The financial markets had a turbulent and volatile 2018, with many storylines and themes changing multiple times over the course of the year. But one financial market theme that remained constant through the volatility was a strong dollar.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, bottomed around 90 in early 2018 during global financial market turmoil. Over the rest of the year, the U.S. Dollar Index steadily gained towards the upper 90's, even amid the big selloff in late 2018.

This trend has changed course over the past month. Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index peaked around 98 in mid-December, and has since consistently fallen towards 95, its lowest level since October. Why? There's renewed optimism regarding a trade war resolution, and hope that while the global economy is slowing, it's not slowing as much as feared. Also, the Fed has grown increasingly dovish over the past few weeks, signalling fewer rate hikes than previously anticipated.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But a weaker dollar is good news for some companies, such as multinationals with significant overseas sales exposure and foreign stocks with mitigated sales exposure to the U.S. Many of these stocks were hampered by a strong dollar in 2018. But, if the dollar continues to weaken in 2019, these stocks could have room to run higher as a major headwind is removed from the equation.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



With this in mind, let's take a look at seven stocks to buy as the U.S. dollar weakens.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: McDonald's (MCD)

Source: Shutterstock 

At the top of the list is McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the multinational food giant which not only gets a majority of its revenue and profits from international markets, but whose international operations are also more profitable and growing faster. Therefore, as the dollar weakens and those businesses start to earn more in term of U.S. dollars, MCD stock should benefit.

Last year, roughly 65% of the company's total revenues and nearly 60% of total operating profits came from outside of the U.S. Moreover, comparable sales growth in the U.S. was just 3.6% last year, versus 5% and up overseas. Also, U.S. company operated margins hovered around 16% in 2017. International company operated margins were north of 17%.

Overall, as goes the international business, so goes McDonald's. Thus, as the international business becomes increasingly valuable against a weakening dollar, MCD stock should naturally rise.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Alibaba (BABA)

Source: Shutterstock 

The plunge in Chinese stocks started in early 2018, when the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the Chinese yuan. That strengthening diluted the value of U.S. listed Chinese stocks, and that dilution -- on top of concerns regarding weakening growth -- caused all Chinese stocks to drop in a big way. That included shares of Chinese internet giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).

But the fundamentals underlying Alibaba remain very strong. This is still the premiere e-commerce and cloud company in a 6%-plus growth economy supported by healthy demographic trends. Despite those tailwinds, the stock now trades at a rather anemic sub-30x forward multiple (revenues grew by over 50% last quarter).

All this stock needs to explode higher is a few good catalysts. One such catalyst is a weakening dollar. The other is positive progress on U.S.-China trade talks. Those two are tied together, and both are starting to move in favor of Alibaba. As such, now seems like as good a time as any for a big BABA stock around.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Baidu (BIDU)

Source: Shutterstock 

Another Chinese stock that plunged with a strengthening U.S. dollar but is now set to rebound as the dollar weakens is Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).

For those who are unaware, Baidu is the company behind China's leading search engine, and as such, is often called the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of China. As the Google of China, Baidu has established itself as the backbone of China's burgeoning internet economy. There have been some hiccups in the road, but the company has always successfully navigated around them and -- much like Google- - Baidu has found itself as a largely consistent 20%-plus revenue grower.

At current levels, BIDU stock is pretty cheap with a mere 15x forward multiple. Google trades at over 20x forward earnings, and Google is growing revenues at a slower clip than Baidu. Thus, the 15x forward multiple on BIDU stock doesn't make much sense and should ultimately be corrected with a few positive catalysts.

One such positive catalyst will be the weakening of the U.S. dollar. If dollar weakness persists and U.S.-China trade talks continue to make progress towards a resolution, BIDU stock could be in store for a major rally from multi-year lows.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Coca Cola (KO)

Source: Coca-Cola

One multinational giant that is set to benefit in a sizable way from U.S. dollar weakness is Coca Cola (NYSE:KO).

Much like McDonald's, most of Coca-Cola's revenues, profits, and growth come from international markets. Specifically, last year, only ~25% of the company's revenues came from North America. Presumably, most of that was from the United States. Still, at most, the U.S. represented just about 20% of Coca-Cola's total revenues in 2017. Roughly a third of operating profits came from North America, so maybe about 25% came from the U.S. Meanwhile, volume growth in North America was flat, while it was positive in some other international geographies.

Broadly speaking, then, the KO growth story is one led and driven by international growth. As the dollar weakens, that international growth becomes more valuable in terms of U.S. dollars, and the entire KO growth story becomes more valuable, too. As such, dollar weakness should lead to a KO stock rally.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Netflix (NFLX)

Source: Shutterstock 

Although this stock is often viewed as being in a different category than McDonald's and Coca Cola, streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) actually shares a few prominent parallels with the aforementioned consumer staples giants. Namely, all three are international driven growth stories that benefit from a weaker dollar.

Netflix is still growing by leaps and bounds in the U.S. But, the majority of the growth is happening outside of the U.S. Last quarter, the U.S. streaming business grew revenues by 25% with just over 1 million net ads. In contrast, the international streaming business grew revenues by nearly 50% with almost 6 million net ads. Also, when investors and analysts talk about how big Netflix can be, those discussions almost entirely revolve around the international market, since the consensus belief is that the U.S. market is nearing saturation.

Overall, Netflix is a multinational giant with an international driven growth story. As such, this company and stock are winners when the dollar weakens.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Tesla (TSLA)

Source: Tesla 

When talking about growth giants with international driven growth stories, streaming giant Netflix and electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fall into the same boat.

Tesla had a breakthrough back half of 2018 as the company achieved a sizable profit for the first time in several years -- and did so while accelerating Model 3 production and delivery to mainstream levels. But all those positive developments happened almost entirely on the domestic front. The Model 3 has yet to really scratch the surface internationally.

  * 5 Fallen-Angel Stocks That Have Been Oversold 



That will change in 2019. One of Tesla's biggest focus is producing and delivering Model 3 vehicles all around the world this year. As the company does this, the TSLA growth narrative will become increasingly internationally driven. The more internationally driven this growth narrative becomes, the more a weak dollar will help TSLA stock.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Weibo (WB)

Source: Shutterstock 

Back to the list of Chinese stocks to buy before they benefit from a weaker dollar. There is a lesser known but just as compelling Chinese stock: social-media giant Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).

Many investors and analysts like to call Weibo the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of China, given overlaps in the companies' core social media platforms. Those comparisons make sense. But, Weibo is much bigger (nearly 450 million monthly active users versus under 330 million at Twitter). Weibo is also growing more quickly (44% revenue growth last quarter, versus 29% at Twitter), and is more profitable (42% adjusted EBITDA margins last quarter, versus 39% at Twitter).

Despite Weibo being bigger, faster growing, and more profitable, Twitter stock is deemed more valuable and expensive by the market. Weibo has a $12 billion market cap. Twitter is valued at essentially twice that. Weibo stock trades at 17 forward earnings. Twitter's forward multiple is above 35.

Overall, Weibo stock is just way too cheap to ignore here. And all it will take for a rip-your-face-off rally is a few positive catalysts. A weakening U.S. dollar is one. Positive trade talks is another. Stabilizing economic growth in China is a third. If all those boxes get checked off, this stock could soar in a big way.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BIDU, GOOG, NFLX, TSLA, WB, and TWTR.

2019-01-22,"As the market has rallied the past few weeks, so have shares of retail coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). During this stretch, Starbucks stock is up 7%.

Things didn't look as good at the beginning of 2019. To kick off the year, one of the world's largest companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), fired a warning shot about rapidly slowing growth in China -- the world's hottest economy. Stocks broadly fell after that warning shot. But, it's been nothing but up, up, and away for markets since then. Following the Apple-led market selloff in early January, the S&P 500 has rallied an impressive 8% in under three weeks.

But while Starbucks is up nearly that much, SBUX investors shouldn't be forgetting the Apple warning shot so soon. To be frank, Starbucks stock should not have been part of the broad market rally in January. The reality is that Starbucks, much like Apple, is a company on a slowing growth trend with worrisome exposure to the slowing China economy. As such, first quarter numbers -- due after the bell on Thursday, January 24 -- won't be very good, and they will likely include an Apple-like warning about slowing China growth going forward.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider 



That negative update isn't priced into Starbucks stock. Thus, not only could Starbucks fall after Q1 earnings, but it could also fall by quite a bit.

All together, while Starbucks is a long-term growth company that will ultimately head higher in a multi-year window, caution is warranted on Starbucks stock ahead of Q1 earnings.

### The Numbers May Disappoint

Last quarter, Starbucks reported headline revenue and earnings beats with above-consensus comparable sales growth and a healthy guide. The theme of the conference call was that expansion in the China market would offset slowing growth in U.S. market, and reinvigorate the overall growth narrative. Investors rallied around that idea. Starbucks stock has done nothing but grind higher since then.

That puts Starbucks stock in a precarious position heading into Q1 earnings.

If anything has become clear since the last earnings report, it is that the Chinese economy is dramatically cooling off. Apple cut its quarterly guide in a big way due to slowing growth in China. China reported 6.6% GDP growth in 2018, the lowest annual pace in nearly 30 years. Q4 GDP growth was 6.4%, the slowest quarterly pace since the Financial Crisis. Other economic data coming out of China has been weak, including retail-sales growth rates hovering at 15 year lows.

This is all bad news for Starbucks stock. The core of the near term bull thesis on SBUX is that China growth is going to pave a brighter future for this company, which has struggled with slowing growth over the past several years.

But, that probably isn't happening yet. It's highly unlikely that Starbucks is bucking the broader China economic trend and putting up strong numbers in China. As such, China numbers this quarter will likely disappoint. If they do, the numbers globally will disappoint, too. Also, the tone on the conference call may be Apple-like, and include warnings about slowing growth going forward.

Overall, Starbucks is heading into an earnings report which has the potential to be pretty bad. That isn't a favorable setup for Starbucks stock, especially at current valuation levels.

### The Valuation Doesn't Incorporate Disappointment

At the end of the day, it always comes down to numbers and valuation. For example, despite significant sales pressure in China, Apple stock is a buy here because it's trading at just 12x forward earnings, and is priced for all the bad news.

That isn't true for Starbucks stock. Despite facing significant sales pressure in China like Apple, Starbucks stock doesn't trade at 12x forward earnings. Instead, it still trades at 25x forward earnings.

That is simply too big of a multiple for Starbucks stock. The whole restaurant industry trades at 22x forward earnings. Other major players in the quick service restaurant space like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Dunkin' (NYSE:DNKN), Yum(NYSE:YUM), Jack In The Box (NASDAQ:JACK) and El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) all trade around 18 to 23x forward earnings.

In the past, Starbucks stock warranted a premium valuation because of higher quality growth. That is no longer the case today. Comparable sales growth last quarter was just 3%. That is largely an industry average comparable sales growth rate (McDonald's was up above 4% last quarter, and Yum was at 2%). Thus, this is no longer a higher quality growth company, meaning the stock no longer deserves its premium valuation. Compression to the norm valuation across the QSR space implies ~10% valuation downside risk.

### Bottom Line on SBUX Stock

In the long term, Starbucks stock is a winner, powered by global brand leadership in the steady growth coffee retail industry. But, in the near term, Starbucks stock seems due for a correction as it rallies into an earnings report that will likely disappoint due to slowing China growth.

As such, near term caution is warranted. But, post-earnings pullbacks towards the $60 level could quickly turn into buying opportunities.

This morning the stock is down 1.5%, which could be partly due to the headline or as a reaction to Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) bad earnings news. Last year, there were rumors about this, yet the stock did relatively well. But the reaction is always different when the actual news comes out.

That aside, Starbucks is doing well of late. SBUX stock is up 17.6% in a year while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) is down 8.4%. Starbucks has had its fair share of worries but most were around their throughput. Their critics complained about the long lines, which is a good problem to have for any retailer.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Last year there were fears stemming from Starbucks' China markets but those, too, are subsiding. Admittedly, this may change in early March if the two countries don't come to terms or kick the can on the deadline. Otherwise, SBUX stock is a proven performer and deserves the benefit of the doubt.

  * 10 of the Best Stocks to Invest In for February 



But that is nothing new to me. I've been a long time fan of Starbucks stock. But for a long while, it was stuck inside a wide horizontal range with hard resistance around $61 per share. Last November's earnings report changed that -- SBUX stock spiked by $10 to reach $68 per share.

Then, on this most recent earnings report, SBUX shrugged off headline concerns, and the important thing about this is that it's defending the neckline from where it finally broke out.

So is it too late to chase it? No.

When a stock spends months consolidating inside a range then breaks out of it, that range will serve as forward support. So the bulls will have a good base on where to build higher levels. All that management has to do is continue to deliver on plans.

Just recently, Starbucks announced that it partnered with Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) to perk up its delivery service in China, which is a huge opportunity market for SBUX. Clearly, they are not afraid to seek alliances where they see fit. This is a heads-up management team even after the recent change in the C-Suite. Hopefully, Howard Schultz's political aspirations won't cause any blow-back to the stock.

While it was stuck below $61 per share I sold put options on dips to create income but now I can hold the stock outright for the long-term. Those who want to invest in a basket of solid fundamentals ought to consider SBUX stock.

This year, SBUX stock is off to a good start in spite of a shaky knee-jerk reaction to the earnings headline. So there could be sellers still lurking especially if the general markets correct in the next few days. This is a potentially violent week from several angles.

We have almost $200 billion in potential market capitalization that could move from this week's earnings, especially leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But so far the bulls have prevailed in times of uncertainty in 2019. I expect that to continue as I doubt that all mega-cap stocks will disappoint investors this week.

The Starbucks-specific earnings headline has passed for SBUX, so from here it will move with the general markets but inside its own range of prices. So I expect the recent lows to hold and they, too, will be buying opportunities.

So to guard against the potential dips, I would start with a partial position just so I can leave room for adding, in case equity markets fade a little. In the long run, SBUX will continue its growth strategy and build upon its cash cow. The immediate sentiment threat that we had last year is dead. This year while we've had a few stints of fear, they have not had follow-through selling.

Those who are looking to invest in a stable of staple companies for the long-term should consider SBUX. Trading in and out of it will likely be more work than benefit unless someone plans on actively trading and using options. So the idea is to enter the stock with the confidence that management has proven itself worthy and that they will deliver on their plans for years to come. The world is addicted to Starbucks' coffee, and it's a cash cow upon which it can expand into other income streams.

### Bottom Line on SBUX Stock

Fundamentally, Starbucks stock is priced in line with other mega consumer retailers like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Costco (NASDAQ:COST). This is to say that it's not susceptible to an obvious correction from a bloated state. Buying it here for the long-term carries no undue risk.

In summary, SBUX is a great American company on a global expansion mission. It has proven management and a strong opinion on Wall Street. So my worry is that it sounds too easy. But I will always be comfortable taking risks on solid fundamentals.

I reiterate the short term potential risk stemming from the political headline threats into mid-March. So patience and sizing are important here even if the SBUX story is strong on its own.

In three weeks, U.S. politicians will fight it out again over the government budgets and the spending limit. This is in addition to the drama over the China tariff war.

Despite all the pundit noise and hate, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still a wonderful place to find great stocks and big-time dividends. The thirty Dow Jones stocks are still powerhouses in their respective fields and feature enviable moats, large cash flows and big-time profits. With the Dow 30, you really are getting the top dogs of America's economic landscape.

There's a reason why nearly $20.2 billion still sits in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA), and that's because the index remains a pretty solid collection of blue-chip stocks.

### Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)

For heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), a few years is the difference between being cast aside as a relic, touching record highs and being cast aside again.

A few years ago, CAT suffered as slowing growth in China and the rest of the world decreased demand for bulldozers, backhoes, and other construction/farm equipment. Shares of the Dow Jones stock were basically left for dead. Then, global growth returned, and CAT stock managed to eke out major gains.

Now, however, CAT stock has taken a beating as it again warns of slowing global growth. Despite this, CAT stock remains a strong buy, and this could be seen as a buy-the-dip moment. Caterpillar's fortunes will eventually return, and the analyst consensus is for double-digit share growth over the next 12 months.

In the end, a return to global growth will be a boon for Caterpillar and its bottom line. That said, be wary of timing the market with an entry into CAT stock, especially if you don't have the cash on hand to hold for the long-term.

### Nike Inc. (NKE)

When you own the dominant and most iconic brands in your operating market, you must be doing something right. That swoosh has made Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) investors plenty of coin over the years. Up nearly 20% in the past year, the good times could keep rolling in 2019. The reason is two-fold.

First, Nike has gone gangbusters on its Consumer Direct Offense Initiative. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor Luke Lango highlights the move as an aggressive push to become more fashion forward. That should help it drive sales beyond its core athletic gear market and take away market share from rivals like Adidas AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:ADDYY).

Second, Nike has taken its product directly to the consumer. Nike has pushed hard into e-commerce and direct selling to get an edge and boost revenues per purchase.

### Wal-Mart (WMT)

Retail isn't dead. Sector kingpin Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) has just had its best year since the dot-com days. More could be in store for the Dow Jones stock. That's because Walmart continues to dominate in online sales.

Walmart has gone all-in for e-commerce to keep up with the increase in online shopping. This push has included buying Jet.com and a whole host of smaller shopping sites, adding additional online shipping/pickup options and beefing up the number of SKUs on Walmart.com. And these efforts seem to be working. Online sales metrics have really begun to add up at Wally World.

And the innovation continues.

Walmart just announced that it is unveiling a new scan and go app that will allow customers to avoid the lines by bleeping their own barcodes while shopping and paying for items before they leave. Aside from sticking it Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the move will allow WMT to reduce its biggest cost -- labor.

That means more money for dividends for WMT shareholders ahead.

### McDonald's Corp. (MCD)

Compared to 2017, the Golden Arches have dulled somewhat. In 2017, McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD) was one of the best performing Dow Jones stocks, finding a lift from its all-day breakfast, menu simplification and sped-up drive-thru lines. But with MCD stock in the red by 3% this year, there's some analysts that see MCD stock rallying by double digits over the next 12 month. That said, it's likely that the real win for MCD could still come. McDonald's is going back to its roots as a cheap source of calories and bringing back the dollar menu.

With higher-end burger joints like Shake Shack (NASDAQ:SHAK) and Five Guys killing it, MCD's is refocusing on its core consumer once again. And that's people who want to spend a buck on a burger. The fast-food restaurant chain has announced plans to bring back its dollar menu and launch other value-priced offerings. While margins here can be thin, the name of the game is revenues.

And with McDonald's looking at adding more kiosk and mobile ordering to its stores, like previous pick Walmart, the company could reduce one of the biggest costs for its franchises.

### Pfizer Inc. (PFE)

The past year has been a relatively good year for pharmaceutical giant Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE). PFE stock is up 1% over the past year, compared to the 17% rout in the SPDR S&P Biotech (NYSEARCA:XBI). The reason? The tax plan. Pfizer has been struggling with its high tax rate. In fact, the pharma attempted to buy AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE:AZN) and Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) in order to be able to &quot;move&quot; to Europe and lower their corporate tax rate.

Pfizer currently has one of the largest U.S. corporate cash piles offshore -- roughly $160 billion. After the Republican tax plan takes effect, Pfizer will be able to bring that money into the U.S. -- and spend it -- at a much lower tax rate.

That's huge news for investors.

As Pfizer sees a huge influx of capital, the dividends, buybacks and M&A activity is set to explode at the firm.

And the company is not waiting. Pfizer has already boosted its dividend by 6% to 34 cents per share and announced an additional $10 billion in buybacks. That's on top of its current $6.4 billion buyback program currently underway.

All of this means just one thing: PFE stock will continue to rocket in 2019 as these programs take hold. As a result, Pfizer could be one of the best Dow Jones stocks to hold in the new year.

As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-29,"Despite the broader market volatility since October 2018, on Nov. 29, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) reached a 52-week high of $190.88. MCD is expected to report earnings on Jan. 30, 2019, before market open. Although there might be weakness in the MCD stock price going into the earnings, I regard the company -- globally recognized as &quot;the Golden Arches&quot; -- as a core consumer staples holding for a well-diversified portfolio.

McDonald's operates in the fragmented food service industry, which includes competitors like Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM). It has over 36,000 restaurants in over 100 countries.

Company management defines the primary competition as the informal eating out (&quot;IEO&quot;) segment, which includes &quot;quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, cafes, 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias, and juice/smoothie bars.&quot; Despite the fierce competition in the (IEO) segment, MCD remains one of the most popular brands in the world.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As one of the largest fast food chains around the globe, over 90% of the restaurants are currently franchised. The franchising business gives McDonald's a significant competitive edge as the initial franchise fees and on-going royalties mean high margins. Its operating margins now stand around a healthy 30%. As the franchisees carry the operating costs and business risks, McDonald's does not have to worry about the expenses of running those operations.

  * 10 Triple-A Stocks to Buy in February 



Even more importantly, the group collects rent from the franchisees as the company owns most of the properties where the restaurants operate. It leases those out to the franchisees, often at significant markups. It may not be wrong to say that the company is in real estate business as much as food services.

### Robust Fundamentals

McDonald's latest earnings results on Oct. 23 came in better than expected. Management gave an upbeat outlook on long-term profitability and credited the increase in global comparable sales with the strength of the numbers. Despite the slowing of U.S. sales, McDonald's stock has benefited from international growth. Management believes that the value deals to be implemented in the McDonald's menu globally, but especially in the U.S., will help increase sales numbers.

Going forward, if the Federal Reserve Board (FED) stops increasing the short-term interest rates, there is likely to be continued weakness in the value of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis other major currencies. I expect McDonald's earnings to benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar as a significant amount of the earnings come from overseas. When MCD converts its foreign currency income into a weaker dollar, its bottom-line increases. Better profit margins, in return, mean a higher MCD stock price as well as higher dividend payments.

As part of its efforts to improve shareholder value, McDonald's has been increasing dividend payments since its first-ever dividend payment in 1976. On Dec. 17, MCD paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.16 per share, to shareholders of record on Dec. 3. The current dividend yield stands at over 2.5%.

### Long-Term Technical Analysis

Over the past year, McDonald's stock is up 4.7%. The stock's 52-week price range has been $146.84 (Mar. 2, 2018) -- $190.88 (Nov. 29, 2018).

Those investors who pay attention to long-term moving averages should note that the technical message is a &quot;buy,&quot; while oscillators are giving a wider range of &quot;neutral-to-buy&quot; readings. I believe the current long-term positive momentum in MCD stock will continue in the months to come. Within the year, I expect MCD stock to break and stay over the lower $190's level and even test the $200 level.

### What Could Derail MCD Stock in the Short Term?

Since the record Christmas Eve decline in the broader markets, most stocks have had impressive comebacks. And the past month has been profitable for McDonald's shareholders, too. Therefore a slight pullback toward the higher $170's level might still occur in MCD stock during the rest of the week as the company gets ready to release quarterly results.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy With High ESG Momentum 



Its short-term support is at $179 and long-term support is at $167. Yet such price weakness before or right after the McDonald's earnings would offer investors an even better entry point.

### The Bottom Line on McDonald's Stock

I believe that a new leg up in the MCD stock price will be coming in 2019. However, as prudent investors, it is always crucial to maintain a definite risk/return profile. Thus, if the company does not report well on Jan. 30, McDonald's stock might be stuck in a range between $170 and $190 for several weeks.

McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) starts off its earnings report for the fourth quarter of the year with earnings per share of $1.97. This is up from the company's earnings per share of $1.71 from the same period of the year prior. It was also good news for MCD stock by beating out Wall Street's earnings per share estimate of $1.89 for the quarter.

Net income reported in the McDonald's earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at $1.42 billion. This is better than the company's net income of $698.70 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The McDonald's earnings report for the fourth quarter of the year also includes operating income of $2.00 billion. The fast food chain's operating income reported during the same time last year was $2.14 billion.

McDonald's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 also saw the company bringing in revenue of $5.16 billion. This is a decrease from the company's revenue of $5.34 billion reported in the fourth quarter of the previous year. It also just missed analysts' revenue estimate of $5.17 billion for the period, which is likely what is keeping MCD stock from rising more today.

Not every name was swept up in the broad market's bullish swing, however. AT&T (NYSE:T) fell 4.3% after reporting lackluster quarterly results.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Welcome to earnings seasons.

Headed into Thursday's trading, it's the stock charts of Mcdonald's (NYSE:MCD), Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that look like the best potential opportunities, mostly because they're not dishing out the wild swings that turn trades into coin tosses.

### Facebook (FB)

In the middle of this month, Facebook shares were toying with a break above a technical ceiling around $146.30. That ended up happening, the very next day in fact, although another resistance line quickly stepped in to once again bar the rally effort.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



Thanks to the pre-earnings rally, though, bolstered by the post-close gains in response to impressive fourth quarter numbers, FB stock has broken above a major short-term resistance level and widened the distance between it and the ceiling it smashed five weeks ago.

  
Click to Enlarge • The 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray, was the resistance level causing trouble of late, but Facebook pushed above it yesterday.

• Though it didn't break to new multiweek highs during regular market hours, shares were trading around $162 in after-hours action. That's well above the last of the remaining near-term ceilings around $151.50, plotted with a yellow dashed line.

• The weekly chart shows recent bullishness is actually just an extension of the rebound that took shape late last year and in the first week of this year. The falling resistance line that had guided it lower since the middle of last year was cleared, and for the most part the buyers didn't look back.

### Mcdonald's (MCD)

With just a quick glance, the 0.22% setback Mcdonald's shares suffered on Wednesday was nothing. Although the market was up and MCD wasn't, shares of the restaurant giant have been strong performers of late. Things happen.

A closer examination of the bar Mcdonald's shares left behind yesterday, however, is merited, as it suggests a major shift in how investors now see the stock.

  
Click to Enlarge • The deep low and wild high were clearly, visibly unusual, but it's also a red flag. Wild intraday swings often indicate a rethinking from investors. The volume spike suggests the same.

• Zooming out to the weekly chart we gain some perspective on what's taking shape here. MCD is still overbought from the November surge.

• Although the bar -- called a doji -- hints of a pivot, it's not perfectly clear which direction the pivot is pointed. If it's lower, that will be confirmed by a move back below the blue 20-day moving average line and the purple 50-day moving average line in the very near future.

### Align Technology (ALGN)

Finally, yesterday's 4.9% jump from Align Technology shares was well above average, but hardly jaw-dropping. The stock is still much closer to recently-hit 52-week lows than it is 52-week highs.

But, the shape and placement of yesterday's bar from ALGN is telling in and of itself. Wednesday's action looks like it could have been the much-needed jolt out of a rut and back into a recovery.

  
Click to Enlarge • The initial reaction to Align's fourth-quarter numbers was a bearish open, below Tuesday's close. But, by the time the closing bell rang, ALGN was well above the prior day's high. This &quot;engulfing&quot; bar indicates a sweeping change in sentiment.

• Bolstering the bullish argument is the massive volume behind the decent gain. Many traders have been waiting in the wings to become buyers.

• Beckoning the stock higher from here is the gap that was left behind with October's plunge. The upper boundary of that gap is around $289.50, though there's a potential ceiling at $235.60 that needs to be cleared first.

2019-02-04,"Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) has made a deal with hedge fund Starboard Value aiming to take it out of the orbit of founder John Schnatter. Starboard agreed to take a hefty slice of Papa John's, as much as 20%, and seek a new strategic direction. Starboard Value CEO Jeffrey Smith is now chairman of the pizza chain's board, and former Pinnacle Entertainment CEO Anthony Sanfilippo has been added, along with CEO Steve Ritchie.

Starboard is investing an initial $200 million, with a convertible option of $50 million more, half of which will be used to reduce debt and half of which will be used in the business. PZZA stock had a market cap of $1.21 billion on Feb. 1, but rallied more than 10% on the news -- a gain nearly equal to the value of Starboard's investment.

### Bye, Papa

Papa John's has been going nowhere fast ever since the highly publicized fall last year of former CEO, and founder, John Schnatter, who was accused of creating a toxic culture at the company, running the publicly traded corporation as personal property.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

On the way out, Schnatter sabotaged his company's corporate image by verbally attacking NFL Players over political protests, quitting the chain's lucrative NFL sponsorship deal and cursing in company conference calls, which had the chain accused of racism and ultra-right politics.

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



Since leaving, Schnatter has been trying to regain control. The board publicly rejected Schnatter's latest bid, while accepting the Starboard offer.

Schnatter's offer of cash was identical to Starboard's, but the company decided the man who had once been ubiquitous on its TV commercials, as well as its CEO had become toxic, especially after he sued the company following his resignation.

### Papa John's Stock and the Decisions to Come

The value of PZZA stock is now down by half from its late 2016 high while those of rival chains like Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) have soared. Even with the Feb. 4 pop, Papa John's is still selling at a discount to its annual sales, while rival chains sell at many times their sales volume.

Ritchie, who began running daily operations in 2014 and was named CEO in January 2018, then became the target of a Schnatter campaign to fire him by the summer, seems to be the key winner in this deal.

A release from the new management was short on details for how they might turn the company around, other than by making better pizza. The big opportunity here might be Papa John's international push, which by the end of 2017 had one-third of the chain operating outside the U.S.

### The Bottom Line on PZZA Stock

If Papa John's follows the Domino's playbook, and it's one many other pizza chain operators are trying to follow, it will now expand the menu, launch new technology and delivery initiatives, and possibly redesign the stores with help from franchisees.

  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy 



Doing all that, however, will require cooperation from Schnatter, who still owns 30% of the company, and very likely the hiring of an outsider as CEO, possibly from a rival chain like Domino's, Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) or even McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) as CEO.

Starboard could also seek to sell the company, either to one of those firms or Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), since the owners of Burger King and Tim Horton's don't yet have a pizza chain. Other potential buyers might be Inspire Brands, owner of Arby's, or JAB Holding Group, the German company that has been buying up breakfast chains like Caribou, Einstein's Bagels and Krispy Kreme.

Either way, if the company can just put a period on the Schnatter era, Papa John's stock is cheap enough to rise substantially from here.

2019-02-07,"Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) again confirmed it remains on a growth path in its fourth-quarter earnings report. The Denver-based restaurant chain handily beat revenue estimates. It also came in ahead of expectations when accounting for one-time costs. This sent Chipotle stock surging higher in morning trading.CMG stock has put the health-related scares behind it. Customers have returned to the stores, and growth rates remain elevated. However, given its momentum and lofty valuation, investors should consider selling into this news. Chipotle Stock Beat Revenue, Adjusted Earnings EstimatesFor the fourth quarter, the company reported income of $1.15 per share. That amounts to a decline from the same quarter last year when CMG earned $1.55 per share. However, when one-time costs such as store closures and restructuring are not included, earnings came in at $1.72 per share. This figure exceeded consensus estimates of $1.37 per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCMG also earned $1.23 billion in revenue during the quarter. This beat analyst expectations of $1.194 billion and showed a 10.4% increase from last year's levels. Comparable sales grew by 6.1% over the same period.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond Traders reacted favorably to this news as Chipotle stock rose by nearly 15% in morning trading. As a result, CMG stock trades at its highest level since the E. coli scare of 2015 began a steep decline in the stock. At that time, multiple stories calling the restaurant chain's cleanliness into question hammered CMG. Over the following two years, investors would see the stock lose almost two-thirds of its value.However, Chipotle stock finally began its turnaround in late 2017. Since that time, it has more than doubled in value. As a result, concerns have shifted from health scares to multiples. Seeing the stock around the $600 per share could lead to questions about whether the move higher has run its course. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has risen to around 50, while the current P/E has risen above 88. Growth, Issues Don't Justify the Current MultipleCMG has traditionally traded at high multiples. Moreover, the expected profit growth of 40.3% for fiscal 2019 could help justify such a forward P/E ratio. However, analysts expect profit growth will average 27.2% in the coming years. While still impressive, it may not justify its current valuation.Furthermore, the health scares of a few years ago still weigh on investor's minds.  They may trust their local Chipotle enough to keep eating there. Still, they might feel that a scare at a different Chipotle could inspire another round of selling in the equity. I do not see another decline of over 65% in CMG's future. However, it could easily make investors think twice about paying a premium valuation when another health scare could loom over Chipotle stock.Also, as our own Luke Lango points out, competition also looms over the stock. The trend toward healthy fast food has driven many to choose Chipotle over fast food Mexican restaurants such as Taco Bell, a YUM! Brands (NYSE:YUM) restaurant. However, with even McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) embracing healthier ingredients, Chipotle's peers could take more of its business.Prospective buyers need to keep CMG's problems into perspective. Customers returned to Chipotle despite the health scares. Moreover, few restaurant chains benefit from 27% long-term growth forecasts. If Chipotle stock falls back, investors should consider buying. Still, at more than 88 times current earnings, investors should look elsewhere right now. Concluding Thoughts on Chipotle StockDespite CMG's high growth and robust sales, stockholders should consider selling Chipotle stock. To be sure, the health issues of previous years appeared to stop weighing on the stock in late 2017. Since then, CMG stock has more than doubled in value.However, a high valuation coupled with increased competition could make sustaining this momentum difficult. Moreover, consumers may still hold more trust in their neighborhood Chipotle than on the company at large. While that may not hurt company revenue, it could easily make investors think twice about paying a premium price for Chipotle stock. Considering the company's history as well as the pricey multiple, investors should do their thinking twice now, not later.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-02-12,"Howard Schultz may be under the biggest presidential delusion since Herbert Hoover's re-election run -- but that doesn't mean the company he founded is suffering.  * 10 Stocks That Every 20-Year-Old Should Buy <strong>Howard Schultz</strong>Since the start of the year, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock is up 7.4%. Shares that were trading near $50 in August are now trading near $70.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn its most recent quarterly report, sales were up 9% year over year, comparable store sales were up 4%, operating margins were 22% in the Americas and, in China, sales were up 18%. Net income came in at $760.6 million, 61 cents per share, on revenue of $6.63 billion. Other than uniting voters against him, this may be Schultz' most impressive achievement. Since stepping down as SBUX executive chairman last summer, the company hasn't missed him. A Stronger FranchiseIt's a stark contrast to Schultz' first retirement, in 2000, when he was forced to swoop in and rescue the company. He closed all stores for three hours to retrain the staff, then set a new strategy, clearing out the executive suite.This time, his long-term strategy of technology, geographic expansion, and huge Roastery stores seems to be working. CEO Kevin Johnson is a former Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) executive and he has moved the company decisively away from the Schultz &quot;personality cult&quot; into a sustainable franchise whose China operations have even growth investors interested. Starbucks now has four women on its board, most recently COO Rosalind Brewer, and enough self-confidence to feel it can beat a Chinese Starbucks clone called Luckin, even while Luckin considers itself a U.S. IPO.  This Should Not BeGiven the growing competition, Starbucks stock should not be doing this well.Coffee has been discovered by Wall Street to be as potent an ingredient as sugar -- something you can buy for a few bucks per pound and get hundreds of dollars for in the form of finished drinks.Germany's Riemann family, through JAB Holding, has been buying up every non-Starbucks breakfast joint it can find, doing a partial spin-out of Keurig, as Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE:KDP), to bring public investors into the party. Brazil's 3G Capital bought Tim Horton's, the Canadian chain, as part of their Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR).The woods are also still full of new coffee entrepreneurs and there are thousands of one-off stores, including many that have managed to extend their hours with beer, wine, and even music, in ways Starbucks failed at.Starbucks has changed America as no restaurant chain has since McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Schultz is the founder (even if he didn't found it).All this continues to fuel the fire of Starbucks bears, who insist the company is slowing down despite a lack of evidence. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded Starbucks recently, with a price target lower than its February 8 opening bid of $69.14. The Bottom Line on Starbucks StockHoward Schultz is a divisive character, even in his hometown of Seattle. Like a figure in an Aaron Sorkin screenplay, he's a man convinced of his own righteousness, even while he appears out of step with the times.So while your barista insists &quot;Howard doesn't work here anymore&quot;, take a moment to admire what he built, and what continues to build there. Starbucks packaged coffee products now have global distribution, and I have been guilty of pounding the table, for the stock during its recent run-up. At its current price Starbucks is fully valued, at nearly 31 times trailing earnings. But the dividend is fully backed by profits and pays 2.1%. It has risen 50% over the last five years.  * 7 Forever Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains You may be criticized if you bet on &quot;Schultz for President,&quot;  but you're not stupid to own this stock.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-02-20,"The stock market's recession fears are in the rearview mirror. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up 11%, and it's up nearly 20% from its Christmas Eve 2018 lows, as the big risks in late 2018 (stalling trade talks, a hawkish Federal Reserve and slowing economic growth) have all dramatically improved in early 2019.Restaurant stocks have been front-and-center of the bounce-back rally in stocks. That's because as big economic risks have faded, consumers have regained their strength, and the whole restaurant industry has benefited from higher traffic. Indeed, despite adverse weather conditions, comparable sales growth across the entire restaurant industry came in at a two-year high in the December/January period, according to TDn2K.Consequently, restaurant stocks have been in rally mode. Not all of them will remain so for the rest of 2019, however. Instead, as the year rolls on, industry-wide tailwinds will cool, and there will be a big divergence between winners and losers in this industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Smart Money Stocks to Buy Now With that in mind, let's take a look at seven restaurant stocks to watch in 2019, and try to pick out the winners in this group. Restaurant Stocks to Watch: McDonald's (MCD)Stance: BullishAnalysis: At the top of the list of restaurant stocks to watch in 2019 is global fast casual giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).The story here is simple. Over the past several years, McDonald's has reinvented itself to be more relevant to today's health-conscious consumers. That included revamping the menu, improving product quality and expanding product assortment. In so doing, McDonald's has improved relevance and popularity, while sustaining industry-wide low prices and high convenience. The net result has been robust comparable sales growth.This will continue. McDonald's is continuing to revamp its menu, including swapping out frozen patties for fresh patties, and as these initiatives continue to roll out, the numbers here will remain good. Meanwhile, the valuation on MCD stock is reasonable and in line with its long-term average. As such, upward and outward is the most likely path forward for MCD stock in 2019. Chipotle (CMG)Stance: BearishAnalysis: Second on this list is Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), the restaurant chain which has come back from the dead to once again become a Wall Street (and Main Street) favorite.Right now, everyone on Wall Street is applauding Chipotle's new growth initiatives, including delivery expansion, menu innovation and new marketing campaigns. These initiatives are good, and they are working. Comparable sales growth has been consistently positive and impressive. Margins are moving higher. Profits are rising. Everything is going right for Chipotle.  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth But the valuation more than reflects these positives, and importantly ignores competition risks. Namely, Chipotle isn't what it used to be, nor will it ever be again. The healthy food trend has passed the company up, and now all the craze is about unique sushi, poke bowls, superfood cafes and fresh sandwich shops. Thus, while growth will remain good going forward, it won't ever become good enough to warrant a nearly 50x forward multiple on CMG stock, meaning the next move in this stock will likely be lower. Yum (YUM)Stance: NeutralAnalysis: Next up is global fast casual giant Yum (NYSE:YUM), the parent company of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut.The fundamentals here are pretty good. Taco Bell is on fire, and has been for a long time due to favorable millennial appeal. KFC is doing just fine as well. Pizza Hut is finally returning to growth after several bad quarters. Meanwhile, the company is re-franchising essentially all of its locations and turning into an asset-light, hugely profitable, money-making machine. This re-franchising does kill revenues, but the revenue slicing is like getting rid of all the unwanted fat. Profits are consequently moving higher.All of this will continue for the foreseeable future. You will get steady and healthy comparable sales and bottom line growth. But, the valuation underlying YUM stock seems to already reflect that, with the forward P/E multiple at a multiyear high approaching 25 and the trailing dividend yield at a multiyear low of 1.8%. As such, the valuation seems full, meaning that the strong fundamentals won't drive that much more upside in YUM stock. Yum China (YUMC)Stance: NeutralAnalysis: Any discussion of Yum would be incomplete without talking about its Chinese counterpart, Yum China (NYSE:YUMC).At its core, Yum China is at the heart of a still very healthy China restaurant growth narrative. For all intents and purposes, China remains a double-digit consumption growth economy thanks to urbanization and digitization tailwinds, while the dining market remains a high single-digit growth sector of that red-hot economy, powered by deeper digital penetration and robust unit growth (restaurants per capita in China remain well below the developed country norm).  * 10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market's Blitz Higher Because of this, Yum China will remain a big revenue and profit grower over the next several years. Ultimately, those healthy fundamentals will push YUMC stock higher. But, at current levels (nearly a 25x forward earnings while it sits near 52-week highs), YUMC stock seems more than priced for big growth to persist. As such, valuation will cap upside in the near term. Restaurant Stocks to Watch: Starbucks (SBUX)Stance: BearishAnalysis: Another restaurant stock worth watching in 2019 is global coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), mostly because the stock appears to be out over its skis at the current moment.In the big picture, Starbucks is a stable growth company that has been, still is and will remain the leader of the global retail coffee game. But competitors are chipping away at that leadership position. Namely, indie coffee shops are stealing away trend-oriented consumers, while McDonald's and other fast casual giants are stealing away price-oriented consumers. Thus, while Starbucks will remain the leader in the breakfast drink category, the company will lose share in this market for the foreseeable future.The net result will be slower-than-normal revenue and profit growth. The reason that's a problem for SBUX stock is that it isn't priced for slower-than-normal growth. Instead, SBUX stock has a bigger-than-normal valuation at around 26 forward earnings. This convergence of slower-than-normal growth and a bigger-than-normal valuation will ultimately result in SBUX stock falling later in 2019. Domino's Pizza (DPZ)Stance: NeutralAnalysis: One restaurant stock that investors should pay close attention to given its secular attachment to the delivery aspect of the food industry is Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ).For a long time, Domino's and other pizza chains were the only game in town when it came to fast food delivery. Thus, the delivery tailwind and the mainstream emergence of the stay-at-home economy was a big positive for this company. But, then food ordering platforms like Postmates and Door Dash democratized delivery services. Now, essentially every fast food chain has delivery capability.  * Should You Buy, Sell, Or Hold These 7 Medical Cannabis Stocks? This has leveled the playing field in the delivery game, and neutralized a big advantage Domino's had over its peers. Nonetheless, management continues to do everything right to keep growth on track, and the company is also benefiting from persistent struggles at Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA). Thus, in the big picture, growth remains good here -- it will just slow going forward. Good but slower growth seems appropriately priced in here, at 29x forward earnings (in line with its long term average multiple). Dave & Buster's (PLAY)Stance: BullishAnalysis: Last but not least on this list of restaurant stocks to watch is multi-entertainment destination Dave & Buster's (NASDAQ:PLAY).I'm bullish on PLAY stock for one simple reason: the company is perfectly aligned to win as we increasingly shift towards an experience-oriented consumer economy. Long story short, consumers are increasingly valuing experiences over products, and consumption expenditure growth on experiences has significantly outpaced consumption expenditure growth on products over the past few years. Dave & Buster's is at the heart of this transition by offering a multi-entertainment experience that includes a restaurant, sports bar and arcade.Over time, consumers will continue to place greater emphasis on experiences. The net result will be more share of wallet allocated to Dave & Buster's. That will push revenues, margins and profits higher, which will ultimately drive PLAY stock to new highs over time.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD and PLAY.

2019-02-21,"I've been bearish on Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock for some time now. That skepticism looked prescient a year ago, when SBUX stock touched its lowest levels in almost three years. Since then, however, Starbucks stock has soared: SBUX at the moment trades near its all-time high.Source: Shutterstock Despite the volatility of the stock, Starbucks' outlook doesn't seem to have changed all that much. Starbucks' business is up there with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) as one of the best in the world.But the valuation of SBUX stock has been worrisome for a long time, and SBUX is facing meaningful risks. By placing a huge bet on China, SBUX has made a wager that looks increasingly dicey as the economy in that emerging market shows signs of slowing down. Meanwhile, the same-store sales and traffic growth of Starbucks' U.S. business has slowed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability While SBUX stock has gained a whopping 50% from its late-June lows, its risks persist. In fact, several of those risks were highlighted in the company's first-quarter results last month that helped push Starbucks stock to its current highs. Given those concerns, and an increasingly stretched valuation, it looks like SBUX stock has run too far. Starbucks' Q1 EarningsLooking at the headline Q1 numbers, investors could easily believe that SBUX did well. Propelled by a 4% same-store sales increase, its revenue rose 9%. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 15% year-over-year. Both figures were nicely ahead of analysts' consensus outlook, and seem to foreshadow a potentially strong fiscal 2019.But the quarter isn't nearly as impressive as it seems on the surface. Comp growth of 4% seems impressive, but three of the four percentage points were generated by price hikes. In the U.S., traffic was flat year-over-year (as it was in the same period a year earlier), further suggesting that the business has reached a saturation point domestically. In China, comps rose just 1% year-over-year, while the number of transactions declined 2% YoY.Meanwhile, the company's earnings growth came almost solely from a lower tax rate. Adjusted operating income actually declined 1.2% YoY. Margins dropped 1.7 percentage points.Still, there are reasons to worry about the company's near-term profit outlook, even though its sales are growing. And some of the longer-term concerns raised by the company's Investor Day late last year haven't eased.SBUX stock now trades at almost 26 times the midpoint of its updated EPS guidance. That's a high valuation, and one that suggests that everything will keep going smoothly. Has SBUX Stock Peaked?From here, $71.54 looks like a potential peak for SBUX stock. The 26 multiple is towards the high end of the company's multi-year range. It's a multiple that likely requires the U.S. stock market and the company's overseas business to continue to be strong.Starbucks still is adding new stores in the U.S. But the pace is slowing; its domestic store count rose just 4% year-over-year last quarter. With nearly 15,000 stores, SBUX likely is running out of room.And its European business is improving, as a turnaround there takes hold. But the big growth driver of Starbucks stock is China.Luke Lango argued on this site that the struggles of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in China raised some concerns about the country's economy, and he makes a good point. Clearly, Chinese customers are more budget-conscious than they were a year ago.Weakness in China won't bring Starbucks' growth story to an end. But it certainly would slow SBUX down and hurt SBUX stock. I noted in December that Starbucks already has brought down its long-term EPS growth target to roughly 10% per year from 12% previously. Unexpected troubles in China would drop that growth to the single-digits. And as embedded as Starbucks is in the U.S., in particular, it's tough to see investors paying 26 times earnings for 8%-9% annual EPS increases.The risk facing SBUX stock is not necessarily that  Starbucks' growth is going to stop, but that it will slow enough to give investors pause. Currently, SBUX's FY20 EPS is on a pace to be about $3; cut that figure to $2.90 and bring the EPS multiple down to a still-reasonable 21 times, and SBUX stock would drop to $60. Add in any macro worries in the U.S. or Europe and the decline could be steeper. Be Careful With Starbucks StockAll told, it does look like SBUX is approaching a ceiling. It's difficult to imagine its earnings multiple expanding much more. SBUX may outperform expectations this year, but it's seemingly equally likely that it could stumble, particularly in Asia.SBUX stock shouldn't be shorted, by any means; it simply seems like there are better, and potentially easier, ways to make money. A few good quarters have sent Starbucks stock 50% higher. It would probably only take one bad quarter to reverse at least some of those gains.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Shake Shack stock is down 24% from its mid-2018 peak, having largely been left out of 2019's marketwide rally thus far, as doubts about the sustainability of the high-end burger business continue to mount.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)The hamburger chain, with more than 200 locations, will get a chance to earn that victory after Monday's closing bell rings. That's when it's slated to report its fourth-quarter and full-year numbers. The pros are calling for commendable growth, but growth at a steep price.Even more than how it fares relative to expectations though, the fate of Shake Shack stock ultimately lies in how investors feel about the company's performance on three key measures.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Three Things to WatchFor the quarter ending in December, analysts are calling Q4 sales of $118.82 million, up 23.6% from the year-ago top line of $96.1 million. The bulk of that revenue growth stems from new store openings. Profits are projected to roll in at 3 cents per share, down from the Q4-2017 bottom line of 10 cents per share of SHAK stock. Rising costs -- cost increases that are growing faster than revenue -- are the culprit.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills More than the basic accounting measures though, the market is going to qualitatively and quantitatively weigh SHAK stock on three distinct criteria.1&#92;. Rising CostsIts third-quarter 1.4% decrease in operating profit margins might seem modest enough, but for a low-margin industry like restaurants, it can be a small fortune. &quot;Increased labor and related expenses&quot; were the bulk of the reason for its rising costs, jibing with similar complaints lodged by Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).It's not a problem that's likely to abate anytime soon either, particularly in more metropolitan areas where Shake Shack prefers to set up shop. As CFO Tara Comonte commented in December, &quot;We'll never take enough price to offset the kind of labor headwinds that we've got right now and that we foresee for a period of time to come.&quot;2&#92;. Same Store SalesAs a reminder, it was the third quarter's same-store sales drop of 0.7% that inspired most of the post-earnings weakness. Although it was an improvement versus the 1.6% dip booked for the third quarter of 2017, analysts were modeling Q3 same-store sales growth of 0.9%.For perspective, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) reported same-store sales growth of 4.4% last quarter, while Chipotle saw same-store sales growth of 6.1% during the final three months of last year.3&#92;. Impact of Food Trucks, Other InnovationsFinally, while it will be difficult to quantify its impact on sales and earnings, SHAK has been tinkering with different approaches to drive more sales.One new one for 2019 is the launch of food trucks. Only two will be on the streets initially, but if all goes well, more will surface. In the meantime, the company has already been establishing locations in places like airports and sports stadiums, which haven't been targeted by Shake Shack in the past. The company also introduced a mobile ordering app in December, before the quarter ended.  * 7 Cheap Stocks That Make the Grade These shifts, once unnecessary just a few years, are increasingly necessary as the landscape of consumerism evolves. Although it's unlikely Shake Shack is able to talk about specific impacts of new initiative just yet, the conference call may still shed some light on the upside of such developments. Looking Ahead for Shake Shack StockBefore the release of the company's fourth-quarter results, analysts were calling for 2019 revenue of $576.4 million, up 27% from 2018's expected top line of $453.7 million. Earnings were projected to grow from 2018's estimated full-year tally of 68 cents per share to 72 cents per share of Shake Shack stock, suggesting the restaurateur will get a handle on expenses this year.It remains to be seen if analysts will remain modestly optimistic following its fourth-quarter report. The company's disappointing third quarter could have been an anomaly, but given that it started to wave same-store sales red flags with last year's second-quarter report -- and never really stopped waving them -- the current skepticism may well be warranted.The good news is, bad or good, the burger chain has been generally forthcoming about what it sees on the horizon.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-27,"Last night the Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) earnings report confused many PZZA investors, which resulted in a knee-jerk reaction. PZZA stock is now up by nearly 4% in early morning trading.Source: Shutterstock It was a tough quarter as management missed on the top and the bottom lines. Comparable sales were down most notably 8% in North America but did better abroad. Luckily, these days, investors are only obsessed with forward guidance.Despite the miss, Papa John's management gave an upbeat forecast for full-year 2019. So it seems that after a tough 2018, they are confident going forward, especially overseas. This is usually the case with restaurants. When they have a tough year, they set up an opportunity for better comps over past weak performance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow the onus is on PZZA to show that they can indeed deliver on their promises. But for now, the immediate price reaction will be positive until we get more clues from future quarters.There is some upside pressure perhaps from knowing that there is the activist effort from the Starboard Fund that levitates PZZA stock for now. It is good to know that there is outside pressure to do the right thing from people who have experience in the PZZA field.Last year and coming into this quarter, Papa John's stock had its fair share of problems. Most public was its issues stemming from the debacle that its founder's racist comments caused. But the real bottom-line problems came from operations. The current CEO recognized that promotions ate up the profits. So this raises my question as to how they will solve this going forward.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market If they stop promotions, then they risk delivering weak growth on the top line. And since everything starts with the sale numbers, it will be a tough slog ahead. Luckily they will have a low bar to cross from 2018 into this year but expectations are building.This is to say that I don't like the fundamentals of Papa John's stock here. With all its problems, it still sells at a price to earnings ratio of 35. This is almost three times that of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for an absolute comparison. Sure it is much cheaper than say Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), but that is a growth stock. A fairer comparison is to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) or Dominos (NYSE:DPZ) and PZZA is valued higher than those.I am not dissing the company or its efforts, but it is not for me at this point. So it doesn't mean that PZZA stock won't do well. Long-term investors who disagree with me need not worry about my comments and can stay bullish the stock as long as their thesis remains viable.But for the short-term, this won't matter much since there are price levels to trade.On the daily chart we can clearly see that PZZA stock has a bounce level at $38.20. This is evident from the corrections last August, December and more recently, February. This is good news unless the bears finally break below it.If that happens, then the monthly PZZA chart would have a bearish head and shoulder pattern with ominous potential outcomes. I am not calling for it but it's a technical scenario that I need to know exists.  * 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years Shorter term, the stock came into the earnings report with tightening range. A break from either sides between $41.43 or $42.33 per share would have some momentum in that direction. The first targets of those would be just over $1 from the lines. So this would be a relatively fast trade that profits from the momentum move.But those levels also serve as guides to manage longer-term risk. So if I am long the stock, I know where the action lines are. So I don't exit unless my lower trigger lines are crossed. Conversely, if I am long Papa John stock, I know where the buying will accelerate so not to exit too soon or where to add to my position.So in summary, PZZA is not a stock for me except for a short-term trade. I will give management credit for their forward optimism, but I won't give them my money. I will collapse next quarter hard if they indeed deliver on their promises last night.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-02-27,"Although the soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) earned an unfortunate reputation as a boring investment, it now makes an attractive case. With multiple twists and turns in the economic and geopolitical landscape, KO stock provides a measure of stability. Conservative investors have long relied on its consistent dividends.Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)The issue, though, was that the KO stock price went range bound for several years. But in 2018, the shares finally made good on their upside potential. After hitting bottom around mid-May, the beverage-maker gained nearly 17%. Coca-Cola stock ended the year up almost 7%, becoming one of the few names that weathered last October's market fallout.Much of the enthusiasm centered on the company's rebranding efforts. As millennials and later Generation Z emerged onto the scene, their health-centric behaviors dramatically changed the beverage market. Coca-Cola stock suffered while young consumers avoided carbonated, sugary drinks. To counter this trend, the company offered its own healthy alternatives, while face-lifting and spicing-up its traditional soft-drink portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnlike earlier efforts, management finally generated momentum. Despite several fundamental headwinds -- such as unfavorable currency fluctuations and the U.S.-China trade war -- Coca-Cola generated surprising growth. Was Q4 the Growth Story's End?It was a similar story for its most recent fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report. The company met its target for earnings per share at 43 cents, while its revenue haul of $7.06 billion beat the $7.03 billion consensus estimate. This time, though, the KO stock price took a beating following the report.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market Wall Street didn't care for the fact that management downgraded expectations for the full year 2019. Against a forecast calling for EPS of $2.22, Coca-Cola's brass expects to &quot;range from 1% below or above $2.08.&quot;On paper, Q4 spelled the end of the growth story. Does it also spell the end of Coca-Cola stock? Soda isn't Dead and Neither is Coca-Cola StockI don't blame anyone from running away from KO stock. If you pay attention to industry news, you'll find a consistent theme: young consumers don't drink soda.Critically last year, I noted worrisome trend: both Coca-Cola and its principal rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) appeal to an older crowd. I wrote:The main challenge is shifting consumer tastes, especially among the younger demographic. Indeed, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have both unintentionally catered to a surprisingly old demographic. According to a 2016 Adweek report, Coke was most popular among people aged 35-to-44 years. The largest consumer base for Pepsi featured the plus-65 crowd.Sales stats indicate that Coca-Cola have moved the needle on demographics, especially with their slim, colorful Diet Coke packaging, That definitely helps in transitioning consumers back towards carbonated drinks.Another important point is that premonitions about soft drinks may have been premature. A year ago, Food & Wine reported that Slice soda -- a nineties phenomenon -- is making a comeback. Another blast from the past, Jolt Cola, has also returned to retail shelves.While it's too early to say whether these product resurrections will succeed, their return bodes positively for Coca-Cola stock. Logically, we can deduce that their respective backers see a viable opportunity. After all, Jolt Cola runs the tagline, &quot;All the sugar and twice the caffeine.&quot;That's enough to make millennials run to their safe spaces! Yet here they are.Moreover, I don't think prospective buyers should assume that Slice and Jolt are isolated cases. Just recently, Coca-Cola announced that an orange-vanilla variant to their flagship brand. Yes, they'll leverage their massive financial resources to market the hell out of it.But they're doing it for a reason: consumers still love soda, and that's net positive for KO stock. KO Stock is an Underappreciated China OpportunityIf the soda market's potential resurgence wasn't convincing enough, KO stock also has a viable, under-the-radar opportunity in China. Primarily, Coca-Cola can leverage its world-renown branding, something very few companies can boast.  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns Of course, branding alone won't guarantee success in China. Fast-food icon McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has recently suffered frustrating spells in the world's second-biggest economy. Additionally, McDonald's and other American fast-food joints have found difficulty competing against local offerings.This is where Coca-Cola's much-criticized buyout of British coffee-shop chain Costa Coffee will likely benefit KO stock longer-term. Sure, management paid a hefty premium on Costa relative to what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) earns. However, Starbucks isn't for sale.More importantly, both Starbucks and Costa compete aggressively in China. This makes sense considering that upwardly mobile Chinese millennials have embraced a coffee culture. But again, Starbucks isn't on the market. So the only way to effectively compete in the growing Chinese coffee market was through the Costa buyout; hence, the rich premium.Broadly speaking, the bears are overreacting to the immediate soundbites, which naturally hurt the Coca-Cola stock price. But if you take a step back, you'll see positive undercurrents. It just requires some patience for this narrative to play out.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-06,"Once a high-flying stock, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) has suffered in the last year. GRUB benefitted from its first-mover status as restaurants all over the country signed onto its food delivery service. However, increased competition has hurt profits. GrubHub stock lost about half of its value as profits fell despite impressive revenue increases.Source: Shutterstock GrubHub faces further pressure as DoorDash and UberEats parent Uber make plans to sell stock on the major exchanges. However, these competitor moves have ironically made GRUB a buy.  * 9 Trade War Stocks to Sell on U.S.-China Deal News  GrubHub's RevolutionSince its 2014 IPO, GrubHub stock has been the only equity in the delivery space to trade on a public exchange. Now, with an upcoming IPO from both DoorDash and Uber, GRUB stock will face competition in the markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGrubHub prospered for years by democratizing food delivery. Before GRUB, pizza companies such as Domino's (NYSE:DPZ) or Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) made up most of the food delivery business. Thanks to GrubHub, this expanded to the likes of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), and every other restaurant imaginable, including family-owned establishments. Today, GrubHub serves more than 80,000 restaurants in over 1,600 cities across the U.S. New CompetitionNow, competitors have entered the market, and profits have fallen despite massive revenue increases. The $1.0 billion in revenue for 2018 represented a 47% increase from 2017 when the company brought in $683.1 million. Despite this increase, profits fell by 21%. Moreover, the company missed both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter.Peers have also taken market share amid the falling profits. However, GrubHub maintains its lead position. GrubHub held a 43% market share in deliveries. This compares to 31% for DoorDash and 26% for UberEats.Now, this battle moves to the stock market. With these peers launching IPOs, the competition now will likely have a more direct effect on GRUB stock. Of its peers, DoorDash may constitute a more significant threat. DoorDash has seen the largest market share increases. Moreover, the latest round of fundraising values DoorDash at $7.1 billion, the approximate market cap of GrubHub stock. DoorDash IPO and GrubHub StockHowever, this may signify an opportunity in GRUB stock. Despite the market cap parity, GRUB offers more value with its larger market share. Moreover, GrubHub has managed to turn a profit since the beginning. Conversely, DoorDash CEO Tony Xu says the company will delay profitability to focus on growth.Also, once the DoorDash IPO hype calms down, the profit factor favors GrubHub stock. After its stock starts to trade, DoorDash could turn to dilution and devalue its stock to fund its push for more market share. Investors will less likely face this concern in the profitable, more established GrubHub.Furthermore, with industry expansion in high gear, all food delivery companies, including GRUB, will see high growth rates. Increased competition hurt GrubHub in 2018 and this year. However, in 2020, analysts expect double-digit earnings increases to return. Wall Street expects profits to rise by 57.4% in 2020. They also see average earnings increases of 24.7% per year over the next five years.The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio now stands at about 92.2. Given this metric, one can understand why investors sold off GrubHub as profits have fallen. However, when looking at forward earnings, the multiple drops to around 35.3. This multiple appears reasonable when compared to GRUB's predicted growth rates. Final Thoughts on GrubHub StockThe fear inspired by DoorDash gives investors a reason to bite into GRUB stock. Yes, both GrubHub and its stock have suffered as peers continue to take market share. Still, with massive revenue increases in the overall industry, GRUB should continue to benefit from its industry's high growth rate.In the March 4  trading session, GrubHub fell by about 7% on no news. I think the upcoming DoorDash IPO has driven this drop, and I see the decline as a buying opportunity.I expect DoorDash will become GrubHub's principal competitor and its only pure peer in the stock market. Still, DoorDash's faster growth will come at a cost to the balance sheet, and perhaps DoorDash stock itself. With fewer risks and a high rate of profit increases, I see GrubHub stock as the safer and, longer-term, more profitable bet.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-07,"Full disclosure: I think shares of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are slightly overvalued above $70, and that long-term fundamentals do not support prices at these levels for the retail coffee giant until the end of 2019. Having said that, I also understand that fundamentals don't always drive near-term stock price movements. Those can be (and are often) driven by narratives and sentiment.Source: Shutterstock From the narrative and sentiment window, I think that Starbucks will improve dramatically in 2019, driven mostly by a healthy rebound in U.S. traffic growth thanks to a new partnership with singer-celebrity Ariana Grande. Investor sentiment will improve alongside that improving narrative. As such, it does appear as though Starbucks stock has upside potential in 2019.To be clear, this doesn't mean Starbucks stock isn't overvalued. It is. But, when the narrative is good and investor sentiment is bullish, overvalued stocks can continue to rise, despite the fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's exactly what will happen in the first part of 2019 for Starbucks stock. This overvalued stock will keep rallying because of a few landmark catalysts which keep the bulls in control.At the end of the day, this rally won't be sustainable. Fundamentals will eventually catch up to Starbucks stock, and it will drop. But, not yet. The Narrative for Starbucks Stock Will Improve In 2019There has been one big headwind which has weighed on the SBUX growth narrative over the past few years. Namely, Starbucks has ceded mind and market share to both cooler competitors like indie coffee houses, and cheaper competitors like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). This headwind will materially improve in 2019, thereby improving the SBUX growth narrative, which will in turn bolster investor sentiment and push Starbucks stock higher.  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy There isn't much Starbucks can do about the McDonald's threat. McDonald's always has been, still is, and will probably always remain cheaper than Starbucks. As McDonald's builds out its breakfast drink and snack menu, price-oriented consumers will continue migrate to McDonald's.But Starbucks can do something about the indie coffee shop threat which has poached trend-oriented consumers. Indeed, Starbucks has already taken action to win those customers back.Specifically, the company has partnered with singer-celebrity Ariana Grande. That's a big deal. Ariana Grande is among one of the most followed celebrities on social media. Her nearly 150 million Instagram followers make her the third-most-followed person on all of Instagram, while her 60 million-plus Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers make her the eleventh-most-followed person on that platform. For all intents and purposes, her reach and influence among young consumers is second-to-none.Starbucks now has that second-to-none reach and influence on their side, at a time when they desperately need it. Starbucks hasn't reported a positive U.S. traffic growth number in twelve quarters, nor have they reported 5% or higher U.S. comps in seven quarters. With Ariana Grande recharging millennial interest in the brand, both of those things could happen in 2019, especially considering the weak traffic laps (U.S. traffic was down 3% in 3Q18).If that happens, Wall Street will celebrate. Analysts will talk up the company's re-charged U.S. momentum, and investors will get excited about the prospects of Starbucks once again turning into a 5%-plus comparable sales grower. SBUX stock will consequently head higher, regardless of valuation. The SBUX Fundamentals Still Stay OvervaluedAny big rally in Starbucks stock in mid-2019 as a result of improved U.S. traffic trends will not be sustainable.Why? Because in the long run, Starbucks is already priced for improved global traffic trends, and then some. Plus, the improvements in 2019 will be because of weak laps and a one-time catalyst, two things which won't persist into 2020 or beyond. Meanwhile, the McDonald's headwind isn't going away, indie coffee shops are still aggressively expanding and China's economy is still slowing.In other words, the big picture narrative here is still one defined by stable yet slower growth going forward. Assuming Starbucks can continue to grow comps at a mid-single-digit but sub-5% rate in the long run, revenues grow at a mid-to-high-single-digit rate, and operating margins stabilize in the 17%-18% range, a reasonable long-term EPS target for Starbucks is $4.85 EPS by fiscal 2024.Based on a restaurant average 20 forward multiple, that implies a reasonable fiscal 2023 price target for Starbucks stock of nearly $100. Discounted back by 8% per year (two points below my normal 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of just over $70.That is exactly where Starbucks stock trades today. Thus, while upside in the near term looks compelling, it isn't fundamentally sustainable in a long-term window. Bottom Line on SBUX StockStarbucks stock will head higher in early to mid 2019 thanks to strong quarterly numbers which will show improvements in U.S. traffic trends for the first time in several years. But that rally will not be sustained, since long term fundamentals imply that Starbucks stock is already slightly overvalued.As such, SBUX stock seems like a case of &quot;buy now, sell later.&quot;As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TWTR.

2019-03-08,"Your No. 1 job as an investor is to accumulate as many shares as possible of elite, dividend-paying businesses. When you realize that, you &quot;graduate&quot; into a higher class of investor.You also experience a lot less stress than the average investor.Let me explain…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFew people belong to this exclusive class because most folks are obsessed with short-term gratification.They pore over tiny market movements, news releases, CNBC clips, and other things that are meaningless in the &quot;big picture.&quot;These people are always busy trying to get the market to do something for them… instead of using the greatest power in all of investing.That power is TIME.And used properly, time causes extraordinary things to happen to your portfolio.Time allows you to earn huge yields from elite, dividend-paying businesses.Time makes it so you don't care about the moods of the stock market.Here's how it works…Let's say you buy Reliable Breweries (a fictional company), which is an elite, dividend-paying business, for $20 per share. It has increased its dividend payment every year for the past 30 years. Currently, it pays a 5% annual dividend, or $1 per share.Now, let's say that dividend grows at 10% per year for the next 10 years (this rate of dividend growth is common with elite businesses).After 10 years of growing at 10% per year, your annual dividend is now almost 13% of your initial investment. After 15 years of growing at 10%, your annual dividend is 21% of your initial investment. After 20 years of growing at 10%, your annual dividend is 34% of your initial investment.Now… do you think a guy earning a safe 13% yield with one of the world's best businesses cares about a stock-market correction?Do you think he cares about a 5% decline in home prices? Do you think he cares about some economic news story on financial television?No way.He's comfortable knowing that no matter what the stock market does, folks are still going to be buying products from Reliable Breweries.He knows the broad market could decline by 20%, and he would still get that 13% yield on his shares. They could shut the market down for a year -- and he'd still get his money.That's the peace of mind accumulators of elite, dividend-paying businesses enjoy.By combining the power of an elite, dividend-paying business and the power of time, you are able to generate massive yields on your original investment. You just have to let time work its magic.This concept is very important to understand… so let me pose a few more questions…If you're earning a 13% (and growing) yield on a stock, do you care if the share price falls 10%?Do you care if oil climbs $10 or $20 per barrel?Do you care that this guy or that guy is predicting a stock market decline?No way.No matter what stories the media is hyping, the &quot;biggies&quot; of the corporate world -- companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- will still be No. 1 in their industries.They'll still have giant, insurmountable competitive advantages.They'll still have thick profit margins.They'll still generate huge cash flows.They'll still direct a portion of those cash flows to shareholders through ever-increasing dividends.Their longtime shareholders will still earn 13%+ yields on their original investments.For most folks, trying to trade in and out of stocks takes up too much time.  It generates high fees. It produces losses. It causes sleepless nights. It drains mental energy.But if you own a collection of elite, dividend-paying businesses, you won't worry about much.You sleep well knowing that all you need is TIME.Time allows dividend growth to work its magic.Think of it like planting a money tree:Once you plant a tree, you don't have to do anything more with it. The tree sinks its roots into the ground and starts to grow. Rain, air, and the nutrients in the soil are all the tree needs. You don't have to check on it every day. You leave it alone. You let the awesome forces of nature make the tree stronger and stronger as the years go by. The tree will provide fruit, beauty and shade for you, your children, and your children's children.Buy an elite dividend-paying business at a good price, leave it alone, and it will grow large in your portfolio.Given enough time, it will throw off 5%… 10%… even 25% annual dividends on your original purchase price.It will grow into a large money tree you and your family can enjoy for decades.As you go through your investment career, keep in mind your No. 1 job: To accumulate as many shares as possible in great businesses purchased at reasonable prices.Now, earlier I used a hypothetical example -- but there are plenty of real stocks with 5%+ yields.My friend Neil George makes it his full-time job to find, assess and recommend the best of the best.

2019-03-08,"If you know nothing about the stock market except what I'll explain here today, you'll be a vastly better investor than almost everyone on Wall Street… or any MBA… or anyone on CNBC.What I'm going to share with you is a &quot;secret&quot; in the sense that few people use it. It's really an &quot;open secret.&quot; Nobody has it under lock and key. It's hiding under an invisible blanket of common sense.When you start putting this secret to work for you, you'll &quot;graduate&quot; into a higher class of investor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRight now, you've probably got some money in the stock market: You probably have a 401(k), an IRA, or an individual brokerage account.Once you've invested some money, you probably started watching a little financial television.  You probably read financial websites or a few investment magazines.While reading and listening to financial media, you're sure to encounter dozens of &quot;gurus&quot; who promote lots of different market strategies… and make lots of big predictions. You're sure to see lots of news stories about the economy and the government.It's a lot to take in. It can all be very confusing.And for 999 out of 1,000 people, it distracts them from what really leads to long-term success in stocks.You see, the news you read in the paper or hear on CNBC is completely meaningless compared to the idea I'll share with you now.Most people watch the financial news and think they're doing something important. They're actually just wasting time and getting distracted from what's truly important for making big, safe returns in the stock market.And what's truly important for growing wealth in stocks is the accumulation of elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices.That's it.It's the most important idea.It's the &quot;king&quot; of all investment ideas.It's a thousand times more important than knowing what the economy is doing… or what the government is doing… or what's happening in the news.Again… what's truly important for growing wealth in stocks is the accumulation of elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices.What is an elite business?How can you find them?And how can one safely and surely generate wealth for you? The Traits of Elite BusinessesThere's no set definition of an &quot;elite business.&quot; But most smart people agree that elite businesses share some unique traits.An elite business has a durable competitive advantage over its competitors.For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has a durable competitive advantage because its huge global distribution network allows it to sell goods at unbeatably low prices. It's very, very difficult for smaller firms to compete against it.An elite business usually has an outstanding brand name. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a good example. People associate Coke's logo and name with quality soda all over the world.An elite business is often the largest business in its industry.  When you run your business better than the competition, you usually can't help but become the biggest. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) became America's biggest fast food chain because it ran a better business than its competitors.An elite business often sells &quot;basic&quot; products, like food, oil, soda, cigarettes, beer, mouthwash, razor blades and deodorant. These are things that don't go out of style.And here's something you don't often hear: Most of the truly elite businesses sell habit-forming, or even addictive, products.If you look at the list of the 50 Best Stocks of All Time (July 1926 through  December 2016), you'll note many of them sold habit-forming products. It jumps right out at you.For example, Philip Morris, rebranded a few years ago to Altria (NYSE:MO), is right near the top of the list -- creating $470.2 billion of wealth in its lifetime. It sells cigarettes, which contain addictive nicotine.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) are on the list. They sell soda… which is a sugar and caffeine delivery vehicle.People love a little sugar rush. It's habit forming… even addictive.PepsiCo's business includes Frito-Lay, and salty snacks stay strong even when sugar gets a backlash.Many big drugstore brands are on the list. These names include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) -- whose products include Ensure nutrition drinks and Similac baby formula -- Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).People get very accustomed to filling a prescription, over and over. Much of the time, those drugs are useful, although sometimes they are not. And the same goes for your favorite brand of beer. I'm not saying these things are good or bad. I'm simply pointing out that people get very accustomed to them.You can make the case that certain fast foods are addictive as well. Fast food companies load their food with fat, sugar and chemicals that make people want more. This is part of the reason McDonald's has been such a corporate success.The businesses I just mentioned produced more than 13% annual gains for over three decades.Those returns are extraordinarily rare in the stock market. You won't find anything better.An investment of $25,000 in a tax-deferred account that grows 13% per year for 30 years grows to nearly one million dollars ($977,897).Most companies can't sustain 13% annual returns for more than five years.  The businesses I just mentioned sustained those returns for decades.And the reason why they did so well is simple… Why Habit-Forming Products Are Such a Cash CowWhen people form a habit around a product, it goes a long way towards ensuring repeat business.  People get used to certain brands, and they grow resistant to switching.Also, when people get used to a product and the brand surrounding it, they are more likely to continue buying the product even if the price increases a little. Both of these help companies sustain long-term sales growth and healthy profit margins. That's good for shareholders.It's also important to know that when these companies hit upon the right recipes or the right mix of whatever it takes to make good products, they don't have to make large, ongoing investments in the business. They don't have to spend tons of money on more research and development.Once Coca-Cola hit upon Coke, it didn't have to change it. The same goes for Budweiser and Hershey (NYSE:HSY) and Tootsie Roll (NYSE:TR).When you develop a product that people love and develop habits around, you don't tinker with it. You don't have to spend a lot of money on new research and development. You don't have to buy expensive high-tech equipment. You can instead spend that money on things that will provide a high return on investment, like marketing, distribution or manufacturing.This means a larger percentage of revenues can be sent to shareholders.Owning the world's top sellers of basic (often habit-forming) products is also ideal for investing in high-growth emerging markets like China and India.Combined, China and India have about 10 times the population of the United States. Many of those people are at the level of economic development of 1940s America… and they are getting a little richer every year. It's one of the biggest investment opportunities in history.To invest in this trend, I don't want to try and guess what websites will get the most clicks… or what retailer will become popular. That's a very difficult game to play. Those business landscapes will change rapidly.On the other hand, I'm very confident those folks in China and India who are getting a little richer every year will want to enjoy the same habit-forming products Americans have enjoyed for decades.They'll want to consume more branded soda, cigarettes, beer, liquor and processed foods.Owning elite, global businesses that serve those growing markets makes a lot of sense.By the way… these global sellers of branded, habit-forming consumer goods are the kinds of businesses Warren Buffett, the greatest investor in history, always looks to buy. He's a long-time owner of soda-maker Coca-Cola and candy maker See's Candies.My friend Neil George also owns several big-name, habit-forming brands in his portfolio for Profitable Investing -- a portfolio that has a long track record of correctly timing (and profiting from) trends ranging from gold and real estate booms to income stocks.Regards,BrianP.S. Besides habit-forming products…there's another key element that the best-performing stocks share.Compare Brokers The post The 1 Way to Invest for Retirement appeared first on InvestorPlace.",The #1 Way to Invest for Retirement

2019-03-12,"Getting paid a reliable and growing dividend is a great thing. Over time, it can produce 13%+ yields on an initial investment that started out at a 5% yield.But there's a way to make this great idea even better…Elite, dividend-paying companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) allow you to harness the most powerful investment force on the planet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis force is called &quot;compounding.&quot;Compounding occurs when you place a chunk of money into an investment that pays you a return on your money. But instead of taking the returns and spending them, you &quot;reinvest&quot; them… and buy more of the investment.By doing this, your dividends earn more dividends and your interest earns more interest.You can think of compounding returns through dividend reinvestment like rolling a snowball down a hill. As the snowball gets larger, it's able to gather more snow… which enables it to get larger… which enables it to gather more snow… which enables it to get larger… and so on.Eventually, you build a snowball the size of a house.Compounding is the ultimate way for the &quot;little guy&quot; to safely build wealth in the stock market.Given enough time, a good compounding vehicle (like a Dividend Aristocrat) will turn tens of thousands of dollars into millions of dollars.For example, let's say you invest $10,000 in an investment that pays a 5% dividend. You intention is to compound over the long term.In Year 1, a $10,000 investment paying 5% in dividends will pay you $500. You take this money and buy $500 more of the investment.In Year 2, your investment has grown to $10,500, but still earns 5%. That year, you'll earn $525 in dividends… which you can use to buy more of the investment.In Year 3, your investment has grown to $11,025, but still earn 5%. At the end of that year, you'll earn $551.25 in dividends… which you can use to buy more of the investment.You can see how it works.After 20 years of compounding, a stake of $10,000 throwing off 5% in dividends will grow to $26,533.After 30 years, it will grow to $43,219.After 40 years, it will grow to $70,400.And remember, this number assumes no further money is added to the program as the years go by… or that the investment produces any capital gains.As you can see, long-term compounding produces extraordinary effects.It's a very important concept for young people to learn… because they have the power of TIME on their side.The longer you can compound, the more extraordinary the results.The following example shows just how extraordinary the results can be…Consider two investors, Robert and Sally.Robert opens a tax-deferred retirement account at age 26. He invests $3,000 per year in this account for 40 consecutive years. Robert stops contributing at age 65. His account grows at 9% per year.Sally opens a tax-deferred retirement account at age 18.  She invests $3,000 per year in this account for eight consecutive years. After those eight years, she makes no more contributions to her retirement account. Her account grows at 9% per year.The results of these two approaches are below… and they are extraordinary:Robert Sally Age Contribution Year-End Value Contribution Year-End Value 16 $0 $0 $0 $0 17 $0 $0 $0 $0 18 $0 $0 $3,000 $3,270 19 $0 $0 $3,000 $6,834 20 $0 $0 $3,000 $10,719 21 $0 $0 $3,000 $14,954 22 $0 $0 $3,000 $19,570 23 $0 $0 $3,000 $24,601 24 $0 $0 $3,000 $30,085 25 $0 $0 $3,000 $36,063 26 $3,000 $3,270 $0 $39,309 27 $3,000 $6,834 $0 $42,847 28 $3,000 $10,719 $0 $46,703 29 $3,000 $14,954 $0 $50,906 30 $3,000 $19,570 $0 $55,488 31 $3,000 $24,601 $0 $60,481 32 $3,000 $30,085 $0 $65,925 33 $3,000 $36,063 $0 $71,858 34 $3,000 $42,579 $0 $78,325 35 $3,000 $49,681 $0 $85,374 36 $3,000 $57,422 $0 $93,058 37 $3,000 $65,860 $0 $101,433 38 $3,000 $75,058 $0 $110,562 39 $3,000 $85,083 $0 $120,513 40 $3,000 $96,010 $0 $131,359 41 $3,000 $107,921 $0 $143,182 42 $3,000 $120,904 $0 $156,068 43 $3,000 $135,055 $0 $170,114 44 $3,000 $150,480 $0 $185,424 45 $3,000 $167,294 $0 $202,112 46 $3,000 $185,620 $0 $220,303 47 $3,000 $205,596 $0 $240,130 48 $3,000 $227,369 $0 $261,742 49 $3,000 $251,103 $0 $285,298 50 $3,000 $276,972 $0 $310,975 51 $3,000 $305,169 $0 $338,963 52 $3,000 $335,905 $0 $369,470 53 $3,000 $369,406 $0 $402,722 54 $3,000 $405,923 $0 $438,967 55 $3,000 $445,726 $0 $478,474 56 $3,000 $489,111 $0 $521,536 57 $3,000 $536,401 $0 $568,475 58 $3,000 $587,947 $0 $619,637 59 $3,000 $644,132 $0 $675,405 60 $3,000 $705,374 $0 $736,191 61 $3,000 $772,128 $0 $802,448 62 $3,000 $844,889 $0 $874,669 63 $3,000 $924,199 $0 $953,389 64 $3,000 $1,010,647 $0 $1,039,194 65 $3,000 $1,104,876 $0 $1,132,721 Less Total Invested -$120,000 -$24,000 Net Earnings: $984,876 $1,108,721 Return on Money: 8-fold 46-foldSally made just eight contributions of $3,000, for a total of $24,000 invested. Robert made 40 contributions of $3,000, for a total of $120,000 invested.However, Sally started at 18 years of age and Robert started at 26 years of age. Sally started eight years earlier. And those eight extra years of compounding are worth more than all of Robert's 32 years of extra contributions.Despite a much smaller total contribution, Sally ended up with more money… and a much, much bigger return on her investment.This example shows why compounding is such a powerful idea to teach children. They have the ultimate advantage of TIME.This piece of knowledge is one of the greatest financial gifts you could ever give your children.In order to put your compounding plans on autopilot, consider using something called a &quot;dividend reinvestment plan,&quot; also called a DRIP.A dividend reinvestment plan is just what it sounds like. It's a plan that takes the dividends you earn and reinvests them into buying more stock.Once you set up a DRIP, you don't have to do a thing. Again, think of a DRIP as a way to put your compounding plan on autopilot.You can ask any stock broker to institute a DRIP for you. Any reputable online broker will do it for you. It's a simple process. You can find directions on your broker's website or call the customer service department.Regards,BrianCompare Brokers The post How Elite Businesses Allow You to Contribute Less and Make MORE appeared first on InvestorPlace.",How Elite Businesses Allow You to Contribute Less and Make MORE

2019-03-14,"Amateur investors often bring up a common objection to buying elite dividend-paying businesses. Acting on this objection often leads them into very risky investments.Most elite dividend payers sport annual dividend yields in the neighborhood of 2%-5%. And these yields are incredibly safe and reliable. They rise every year.In addition to elite dividend payers, the stock market contains groups of businesses that pay annual yields of 6%… 8%… 10%… even 12%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe amateur looks at these numbers at says, &quot;Why buy a business that yields 4% when I can buy one that yields 8%?&quot; And then, the amateur makes one of the biggest investment mistakes in the world.They &quot;chase&quot; yield.There's a classic piece of investment wisdom about chasing yield. It goes: &quot;More money has been lost chasing yield than at the barrel of a gun.&quot;    Chasing yield is the act of buying stocks simply because they offer high yields… while ignoring vital business factors.Some businesses engage in risky business ventures or take on lots of debt in order to pay high yields. Finance and real estate companies often do this.Some businesses own oil & gas wells and pay dividends from the production. Those dividend payouts are often totally dependent on oil & gas prices staying elevated. They can be incredibly volatile.These businesses are usually very dangerous for the average investor.For example, there is a group of companies whose chief business activity is borrowing money at low interest rates… and then using that borrowed money to buy mortgages that pay higher interest rates. They make money from the &quot;spread&quot; between the two.One of the largest and most popular of these companies is Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY).Annaly is probably operated by good people. But because it borrows lots of money to buy mortgages, its business -- and its dividend yield -- is very volatile. Small changes in the business (like how much it has to pay to borrow money) can cause enormous changes in shareholder returns.Below is a chart of Annaly's dividend payments from early 1998 to early 2019. As you can see, these payments are incredibly volatile.The volatile nature of Annaly's dividend payment leads to volatile share price movement. Below is a chart of Annaly's share price during the same time period (early 1998 to early 2019).The volatility in the early 2000's and around the 2008 financial crisis is par for the course, given what was going on in the market.But even after the recovery in 2009 -- note the drop from $19 per share to $10 per share.Or… consider the performance of the San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:SJT). Prior to 2014, this trust was one of the biggest most popular trusts that owned natural gas assets.Then, the price of natural gas dropped around 65%. Because the San Juan Basin Royalty Trust derived its revenue from natural gas, its shares dropped as well. As you can see from the chart below, they fell from $20 to around $4 per share.Also consider the performance of Enerplus Resources (NYSE:ERF). Years ago, it was one of the biggest and most popular firms that owned oil & gas wells… and paid dividends out of production.Starting in 2014, crude oil fell from over $100 per barrel to less than $30 per barrel. This decline helped crush Enerplus shares. As you can see, they fell from $25 per share to barely $2 per share.The examples of Annaly, San Juan Basin, and Enerplus are not unique. And I'm not picking on these particular businesses.This story plays out over and over in the stock market… with dozens and dozens of companies.Unsuspecting investors see a company offering a very high yield and they buy it. They don't do any research to determine if the business model is risky or not. In almost every case, it is.Some investors are good at timing their purchases of these volatile businesses. They buy them when they are deeply out of favor with most investors.However, the average investor almost always buys these businesses at the wrong time: near share price peaks. He picks up 8% in dividends and then losses 30% on the share price drop.The individual investor is much, much better off owning stable businesses that pay out reliable and growing dividends. You don't trade in and out of elite-dividend payers. There's no frequent buying and selling. There's no worry that the share price will fall 30%. There's no dangerous leverage.You simply buy them and begin building wealth the low-stress way.While the dividends and share price of Annaly were bouncing up and down, elite dividend payers like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) were paying steady and rising dividends.And that's easy to spot…if you have a powerful, yet elegant tool at your disposal -- like my friend Louis Navellier's Dividend Grader.Once you've found a solid dividend, without a ton of price volatility…the rest is history.Regards,BrianP.S. At this point, some might ask: &quot;If you want to avoid volatility…why not just buy gold?&quot; Well, let me show you why.Compare Brokers The post Elite Dividend Payers: The Cure for the Biggest Mistake Income Investors Make appeared first on InvestorPlace.",Elite Dividend Payers: The Cure for the Biggest Mistake Income Investors Make

2019-03-14,"If you're like a lot of folks, you're worried about inflation… and the danger it presents for people saving for retirement, or already in retirement.You might also be worried about another financial crisis wrecking your investments.If you're one of these people (and there's a good chance you are), the &quot;no brainer&quot; decision for you is to own elite, dividend-paying businesses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOwning an elite dividend-payer is a good inflation defense because its strong brand and loyal customer base will allow it to raise prices along with inflation. Its dividend will often increase at a faster rate of inflation, so the value of your income stream remains intact.These companies are safer, better places to park long-term wealth than any currency or any government bond. They are better for parking long-term wealth than gold.There are several major reasons why they're an incredible vehicle for your money…* For one, buying a great business is extremely cheap and easy. You don't get hit with big fees and commissions when you buy and sell them. You can't say that about real estate or art. Buying a great business through an online broker will cost you less than lunch at most restaurants.* Holding a great business is extremely cheap and easy. It's as easy as holding cash in the bank. There are no storage costs. There are no transportation costs. You don't have to get a safe-deposit box or a home safe, like you might do with gold or diamonds.* Shares of great businesses are liquid and freely traded. There's a huge market for these business. It's open most every business day.* Elite, dividend-paying businesses also pay out reliable, extremely safe income to their shareholders.* And finally, great businesses are great inflation-defense vehicles. They have long histories of rising in value when paper currencies decline in value.This is one of the most important aspects of these stocks…You see, governments have a long history of debasing currencies.When they want to pay for big social programs or wars, governments often print up extra currency units (like U.S. dollars). Every currency unit that is printed devalues the existing currency units. This is called &quot;inflating&quot; the money supply.Inflation is a way for governments to quietly clip small bits of value from your bank account and your wallet.Inflation is one of the greatest dangers a person saving for retirement faces. It can crush the future buying power of the money you save today.This is why owning great businesses is so important. Great businesses hold their value through inflationary periods.The world's most successful investor, Warren Buffett, figured this out a long time ago.Buffett urges people who are worried about paper-currency declines to own world-class businesses. He figured out a long time ago that owning great businesses is a better inflation defense than owning gold.I agree with Buffett on this point. The numbers prove it. Owning great businesses is better than gold when it comes to preserving and growing wealth over the long term.Consider that from the start of 1995 through early 2019 -- a time period that includes booms and busts for both stocks and gold - gold returned 241%.Now consider during that time…ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) returned 755%.Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) returned 1,007%.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) returned 1,257%.McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) returned 1,963%.(Note: These numbers factor in dividend reinvestment. Gold, of course, doesn't pay dividends at all.)Keep in mind… the companies I just mentioned were well-established enterprises in 1995. It wasn't like you were buying speculative startups.The numbers are clear. Owning elite businesses that generate consistent dividends is a better long-term strategy than owning gold.If you're concerned about inflation or another financial crisis, I encourage you to think about this idea… and how the world's greatest investor, Warren Buffett, approaches it.Sure… own some gold. Own some real estate. But keep in mind the proven wealth-building power of owning the world's best businesses.If you achieve great results with other strategies, congratulations. But if you're one of the many investors who has found lots of &quot;action&quot; -- but little success -- with exciting strategies, I hope you'll come around to the idea I've laid out for you today.Once you come around, and commit to a lifetime of accumulating elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices, you'll eventually have a beautiful view of your &quot;investment backyard&quot;…At the end of your investment career, you'll have a large collection of elite, dividend-paying businesses… throwing off regular cash dividends.You'll have an orchard of money trees in your backyard.The branches of your money trees will be heavy with fruit every year. One &quot;tree&quot; will yield 20% on your original investment… one will yield 25% on your original investment… one will yield 30% on your original investment… and so on.Broad market corrections won't concern you. The latest government drama won't concern you.You'll sleep well at night knowing your elite businesses will continue to pay out regular cash dividends.You'll have a large and growing portfolio of the world's best soda companies, the world's best energy companies, the world's best food companies, etc.Instead of a fancy art collection or a car collection, you'll have a money tree collection.If you commit to a lifetime of accumulating elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices, you're virtually guaranteed to build significant wealth in the stock market. And you will build that wealth safely.This is the world's 1 way to invest for retirement.It's the closest thing there is to having money trees growing in your back yard.

2019-03-15,"U.S. same-restaurant sales dipped into negative territory in February for the first time in nine months. A potentially softening U.S. restaurant environment suggests investors need to be even more selective when it comes to choosing restaurant stocks. Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass recently said investors should focus their attention on fast food stocks in 2019.  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs Here's a look at his top three favorite restaurant stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips McDonalds (MCD)Source: Shutterstock The past decade hasn't all been smooth sailing for McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) or its investors. However, Glass says the Golden Arches are still the gold standard of restaurant stocks: &quot;U.S. sales will outpace peers in '19 and should accelerate as the year progresses as benefits from a comprehensive re-imaging plan become more visible.&quot;McDonald's has made an aggressive push toward its Experience of the Future initiative in recent years. This initiative emphasizes mobile ordering, delivery and pickup options, store remodels and in-store kiosks.Glass says heavy investments likely clouded McDonald's numbers in 2018. The market doesn't seem to appreciate how much these under-the-radar improvements could improve business efficiency in coming years.In the near term, focus on value offerings and local advertising in 2019 should support same-store sales numbers. Glass predicts return on invested capital will soon hit new highs as McDonald's reaps the rewards of its investments. In addition, he says earnings will get a boost from declining capital expenditures starting in 2020.Finally, in an increasingly unpredictable market environment, MCD stock offers investors value, stability and an attractive 2.5% dividend yield. Morgan Stanley has an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $210 price target for MCD stock. Restaurant Brands International (QSR)Source: Shutterstock  Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR) is the parent company of Burger King, Popeyes and Tim Hortons. Glass says there is a huge disconnect between QSR stock valuation and the company's impressive growth numbers. Fundamentals at Tim Horton's seem to be improving, including same-restaurant sales growth of 2.4% in the most recent quarter. Burger King's SRS growth dropped from 10.1% in 2017 to just 8.9% in 2018, but it still outpaced most of its peer group. Popeyes stole the show for QSR stock investors last year. SRS growth jumped from 5.1% in 2017 to 8.9% in 2018.Glass said that after a big year in 2018, investors can expect more big numbers for this restaurant stock in 2019.&quot;Catalysts include improving margins at Tim's, better visibility on international expansion and economics, and increased investor outreach to help broaden the shareholder base.&quot;From a valuation perspective, QSR stock is trading at a free cash flow yield of roughly 7% based on Morgan Stanley's 2020 cash flow estimates. Glass points out that makes QSR a rare value among restaurant stocks.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash Morgan Stanley has an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and $70 price target for QSR stock. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)Source: Shutterstock  Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has been a battleground stock for several years now. The company's growth story was derailed back in 2015 following a series of food safety scares. However, CMG stock has nearly doubled in the past year on optimism that new CEO Brian Niccol can replicate his past success as head of Taco Bell. Glass says Chipotle is a perfect early-stage turnaround opportunity for investors. Niccol and the management team are pushing hard on several initiatives, focusing on throughput, advertising, menu improvements, digital ordering and customer loyalty. Early returns on the initiatives have been positive, but 2019 will certainly be a show-me year for Chipotle.Because Chipotle's restaurants are company owned and not franchised, the company may face unique margin pressures compared to its franchised peers. Rising wages will certainly take a bite out of Chipotle's bottom line. However, Glass said investors should be watching traffic as a key indicator that Chipotle's outlook is improving. In the fourth quarter, Chipotle reported 6.1%t SRS growth, double-digit revenue growth and a 2% increase in total transactions.As long as the recovery keeps trending in the right direction, Glass said long-term margins could eventually improve from around 18.7% to 21%. Morgan Stanley has an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $617 price target for this restaurant stock.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare Brokers The post 3 Best Restaurant Stocks Morgan Stanley Says to Take a Bite Of appeared first on InvestorPlace.",3 Best Restaurant Stocks Morgan Stanley Says to Take a Bite Of

2019-03-21,"Stocks like Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) don't go on sale very often. But to some investors, &quot;on sale&quot; might be an exaggeration.Source: Shutterstock Domino's Pizza stock, even after its recent selloff, is hardly cheap. Indeed, DPZ stock still trades at over 22 tines analysts' consensus earnings per share estimate.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter That's a huge multiple for a relatively mature company. And given that DPZ stock has tanked lately in part due to its big Q4 earnings miss last month, it's a multiple that might not seem all that attractive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut DPZ has plenty of room to grow into that multiple. Between the company's same-store-sales growth and the new stores it will open, its revenue should continue to increase nicely for years to come. Given its franchise model and the leverage on its balance sheet, its higher revenues will have an amplified effect on its earnings.DPZ is still facing risks. But those risks seem manageable, as Domino's is well-positioned to handle any challenges ahead. DPZ stock isn't cheap, but stocks like this shouldn't be, and they very rarely are. The Case for DPZ StockDPZ simply has come to dominate the pizza business. Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) Pizza Hut's growth has stalled out in recent years. Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) sales are collapsing. Yet Domino's keeps growing at impressive rates.Indeed, during the company's  &quot;disappointing&quot; Q4, its U.S. same-store sales rose 5.6% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Pizza Hut's comparable-store sales were unchanged. Papa John's comps fell 8%. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) same-store sales rose 2.3% in Q4,  and most investors  thought its results were good.No major chain's same-store sales are increasing as rapidly as those of DPZ. No major chain, in fact, is coming close. That trend should continue, and Domino's can benefit from opening new stores, as well.It's adding stores to U.S. metro areas. That's been a successful strategy despite fears that new stores might &quot;cannibalize&quot; existing stores. The company's overseas business continues to grow, in terms of both comparable stores and new opportunities.DPZ still expects its annual retail sales to rise 8%-12% over the next few years, with its global comparable sales increasing 3%-6% and its net store count rising 6%-8% annually. On the other hand, 8%-12% growth might not sound like much, since DPZ stock has a trailing-twelve month P/E ratio of 29.But because of DPZ's  franchise model, 8%-12% revenue growth results in earnings and cash-flow growth that's much higher than that. Store-level costs are borne by franchisees, enabling DPZ's operating margins to rise faster than its revenue. And the leverage on Domino's balance sheet further boosts its net margins. For 2020, for instance, analysts' consensus estimate calls for a 9.8% increase in sales and an 18% increase in EPS. The Risks and Rewards of DPZ StockThe company's 8%-12% revenue-growth guidance, then, suggests that its earnings easily could increase 100% or more  over the next four or five years. Even assuming that the P/E ratio of DPZ stock drops in several years as DPZ matures, investors will still have an easy path to double-digit annual returns, including dividends. Any outperformance - or a continued willingness by investors to pay up for DPZ stock - sets up a path for DPZ to reach $500 and beyond.But there are risks facing DPZ stock. The most obvious one is the potential for recession in the U.S. or in key international markets. Domino's struggled during the financial crisis: its same-store sales declined 4.9% in 2008. But it clearly has a better business ten years later,  and its emphasis on low price points could mitigate the macro pressures on it, particularly domestically.There are two smaller concerns. The first is that on the whole there's much more competition in the pizza industry than ever before. The rise of online ordering services like GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and DoorDash has allowed thousands of restaurants to offer delivery services,  breaking pizza's traditional dominance of that space. In turn, other chains now offer delivery, including casual dining giants like Brinker International (NYSE:EAT) and Dine Brands Global (NYSE:DIN).But as that trend has accelerated lately, Domino's sales don't appear to have suffered. The company's comp-sales growth has decelerated from 12% in 2015 to 6% in 2018. That's not necessarily a surprise, however, given the tougher competition. But 6% still is more than enough growth to leverage expense growth and expand margins. And it hardly suggests that the company's business model is facing an existential threat. The Best FranchiserThe final risk is one facing the entire industry. Companies like McDonald's and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) have benefited from franchising more restaurants. That's benefited MCD stock, in particular, as rising labor and food costs become the problem of the franchisees , not that of the corporate parent.But as James Brumley pointed out last year, at some point franchisees won't be able to handle that pressure any more. Carrols Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:TAST), the largest Burger King franchisee, shows the problem. Over the past three years, QSR stock is up 63%, but TAST has declined by almost 25% during the same period.Domino's franchisees, however, are doing quite well. The company pointed out in a recent investor presentation that its franchisees' average EBITDA per store has soared in the past decade, rising from $49 million in 2008 to over $137 million in 2018. Franchise-level profits have stopped increasing lately, but they're still positive, and franchisees' margins still look quite healthy.So, purely from a business standpoint, Domino's looks like far and away the best pick among restaurant stocks. It has more opportunities to open additional stores than its large peers. DPZ can still take plenty of market share from its corporate rivals (and independent pizzerias). Its franchisees are happy. Since Domino's is doing an awful lot right at the moment, the owners of Domino's stock have little to complain about.Given DPZ's growth potential, DPZ stock is worth paying up for. With Domino's Pizza stock now 15% cheaper than it was just a few weeks ago, the shares may be expensive, but they're still attractive.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Coca-Cola stock famously has made billions of dollars for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). It's also been a great long-term investment for the rest of us.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter But times change. And those changes have notably shifted the investment case here. The KO Stock Price Tumbles After EarningsAt this point, it seems increasingly difficult to make the fundamental case for Coca-Cola stock. A multi-year transformation -- including a &quot;refranchising&quot; of its bottling operations -- has hit revenue in recent years, but it was supposed to create a leaner, more profitable company.That's a key reason why the KO stock price fell over 8% after disappointing earnings last month -- a huge move for a typically low-volatility stock. Guidance for 2019 was much weaker than expected. Coca-Cola expects earnings growth of -1% to 1% against 2018's $2.08.Investors were hoping for much more after the refranchising. The problem goes beyond results for a single year, however, as 2019 guidance implies EPS of $2.06 to $2.10. In 2013, Coca-Cola's non-GAAP EPS was $2.08. Over six years, including a massive transformation, earnings per share will barely move, if at all.But even that doesn't tell the full story.Coca-Cola stock, like so many other U.S.-based investments, has benefited from a lower tax rate. The underlying (i.e., adjusted) tax rate in 2013 was 23%. It's estimated to be 19.5% in 2019. That lower rate provides a 4.5% benefit to net earnings. Billions of dollars in share buybacks boost EPS as well. Considering this, Coca-Cola has 4.5% fewer shares outstanding than it did in 2013. In other words, KO is making less pre-tax profit than it did six years ago (the figure has declined about 8.7% by my math).And yet, Coca-Cola stock trades for 22x the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance. That multiple seems incompatible with the performance over the past few years. The Risks to KO StockTo be fair, a stronger dollar has been an issue, hitting revenues and profits overseas. Coca-Cola is projecting a significant currency headwind, with 6% to 7% impact on operating income in 2019 alone. This comes after a 4% hit in 2018. Essentially, much of the potential benefit of the refranchising has been swallowed by currency effects.That said, it's not as if the dollar is guaranteed to get weaker going forward. KO stock still looks reasonably expensive against even currency-neutral growth. Meanwhile, risks are rising.Soda consumption continues to decline in the U.S., dropping by 20%-plus over two decades according to one report. Coca-Cola has tried to diversify, acquiring Costa Coffee and sparkling water manufacturer Topo Chico last year. But a $5 billion coffee deal -- let alone a $220 million bottled water purchase -- doesn't move the needle much against a $200 billion market cap.The trend here is consistently negative, particularly in terms of diet soda. Sparkling waters from Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ) (even with some recent trouble), and private companies like Polar and Spindrift are taking share from diet soda. Neither Coke with its Dasani brand, nor Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) with its Aquafina, have been able to win much in that market. New BrandsMeanwhile, HSBC Securities highlighted an interesting stumbling block for Coca-Cola's plans for expansion. Coca-Cola has looked to new extensions, including flavored Diet Coke and an orange-vanilla offering for its full-calorie brand. But, as HSBC pointed out, those efforts are likely to upset the same bottlers who have taken over Coke's operations.Smaller products have high startup costs, as well as long payback periods. Coke's refranchising may slow it from following the brand expansion strategy that's currently popular among consumer companies. It's a bit analogous to the risk facing Coke customers McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR). Those companies have shifted costs to their franchisees too. However, those franchisees may rebel as their parents look to compete solely on price or otherwise push the limits of their profitability. Not Enough GrowthFrom here, zero growth isn't worth the risks facing the industry. As such, KO stock looks far too expensive. I asked last year if Coca-Cola might be the next giant to stumble after consumer heavyweights Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), and Altria (NYSE:MO) saw big declines.It hasn't happened yet, even with the post-Q4 selloff. But I wouldn't be shocked if it did. In fact, I'd be less surprised if KO stock fell sharply than if Coca-Cola somehow figured out how to grow in an industry destined for long-term declines.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-03-22,"I'm a huge sports fan. Always have been. I'm an even bigger fan of making money (and that's saying something). We're smack in the middle of a great time for both at once -- thanks to some great news for gaming stocks.In terms of sports, the NBA and NHL playoffs start in just a few weeks. Major League Baseball's spring training is in &quot;full swing&quot; (sorry, couldn't resist). In fact, I'm writing to you from Florida, where I'm catching a few Philadelphia Phillies' practices and games.And to top it all off… the 2019 NCAA basketball tournament just got under way. You've also heard it called &quot;March Madness,&quot; and that brings us to investing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMore than 40 million people were expected to fill out those famous brackets - picking winners round-by-round all the way through the championship. From those little office pools to big-time bets elsewhere, nearly 20% of adults in the U.S. are expected to bet on the tournament. The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that about $8.5 billion in total will be wagered on the tournament, which puts it up with the Super Bowl as the most bet on sports events each year.This year's tournament marks a landmark shift, especially for gaming stocks. It is the first time in its 80-year history when betting on it is legal outside of Nevada.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course Similar to marijuana, the wave of legalized sports betting is building since a Supreme Court decision last May left the question of sports betting up to individual states. It hasn't taken long for several to jump on board in just the last 10 months. In addition to Nevada, sports betting is now legal in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Delaware, Mississippi and New Mexico.I realize eight states do not make a wave, but this is just the beginning. More than 20 other states are at least considering legalization. In less than a year, more than half of all states have either jumped on the sports betting bandwagon or are thinking about it.A wave of legalization is powerful on its own, but there's more to the story. In addition to more states allowing sports betting, the ways people can bet and the types of bets available are also about to explode. The Great American Sports Betting BoomAny time the government opens up a huge new market, investors can win very big. That's true now for gaming stocks.Not convinced? Just look at marijuana.Last fall, Canada legalized cannabis throughout the entire nation. More and more U.S. states are doing the same, even though it is technically illegal on the federal level. (Just wait until that changes!)Thanks to this wave of marijuana legalization, sales in the United States and Canada are growing at more than 20% per year… and will do so for many years. The legal marijuana industry is set to grow 10-fold over the coming decade.This will create massive new markets and stock winners. Actually, it already is.At Matt McCall's Investment Opportunities, marijuana stocks have surged 58% on average just since the beginning of the year. One is up more than 156%. Another is up 98.5%. Two more have gained over 70%. All in less than three months.Another government action - the Supreme Court ruling last May - opened the door to legal sports betting. It will take a little longer to unfold state by state, but this is also a huge opportunity still in its early stages.Let's look at some numbers. If you can grasp the significance of these, you'll be well on your way to making a fortune with gaming stocks in the  Great American Sports Betting Boom.In 2017, the last full year before the Supreme Court's decision, Nevada was the only state that allowed sports gambling. A total of $4.87 billion was wagered legally in that state. But that paled in comparison to the estimated $150 billion that was bet illegally. About 30 times more money was bet illegally than legally.As more states come on board, there is no doubt that a large percentage of those illegal bets will move over to legal channels. Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a boutique research firm specializing in the gaming and technology sector, sees annual gaming revenue of $6 billion in the U.S. by 2023. That's based on 32 states legalizing sports gambling, which seems more than reasonable over the next four years. One Gaming Stock to Get You StartedLike marijuana, the sports betting market is being created in large measure thanks to government actions. Also like marijuana, the opportunity is made even more exciting by the various ways to profit from it. There are a number of gaming stocks that can succeed and take a big piece of the growing sports gambling pie.The most obvious would be the casinos, which can easily add a sportsbook and attract gamblers who are already on their properties.Plus, technology is needed to power the gambling experience on land and on mobile devices. In the coming years, the majority of wagers will be placed via apps. You want to own companies that are at the forefront of this technology.Then there are the leagues and the teams themselves. One company that encompasses many of these opportunities is William Hill (OTCMKTS:WIMHY). You may not be familiar with the name, but in London there are more William Hill betting stores than there are Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) or McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) locations.As cool as that is, I'm more interested in how aggressively this leading betting and gaming stock is going after the U.S. market. William Hill has already expanded into six of the eight states where sports betting is legal, and we know there is more to come.William Hill has also already partnered with a few professional teams, from the minor leagues to the big leagues, including the NHL's Las Vegas Golden Knights and New Jersey Devils. This trend should continue and include more of the largest franchises in the world.It also opens the door for something I expect will be a big boost to the company and sports betting itself: in-game wagering. Simply open an app on your phone and place your bet as the game is going on. Which player will score the next goal? Who will commit the next foul? To stick with the sports theme, this is a slam dunk. Sports fans will love this.William Hill has a big advantage with its well-established app, name recognition, and loyalty among gamblers. Its sportsbook app has been downloaded more than 2.5 million times from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store.I recommend William Hill in my Investment Opportunities service. We're down since I added it last July. But honestly, that makes it an even better buy for you, reading this today. A lot of the sports betting/gaming stocks have been off to a slow start, but looking out over the long term, I expect it to climb much higher as legalized sports gambling spreads.That's a bet I expect to pay off big time.The thing I love best about sports betting is that it's a big investing theme that gives us multiple ways to make money. So is the spreading legalization of marijuana.As the cannabis market explodes, more and more companies are coming public. Please don't rush out and buy them! There's some homework to do first. Make sure the fundamentals back up the hype. And the timing has to be right.That's all part of my Cannabis Cash Calendar system, which I designed specifically for marijuana IPOs.

2019-03-26,"The coffee market is back in the news, but the latest development may not have a big impact 0n Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), stock. Burger King recently announced a $5 per month coffee subscription model, giving members one free cup of coffee per day.Source: Shutterstock In the unlikely event that a member uses his or her subscription every day of the month, he or she would only pay a rather cheap 17 cents per cup. Burger King is said to be creating a &quot;community&quot; around its coffee and breakfast options, and aims to peel off traffic from  Dunkin Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy Now The good news for SBUX stock is that, despite the ample media attention, Burger King is hardly a threat to Starbucks. McDonald's has already offered cheap coffee as part of its breakfast package for years. It's never been clear that there is a huge overlap between Starbucks' and McDonald's customer bases. As a result, Burger King's invasion of the market is unlikely to shake up the sector either, though it likely will hurt McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts at the margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat said, Starbucks stock has plenty of other issues, even if Burger King's initiative isn't one of them. At the end of the day, the combination of the high valuation of Starbucks stock  and  its limited growth prospects make it hard to endorse the stock, particularly as it trades near its new, all-time highs. You'll almost certainly be able to buy Starbucks stock at a cheaper price later this year.  Is Starbucks Stock Really So Expensive?A standard bearish talking point on SBUX stock is that its price-earnings ratio is quite high. That has only become more true as Starbucks stock has rallied in recent months. With the stock now trading for more than $70, Starbucks is selling at 32 times its trailing earnings and 24 times  analysts' consensus 2019 earnings estimate.McDonald's, by comparison, is trading at 24 times its trailing earnings and 21 times its forward earnings. Restaurant Brands, (NYSE:QSR), the owner of Burger King and Tim Horton's, has around the same multiple as McDonald's. Dunkin Brands is slightly pricier than either of those, though cheaper than Starbucks. Meanwhile, the suddenly hot Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is back over 40 times its earnings despite all its problems over the past couple of years. Against that backdrop, you can make a case that SBUX stock isn't that expensive compared to its rivals. The Owners of Starbucks Stock Still Need a Lot to Go RightWhile a case can be made that the valuation of Starbucks stock is reasonable, I'd argue that's more because restaurant stocks as a whole have become overvalued.  Looking at Starbucks in isolation, rather than against its sector, it's clear that Starbucks stock is pricing in some strong growth in coming years.That said, for this year, analysts on average predict SBUX will report 6% revenue growth and 12% earnings growth. Those numbers are fine; they're quite good, in fact. for a company that is already as large as SBUX. But for a stock that's trading around 30 times its trailing earnings, that growth still isn't that impressive. Keep in mind that Starbucks is benefiting from several favorable trends - such as unusually low coffee-bean prices - that are making its earnings jump more than its revenues.Ultimately, Starbucks will find it hard to keep its price-earnings ratio this high if its revenue continues to increase around 5%. It's true that Starbucks is still trying to open a ton of stores, particularly in China. But there are limits to how many more stores it can open in many markets. This is close to a mature brand at this point, while SBUX stock is back to trading as if the company can still grow vigorously for years to come. Revamped Domestic StoresWhile China is clearly Starbucks' most important market at the moment, don't forgot about its U.S. operations. In recent years, the company has struggled to generate any same-store sales growth at home. Its mishandling of the situation in Philadelphia during which two men were wrongfully arrested didn't help matters either.Starbucks' most recent results were slightly better.  Its same-store sales growth in the U.S. market came in at 4%. Before we get too excited, however, consider that traffic at its stores was merely flat, as its sales growth was entirely caused by higher prices and a more favorable mix of products sold.Unfortunately for SBUX stock, there is a limit to how much its average check size can rise before consumers get irritated. Particularly once the economy turns down again, SBUX will have trouble using higher prices to maintain its sales growth.That's why it is so important that SBUX is focusing on getting its store traffic up again. It is using several methods to attempt to accomplish this aim, such as tinkering with its rewards program. However, its most important initiative is its decision  to reevaluate all of its domestic stores.According to CNN Business, SBUX is looking for ways  to make all its stores cater more to local demands. Busy metro areas, such as New York, need more stores where beverages ordered through the app can be easily picked up. The company found that in the Texas market, clients prefer stores with more interior lighting. In New Jersey, there will be more lounge areas for customers to hang out in the afternoons.By rebuilding its store base to meet local needs, SBUX may finally be able to get more people into its stores again. The Verdict on Starbucks StockGive credit where credit is due; Starbucks' last quarter was better than its previous few quarters. And while I'm still skeptical about the company's long-term outlook in China, so far, it is putting up decent results in the country.Additionally, I see management's efforts to overhaul its U.S. store base as a wise move. Ultimately, if SBUX stock is going to remain a compelling growth story, it needs to accelerate its same-store sales again,  and higher prices can't be relied upon to do that forever. If SBUX can get more foot traffic into its stores, particularly in off-peak hours, the outlook of Starbucks stock would greatly improve.That said, at this P/E ratio, consider me uninterested in Starbucks stock. The stock is rather sensitive to the overall economy, and should correct pretty dramatically when the economy slows. Continued trade- war jitters between the U.S. and China could also cause another drop in Starbucks stock. With SBUX stock near its all-time highs, investors can wait for a correction before buying any shares.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

Trading close to its 52-week high of $190.88, the food retailer agreed to acquire an Israeli digital startup for around $300 million. This buy should further advance the company's already-solid implementation of simple store-level technology solutions. With MCD stock valued at 21 times forward earnings, investors may look for McDonald's to accelerate its revenue growth.Source: Shutterstock For a rumored $300 million, McDonald's is getting personalization and decision-logic technology developed by Dynamic Yield. That tech will enable the fast-food purveyor to more closely match its offerings to what its consumers want. Through an outdoor digital drive-through, customers get a more-immersive, personalized experience from McDonald's menu items. And by combining the trending food items of the day, time of day, current weather, and current restaurant traffic, the technology will help guide the customer through the decision-making process.Things have certainly come a long way from &quot;would you like fries with that?&quot;.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Hybrid Brick-and-MortarMcDonald's is leveraging its brick-and-mortar retail fronts with the latest technology. What better way to compete with online-only restaurants and other firms that use apps and online channels to take orders ahead of time?  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 McDonald's will also integrate this technology into its own mobile app, self-order kiosks, and other digital consumer experience touchpoints.Ahead of the acquisition news, Cowen had noted that the restaurant chain's renovations will drive continued revenue growth. With strong earnings and sales on the way, the brokerage views MCD stock as a solid defensive play that is also appealing to fixed-income investors. Though the dividend yield of 2.5% is not high, it's still better than that offered by Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Still, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) offer dividends north of 3%. Pepsi is especially attractive because its P/E is 13.8 times, compared to 24 times with MCD stock. Growth OpportunitiesMCD's 24x P/E is low when investors consider the company's growth prospects. Restaurant additions, along with the optimization through renovations and promotions, will ensure steady revenue growth. In 2017 and 2018, the stock traded in a range because McDonald's had only started driving higher traffic growth at its locations. This year, integrating the Dynamic Yield technology and offering UberEATS at most, if not all, of its locations, will fuel higher sales.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course The beauty of UberEATS is that it increases consumer awareness for the McDonald's brand. And once the customer makes that first order, getting repeat business is easier than winning initial business from those customers. MCD Stock ValuationTraffic into fast-food restaurants is on the decline, so McDonald's must differentiate itself from competitors. As more people work from home, the population ages, and habits for eating at fast-food chains change, McDonald's must continue to adapt. The technology changes will most certainly add meaningfully to the bottom line. Offering delivery and changing the customer experience for the better will also offset the macro headwinds McDonald's faces.Analyst sentiment engine Tipranks.com shows that of the 11 analysts covering the stock, eight have a buy rating and three others have a hold. The average price target is 6% above the recent share price of around $187. Using finbox.io to model a fair value for MCD stock with a 5Y DCF growth exit model, assume revenue falls for the next two fiscal years. In this scenario, macro headwinds are hurting all fast-food chains. If revenue recovers in year 5, then McDonald's stock is trading close to fair value. In this downside scenario, MCD has a fair value that is around 5% below the current share price.Buying MCD stock today is low risk. The company continues to put its customers at the forefront of growing the business. And few firms ever fail to grow when enhancing the customer experience to drive repeat sales higher. That is the case for McDonald's stock.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-28,"In the quick service restaurant (QSR) industry, there are two recurring themes. First, low prices and high convenience always wins. Second, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is consistently one step ahead of the QSR competition in terms of delivering the lowest prices and the highest convenience. That's what keeps MCD stock one of the great QSR buys.Source: Shutterstock McDonald's consistently has outperformed over the past five years. During that stretch, MCD stock has risen nearly 100%. The S&P 500 is up just 50% over the same time frame.Meanwhile, QSR peers Yum (NYSE:YUM), Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), and Habit (NASDAQ:HABT) have all under-performed relative to MCD stock, too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis over-performance from MCD stock will continue for the foreseeable future. This is largely because McDonald's remains one step ahead of the QSR competition in terms of delivering the lowest prices and highest convenience to consumers.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 Specifically, McDonald's recent acquisition of decision technology firm Dynamic Yield puts the QSR chain ahead of the competition when it comes to integrating technology and data into brick-and-mortar operations.This integration will only increase consumer convenience by personalizing and digitizing the consumer experience. It also has the potential to lower costs through cutting labor expenses.As such, technology and data will power a bright future for McDonald's. That future will be one wherein the company will continue to dominate on price and convenience, and where MCD stock will continue to out-perform. Price and Convenience Always WinWhen it comes to the QSR industry, only two things truly matter at the end of the day: price and convenience.Just think about what a QSR is supposed to do. As the name implies, a QSR is supposed to give consumers quick food at reasonable prices. When consumers go to a QSR, their priorities are minimizing cost and maximizing convenience.Sure, consumers may also want the meal to be healthy, but if healthy were the priority, the consumer would cook at home. Consumers may also want the meal to be very tasty, but if quality were the priority and cost weren't an issue, the consumer would eat at a fancy restaurant.As such, the priorities for a consumer going to a QSR are largely restricted to price and convenience. So long as prices are low, and convenience is high, the consumer's highest priority needs are being met. That consumer is therefore likely to return when they are next seeking a low-cost, high-convenience meal or snack.Because of this, the two things that matter most in the QSR industry are price and convenience. If a QSR dominates on price and convenience, then that QSR will continue to see customer and sales growth. McDonald's Always Is One Step AheadWhen it comes to price and convenience, McDonald's has no peer in the QSR industry. This is mostly because everything McDonald's does enhances the customer value prop through lowering prices and/or elevating convenience. Importantly, McDonald's is also always one step ahead of the competition.Example 1: in 2015, McDonald's rolled out All-Day Breakfast. This was a novel breakthrough in the QSR industry that drove huge traffic growth, mostly because it increased consumer convenience (consumers could now order a McMuffin at any time of the day). Now, everyone has replicated the All-Day Breakfast initiative.Example 2: once everyone replicated the All-Day Breakfast initiative, McDonald's pivoted to revamping its menu to include fresher ingredients and healthier options. The revamp drove huge traffic growth, mostly because it increased convenience (healthier food was now available in a drive-thru setting) and lowered prices (healthier food was now being offered at McDonald's prices). Since that revamp, mostly everyone in the QSR space has adopted broad healthy menu makeovers.The next leg in this &quot;one step ahead&quot; growth narrative will come from technology and data integration. Specifically, McDonald's recently acquired decision technology firm Dynamic Yield. The plan? Take Dynamic Yield's decision technology and data analytics, and integrate it into McDonald's brick-and-mortar locations worldwide. That integration includes digital, dynamic, and data-driven ordering kiosks and drive-thru menu displays, which should create a more personalized customer experience.The result? Increased consumer convenience and lower prices. Data-driven digital ordering kiosks will make the checkout experience quicker, easier, and overall better. Further, if data-driven digital ordering kiosks are that good, then they will inevitably phase out human cashiers. That will lower labor expenses, and allow McDonald's to pass those cost savings onto consumers through lower prices. Bottom Line on MCD StockIn the QSR industry, price and convenience are most important. Thus, the QSR chain that dominates on price and convenience will be the winning QSR chain.Over the past several years, that winning QSR chain has been McDonald's, thanks to things like All-Day Breakfast and a menu revamp. McDonald's will remain that winning chain for the next several years, too, thanks to the company pioneering a new era of technology-integrated and data-driven QSR operations.Because of this, MCD stock projects as a winner for the foreseeable future. Valuation friction will rear its ugly head from time to time. But, in the big picture, the stock will remain on a healthy long term uptrend.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD.

2019-03-29,"After years on the sidelines, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has returned to the acquisition front. The Chicago-based fast-food giant announced that will buy Dynamic Yield, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup. To stay ahead of its peers, McDonald's wants to build any competitive edge it can find for MCD stock, even if it comes from far outside the restaurant industry.Source: Shutterstock However, buying this company also takes McDonald's outside of its core competency. Also, the size of the deal leads to questions on how much it will help McDonald's stock.Given the lack of potential the deal holds for changing the value proposition on MCD stock, investors should hold to their current view on the equity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos  Dynamic Yield brings AI to McDonald's Drive-ThroughsMcDonald's will buy Dynamic Yield, based in Israel, for over $300 million. The restaurant will utilize Dynamic Yield's technology at its drive-through windows, specifically on menu displays.With this AI technology, McDonald's will utilize adaptable point-of-purchase displays. This amounts to the electronic version of the displays that inspire impulse purchases at the grocery store. Items displayed will hinge on factors such as weather and the customer's choice of order.AI could easily add to profits for McDonald's as it inspires customers to add an ice cream cone during a heat wave or buy a hot chocolate during a cold spell. This purchase also builds off a recent approach to technology that includes order kiosks and Uber Eats delivery. McDonald's and the Tech BusinessIt is also the biggest acquisition by MCD in about 20 years. Still, I would question whether it changes the value proposition. For one, the deal places McDonald's in the tech business. Dynamic Yield will continue to operate as a standalone company, serving current customers which include non-restaurant retailers such as Forever 21 and IKEA.This probably speaks to the true motivation for McDonald's buying the company, instead of merely becoming a client. By owning this retail AI company, peers such as Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), or Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) will more likely lag McDonald's on implementing AI-based drive-through displays.Also, at $300 million, the deal amounts to a small fraction of the $144 billion market cap, and the $5.92 billion in net income McDonald's earned in 2018. Hence, I would not expect Dynamic Yield to have the effect that Amazon Web Services had for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). By the same token, I would expect only a marginal improvement in revenue for MCD stock.For these reasons, the deal leaves investors with little additional reason to buy or sell. MCD appears to trade near its fair value as things stand now. The forward price-to-earnings (PE) is about 21.3, slightly below S&P 500 averages.Before McDonald's announced this deal, Wall Street forecasted a 2.9% increase in profits for this year. They also predicted net income that will grow an additional 8.1% in 2020. Dynamic Yield's innovations could increase that growth somewhat.I think long-term stockholders will see the most benefit. The annual dividend currently stands at $4.64 per share. It yields around 2.5%, and the company has hiked this payout every year since 1977.Impulse purchases adding to the bottom line help ensure that the 42-year streak of dividend increases continues. Still, for everyone else, I think it will take more than a 21st-century point-of-purchase display to change the value proposition on McDonald's stock. The Bottom Line on MCD StockThe Dynamic Yield purchase should not change anyone's mind about MCD stock. Between the order kiosks and the electronic drive-thru displays, McDonald's has taken the lead among peers in adding this technology.However, it remains unclear how much success McDonald's will have in overseeing a tech company. Also, the move gives the company something amounting to a point-of-purchase display.It could lead to impulse buys which marginally boost revenue. It could also help long-term holders of MCD who depend on yearly dividend increases.

2019-04-01,"McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has upset a lot of Aussies following the burger chain's decision to roll out the McPickle Burger… which it didn't actually do because the whole announcement was an April Fool's Day prank.Source: FlickrThe restaurant announced the item in Australia and even shared pictures of the fake sandwich, which looks like a big mac but with plenty of pickles instead of the two beef patties. It also turns out that some Mickey D's fans are not exactly happy with the move.The McDonald's McPickle Burger prank fooled some fans and got them excited about a pickle-based sandwich, because that's the world we live in now.

2019-04-01,"Ever since Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) changed the way the world shops, the retail sector has been on its heels. Most brick and mortar companies are still reeling from the AMZN effect and are still scrambling to find a solution to that riddle.Source: Shutterstock Also as a result, there is confusion and misconception on Wall Street that the retail stocks are dead. This is false since there are a few winners and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is definitely one of them.In the last 12 months, SBUX and Nike (NYSE:NKE) are both up over 32%, which is three times that of the S&P 500. These are proven companies for decades and unlike typical brick-and-mortar retail, they control their inventories and margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSBUX stock went through a rough patch because of operational worries, but even those were the great kind of problems to have. Critics were on it for having long lines, but, to me, having too many clients in your store every day is a great opportunity. The people there want a daily experience more so than they want the actual coffee. The more people who line up, the more diverse the experience.  * 7 Weak Blue-Chip Stocks to Trim Immediately This is nothing you can put on a profit and loss (P&L) statement, but the proof was in the fact that this is no longer a concern for traders and clearly they voted with their actions on the stock. So from the opening salvo, you'd think that I would be recommending to buy SBUX stock right here and now, but I am not. It is up so much that now it has too much love on Wall Street. After this big a rally, SBUX stock needs everything to go right.Before you send me hatemail this is not the same as saying that &quot;short SBUX.&quot; This what I call too high to chase and too hot to short. So if I am not long it already I should wait for a better entry point even if it means that I miss out on more upside.I know that sometimes the idea is to buy high and sell higher but usually, I chase a technical trigger for that. In this case, Starbucks stock is at all-time highs heading into the April earnings. This makes it tough to spike even higher. Management would have to crush earnings and raise guidance even higher but in this uncertain geopolitical risk, I am not confident they can.The U.S. is in the throes of a tariff war with the world. SBUX stock is sensitive to that, especially in China. The consensus is that we are close to a deal with them but nothing is certain until the ink is dry. This is a fluid situation since we are dealing with volatile egos on both sides.SBUX is not cheap selling at a 32 price to earnings ratio relative to traditional retail. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Target (NYSE:TGT) sell at a 24 and 14 P/E's respectively. But the premium is justified for as long as SBUX stock continues its rally. In essence, investors get what they pay for and in this case it's half.Technically, even though I don't see an obvious trigger to chase up, SBUX stock has three support zones.Mid-January, it broke out from the $65 level into a 15% rally. Along the way, it sliced through another pivot level at $69 per share and that becomes the first level of support. If we get a dip then I look for support there first, then at $65 if it fails. The breakout from November would be the third support zone if the first two fail.So clearly SBUX stock is in favor among investors but for the short term, I see no rush to buy it.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-02,"For the past nine months, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock has been in major rally mode, as the global retail coffee giant has regained some operational momentum. SBUX has successfully carried out some key growth initiatives which together have reduced the company's competitive pressures.Source: Shutterstock The company's comparable sales and traffic trends have improved globally, and Starbucks stock has risen more than 50% from its late June 2018 lows.  * 15 Stocks to Buy Leading the Financial Charge It appears that the rally of Starbucks stock can continue deep into 2019. There are reasons to believe that its traffic trends will remain favorable for the balance of the year, and that those favorable trends will combine with really easy year-over-year comparisons to make the company's results look very good. If that scenario plays out, SBUX should report really strong numbers throughout the balance of fiscal 2019,  likely keeping SBUX stock on a winning path.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the rally of Starbucks stock is likely to be challenged by fundamental risks. Namely, the long-term growth outlook of Starbucks stock is slowing, its competitive risks are still building, and Starbucks stock is priced for perfection. At some point in time, these fundamental risks will affect SBUX, and Starbucks stock will fall.But that won't happen now. For the time being, SBUX stock looks unstoppable, as it's regaining global operational momentum. On the Bright SideSBUX stock looks unstoppable in the near-term because  its global comparable sales and traffic trends are poised to keep improving in 2019.On a global basis, its comparable-sales growth was 4% last quarter, the strongest gain since the third quarter of 2017. Meanwhile, its traffic was flat after three consecutive quarters of negative traffic growth. Furthermore, as fiscal 2019 progresses, its comparisons will only get easier, as 2018 was a year defined by largely negative traffic growth and 3%-and-under comparable sales growth.In the U.S., Starbucks has rattled off back-to-back, 4% comparable sales growth quarters for the first time since late 2016. Traffic growth was also flat last quarter after two consecutive quarters of declines. Consistent with the global narrative, the comparisons for the company's U.S. business only get easier as fiscal 2019 progresses.It's the same story in the China-Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions. Comparable sales and traffic growth hit multi-quarter highs in both areas last quarter, and the comparisons for the rest of the year in those regions will be pretty easy, too.All in all, SBUX is firing on all cylinders right now and should continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The company is leveraging digital innovation, an enhanced mobile ordering experience, renovated stores and drive-thrus, menu innovations, and relevant celebrity partnerships to win back breakfast snack and drink market share. Its strategy is working and will continue to work, mostly thanks to celebrity partnerships in 2019 and easy comparisons.Thus, Starbucks' results will remain good in 2019. As long as those numbers remain good, Starbucks stock will likely stay on a winning path. Some Things to Worry AboutAlthough SBUX stock is positioned to stay on a winning path in the near- term, Starbucks stock is facing fundamental risks which could derail the rally.The first big risk is that the company's growth is slowing. A few years back, SBUX was well-known for its track record of consistently reporting 5% or higher comparable sales growth. That streak broke in mid-2016. Since then, SBUX's quarterly comparable sales growth has not reached 5%. That won't happen anytime soon, either, as its consolidated comparable sales growth is expected to be around 3%-4% over the long-term.Some investors are buying Starbucks stock as if this company is doing as well as it ever has. But it's not. Its growth is slowing, and that's a problem.The second big risk facing Starbucks stock is that its growth will continue to slow thanks to still-strengthening competition. Specifically, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continues to expand its presence in the breakfast snack and drink category. That creates sales, traffic, and margin pressures on SBUX. Meanwhile, independent coffee shops continue to open up left and right. There's also a new craft coffee trend that could hurt Starbucks' results.Given all these competitive risks, it's likely that once the company's comparisons gets harder and its boost from celebrity partnerships cool, Starbucks' growth will  slow. When that occurs, Starbucks stock will drop.The third big risk facing Starbucks stock is valuation. SBUX stock is priced for perfection. The stock trades at 27 times analysts' consensus forward earning estimate. Over the last five years, the average forward multiple of Starbucks stock was 25, and during part of that stretch, its comparable sales growth was much higher (5% and up) than what it is expected to be over the next five years (3%-4% or lower). So the valuation of SBUX stock seems stretched at this point. Any bad news could cause the valuation of SBUX stock to drop meaningfully. The Bottom Line on Starbucks StockSBUX is a solid company, but the valuation of Starbucks stock today is overly optimistic, given the company's long-term growth outlook. As long as the company's results remain good, SBUX stock can maintain its overly optimistic valuation and head higher. Eventually, though, the company's numbers will miss expectations. When they do, SBUX could drop in a big way.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD.

2019-04-05,"I must admit that I haven't paid much attention to Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) over the past several months. After receiving a nice pop following its outstanding first-quarter earnings report, Chipotle stock mostly entered a frustrating consolidation pattern.Source: Shutterstock My initial thoughts were, here we go again! It's the same, old CMG stock, with perhaps some different seasoning sprinkled on to confuse passersby. One of the biggest reasons why I was hesitant on the trendy eatery was history.Back in the early 1990s, Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) suffered a horrific bout of food contamination. In the end, over 700 people across four states fell ill, leading to 171 hospitalizations and four deaths. It took many years, and an entirely revamped marketing campaign before customers trusted JACK.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio I wasn't alone in wondering whether Chipotle stock would suffer the same fate. Some of the similarities between CMG's food-poisoning outbreak and JACK's crisis are eerie, including the number of people affected.However, Chipotle exceeded nearly everyone's expectations. With its back against the wall, CMG stock kept fighting. Today, it's one of the strongest names on Wall Street, having gained nearly 65% year-to-date.If you speculated on the long side, congratulations! Now is a great time to sell Chipotle stock into strength. Chipotle Is OverheatedThe most obvious clue that CMG stock may face downside pressure soon is its technical chart. While technical analysis isn't exactly a uniform science, you can glean useful information from generally-accepted principles.For instance, both the relative strength indicator (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are flashing red-hot. Another confirming factor is volume. As the price for Chipotle stock rises, volume isn't following it up into the stratosphere.That tells me that most investors are in &quot;wait and see&quot; mode. If so, I wouldn't jump onboard here. Under such circumstances, the markets want to see some justification for the elevated prices. If they don't receive at least a compelling narrative, they'll likely dump CMG and search for better opportunities.Beat them at their game, and capture a premium rate for your earlier speculation. CMG Stock Is OvervaluedI've read recent analyses on Chipotle stock that suggested the low-hanging fruit in this equity is gone. I couldn't have said it any better myself.What I will do, though, is quantity my argument.   Click to EnlargeA major contributor to Chipotle's comeback story was revenue growth. Management threw everything at their rehabilitation efforts, including generous discounts and freebies. While this tactic challenged margins, it revitalized growth. In 2017, quarterly revenues grew an average 15% on a year-over-year basis.With such a robust rate, CMG stock naturally found its way back to the top. But now, I think that narrative is overcooked. For example, consider quarterly revenue growth in 2018, which has dropped down to under 9%. Contrast that to the share price, which increased over 47% last year.This year, Chipotle is up 65%, as I mentioned earlier. The burrito specialist may have produced solid numbers for its first quarter. That said, I don't think they did enough to justify that 65% premium. Again, if I'm profitable on CMG, I'd take it while the going is good. Chipotle Stock and Demographic ChallengesWith millennials representing the largest workforce right now in America, marketers are constantly seeking ways to attract them. This is a tricky endeavor under the best of circumstances. However, one thing everyone can agree on is that millennials love eating out.Another distinctive millennial trait is their thirst for authenticity. This is a generation that genuinely believes that through their choices, they can make a positive impact on the world. That being the case, attributes such as small and local are in, and big and branded are out.And how authentic is Chipotle? Probably about as authentic as a Philadelphia sushi roll, which is to say, not very.That's the problem Chipotle stock will face in the future. Over the years, millennials have earned a reputation for their pickiness and fickleness. If seasoned players like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) are constantly tweaking their menus, so must Chipotle.But I'm not seeing any substantive changes.

2019-04-06,"The first three months of 2019 were kind to shareholders of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). On April 1, the coffeehouse chain out of Seattle reached an all-time high stock price of $74.93. Year-to-date, Starbucks stock is up over 15%.Source: StarbucksIn general, winners keep winning in the stock market. Starbucks has a great core business and its stock is likely to keep rewarding investors well into the future.Here is why …InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Starbucks Stock Has Robust FundamentalsThe coffee giant whose history dates back to 1971, went public in 1992. Since its initial public offering (IPO), SBUX stock has had impressive growth, well over 22,000%. Over the years, the stock has split several times; it has also been paying dividends since 2010.The current dividend yield in Starbucks stock stands at 2.0%.On Jan. 24, Starbucks reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, buoyed by strong holiday sales. The earnings came at 75 cents per share, an increase of over 15% from the year-ago quarter.Within the quarter, membership in its loyalty program, My Starbucks Rewards, has almost doubled, too. Similarly, in 2018, its U.S. gift card sales went up by 12% to $2.6 billion. Following the upbeat conference call, Starbucks raised its guidance for fiscal 2019 earnings.  * 10 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Avoid During the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on March 20, the company introduced a new $2 billion stock repurchase program that will be completed by June 2019. Management discussed several customer-friendly changes to its loyalty program, too. Wall Street also noted the various steps SBUX is taking to make the company reach more environment-friendly goals in sustainability, recycling and composting.Finally, Starbucks announced its first-ever investment in a growth-oriented private equity fund, Valor Siren Ventures. This fund focuses on retail technologies and innovation, an area that may help Starbucks serve its retail clients better. Although the result of all the steps on the SBUX stock price would possibly require some time to materialize, the week following this Investor Day presentation, its price has already reached a new all-time high. Power of the Starbucks BrandLong-term investors should also consider the strength of the group's brand: Starbucks is regarded as the &quot;most valuable&quot; restaurant brand. From its early days onward, the company's brand identity has centered around offering customers a relaxing and quality experience, especially within the store itself.Strong brands give a company increased ability to enter new markets and to raise prices, boosting revenue growth. Currently, SBUX derives most of its revenue from high-margin specialty drinks. Indeed, a 2013 research report concluded that Starbucks customers would be willing to pay more for their coffees.And the power of the brand makes Starbucks stock a favorite with a range of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, increasing the demand for the stock. For example, the largest ETF holder of SBUX is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), with approximately 13.87 million shares. On an anecdotal note, according to Robinhood, a trading app, Starbucks stock is one of the most popular on its trading platform. Starbucks' Long-Term Ambitions in ChinaInvestors in the Starbucks stock would certainly be relying on the power of the company's brand as it increases its presence in China. As of early 2019, Starbucks has over 3,500 stores in China, making the country its second-largest market after the U.S. SBUX is expected to open almost 600 stores a year, a rather ambitious growth projection.Before China, the group's international expansion began in 1986 in Japan, followed by the U.K. in 1998. It opened its first Chinese store in 1999. Over the past three decades, SBUX, which in some ways has introduced the European coffee culture to the U.S. consumer, became the brand that has made coffee drinking a regular daily routine in many cities globally. Now it wants to dominate the Chinese coffee shop market, too.Traditionally, China is a tea-drinking country. Coffee growers and chains like Starbucks are excited by the potential in the country as the market is expected to grow almost 10% per year. The group's biggest competitor is the homegrown chain Luckin Coffee, which relies on its popular app to order and pay as well as its convenient pick-up and delivery.According to Starbucks' Jan. 24 earnings call, the same-store sales in China were up 1% for the quarter. However, as the number of Chinese transactions was down 2%, SBUX's premium prices and not more foot traffic drove up the results. Management is optimistic regarding the long-term-potential China offers. Nonetheless, investors may want to wait for the release of the next quarterly report in late April to assess the possible effect of an economic slow down in China on Starbuck's earnings as well as the stock price. What Could Derail the SBUX Stock Price?The U.S. coffee shop market is fast approaching a $50 billion valuation. Yet, over the past few years, the coffee chain space has become quite saturated. SBUX's main chain competitors now include McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN). In the retail space that includes dry coffee goods, SBUX competes with Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), which owns the Maxwell House brand and J M Smucker (NYSE:SJM), which owns the Folgers brand.From these big names to smaller high-end local specialty coffee shops, competition is aiming to take a slice of SBUX's market share, either by undercutting Starbucks on price or offering a different and &quot;better&quot; in-store customer experience. The company's market share among leading U.S. coffee chains is an impressive 40%. However, if Starbucks management fails to underestimate the potential threat from any of the competitors, the stock price may easily take a pause.In the more immediate weeks, there might also be some profit taking in Starbucks stock. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that SBUX's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;In April and May, Starbucks stock may trade sideways for several weeks, and even have a pullback toward the low-$70's or even high-$60's level, where the stock is likely to find major support.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find SBUX stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I 'd expect the shares to reach $90.Therefore, if you already own SBUX stock, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider protecting your portfolio with a covered call. For example, you could consider buying 100 shares of SBUX at $74.35 (closing price on Apr. 4) and at the same time selling a SBUX July 19 $75 call option, which currently trades at $2.8. The $75 option is slightly out-of-the-money (OTM), offering downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in SBUX stock.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards This call option would stop trading on July 19, 2019 and expire on July 20. The Bottom Line on SBUXWhen investors buy a stock, they pay that purchase price for a claim against that company's future earnings, with the view that their investment will generate returns that will beat those of the broader stock market over the long term.Are more gains ahead for Starbucks stock? It's impossible to know for sure, but there are reasons to believe that the stock price could see new highs. Although there might be some profit-taking in the coming weeks, any dip in the price of Starbucks stock could be regarded as an opportunity to go long in SBUX.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-08,"Bulls continue to dominate the Street. Last week's muscle-flexing was simply the latest evidence of their reign. Today's gallery will help you embrace the trend by offering up three food stocks to buy.As you might expect after a week where buyers ran the table, my weekend scanning revealed uptrends galore. And many of them offer chart patterns worthy of mention. While the sector representation was as diverse as usual, I did notice one particular theme - food stocks.Pizza, burgers and jelly all made an appearance on this week's stocks to buy list. While one sits a stone's throw from record highs, the other two have only just recently gotten their mojo back.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards All three boast lower-risk setups if you want to add some nutrition to your portfolio. Let's take a closer look. Food Stocks to Buy: McDonald's (MCD)Source: ThinkorSwim McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) tops the list and deservedly so. The long-term trend is gorgeous and last week's ramp ushered it to the brink of a big-league breakout. Momentum increased during its most recent upswing confirming buyers are strengthening their grip.Since mid-November, MCD stock has been consolidating in a trading range that is now on the cusp of completing. The series of higher swing lows reveals increasing buying appetite and have morphed the box into more of an ascending triangle.For the past six weeks, distribution days have disappeared showing zero institutional distribution. Throw it all together, and the wind is at buyers' backs.If you think the trend continues, then buy the June $190/$200 bull call spread for $3.90 J M Smucker Co (SJM)Source: ThinkorSwim The past two-and-a-half years have seen a sloppy downtrend descend on J M Smucker (NYSE:SJM) shares. From peak to trough, the food company fell 42%. But if recent price action is any indication, the worst is over. Last month's breakout above the 200-day moving average scored solid followthrough. The upside thrust was enough to turn the 20-day and 50-day moving averages higher.And since pole-vaulting higher, SJM stock hasn't given back an inch. The two-week high base pattern has the stock itching for an upside breakout.Volume patterns are lending a hand to the bullish argument as well. Accumulation days litter the landscape, suggesting the big boys are now net buyers.  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio SJM options aren't that liquid, so I suggest buying shares outright if you think the new uptrend sticks. Papa John's (PZZA)Source: ThinkorSwim Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) rounds out today's tasty trio with a bull flag pattern. Like SJM, it too has been brought low in recent years. But this year's rebound looks promising. PZZA stock is up 28% year-to-date and sits above all major moving averages.The increasing momentum seen during its latest upswing coupled with multiple accumulation days also has me leaning in favor of buyers. Rather than purchasing the stock now, however, I suggest waiting to see if we can clear the $54 resistance zone. The descending trendline that has defined its downtrend since late-2016 rests in this area and needs to be taken out before the long-term chart is a buy.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-09,"Looking back at 2018, we thought that was a big year for marijuana stocks…as voters approved marijuana (to varying degrees) in four more U.S. states -- Oklahoma, Michigan, Missouri and even Utah -- not to mention Canada.But 2019 will be a HUGE year.On the path to widespread legalization -- and huge gains for us as investors -- even more &quot;dominos&quot; are about to fall. Seven of them, in fact.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Catalyst 1: The STATES ActThe first step toward ending federal prohibition could happen this month…as soon as Congress votes on the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act.Essentially, the STATES Act would formally entrust marijuana laws to the states. As long as residents follow their state's laws, the federal government would not be able to intervene.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Momentum is building -- it's a bipartisan bill that's picking up cosponsors left and right. The Chair of the House Rules Committee is confident that it will come to the House floor &quot;within the next several weeks.&quot;The STATES Act removes two big hurdles:* Right now, few banks are lending to marijuana companies. The federal &quot;red tape&quot; is just too prohibitive. But once the Feds are no longer interfering…those floodgates will open.In fact, a separate bill is already on its way to the House floor -- the SAFE Banking Act -- that does just that.* Investors will soon have many more options for investing in the marijuana megatrend -- as more companies will be able to make the &quot;Jump&quot; I'll be covering in a special event tonight. Please click here to RSVP to my Cannabis Stock Summit…then tune in at 7 p.m. ET to hear all about it. Catalyst 2: 2020 ElectionsRight now, we have 12 governors in office who ran on pro-marijuana platforms.And 2020 will be the first presidential race with a focus on candidates' views of marijuana and legalization.With two-thirds of adults in the country in favor of legalization, it is becoming more politically damaging not to support it. An eye-opening 75% of Democrats support legalization, and odds are that every candidate from that party will side with the majority of their voters. Even more astounding is that for the first time, over half (53%) of Republicans now back the legalization of marijuana. Catalyst 3: President TrumpI do not get into my personal political views when it comes to my commentary and investing. My goal here is to help you make money. It doesn't matter what political party is in control.Marijuana is a bipartisan issue…in what could be a very close presidential election. President Trump has said he will &quot;probably end up supporting&quot; the STATES Act. I wouldn't be surprised to see President Trump push medical-marijuana legalization nationwide, as long as it could be the deciding factor behind a Republican win.That's great news for Pot &quot;Jumper&quot; Stocks…and for investors who stand to turn a small stake in them into a windfall. You'll be well-positioned to do just that after tonight -- when I share my 1 pick to buy now. Catalyst 4: Marijuana Declassified as Schedule 1 DrugIt's only a matter of time before the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) moves marijuana down from a Schedule 1 drug (like heroin, LSD and ecstasy) to a Schedule 5 drug (like Robitussin, which we can buy anywhere).Marijuana's removal from Schedule 1 will clearly be a major boost to the industry, and I'd expect to see many more pot stocks make the &quot;Jump.&quot;What's more, it will also allow for more medical testing of marijuana at universities and research centers, which will lead to even more positive medicinal breakthroughs. Catalyst 5: GlobalizationAt a cannabis conference I attended in January, several CEOs referenced overseas opportunities - from more legalization in the European Union to cheap grow facilities in South America to opportunities in Africa and Australia.The odds of a European country legalizing recreational marijuana in 2019 are above 50/50. Whichever country is first will set itself up for big profits. Marijuana tourism is booming, and it is very easy to country hop for residents in Europe. Catalyst 6: BrandingThink about any consumer good and you immediately think of the most popular brands. Soft drinks - Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Fast food - McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). Athletic wear - Nike (NYSE:NKE). Coffee - Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). And so on.As more products hit the shelves and the marijuana industry starts to mature, there is no doubt that a few brands will rise to the top. Right now, every company that produces consumer cannabis products is angling to top that list. And a key step is attracting more investment dollars by making the &quot;Jump&quot; I'll be discussing in tonight's event. Catalyst 7: Hemp and CBDThe medical and legal establishments are coming around to hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) oil…the non-psychoactive &quot;cousin&quot; of marijuana that won't get you high.CBD has been used by wellness and medical professionals for years as an alternative treatment for everything from anxiety and depression to chronic pain to the reduction of inflammation to childhood epilepsy. CBD is now considered one of the most beneficial compounds available to humans, and it does not have the nasty side effects that many drugs do.Producing hemp CBD wasn't easy -- until now.The 2018 U.S. Farm Bill removed hemp from the DEA's Schedule 1 drug list for the first time since the 1930s. So, you can expect hemp-derived CBD products to hit the shelves in Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Whole Foods, and every other major store. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) have already announced that they will start selling topical CBD.Notice how these catalysts are all driven by the increasing number of states and nations that are legalizing marijuana. Any time governments open up a huge new market like legal marijuana, investors can win very big. We're already seeing that, and there is a lot more to come -- as more and more pot stocks make the &quot;Jump.&quot;I'm hard at work today, wrapping up my presentation with everything you need to know about Pot Jumper Stocks…Be sure to tune in tonight at 7 p.m. ET, when I'll clue you in to this phenomenon -- and even give away my next stock pick, for free.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2019-04-09,"After multiple food-poisoning scandals, I couldn't confidently see a case for Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) to recover. Obviously, I was wrong. Chipotle stock is one of the strongest publicly traded companies this year, having soared 67% since the beginning of January. So why then am I still bearish on its prospects?Source: Shutterstock In fact, a couple days ago, I discussed my three reasons to sell CMG stock. Contrary to initial gut reactions on the internet, I don't have anything against Chipotle. I love their fresh ingredients and lightning-quick service. It's a great place to placate your hunger when you're tight on time.But these factors don't make Chipotle stock a reasonable investment at current prices. Again, shares are up 67% year-to-date. Without any context, you instinctively recognize that CMG needs a fresh batch of supportive evidence to justify the risk.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards This is where I'm hesitant in recommending CMG stock. Although the underlying company's recovery efforts are nothing short of supremely impressive, the markets don't run indefinitely on past achievements. As things stand, shares are technically overheated. Fundamentally, no clear justification exists to support such a premium.Nevertheless, Chipotle stock continues to defy gravity, attracting more buyers to its cause. Still, I'd urge caution. Here are three additional reasons why I'm not convinced on the fast-casual eatery's prospects: Growth? What Growth?Back during the immediate aftermath of the food-poisoning controversies, Chipotle stock belonged decisively in the speculation category. However, the company eventually attracted fundamental investors with its strong growth trajectory.In the first quarter of 2016, revenue dipped to an alarming, multi-year low of $834.5 million. But for its most recent fiscal report in Q4 2018, CMG boasted $1.23 billion in sales. From the lows, this surge represents a growth rate of 47%.Without any context, that's an impressive performance. But what takes the shine off this coating is that CMG stock was on a clear, upside trajectory prior to the scandals. In Q3 2015, the fast-casual restaurant rang up $1.22 billion in sales. If we use this figure as a comparative baseline, then Q4 2018's revenue haul was up less than 0.7%.In other words, Chipotle is only substantively growing compared against the crisis framework. But against the normal framework, the company spent three years getting back to even ground.Don't get me wrong: management did an excellent job keeping the organization afloat. But I doubt Wall Street will continue driving up CMG stock based on a return to business as usual. Industry Headwinds Will Slow Chipotle StockA natural comeback against my last point is that management needed time to rehabilitate their brand's image. Moving forward, this is where they will start putting meat on the table.I appreciate this argument. Furthermore, I'd be willing to give it credibility if it weren't for the fact that the restaurant industry itself is under pressure. According to experts in the field, the entire restaurant segment will likely grow but at a slower pace.In particular, fast-casual and quick-service restaurants may notice a slowdown from 5.1% growth in 2018 to 4.9% this year. While individual names could upset this dynamic in either direction, the forecasted deceleration aligns with broader sector trends.For example, retail sales in restaurants and other eating places totaled $54.4 billion in December 2018. This represented year-over-year growth of 4.5%. But in December 2017, restaurant revenues increased by more than 4.7% YOY.Yes, these are small percentage declines. But it's in the granularity where you find the real narrative. Right now, the data is telling us that Chipotle's industry is steadily slowing. Thus, it's a great time to sell Chipotle stock into strength before everyone else catches on. CMG Stock Is Vulnerable to a RecessionPersonally, I don't want to expound upon my final point because it makes me look like a negative Nancy. But in the interests of covering all angles, I must address the pink elephant in the room.Chipotle's turnaround efforts are not only impressive, but inspiring. The company employs many people, providing vital opportunities across the nation. That said, nothing occurs in a vacuum. To paraphrase Sir Isaac Newton's scientific work, for every action, there is a reaction.In Chipotle's case, the leadership team did everything necessary to jumpstart traffic and boost sales. Unfortunately, though, that move comes at a cost to profitability. Just look at gross margin or net margin from full year 2015 to 2018: you can fit the Grand Canyon in those gaps.I'm not second-guessing management as their decision was the only viable one. But it doesn't take away from the fact that if a recession strikes, Chipotle stock is in trouble. After all, competitors like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) or Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) spent the last three years growing their businesses, not recovering from a crisis.I genuinely hope that we don't fall into an economic downturn because it does none of us any good. Still, it's a real possibility, which is another reason to sell CMG stock at its current premium.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-12,"Shares of fast casual Mexican eatery Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) have been on a tear since February of 2018. At that point in time, Chipotle stock bottomed at $250 before former Taco Bell executive Brian Niccol took over as CEO.Source: Shutterstock Ever since, Niccol has executed flawlessly on multiple growth initiatives, the sum of which have driven Chipotle to report its best numbers ever since the infamous E. coli outbreak. Consequently, CMG stock has nearly tripled over that same stretch, and today finally trades near its pre-E. coli highs.Although the Chipotle turnaround is very real, and the company is firing on all cylinders, this mega-rally in CMG stock may be on its last legs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhy? Many reasons, ranging from valuation to slowing growth concerns. Put together, all these concerns paint an outlook for CMG stock that isn't all that great.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives With that in mind, let's take a look at four reasons to sell CMG stock on this big rally. Too Far, Too FastBroadly speaking, CMG has simply come too far, too fast.The stock has nearly tripled over the past fourteen months. That's a big rally on its own, but a big portion of this rally has happened recently, with the stock up 85% since Christmas 2018. That's a near 100% rally in just over three months.Because of this big rally, Chipotle stock is now in technically overbought territory, with a Relative Strength Index that is as high as its been pretty much ever and a stock price that is nearly as far as its ever been above its 200-day moving average.All of these overbought conditions, and the stock is heading into earnings season. That means the numbers need to be really good in order for the stock to hold onto its gains. If they aren't really good, the stock could drop in a big way. Valuation FrictionI follow a lot of stocks, and Chipotle is now close to being the most richly valued restaurant stock I've ever seen that isn't growing revenues at a 20%-plus rate.Chipotle stock trades at nearly 60-times forward earnings. The giants in this space, like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Yum (NYSE:YUM), Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK), and Domino's (NYSE:DPZ), trade around 20- to 30-times forward earnings. The sector average forward multiple is 24.To be sure, the fast growers like Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) and Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) trade around 100-times forward earnings, but both of those companies are projected to do 20%-plus revenue growth this year. Chipotle is projected at a much more mundane 9% sales growth this year, which is pretty much the same as McDonald's and Domino's.True, there is a big margin expansion narrative at play here, but even if you model that narrative out, there still isn't enough long term profit power here to justify a $700-plus price tag. Economic Slowdown and Chipotle StockAlthough stocks are rallying to all time highs, the economy is still slowing, U.S. consumer sentiment is still below where it was for most of 2018, and sales across the restaurant industry haven't been all that great to start 2019.Inevitably, this slowdown will catch up to Chipotle. The company is firing on all cylinders right now thanks to digital business expansion, menu innovations, and a new marketing campaign. But, those tailwinds will cool in 2019 as they mature and come against tougher laps. When that happens, a slowing economy will start to show up in Chipotle's numbers, and that could have a materially negative impact on the stock. Mysterious E. coli OutbreakTo be clear, there has been an E. coli outbreak in the United States, a source has not been identified, and Chipotle hasn't been mentioned by any reports. It's also highly unlikely that Chipotle is the source of this outbreak.Having said that, there is an E. coli outbreak happening right now, and the last major E. coli outbreak in the U.S. was Chipotle's fault. I don't think consumers have entirely forgotten that. Consequently, when consumers hear E. coli outbreak today, they naturally get a little bit worried about Chipotle. This worry may have a negative impact on the numbers in April and May, and that could provide a drag on Chipotle stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD and DPZ.

The economy is going strong, the labor market is tight and that means good things for disposable income.As a result, a number of consumer-oriented food companies are doing quite well right now. Are they about to fizzle out or is the run just getting started?That varies by company, but with only tepid inflation impacting costs and bringing in technology to improve supply chain operations and efficiencies, many companies continue to churn out impressive results. Whether that's on the comparable-store sale side or the bottom line (or both).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks That Can Outperform for Years Let's quit wasting space and get on with the list of fast food stocks that have been on fire! Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)  Click to EnlargeMan, what is going on with the burrito? Investors should print out the chart for Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and label it &quot;lesson for stubborn short sellers.&quot;No matter what the bearish thesis is, it doesn't matter. Some shoot against Chipotle on a fundamental and valuation basis. Others note how overbought the stock has become. But none of these facts matter because the market can act irrational for far longer than expected. That's why discipline is so important and the only real factor to remember is price.Look, I get it. Chipotle reported earnings on February 6th, beating on earnings and revenue expectations. However, do earnings of just $1.72 per share and revenue growth of 10.4% justify an overbought condition for two months and a $194 (37%) rally in the stock?No, but that's what momentum can do to a stock.So what now? Obviously the risk/reward here does not favor those initiating a new long position. However, it's clear that -- short of a food-borne illness breakout -- Chipotle is back in investors' good graces.Eventually CMG stock will tire and it's a question of how much this one will pullback, not if it will do so. So far, it's been following its trends pretty well and luckily, it's a name we've liked since January. A pullback into the 50-day will likely attract some buyers and while I'm not sure if we get a $120 decline down to $600, but that could be a solid level of support too. Near $606 is the 38.2% retracement for the 2019 range.Watch for this one on a pullback. Starbucks (SBUX)  Click to EnlargeNot quite as strong as the Chipotle rally, but one clearly with caffeine fueling its run is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Earlier this week, I highlighted Starbucks stock as it was knocking on $75 resistance. I said that it's hard to get too bearish on Starbucks given its momentum, despite how much it's rallied in the past few months and quarters.Now pushing over $75, shares are definitely overbought. But as we just saw with Chipotle, that condition can persist for quite some time. If Starbucks stock rallies into earnings on April 25th though, it will become a strong candidate for a sell-the-news event.If the U.S. business can continue to buoy Starbucks' business until the Chinese business re-accelerates, SBUX could have plenty of upside over the long term. For now though, estimates predict 6.3% revenue growth this year and 7.8% growth next year. Earnings are forecast to grow 11.6% this year and 12.2% next year. For this, investors are paying almost 28 times this year's earnings.The bears will quickly point out that this valuation is stretched and given the stock's near-60% rally from the summer lows, that claim has some validity. But SBUX is a cash cow with strong margins and continued growth. That cash is being used to fuel an aggressive rollout in growth-hungry China, buy back large chunks of stock and put through huge increases in the dividend.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Until the trend fades, SBUX stock is a buy-on-dips name.  McDonald's (MCD)  Click to EnlargeMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is likely the first stock that comes to mind when talking about fast food stocks.The Golden Arches are almost never a bad choice when looking for a long-term investment. Sure it goes through lulls and at times the stock is overvalued, but at the end of the day, its products are in demand. It doesn't matter about the trends in gluten or impossible burgers. Customers still want a Big Mac or McDouble with fries and that demand isn't going to fade.As a result, MCD rings up billions a year in profits. Before its most recent earnings report where McDonald's missed revenue expectations, it had beaten top- and bottom-line expectations nine quarters in a row. That &quot;miss&quot; though was by just $1.6 million on a consensus estimate of more than $5 billion.It shows just how incredibly consistent MCD has been over the last few years. While shares are hovering near all-time highs, the charts still look constructive and I would love a buyable pullback should this $187 to $188 area not buoy the name. The average price target hovers near $200, giving investors decent upside should it get there.Plus, McDonald's is one of the best dividend names you can own. Wendy's (WEN)  Click to EnlargeAside from having a savage social media account, Wendy's (NYSE:WEN) stock has been doing well too. $18 had been resistance for almost a year before WEN stock finally pushed through it earlier this year.Wendy's has come up short of revenue estimates in four of the last six quarters, but after a volatile two years, expectations are settling down a bit.Analysts expect 4.9% revenue growth this year and 4.3% growth next year. On the earnings front, estimates call for 5.1% growth this year and a whopping 22.6% growth next year. If Wendy's stock can maintain momentum for the next few quarters, investors may really start to feast on this one in anticipation of that big earnings growth next year.  * 3 Solar Stocks to Buy for a New Day in Solar Energy Should it lose $18 though, look for support to come into play near the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). While not quite as a high as MCD's 2.45% dividend yield, Wendy's 2.2% payout isn't unattractive after a 17.6% bump in February. Domino's Pizza (DPZ)  Click to EnlargeFor years, Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) couldn't be stopped. The pizza maker was one of the first food companies to really embrace technology in a meaningful way. Consumers could place delivery and pickups order in a snap on the app and website. This not only gave a boost to revenue as more customers climbed aboard thanks to the convenience of online ordering, but it also gave a lift to margins. Domino's had less mistakes on its orders and therefore wasted less product.While the stock was a steady beast for many years, that hasn't been the same story over the past year. The stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months, but that may lead to big gains if DPZ can regain its prior momentum.On the weekly chart, you can see that these multi-month bull flags are not uncommon for DPZ. A break out of this pattern and a close over the 50-week moving average could ignite the stock to $300 and above.Analysts expect 9.7% revenue growth this year and next year, and earnings growth of 11.3% this year and 17.2% next year. If DPZ can deliver on these expectations (and perhaps more), maybe that will be enough to get the stock moving higher. Others say the stock's too cheap, so take your pick.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long SBUX.

2019-04-17,"The news surrounding Boeing (NYSE:BA) is no secret at this point. The 737 MAX has some serious issues that have resulted in massive backlash against the jet maker. To be honest, Boeing stock hasn't suffered as big of a blow as some would have thought, as support continues to lift BA.Source: Shutterstock Does that mean it's time to buy? Let's look at what's happening. Boeing's 737 MAX IssueLast fall, a 737 MAX operated by Lion Air crashed, killing all on board. There were concerns by pilots, but it didn't stop airlines from keeping the 737 MAX operating in their fleet. Another accident involving the 737 Max occurred in March, with Ethiopian Air suffering a crash, leaving no survivors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Marijuana Companies: Which Pot Stocks Should You Buy? This caused the industry to awake from its slumber, with countries and airlines quickly grounding their 737 MAX fleet. This is a terrible optic for the aircraft manufacturer, and it's about to hit Boeing's bank account.For a moment, forget about the possible order cancellations, potentially lower prices and lawsuits Boeing will face. According to their first-quarter deliveries report, the company did not log one new order for the 737 MAX in March. This isn't some hokey jet at the bottom of its catalog, either. The MAX is Boeing's fastest-selling unit right now. For the order line to dry up instantly says everything about what the industry thinks about the embattled airplane.If the solution isn't a simple software fix, Boeing's sales and earnings could be at stake. Not that it will bankrupt the company, but it will cause some investors to rethink Boeing stock in the near term.More likely than not, BA will get through the 737 MAX issue in the same way that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) or Disney (NYSE:DIS) and other blue-chip names get through issues like this. But that doesn't mean it may not suffer more before moving past it. Trading BA Stock Price  Click to Enlarge The 737 MAX has become a short-term focus, but it could become a longer-term worry.  That's why we're looking at two charts, the six-month daily (above) and a 30-month weekly chart (below). I have updated these charts from my prior outlook earlier this month.As you can see on the short-term chart, Boeing stock continues to bounce with each test of that $362-ish level. It's just above the 200-day moving average at $359, but BA stock is struggling to move higher. It put in a lower high earlier this month when it failed to reclaim the 50 DMA. If momentum fades here, it will secure another lower high and increase the odds that shares will break below support.Then what?That's where the longer-term chart comes into play. There's support in the low $360s, while the 50-week moving average is at $357.  Click to Enlarge This 50-week/200-day combo should be enough to buoy Boeing stock on its first test. However, if there's a gap down below this level, BA stock may quickly find itself back in its prior range.This rangebound action persisted for most of 2018, keeping the Boeing stock price between $315 and $360. The occasional break below range support was met with buyers, and you can see how BA shares have been finding prior-range resistance as current support.If support does hold up, we need to see the Boeing stock price push through the 10-week moving average and get above its 50 DMA. Until then, a break below prior resistance/current support is a possibility. Bottom Line on BA StockBoeing stock will report earnings on April 24. It's hard to imagine investors finding a sudden wave of confidence ahead of that report. The only exception? Perhaps management giving the all-clear and global airlines announcing the re-addition of the 737 MAX to their fleet.Estimates currently call for revenue to grow 2.4% to $23.95 billion in the quarter, driving earnings of $3.59 per share. This EPS estimate calls for a 1.4% decline year-over-year, and has fallen from $4.30 per share over the last 30 days, a 16.5% decline.The full-year estimates have also come down, although not as much. Full-year expectations now call for earnings of $17.81 per share. This is down almost 12% over the past 30 days from $20.21 per share. However, this would represent growth of more than 11% YOY, while revenue is still expected to grow 4.6% for 2019.BA is still a cash flow machine. It runs a very profitable outfit and has a deep backlog of new orders. Even with the disruption to the 737 MAX, this backlog should remain robust and keep Boeing's long-term trajectory intact.

2019-04-25,"Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been monstrous lately. CMG is a restaurant company yet Chipotle stock trades like a technology momentum stock.Source: Shutterstock But this wasn't always the case. In 2015, Chipotle stock was soaring to $750 per share, but then it hit a giant roadblock and then it collapsed 60% from high to low.Last night, management delivered a strong earnings report that was reminiscent of the old days. CMG beat on all metrics and raised guidance. And the company delivered double-digit growth. Furthermore, it doubled its digital sales, which shows us that they seem to be making all the right moves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the way up, CMG stock commanded a premium because of the incredible comparable sales the company was able to deliver. So it earned it for as long as it delivered the growth.  * The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now When I'm evaluating a growth company I don't worry so much about the profitability for as long as they are growing.But then the food illness headlines broke out and the problems caused the comps to fade. The fall was severe as the headlines kept on coming. Wall Street took back the premium out of the stock.2018 was a terrible year for the whole stock market, but the S&P 500 bottomed on Christmas. Yet, Chipotle stock didn't hit its bottom until earlier this year when it reported earnings.And that marked the absolute bottom that's $247 per share. The stock had finally found value and the buyers stepped in.On the way up, once the bulls broke through the lower high trend line first at $322 and then at $360 per share, the rally was on.As a result, it came into the earnings up 171% from the bottom. Year-to-date CMG stock is up 65% versus the S&P's 17%. It is also up twice more than Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) and five-times better than McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).Maybe this out-performance justifies the valuation that CMG now carries. Its price-to-earnings ratio is 115, which is almost five times that of MCD's. How to Approach Chipotle StockAt these altitudes, one needs a lot of conviction to start buying CMG shares. I don't have such gumption. Especially not when the S&P 500 is at all-time highs. Buying it up here means that the investor is committed to holding the stock for a really long time.True, CMG stock is approaching its all-time highs. But therein lies a danger. The closer it gets to the accident scene the more likely it is to fade. There are a lot of investors who have been stuck at the highs who may decide to exit.Therefore it makes more sense that as it rises here after the earnings it could run into resistance. Getting into Chipotle stock over $700 would be risky short term. This is not an obvious entry point.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks with More Than Enough Upside This is nothing against the company itself but rather doubt of the price action that will unfold up here. And it's definitely not saying to short it either. Doing so opens the trader up to unlimited losses. Those who insist on shorting it should use put options where the out-of-pocket exposure is finite.However, CMG could be a trading vehicle for those who prefer trading it shorter term.As CMG continues to slog higher, there will be resistance as it nears $725 per share. This was a major ledge from which it collapsed in October 2015. The onus is on the bulls to prove they can retake it and establish it as support once again.Conversely, if CMG falls below the $685 zone it could trigger a bearish pattern that would target the prior pivot zone around $620. Then there is the open gap all the way to $540 per share. This is not a forecast, but it is a bearish scenario that I should know.In summary, this is a stock that is too high to Chase and too hot to short at these altitudes. For those who are already long CMG, the price action here is great news.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-25,"Although I can understand the longer-term case for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), I've never in my adult years liked their food. However, curiosity got the better of me in recent months, and I decided to give their offerings a chance. Surprisingly, my InvestorPlace colleague Will Ashworth was right: their food has improved significantly, which theoretically bolsters the case for McDonald's stock.Source: Shutterstock Actually, it's not theoretical at all. Just pull up a recent chart of MCD stock, which proves that many investors are loving it. Since the beginning of this year, shares have jumped decisively into double-digit territory. Granted, the fast-food giant suffered turbulence early into 2019, but since mid-February, MCD gained more than 8%.At the same time, McDonald's stock has risen against significant headwinds. Millennials no longer care about the brand, and demographically, this circumstance will likely worsen. Among burger joints, the &quot;Golden Arches&quot; is losing out to Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) from a consumer sentiment standpoint. Finally, other fast-food brands like Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) compete fiercely for those fickle consumer dollars.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside Seemingly, if there's any time to sell MCD stock into strength, it's right now. And that's exactly what I'm going to tell you. Here are three reasons why: Shrinking Markets Will Strangle McDonald's StockIn my studies regarding technical analysis, one of the clear signs to watch out for is lack of confirmation. Typically, if shares rise, you want to see volume lift higher accordingly. If not, you have a mismatch: the volume is not confirming the bullishness in the share price.With McDonald's stock, we have a similar dynamic. Indeed, shares have been rising while overall volume levels have declined. But I'm more interested in the fundamentals not matching technical enthusiasm. For me to get interested in MCD at this juncture, I need to see a viable growth plan. Unfortunately, I see the opposite.Most people who follow MCD stock realize that annual revenues have steadily declined for the better part of this decade. Of course, this is to be expected as management wrestles with a changing landscape in the fast-food industry.What isn't expected, though, is that the iconic burger joint hasn't made progress in any market. Since 2013, the domestic segment revenue is down more than 13%. Leading international markets are down 11%. High-growth regions are down more than 43%. Finally, what MCD calls foundational markets and corporate sales are down nearly 52%.The one small exception is leading international markets since 2016, which has produced modest sales growth of 5.3%. But that's just too pedestrian to justify the soaring McDonalds stock price. No Viable Opportunities with MillennialsI have some simple math for you, not the fuzzy kind that former President George W. Bush likes: millennials represent the largest demographic in the U.S. labor force. If you're going to win in any retail segment, you must win over millennials.But as I previously mentioned, the McDonalds brand hasn't remained relevant. But it's not just about the failure to bring customers into their stores, which is already bad enough. Instead, the company no longer has social cachet.According to a Quartz article from two years ago, only 20% of millennials have ever tried a Big Mac. If you're one of the 20%, the Big Mac is the company's marquee burger. Do I have to even have to explain what that tells you about the longer-term challenges awaiting McDonald's stock?If that's the case with millennials, what about the incoming Generation Z? Furthermore, as millennials start having babies, those future consumers will likely not care at all about the fast-food icon. Of course, that's way down the road, but you get my point: If you can't win the young market, it's unlikely you'll resonate with the younger market. Signature-Crafted Volatility for MCD StockJust recently, management made a startling announcement: they're getting rid of their signature-crafted burgers. Instead, they'll focus on simpler (i.e., cheaper) quarter-pounder options.  * The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now Earlier, when I said that I tried their food for the first time in a long time, I was referring to the signature-crafted burgers. Especially for a fast-food joint, they're a cut above the competition. I was genuinely impressed. However, it doesn't matter what I think if other customers aren't buying them.Of course, management put their corporate spin on the issue. They're claiming that they're focusing on what their customers want, which is great. The problem here is that MCD tacitly admitted that their consumer base is declining. Worse yet, their efforts to capture the youth market have failed.I'm not saying that MCD stock is a bad investment. What I am saying is that it's a bad investment at over $190 a pop. The company needs a compelling growth narrative to have me interested. Right now, it does have such a narrative, but only for the bears.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-30,"Tuesday's action just goes to show how strong the stock market has been. Despite an 8% drop in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) following its earnings disappointment, the stock market was down but holding up pretty well. Eventually it took a tumble in what looked like it may be the start to the pullback so many have been hoping for.Instead, the markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 about flat on the day. The action is irritating a lot of traders, but they need to be mindful of the trend. Until it breaks, there's no reason to be incredibly bearish. On that note, let's examine some top stock trades for tomorrow. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: AppleInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMost of FAANG has done pretty well post-earnings, with the exception of GOOGL. Investors are hoping that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can trade higher after its report too, on today after the close.I like that Apple stock has been pulling back over the past few trading sessions. Unlike GOOGL, which we outlined the day before as shares were red-hot into the print, AAPL stock has been retreating a bit.  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into That doesn't mean it's set to rally though. After all, shares are still up about 40% from the December lows. The company will have to bank on solid results, a good outlook and a strong capital return plan.If investors bid it up, look to see that AAPL stock clears $205 on the upside. If it does, it opens the door to $215+. On the downside, I consider $190 a must-hold level. Not only a notable level on the chart, but also where the 50-day, 200-day and 50-week moving average currently rest. Below this and the $175 to $180 level is on the table.According to the options market, Wall Street is pricing in a ~$10.60 move in Apple stock, or a little more than 5%. Let's see if they're right. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: McDonald'sMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) clocked in at $200 on Tuesday after reporting earnings and that brought in the sellers. Now shares are bouncing around this $197.50 level and the next direction is unclear.Investors can consider a short position should it lose Tuesday's lows and break below uptrend support. That could get a quick sell down to the 20-day moving average. Below there and the $188-ish level is in sight and/or the 50-day moving average.That said, this name has been a beast, and if going short, I wouldn't look for massive downside. Otherwise, it's a buy-the-dip name until the trend breaks. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: ShopifyAnother beast? Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP), which continues to rip higher, this time on earnings. Holy smokes this one has been a winner.While SHOP is overbought, channel resistance still allows for an even higher expansion from current levels. On thing Shopify has done in this trend though? Breakout over short-term resistance and eventually pullback to that level only to find it as support.Let's see if we get that kind of action again. Otherwise, SHOP is a pass for me on the long side at this time. But I'm definitely not shorting it. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: PfizerPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is up about 3% on the day after the company reported earnings. While momentum is starting to improve and the stock is anything but overbought, there are definitely some concerns.For starters, PFE is struggling with $40, a prior support zone that's potentially now going to act as resistance. Should it get through $40, $42 is going to be tough too. Here the stock has both the 50-day and the 200-day, with the former crossing below the latter as we speak. I expect that to keep PFE in check. Finally, PFE has been making a series of lower highs (blue line), which is a bearish technical development.Notice how the stock took out its January lows and quickly reclaimed this level. I normally love that action, but there are too many concerns on the chart for me right now. Over $40 and PFE could give short-term buyers a ~5% run, but be leery at the 50-day/200-day conflux. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: NXP SemiconductorsNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is ripping, jumping more than 8% after the company reported earnings. The stock was holding up well over this $95 to $97 area, spring-boarding off its 20-week and 200-week moving averages.Shares are now coming into potential downtrend resistance, although it's unclear whether it will play a role. More likely, $110 could be an upside cap, given that it was Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) initial offer price for its takeover of NXP a few years ago.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Above that opens the door to the $117s and possibly higher. On the downside, it would be encouraging to see NXPI hold up over $100.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell was long GOOGL and AAPL.

In hindsight, my many critics -- thanks for the viewership and engagement, by the way! -- may mock my cautiousness. Sure, I look like an idiot now, but here's the kicker: I'm still leery on the big bank.The main reason is that the much-discussed revenue growth represents the wrong type of growth. Because of that, JPM stock is moving higher for the wrong reasons. Allow me to explain:When management reported its $29.12 billion revenue, almost half of that was net interest income. This metric is exactly what it sounds like: revenues generated from a bank's funds on its balance sheet. In other words, these are sales that JPMorgan makes from merely existing.And if net interest income is nearly half of total revenue, that means non-interest income is barely over half. This segment represents sales from activities such as lending, advising and consulting. Stated different, these are sales from actually doing something.In a truly healthy economy, you need non-interest income to be significantly higher than net interest income. This would indicate true economic growth: businesses are borrowing money from banks, which then circulate throughout the country in the form of wages and commerce.  Click to EnlargeBut that's not what is happening. Instead, the allocation of net interest income has steadily increased over the years. Between Q1 2013 through Q4 2015, net interest income relative to total revenue averaged 45.7%. From Q1 2016 to now, this allocation averages 49.4%. If the trend keeps going, net interest income will represent the majority of total revenue for JPM stock.Why is this granular detail so critical? Because during the Great Recession, net interest income ballooned to 80%! It's just common-sense reasoning, folks. Keep a Cautious Eye on JPMorgan StockBut to further drive home my point, let's consider the revenue allocation prior to the 2008 meltdown. In 2007, net interest income was only 37.3% of total sales. Recall that the troubles really started to unravel in the second half of that year.  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into Again, it's just common sense. If an economy is truly robust, a banking bellwether's sales should come from business activities. Right now, it's coming from financial engineering, and that's not stable ground for JPMorgan stock.So why are shares flying? JPM stock is like no other investment. While other heavyweights like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) or Boeing (NYSE:BA) clearly represent specific industries, JPM represents us all. If it's suffering, it usually means that a large, negative catalyst exists.I'm not trying to be conspiratorial. Still, it's a bad look for everyone if JPM stock starts crumbling. Therefore, an incentive exists to keep shares on the up and up.But as much as I'd like to join the party, I can't. We have a student debt crisis, along with an opioid epidemic and startling levels of homelessness. Yet in this harsh backdrop, JPMorgan shares are soaring? As it turns out, your instincts are correct, even if it's not reflected in the charts.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-02,"In what has to be one of the strangest headlines over the years, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) announced that they're getting into the life-insurance business. Yes, we're talking about that Philip Morris, the famous (or infamous) distributor of tobacco products. Even more strange, PM stock is taking the news quite well.Source: Shutterstock Shares closed up slightly on the Tuesday session, and didn't really move much during extended hours. Of course, that dynamic runs counter to our intuition. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death. It's almost as if management is deliberately throwing Philip Morris stock into a fierce headwind.Even more curious, PM is offering discounts to buyers who either transition to smoking alternatives like vaporizers or quit altogether. Here's how this will work. For those who switch to e-cigarettes, they'll receive a 2.5% discount on insurance premiums. Anyone moving to a Philip Morris-branded heat-not-burn product -- specifically iQOS -- will get a 25% discount.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Finally, buyers who quit smoking for at least a year will enjoy half off on premiums. On the surface, this is an awfully risky environment for PM stock. I'm sure I'm not the only investor who thought, what the heck is management smoking?At the same time, it can also be a genius move that may stabilize Philip Morris stock. Cynicism Drives PM StockJust based on headlines alone, you would imagine this is the equivalent of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) buying out Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WW). But dive a little deeper into the details, and you get the true sense of where management is headed: they just want the insured to transition to Philip Morris-branded e-cigarettes.And of course, that's a great business strategy that should boost PM stock. A major fundamental overhang working against tobacco firms is shifting consumer habits. Today, it's no longer fashionable to smoke as it once was. Anti-tobacco advocates have done wonders exposing the seedy side of the business, ranging from health concerns to predatory practices.Plus, the cool kids are not smoking. Instead, they're vaping, and it's not hard to see why. For example, take a quick peek at some of the popular e-juice products. You'll find a dazzling array of fruit and organic blends, and candy-inspired flavors. I don't vape yet I'm tempted to!However, it's not just the broader shift toward e-cigarettes that benefits Philip Morris stock. We're talking big tobacco, so naturally, they'll amp up the cynicism factor. Management realizes quite well that no matter how much you want to quit smoking, you just won't do it. Therefore, they don't really have to worry about giving up a 50% discount.For non-smokers, the path to abstinence appears easy and straightforward. Put on a nicotine patch, or chew some nicotine gum, and eventually, you're on your way to freedom. Yet recent scientific studies indicate that tobacco is much more addictive than experts initially thought.  * 7 of the Best ETFs to Buy for a Slowing Economy For instance, the CDC reports that average smokers take eight to 11 attempts to quit. The American Cancer Society has similar numbers, between eight to 10. But the bottom line? PM knows you likely won't quit. Philip Morris Stock to Benefit From Easy CompetitionWhile today's focus is on the company's new business venture, what underlines PM stock, again, is the cynicism. This is management's attempt to adapt to changing market conditions and funnel more revenues into their pockets.Better yet, this is a very realistic strategy. Although the e-cigarette revolution has historically hurt big tobacco, this age-old industry has something the upstart sector does not: massive resources. After paying down some debt, PM is sitting on more than $3 billion in cash.On the other hand, the e-cigarette industry is comprised of many small Chinese companies competing for consumer dollars. Although it's a flashy (literally, in some cases) segment, it's also extremely cutthroat. Plus, geopolitical tensions such as the one we're suffering through right now can present challenges to typical e-cigarette makers.PM, though, has the resources to ride this and other waves. Admittedly, their products haven't captured vape users' attention like the Chinese companies have. But they have ample funds to invest in research and development. Worse comes to worst, management can buy out their vaping competitors, which supports the cause for Philip Morris stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-02,"McDonald’s: Key Takeaways from Its Q1 Earnings(Continued from Prior Part)First-quarter performance In the first quarter, McDonald’s (MCD) posted revenues of $4.96 billion, which beat analysts’ expectation of $4.93 billion. However, the",What Drove McDonald’s Revenues in Q1?
2019-05-02,"Shares of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) eclipsed the $200 mark for the first time ever in late April after the global fast casual food giant reported first quarter numbers that sailed past expectations. Specifically, revenues, profits, global comparable sales, and domestic comparable sales all came in ahead of expectations, and McDonald's stock rose a few percentage points in response to fresh all time highs.Source: Shutterstock This is nothing new for McDonald's. The first quarter of 2019 marked the company's fifteenth consecutive quarter of positive global comparable sales growth. During that 15 quarter stretch, McDonald's stock has risen nearly 80%, versus a 43% gain for the S&P 500.This out-performance from MCD stock will continue. Why? Because, at the end of the day, what drives McDonald's is comparable sales growth. When comps are healthy and positive, MCD moves higher. When they are unhealthy and negative, MCD moves lower. Fortunately for shareholders, McDonald's management is doing everything right to keep comparable sales growth in healthy and positive territory for the foreseeable future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Thus, barring an unforeseen sharp economic downturn, MCD stock should remain on a winning trajectory. While that winning trajectory will naturally feature some bumps in the road, the big picture idea here is that McDonald's stock will continue to grind higher. Price & Convenience Always WinIn the big picture, McDonald's management team is making all the right moves to ensure that McDonald's remains the dominant player in the global fast casual good industry.When it comes to that industry, only two things truly matter: price and convenience. When consumers go to a fast casual restaurant, their priorities are minimizing cost and maximizing convenience. Sure, consumers may also want the meal to be healthy, but if healthy were the priority, the consumer would cook at home. Consumers may also want the meal to be very tasty, but if quality were the priority, the consumer would eat at a fancy restaurant.In other words, the keys to a fast casual chain succeeding rest in minimizing price and maximizing convenience. McDonald's Is Making All the Right MovesMcDonald's is doing just that. On multiple fronts.First, there's seemingly a McDonald's on every street corner and at every freeway exit, so convenience is already second-to-none. Second, McDonald's has long been known for its cheaper-than-peer prices, so the prices are likewise second-to-none. But, instead of resting on its laurels, McDonald's is rapidly innovating to further widen its inherent convenience and price advantages.The company is modernizing stores across the U.S. to have more advanced and efficient ordering systems, like digital kiosks, so as to minimize the amount of time consumers spend ordering food.Also on the maximizing convenience front, McDonald's has aggressively expanded its digital ordering and delivery presence, enabled consumers to more easily order custom meals, and built out a robust mobile ordering system. Meanwhile, on the minimizing price front, McDonald's continues to consistently roll out promotions (like the 2 for $5 Mix and Match deal) and keep prices across the menu exceptionally low.Broadly speaking, McDonald's is doing everything it possibly can to maximize convenience and minimize price. McDonald's Stock Will Stay on a Winning PathBecause McDonald's management continues to aggressively innovate in all the right areas, comparable sales growth at McDonald's should remain healthy and positive for the foreseeable future.That's a big deal. MCD trades with its comps numbers. When those numbers are positive, the stock rises. When they are negative, the stock drops. Thus, so long as comps remain in positive territory, McDonald's stock should be able to trend higher.This is especially true considering where MCD stock trades today. To be sure, the stock isn't cheap. But, at 24.5-times forward earnings, the stock trades at the same valuation as the broader restaurant sector. Also, with a 2.2% yield, the stock has a bigger yield than the S&P 500.Thus, this is a stock with a relatively average valuation and an above-average yield. That combination plus positive comps should drive out-performance in the stock going forward. Bottom Line on McDonald's StockWhen it comes to fast casual restaurant stocks, McDonald's is second to none. Not only is this company the global leader in the space, but McDonald's is also widening its lead through aggressive innovation and investment where it matters.So long as this remains true, McDonald's stock will continue to grind higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD.

2019-05-03,"Shares of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) certainly had a roaring start to 2019. MCD stock had risen over 12% and reached a new all-time high of $200 before finally pulling back slightly. McDonald's stock, though, is beginning to look a little tired and toppy at current levels. The fundamentals and technicals both point to a pullback on the horizon.Source: Shutterstock MCD reported earnings on April 30 that slightly beat estimates but were down from the year-ago basis.Yet in that same timeframe, shares have moved higher by nearly 25%. This means McDonald's stock valuations are now at historically rich levels. P/E is approaching 26, well above the 5 year average of 22.7. Price/Cash Flow is also at a premium and the dividend yield is below average at 2.2%. Price/Sales, which can't be goosed up by stock buybacks,  is now over 7 and at a 10 year high. McDonald's is certainly not cheap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Click to Enlarge Forward earnings for 202o are expected to come in at $8.68. If we apply the five-year average multiple of 22.7 (still well above the overall S&P 500 forward multiple of 16.8), we arrive at a forward stock price of $195.30 -- or almost exactly where McDonald's stock is trading now. Not exactly a bullish outlook for 2020.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now  How does MCD Stock Look Now?McDonald's stock had become extremely overbought on a technical basis before finally weakening.  Click to Enlarge Shares reached the highest readings of the past year on a 14-day RSI basis. MCD was trading at a big premium to the 20 day moving average before reverting back. Momentum has cooled dramatically after reaching a peak. MACD just issued a sell signal as well.MCD stock traded up to the $200 -- exactly -- on an intra-day basis before reversing to close well off the highs off the day. This type of price action many times is the sign of a short-term top, especially following such a strong rally. The buyers may finally be exhausted and momentum has been broken.Stock traders should look to use any rally to short MCD stock. Option traders may want to consider selling the June $200 calls and buying June $205 calls for a $1.50 net credit. Maximum gain on the option trade is $150 per spread. Return on risk is 17.64%.Tim Biggam may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

2019-05-03,"In late March, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) acquired Dynamic Yield for $300 million, which, a company with a market value of nearly $150 billion, this may seem like lunch money. Yet the deal is actually the biggest since the end of 1999 when it bought Boston Market and MCD stock was about $46 a share.Source: Shutterstock The Israeli startup is the kind of company that would actually be interesting to a tech operator like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Founded in 2011, the firm is focused on developing sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models to personalize customer interactions across the web, mobile apps and email. It has a database of more than 600 million users.So why is McDonalds buying this company? What is the fit here? Well, I think the deal is spot on -- and should be driver for MCD stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Last year the company initiated a pilot program using Digital Yield's technology for its drive thru service (this represents a majority of revenue). It leveraged information on traffic, the time of day and weather -- just to name a few items -- to dynamically change the digital signage to gin up more sales.Yes, it seems like Digital Yield passed the test with flying colors. In fact, McDonalds also researched 30 other companies in the space.For the most part, it looks like the company is aggressively rolling out the technology. In the latest earnings call, CEO Steve Easterbrook noted that 700 drive thrus already have the system in place. &quot;Over time, using data from the millions of customers that we serve daily, the technology will get smarter and smarter through machine learning,&quot; he said.The company is also exploring interesting uses for Dynamic Yield. For example, image recognition of license plates and geofencing of mobile apps could provide even more advanced personalization.But the deal is more than just cutting-edge technology. Consider that Dynamic Yield has a strong group of data scientists, software engineers and AI experts. No doubt, this kind of talent is tough to attract, especially for a traditional company.Yet might Dynamic Yield get stifled? It's true that this is always a risk when a traditional company acquires a start up. But it does appear that McDonald's is managing things the right way. Dynamic Yield will remain independent and continue to sell its technology to other companies, which should help keep up the innovation. The company has more than 600 clients, including the Hallmark Channel, IKEA and Sephora.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season But the deal for Dynamic Yield is definitely not a one-off.  The good news for McDonald's stock holders is that the company has made it a major priority to focus on innovation. To this end, it has partnered with Plexure for its mobile platform, which includes apps and in-store kiosks. McDonald's has taken a 9.9% equity position in the company.Then there is the deal with Uber, which allows for delivery services. Consider that the business is now at $3 billion. Bottom Line for McDonald's StockFor McDonald's, AI will likely go beyond marketing. The technology could prove helpful for the supply chain, such as in terms of improving efficiencies. Even small gains can have a material impact because of the company's massive scale.Granted, McDonald's stock is pricey, with the price-to-earnings multiple at nearly 26x. But then again, a premium is well deserved. The company has remained fairly reliable, with 15-consecutive increases of global comparable sales.And finally, the heavy investments in technology will certainly help guard the company against disruption.  But more important, AI has the potential for being transformative -- and keeping up the growth that fuels MCD stock.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-05-09,"The stock market has had a record run in 2019, with the S&P 500 rising 17% year-to-date, and it's still just early May.Of particular importance, the big 2019 rally in stocks has been characterized by unusual placidity. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 has dropped 2% or more off its highs only three times, with the biggest downdraft being a 2.5% correction at the very beginning of the year. Historically speaking, the stock market usually experiences 5%-plus pullbacks roughly three to four times a year. Thus, relative to the past, the 2019 rally in stocks has been unusually calm.Investors shouldn't be lulled to sleep by this placidity. You can count on volatility rearing its ugly head in stocks as much as you can count on the sun rising every morning. Thus, volatility is coming to the stock market. It isn't a matter of if. It's a matter of when.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA good rule of thumb in investing is as follows: when the good times are rolling, prepare for the bad times. Why? Because volatility rearing its ugly head usually happens out of the blue. The bust usually follows a boom.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From With this in mind, let's take a look at seven stable stocks worth considering for protection from the next stock market pullback, which history says is due soon. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.35Yield: 2.2%At the top of this is fast-casual restaurant giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) for three reasons: low beta, high yield, and a long history of dominance in a stable growth restaurant category.First, this stock has a very low beta at just 0.35. By itself, that's a low beta. But it is especially low considering McDonald's also gives you consistent and steady revenue and profit growth on top of that low beta. In other words, you have stable growth with mitigated historical volatility.Second, there's the 2.2% dividend yield, which is above the market average. That 2.2% yield, too, looks really good on top of consistent and steady revenue and profit growth.Third, McDonald's has, still does, and will continue to dominate the global stable growth restaurant category. Broadly speaking, McDonald's is the king of high convenience and low prices, and at the end of the day, those are the only two things that truly matter in fast food. McDonald's is continuing to invest and innovate to maintain those price and convenience advantages. So long as they do, this company will be the dominant player in the global restaurant industry, and MCD stock will be a steady riser. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.17Yield: 3%When it comes to avoiding volatility, few stocks do it better than utility stock American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).When it comes to high-yield utility stocks with stable fundamentals, American Electric Power is in a league of its own. The company provides electricity services to more that 5 million Americans across 11 states. Demand therein is exceptionally stable, because consumers will forever need electricity services. Ultimately, the business supports steady and consistent revenue and profit growth in a long term window.Further, the beta on AEP stock is ridiculously low at 0.17, meaning that the stock has exceptionally limited systemic risk (if the market drops, it doesn't necessarily mean AEP stock is going down with it). The yield is robust at 3%, meaning investors get paid to inherit limited risk on steady profit growth.  * 4 IPOs That Have Fallen Flat All in all, AEP stock is one of the best stable stocks to buy if you're looking for safety and protection. Disney (DIS)Source: Baron Valium via FlickrBeta: 0.68Yield: 1.3%Media giant Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one part growth stock and one part stable stock, and that makes it an attractive stock to own for investors seeking to mitigate risk without compromising too much on the potential return side of things.On the growth side, Disney is pivoting aggressively from linear television to internet television, and in so doing, is creating a streaming service that puts at least one part of the company on a potential supercharged Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) growth trajectory. If this streaming service takes off, this stock could fly high as cord-cutting concerns are laid to rest, and investors turn their attention towards streaming subscriber additions.At the same time, Disney is a stable stock because it's a media giant with a portfolio of high-quality content with enduring appeal. Regardless the channel of consumption, consumers always find a way to watch Disney content. That has been the case for several decades. It will remain the case for the next several decades, too. Consequently, stable and enduring demand is the backbone of DIS stock.Ultimately, this combination of stability and growth potential makes DIS stock a top-notch stock to consider for protection against a market downturn. Stable Stocks Worth Considering: AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.81Yield: 6.6%Over the past several years, shares of telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) have been dragged lower by a huge and growing debt load, slowing growth in its core business, and concerns regarding the longevity of its services.All these concerns have plunged AT&T stock into dirt cheap valuation territory. The dividend yield is up at 6.6%, which is essentially a five year high. Meanwhile, the forward earnings multiple is around 8.5, and that's near a five year low. In other words, you have a single-digit P/E multiple stock trading at a five year low valuation, with a dividend yield that is nearing 7% and at five year high levels.At those valuation levels, AT&T simply needs stabilization in order for the stock to work here. Stabilization is exactly what will happen over the next several years. Sure, cord cutting will persist. But the company will more aggressively pivot into building out DirecTV Now, and simultaneously up internet connectivity costs to offset cord cutting weakness. Meanwhile, the 5G boom will provide a nice tailwind for the wireless business, which should help offset continued wire-line weakness.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks That Are Bleeding Cash Broadly, operations should be stable going forward, and stable operations on a single digit P/E stock with a near 7% yield is an attractive combination. Intel (INTC)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.41Yield: 2.4%Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) often gets thrown into the growth stock category given its exposure to secular growth markets. But Intel is just as much &quot;stable stock&quot; as it is &quot;growth stock&quot;, and that makes INTC a winning pick for defensive investors still looking for healthy return potential.In the big picture, Intel is the 200-pound gorilla in the semiconductor market. They pretty much dominate everywhere it matters, and project to keep dominating as the market extends into data-centers, AI, machine learning, so on and so forth. Thus, demand for Intel's chips projects to remain stable for the foreseeable future.At the same time, secular growth drivers in data and AI markets could turn stable demand into stable and growing demand. That dynamic, on top of a stock with a 0.41 beta and 2.4% yield, should produce healthy risk-adjusted returns for investors. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Beta: 0.29Yield: 3.2%Last, but not least, on this list global beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Much like McDonald's, Coca-Cola is a strong defensive buy for three reasons: low beta, high yield, and stable fundamentals.KO stock has a low beta of 0.29, and that low beta comes on top of a company that is able to produce healthy and consistent profit growth year after year. Further, the dividend yield stands north of 3%, which is equally impressive considering the underlying profit growth trajectory.This stable profit growth at Coca-Cola is supported stable growth fundamentals underlying the business. Long story short, consumers need to drink, and Coca-Cola gives them what they want to drink. For a long time, that was sugary carbonated beverages, so Coca-Cola made a wide variety of Coke-based products. Now, its athletic drinks, teas, and sparkling waters, so Coca-Cola has acquired a wide variety of drinks in those categories, and given them global distribution.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Net result? Revenues and profits have remained on a healthy uptrend, despite an adverse change in consumer preference. This trend should broadly continue, so as long as consumers have a need to drink, Coca-Cola should remain a steady grower.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD, AEP, DIS, NFLX, T, and INTC.

2019-05-10,"Concerns about Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) alleged lack of respect for its users' privacy is in the news again.  But Facebook's user base continue to grow and Facebook stock is still on an upward trajectory, indicating that average people don't care about the negative headlines.Source: Shutterstock However, at this point, almost anyone who can get a Facebook page now has one. That means FB's  growth will decelerate unless it either better monetizes its flagship site or generates more revenue from its other websites and apps.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days  Privacy Concerns Are No Longer Affecting Facebook StockEarlier this week, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg was on Capitol Hill lobbying for new laws to protect Facebook's users in the U.S. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is preparing to fine FB up to $5 billion over its alleged failures to protect users' data during the 2016 election. Lately, there's also been some coverage  of Facebook's decision to ban certain controversial people from the website.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet the vast majority of users don't care about these issues, so FB stock has not been meaningfully affected by them.Amid the controversy, FB remains the go-to platform for keeping tabs on family and friends or spouting off political views. Complaints about banned users have done little to slow FB's growth or negatively affect FB stock. Facebook's Flagship Site Can't Grow That Much MoreThe Facebook platform has attracted 2.38 billion people, a staggering number considering 3.2 billion individuals had internet access as late as 2015.Going forward,  FB will have to rely primarily on Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other lines of business to boost its growth and raise FB stock. Facebook Stock Still Looks Poised to AdvanceBut I think Facebook stock will continue to move higher over the long-term. With its cash hoard of over $45.24 billion as of its last quarterly report. FB can buy a great deal of growth.However, Facebook faces the same challenge  that plagues Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD): How does a company continue growing when it can no longer expand to new markets?Coca-Cola attempted to solve that problem by launching new drinks,   while Facebook has tried to address it with new apps.  Many of FB's acquisitions have performed quite well. Instagram now boasts over 1 billion users. Among young people, Instagram continues to take market share from Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) flagship app.In the realm of international calling, WhatsApp, with its free calls to anywhere in the world, can take business from telcos. Moreover, competition from Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and other platforms do not pose a direct threat to FB or Facebook stock. Facebook Stock May Have to Follow KO's pathOver the next five years, analysts, on average, forecast that FB's average annual earnings growth rate will be 17.55%. That should support the current price-earnings ratio of Facebook stock, which is just over 28.Still, advertising,  which provides the bulk of Facebook's revenue, is becoming more competitive. Furthermore, if the multiple of Facebook stock moves much higher, FB stock could tumble again.Due to its current size and long-term growth prospects, Facebook stock will gradually become more similar to Coca-Cola stock. Interestingly, KO stock has a similar PE ratio, but KO's profit growth is much lower than that of FB. However, unlike Facebook stock, KO stock pays a dividend. It has a dividend yield of about 3.25%, and its dividend has increased annually for the last 56 years.Facebook should consider a similar approach. If Facebook stock continues to struggle, its current crop of investors will sell their shares. But by attracting dividend investors, FB would entice a group of investors who previously would not consider owning FB stock. The Bottom Line on Facebook StockFacebook may have to adopt  a new approach as its flagship site approaches global saturation levels. Despite privacy concerns and looming fines from countries, people continue to log on to its flagship site and its other apps. Furthermore, the company has  become adept at monetizing its other apps, enabling its profit to grow.However, there is increased competition in the ad space. Moreover, both FB's size and its relatively limited growth prospects put FB in the same position as Coca-Cola. To meaningfully boost FB stock, FB may have to follow KO's lead and initiate a dividend.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-13,"U.S.-China trade war tensions are rising again, and investors are scrambling to find the right defensive stock picks to weather this latest flare-up in what has been a year-plus standoff.President Donald Trump recently hiked tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%, arguing that Beijing broke a previously agreed deal. The president also formally instructed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to begin the process of raising tariffs &quot;on essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion.&quot; Beijing will retaliate, saying it will increase its own tariffs on about $60 billion in American imports.Unsurprisingly, the threat of a full-blown trade war is playing havoc with the global markets. The major indices have pulled back considerably from their recent peaks. But Goldman Sachs has just released a very useful report setting out how to pick the best stocks for these turbulent times.&quot;Services ﬁrms are less exposed to trade policy and have better corporate fundamentals than goods companies and should outperform even if the trade tensions are ultimately resolved, as our economists expect,&quot; writes David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' head U.S. equity strategist.Here are five standout stock picks for the U.S.-China trade war from Goldman Sachs' report. We have used TipRanks market data to dig into five &quot;Outperform&quot;-rated services stocks that the firm has singled out. Each of these will likely still have their down days with broader-market sentiment. But over a prolonged standoff, they should hold up better than the rest.

What puts GM in the spotlight for me is mainly its subsidiary, Cruise, which has the second place for autonomous driving commercial services in the U.S.The global market for self-driving vehicles and services is expected to grow in double-digits in the next several years. More specifically, analysts estimate that the industry will grow more than tenfold from $54.23 billion in 2019 to $556.67 in 2026.In August 2016, GM bought a majority stake in Cruise for $1 billion. In three years, Cruise's valuation has reached $19 billion. It is worth remembering that GM's own market cap currently stands at $53 billion.GM Cruise is currently testing its driverless vehicles in California. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo and GM Cruise make their California road safety reports publicly available. The 2018 data for both companies showed marked improvements over a year ago, increasing speculation that GM Cruise may soon be able to reach commercialization at scale.On Apr. 30, GM reported Q1 2019 earnings that saw profits increase. The group earned $1.41 per share, 30 cents better than what Wall Street was expecting. The company benefited from increased SUV and truck sales, especially considering that they're some of its most lucrative models. General Motors also said that its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts were on track, a development which investors saw as positive for the stock.With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 5.7, GM stock is also likely to catch the attention of value investors. In the meantime, its current dividend yield of 4.08% could also make the company an important addition to an income-generating portfolio.Almost a decade ago, General Motors emerged from the ashes of bankruptcy. Yet I expect the next decade to be a lot different and positive for the company. Therefore, I'd consider buying GM not only for its dividends, but for the potential growth in stock price.Since the trade war rhetoric impacts the auto industry too, in the next few weeks, there may be choppiness and even some profit-taking in GM stock. However, as the dust settles, GM shareholders will likely be well rewarded. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock McDonald's operates in the fragmented food service industry, which includes competitors like Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM). It has over 36,000 restaurants in over 100 countries.McDonald's latest earnings results on Apr. 30 came in better than expected. Group revenues of $4.95 billion topped analysts' estimates of $4.94 billion. Management gave an upbeat outlook on long-term growth and profitability.In addition to the acceleration of U.S. sales, McDonald's stock has benefited from international growth. Comparable U.S. store sales rose 4.5%. Similarly, global comparable-store sales rose 5.4%, mostly thanks to promotions mixed-priced deals, as well as renovated stores.As one of the largest fast food chains around the globe, over 90% of the restaurants are currently franchised. The franchising business gives McDonald's a significant competitive edge as the initial franchise fees and on-going royalties mean high margins. Its operating margins now stand around a healthy 30%. As the franchisees carry the operating costs and business risks, McDonald's does not have to worry about the expenses of running those operations.The group -- globally recognized as &quot;the Golden Arches&quot; -- also collects rent from the franchisees as the company owns most of the properties where the restaurants operate. It leases those out to the franchisees, often at significant markups. It may not be wrong to say that the company is in the real estate business as much as food services.As part of its efforts to improve shareholder value, McDonald's has been increasing dividend payments since its first-ever dividend payment in 1976. The next dividend payment of $1.16 per share is expected to be paid out on June 17. The current dividend yield stands at over 2.3%.  * 7 ETFs for Healthy Healthcare REITs On May 19, MCD stock price saw an all-time high of $200.36. Year-to-date, the stock is up 12%. Although there might be some weakness and profit-taking in the MCD stock price in the coming weeks, especially around the $200-level, I'd regard any dip in price as an opportunity to go long the shares. The company is a core consumer staples holding for a well-diversified portfolio. Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrMy final stock is the oil and gas supermajor Royal Dutch Shell. Investors will note that there are two separate tickers for the company: the A-shares, RDS.A, fall under Dutch law, whereas the B-shares RDS.B are subject to U.K. law. Which one to invest would depend on individual tax considerations regarding dividends. As a U.S. resident, I'd personally prefer the RDS.B stock. However, I'd urge our readers to check with their brokers as well as tax advisors as to which stock would be better suited for their portfolios.On May 2, Royal Dutch Shell released its first-quarter 2019 results which beat analysts estimates. Profit of $5.3 billion was down just 2% year-over-year but compared favorably with the $4.5 billion forecast. EPS came at 65 cents and the results showed an impressive $12.1 billion of cash flow. Management highlighted several projects for 2020 and beyond that are expected to impact growth positively.The group's diversified operations are divided into four main segments: Integrated Gas, Upstream, Downstream and Corporate.Integrated Gas covers the production, marketing and trading of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas-to-liquids (GTL) products. This business also manages the New Energies portfolio,  such as advanced biofuels, hydrogen and charging for battery-electric vehicles. Many analysts believe that the division will be a key driver of RDS.B's long-term value.Upstream activities include oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production, while Downstream manages Royal Dutch Shell's manufacturing, distribution and marketing activities for oil products and chemicals. Finally, the Corporate segment covers the non-operating activities supporting the group.Demand, supply, quantity and commodity prices all affect the earnings of an energy group. During the quarter, lower oil prices (with an average price of $63) have continued to be a significant challenge across the business for RDS.B. Yet strong contributions from trading helped offset the impact of lower oil prices.And as the U.S. tightens sanctions on Iran while we also approach the summer months, oil prices are heading higher -- Brent crude is now over $72. Any uptick in the price of oil would help increase Royal Dutch Shell's quarterly earnings.Dividends and stock repurchases concern shareholders because they affect investment returns. Royal Dutch Shell has an enviable track record as an income stock. Long-term RDS.B shareholders enjoy a current dividend yield of 5.8%. And that amount looks safe as it has dividend cover of 1.4X. The group has not cut its dividend even once since the end of World War II. The next dividend payment date is June 24.The company also announced that the board had approved a new tranche of share repurchases and will now buy back $2.75 billion in shares before July 29.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Major indices swinging a full percentage points intraday or a couple of points in one direction, then reversing the next have become the new normal. Volatility reared its head but seems to have died down just as quickly as it rose.Over the last two weeks, the S&P 500 has lost 0.8 percent. Meanwhile companies like McDonald's and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) looked really strong amidst the volatility. Both stocks posted gInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential ains with McDonald's stock up almost a percent over the time period and DRI making a big 4.5 percent up.Even Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) has been making new highs, indicative of the demand for names in the restaurant sectors though still looking expensive from a valuation standpoint. A Closer Look at McDonald's StockIt may be surprising for some investors to hear that Mcdonald's bought a machine learning startup called Dynamic Yield for $300 million in March. Yes, it is at its core a fast casual chain, but that's just the past and the present. In the future Mcdonald's will still be selling Happy Meals but how they sell in undergoing a shift.The future is about understanding customers and how to improve sales based on its dynamic menu. Taking into account factors like weather, the technology will redesign the display on the menu. On a hot day, for example, McFlurry's are likely to be front and center.MCD will be rolling this AI technology out across 1,000 locations in the next couple months and will eventually reach all 14,000 US restaurants as well as their international stores.It's hard to assess just how much this will add to the Company's top line as it isn't exactly an event-based catalyst. What it does ensure is consistent revenue growth over the next few quarters as the technology extends throughout their entire ecosystem of restaurants.While it's true that MCD stock doesn't look particularly cheap at 26x earnings, with the addition of AI technology, they have here another lever for growth. So maybe 26x isn't all that rich a multiple after all. An Upscale AlternativeDRI had a big third quarter, showing that momentum is on their side. Total sales increased 5.5 percent and same-restaurant sales increased as well to the tune of 2.8 percent. Standout performers for comp sales included Olive Garden (up 4.3 percent), LongHorn Steakhouse (up 3.8 percent) and The Capital Grille (up 4.3 percent).After a tepid second quarter with just 2.1 percent growth in same-restaurant sales, DRI has bounced back. Expectations for the fourth quarter are in line with the most recent quarter.Darden exceeded top line expectations due to market share gains. This reaffirms that management's strategy is working. Across the portfolio of 1,700 restaurants, Darden continues to invest in brands that create exceptional dining experiences. Management has also continued to support its shareholders with a continuation of its share repurchase program.Given the strong quarterly figures, Darden increased its financial outlook for fiscal 2019 and for the fourth quarter. Sales growth notched up to match the third quarter number of 5.5 percent as did expectations for comparable sales growth. All in all, it paints a rosy picture for DRI stock in the second half of the year.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-23,"With the growing trade war with China, slowing economic growth in Europe and political problems here at home, there's a lot on investor's plates these days. That could explain why the markets have gone haywire over the last few weeks. With volatility rising and big market swings now a common occurrence, the stocks to buy these days may not be the high flyers, but those come with a hefty dose of safety.The stocks to buy these days are those with steady revenues, big cash balances and a hefty dose of dividends. The kind of equities that could be immune to the various geopolitical and economic events that are plaguing the markets currently.There are plenty of studies that show if a portfolio can have a smoother ride, then returns can be better over the long haul. Given the craziness and potential for doom and gloom, these less volatile safe stocks could be exactly what the doctored ordered.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy But which are the safe stocks to buy today? Here are five that will help you ride out the summer with relative ease. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) needs no introduction. The burger joint is iconic at this point with millions of customers stepping into its restaurants daily. This flood of customers continues to produce ample revenues, cash flows and profits for MCD. The best part is that McDonald's tends to be pretty immune to the effects of the economy. People want their Big Macs and fries no matter what.That point alone makes it one of the best stocks to buy for the summer.But the burger joint is now adding a touch of growth to its safety. Over the last year or so, MCD has increased its use of technology in its restaurants. This has included updating its mobile apps, increasing options for online ordering, adding self-ordering kiosks and even began offering delivery via Uber (NYSE:UBER). However, the real win has been its forays into artificial intelligence and data mining via its buyout of Dynamic Yield. All of these initiatives are designed to boost revenues and margins.And it looks like they are working. Two years into MCD's Velocity Growth Plan and the golden arches are much more golden these days. Both sales and profits have jumped.With a yield of 2.32%. MCD stock is an ideal place to wait out the market's current volatility. Waste Management (WM)Source: Shutterstock We make a lot of trash and it has to go somewhere. Increasingly that job continues to fall toward Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM). WM owns the largest network of landfills, transfer stations, and recycling facilities in the industry. It's a massive moat that can only be matched by a few competitors. Because of this scale and virtual monopoly, Waste Management enjoys some pretty hefty pricing power.It has been successfully able to pass on price increases to customers.And WM keeps on getting bigger. The firm has been able to smartly use M&A to buyout smaller waste hauling operations to entrench its position in key areas. This includes its recent $4.9 billion buyout of Advanced Disposal (NYSE:ADSW). That deal -- like many of WM's buyouts -- will be instantly accreditive to earnings.This should be a boon to its operating income and cash flows. Already, the firm reported record profitability and operating cash flow for 2018.  But with the addition of new customers and continued volume strength, Waste should keep the growth going. This should benefit shareholders as well.WM has become a dividend champion and it has consistently increased its dividend for the last 15 years straight -- with a compound annual growth rate of about 6% over the last five years. Currently, shares yield 1.9%.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend All in all, WM has the goods to be one of the best stocks to buy this summer. Consolidated Edison (ED)Source: Shutterstock Utilities are known for their safety and steadfast nature. After all, you have to keep the lights on and heating your home despite what the economy is doing. This makes them a prime stock to buy when the going gets rough. And none could be stodgier than Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED).ConEd has been providing electricity, steam and natural gas for metropolitan New York for more than 180 years. New York is a tough town, but NYC, Westchester, and New Jersey feature strong economic fundamentals and continued growing populations. This has allowed ED to &quot;keep the lights on&quot; for itself as well as reward shareholders.In fact, Con Ed has managed to grow its payout for roughly five decades. The latest was another 3.5% bump at the start of the year.And the dividends could keep coming in. ED has earmarked around $12 billion in CAPEX spending over the next two years. The key is that the vast bulk is going towards its regulated operations. That's a key factor in determining future rate hikes and profits at a utility. With improvements on this side, ED should be able to boost its cash flows further.In the meantime, the safety of being the utility in the biggest city in the U.S. has plenty of advantages for a rocky market. During the last downturn in 2008, ED held up better than the broader market. ED currently yields 3.38%. Aflac (AFL)Source: Shutterstock The duck, its quack and those commercials are pretty iconic. But the parent company is pretty darn iconic as well. Aflac Inc. (NYSE:AFL) makes an ideal stock to buy for this summer.AFL provides so-called voluntary supplemental health and life insurance products. This niche -- and Aflac is the leader -- is generally a high-margined insurance variety. This provides AFL with plenty of underwriting profits. Moreover, AFL has been very smart with its float and has used it to generate plenty of returns. Net investment income jumped 1.1% and 4% in the last quarter for its U.S. and Japanese operations, respectively. The combination of strong underwriting and gains on its float/investment portfolio have allowed AFL to up its guidance for the rest of the year.At the same time, AFL's conservative nature has allowed it to become a dividend machine. The duck has been paying increasing dividends for 36 years. The latest was nearly a 4% increase at the start of the year. With a low payout ratio -- of less than 30% -- there's plenty of wiggle room left for AFL to keep the payout growing socially if profits keep rising.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains Overall, Aflac represents a strong niche insurance agency with conservative fundamentals. It's exactly the kind of stock to buy for a rocky market like this one. iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV)Source: Shutterstock The best safe stocks to buy this summer might actually be all of them. And that's where the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (NYSEARCA:USMV) comes in.USMV tracks a smart-beta index that uses various screens to kick out high-volatility stocks in order to capture the upside of the market while eliminating the downside. With the exchange-traded fund, you're basically buying all the stocks on this list with one ticker. And so far, USMV has delivered on its promise of providing a smoother ride for portfolios.Since its inception in November 2011, USMV has managed to capture roughly 82% of the S&P 500's gains, while only realizing about 56% of its losses. This past December, when the market's imploded, the S&P 500 lost 9%. USMV only lost 7%. This highlights that the stocks to buy are safe ones in this rocky environment.This summer, investors can swap USMV for a core index holding or use it to boost the robustness of an equity portfolio and provide a safety net for the summer. USMV features an expense ratio of just 0.15%, or $15 annually per $10,000 invested.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-24,"I don't know what Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Robert Iger does day to day. However, I'm sure one of his actions over recent weeks involved a face-palming. That's because DIS stock, which is in the middle of a critical pivot, now faces a possibly severe headwind.Source: Baron Valium via FlickrMaking headlines throughout the world is the ongoing and escalating U.S.-China trade war. It's taken a lot of companies like Disney by surprise. Just a month ago, the tea leaves suggested that a resolution was imminent. Both Washington and Beijing agreed to hash out their differences.But a sharply worded Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posting from President Trump -- is there any other kind? -- scuttled optimism. As usual, the former real-estate mogul doubled down on his about-face sentiment. Fearing losing face to its citizenry and the international community, China pushed back. The trade war is back on, and so, too, are concerns for the Disney stock price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors For Iger, the situation must be doubly frustrating. He sat on Trump's business council two years ago and was among the execs who advised the President against igniting an all-out trade war. Interestingly, DIS stock was incredibly choppy until relations appeared to smooth out.Now, Iger is exactly where he begged the business gods not to place him in. Like a pivotal point in a Marvel action movie, just when DIS stock gained decisive momentum off its Disney+ streaming platform, shares have slammed into a wall.With competition expanding in the broader entertainment arena, China presented a glowing opportunity. A country four times the size of the U.S. population, the Asian juggernaut was a license to print money.But before giving up on Disney stock, here are three things to consider: DIS Stock Levers &quot;Status Symbol&quot; BrandsOn the surface, a trade war would spark a nationalistic fervor in China against the &quot;imperialist&quot; Americans. Building off the uproar, the Chinese government will urge (or force) its citizens to boycott all U.S.-made goods and services. Naturally, this would hurt the Disney stock price.In reality, I think the reaction toward a company like DIS will be much more nuanced. I say this because social status in China remains an important factor in everyday life.For instance, when we go grab a quick bite to eat at Pizza Hut or McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), we don't think twice about it. But in China, the situation is much different. If you want a slice at Pizza Hut in Xiamen -- owned by Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) -- you better get a reservation. I'm not kidding!Like the historical impact of the first McDonald's opening in the Soviet Union, the Chinese still have fond memories of western integration. In my view, this helps Disney stock. The underlying brand represents America in ways other brands can't quite capture.As far as status goes, it's an incredible luxury for an average Chinese family to visit Shanghai Disneyland. So, I'm not overly worried about the trade-war impact here. Disney Stock and That Content EmpireAnother area that deteriorating U.S.-China relations can't touch is Disney's content. Quite simply, the Magic Kingdom has plenty of it, and most of these licenses are extremely lucrative.If you follow my writing on InvestorPlace, you'll know that I'm generally bullish on streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Even with DIS getting into the mix, I'm still optimistic on NFLX because of its powerful original content.Admittedly, though, DIS is taking out Netflix's initial advantage of going first to market with the streaming platform. Moving forward, the two will compete head-to-head mostly on content, which is Disney's strength.Further favoring the Disney stock price is the changing nature of the entertainment consumer. With the mainstreaming of geek culture, most of today's successful movies are science-fiction fare or based on comic books.Of course, this is a huge boost for DIS stock because the underlying firm owns the Star Wars franchise. That is a real license to print money, trade war be damned! And when the hotly anticipated Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker hits theaters later this year, I expect record-breaking sales. That includes both domestic and Chinese box offices. Disney is America's Corporate AmbassadorIf tensions get worse -- and that's more than likely -- I can see the Chinese boycotting expensive American goods. I don't think it's any coincidence that General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) suffered sharp declines recently.American car companies are on life support. They're only hanging on because of Chinese demand. Surely, the communist government knows this, and they'll go after GM and Ford. By stabbing Detroit in the jugular, China can hand the U.S. a permanently ignominious defeat.But attacking Disney? I don't see it, primarily because this is the most inoffensive brand ever. For one thing, its content, products, and venues appeal to the widest audience possible. Second, Disney is a very diverse brand. Specifically, they're Asian-friendly, which is somewhat important when you're trying to court Chinese viewers.Lastly, we go back to Bob Iger and his short tenure on the President's business council. After hitting the wall that is Trump's ear canal, which helps funnel verbal cues to the President's brain, Iger quit. But in doing so, he may have endeared himself to the Chinese. As luck would have it, this may turn out to be the best move ever.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-28,"There's an old Wall Street saying that goes, &quot;Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.&quot; No one really knows who originally said it, but its meaning is clear. You can make money in a rising market or a falling market if you're disciplined. But if you hunt for stocks to buy while being greedy, sloppy and impatient, things might not work out as you hope.This is a time to be patient. We're more than a decade into a truly epic bull market that has seen the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index appreciate by well over 300%. While value investors might still find a few bargains out there, the market is by most reasonable metrics richly valued.The S&P; 500's trailing price-to-earnings ratio sits at a lofty 21. The long-term historical average is around 16, and there have only been a handful of instances in history in which the collection of blue-chip stocks has breached 20. It's expensive from a revenue standpoint, too -- the index trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 2.1, meaning today's market is priced at 1990s internet mania levels.The beauty of being an individual investor is that you reserve the right to sit on your hands. Unlike professional money managers, you have no mandate to be 100% invested at all times. You can be patient and wait for your moment.Here are 13 solid blue-chip stocks to buy that look interesting now, but will be downright attractive on a dip. Any of these would make a fine addition to a portfolio at the right price. And should this little bout of volatility in May snowball into a correction or proper bear market, that day might come sooner than you think.

2019-05-30,"Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) will deliver its first earnings report as a public company after the market closes May 30, and investors are bracing for bad news.Source: Shutterstock The company is expecting to lose $2.39 per share, on revenue of $3.07 billion. This comes to $4 billion based on Uber's 1.68 billion shares outstanding. In one quarter. Keep that up for a year and you're &quot;only&quot; paying 5.5 times revenue at the company's May 30 market cap of $67 billion. The &quot;better&quot; news is you're only paying 4 times losses.That's right, Uber's latest innovation is a new ratio -- the price-to-losses ratio. It's like the price to earnings ratio, only upside down.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd on that news, Uber opened for trade up half a percent on May 30, at $40 per share. Not a Fan of Uber StockI admit to not being a fan of Uber stock. I even asked if you could short it when it went public early this month.  If you took that for investment advice, you're still in the money.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War I can now claim I'm not a fan of Uber's service, either. I tried one of their electric bikes over the weekend. It's heavy. It can't go uphill. I did a ride on my old road bike afterward and used less energy.Uber also dinged me because I had to leave the bike near someone's home, a half-mile away. That's because the bikes are banned from my street and its nearby transit stop. My review was not kind, so I guess they won't want to do business with me.Bikes, like scooters, are immaterial to Uber results. The hope is the company can use them to build partnerships with transit agencies, transportation companies, and others. Scooters (and bikes) can be a fill-in solution for short trips in crowded urban environments, where cars are  stuck in traffic, but distances are too far for comfortable walking. The Real ProblemScooters and bikes are the moves of a mature company, not a fast-growing start-up focused on cars.Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent employees a memo after the failed IPO, comparing the open to those of Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which also did not impress out of the gate.The year before Amazon went public, in 1997, its total revenue was under $16 million. The year before Facebook went public, in 2011, its revenue was $3.7 billion, and it had just committed to becoming a cloud company.Uber, by contrast, had 2018 revenue of $11.3 billion  and its big innovation is an electric scooter?The situations are just not comparable.Another thing that isn't mature at Uber is its business model. California wants to make its drivers employees, which Uber believes would be disastrous. So far, it has mainly been a way for drivers to finance car purchases, an indentured version of Ford (NYSE:F) Motor Credit.The long-term bet on Uber has always been one on self-driving cars. But a new MIT study shows self-driving cars will cost services like Uber four times more to operate than previously thought , and three times more than the cost of just buying a car. The Bottom LineThere's a bright spot in Uber's numbers -- namely Uber Eats. The delivery service is now available at more than half the McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) in the U.S., and is taking a &quot;big bite&quot; of sales.In response, McDonald's is ending Uber Eats' exclusivity. If you like Uber Eats, buy McDonald's.Since Khosrowshahi compared his company to Amazon, a 1990s IPO, let me close by saying Uber does remind me of a big IPO from that era.Uber reminds me of Webvan.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher for a fourth consecutive day, adding 1.02%.Comments from President Donald Trump regarding Mexico potentially avoiding the trade tariffs set to go into effect next week were among the catalysts for stocks today. Trump is pushing Mexico to buy more from U.S. farmers, saying that if Mexico cooperates, tariffs could be avoided.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately,&quot; Trump wrote in a post on Twitter, reports CNBC. &quot;If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!&quot; Talking TechThe Dow Jones Industrial Average allocates 18.71% of its weight to the technology sector, its second-largest sector exposure behind industrials.

Earlier this week, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler noted Microsoft's cloud business could eventually generate $140 billion in revenue. The analyst has an &quot;outperform rating on Microsoft stock.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Dow's largest tech holding, joined the party, adding 2.66%. Apple's Friday rally appears to be a sympathy play as the stock traded higher alongside the broad market, not on the back of company-specific news. There was some bullish analyst chatter on Apple stock yesterday along with rumors that the company is considering an acquisition to bolster its footprint in the fast-growing autonomous vehicle market.Outside of tech, United HealthGroup (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare stock in the Dow and one of the index's worst-performing components this year, enjoyed a decent day Friday, gaining 2.05% to put a dent into a year-to-date loss of almost 3%. On Thursday, UnitedHealth declared a quarterly dividend of $1.08 per share, up from the previous quarter's payout of 90 cents a share.McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continued its assault on the record books, hitting another all-time high after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the fast food giant with a $220 price target, implying decent upside from Friday's close around $206.&quot;The company has generated strong growth in international markets, and though its traffic has been down in the U.S., its same-store sales have easily outperformed competitors as customers pay higher prices and order more add-ons,&quot; according to Restaurant Business. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayHeading into Friday, it was expected that the May jobs report would miss expectations and do so in a big way. Still, it is encouraging to see riskier assets, such as stocks, handle that number with aplomb. There is still plenty of June, but the Dow closed the first week of a month that is historically rough on stocks on a four-day winning streak.Traders likely bid stocks higher today because the weak jobs number stoked hope that if the economy slows, the Federal Reserve could step in with interest rate cuts. In fact, bond markets are now pricing in as many as three rate cuts this year, with one possibly coming as soon as next month.It remains to be seen whether or not the Fed will pursue any rate cuts this year, so monitoring President Trump's Twitter feed for trade updates may help investors get a sense for where stocks are headed next week.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

The stock is trying to work its way out of a bear market (still 19.90% below its 52-week high) and if it can gain another 4.4% to reclaim its 200-day moving average, there could be something to see here.Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) added 1.16% after iPhone supplier Foxconn said Tuesday that is the capability to shift iPhone assembly out of China if needed and that it has capacity in other locations to meet U.S. demand for the popular smartphone. About a quarter of Foxconn's production capacity is found outside of China.Apple is now on a six-day winning streak. CEO Tim Cook said last week he does not expect China to overtly target his company as a result of the trade war and analysts seem to think tariff talk as it pertain to Apple is mostly noise.&quot;The fundamental impact on iPhone production and the potential cost increases are thus far containable with shares baking in a much more draconian/worst-case scenario,&quot; said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a recent note.As was noted here yesterday, the Dow's financial services components have been solid recently. While the group did not set the world on fire today, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trader higher on the likelihood of higher dividends from the sector following completion of the Federal Reserve's stress tests.&quot;Large bank stocks could go still higher, boosted by double-digit dividend increases expected to be authorized under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, according to analysts at JPMorgan,&quot; reports Lawrence Strauss for Barron's. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones Today: Banks And Burgers?With dividends poised to rise, revenue streams that rely heavily on the U.S. and surprisingly low volatility, bank stocks, including those in the Dow, are sensible ideas for investors to consider over the near-term.Add burgers into that conversation as Dow component McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continues trading higher. On Tuesday, UBS reiterated a &quot;neutral&quot; rating on the stock, but did boost its price target to $203 from $185. Shares of McDonald's are up nearly 14% this year, so it is not clear why UBS is not rating the stock a &quot;buy&quot; while raising its price target, but more upside appears imminent for the fast-food giant.As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-11,"Stocks are putting up impressive numbers so far this year. The S&P 500 is up 15%, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ is up 17.9%, and patient investors are reaping the rewards. But as this past May has shown, the markets are still volatile, and it’s tempting to look for ‘safe play’ investment. According to five-star blogger Aaron Levitt (Track Record & Ratings), the right stocks to buy are “the kind of equities that could be immune to the various geopolitical and economic events that are plaguing the markets currently.” So let’s dive into the TipRanks database and look at three stocks that are primed to keep delivering in the second half. Comcast Corporation (CMCSA)You wouldn’t necessarily pick the cable company as a market outperformer. Comcast has managed just that, however, gaining 20% year-to-date. The secret lies in streaming – by its Hulu agreement with Disney (DIS), Comcast is staking out a position in the future of television.The Hulu agreement gives Disney operating control of Hulu now – it already has a controlling stake in the company – while committing both parties to a minimum sale price for Comcast’s shares in 2024. The advantage for Comcast is two-fold: the company can focus on releasing its own streaming service next year, while continuing to enjoy the profits from Hulu. And should Disney work its usual magic and boost Hulu’s valuation, Comcast will sell its share based on the higher valuation.The near-term forward advantages which Comcast has locked in through the Hulu agreement are only part of the story. Comcast has shown double-digit annual EPS growth 15 times in the last 17 years, and generated $14 billion in free cash over in the last 12 months. Its cable and internet businesses provide a solid foundation to support the content production and technical innovation that the company needs to bring in new customers. The company’s upbeat forward-going prospects are reflected in the EPS estimates over the next three years – continued double digit growth. Add to this company’s attractive valuation and modest-but-reliable dividend, and you’ll understand why the market’s top analysts are so bullish.From Morgan Stanley, Benjamin Swinburne (Track Record & Ratings) looks at the details of the Hulu agreement. Acknowledging that Disney has the immediate advantage, he also points out the benefits for Comcast: “The new deal gives it downside protection and content flexibility as it builds out its own streaming plans.” At the end of May, five-star analyst Mike McCormack (Track Record & Ratings), of Guggenheim, upgraded his rating on CMCSA and summed up the company’s position in the simple statement that “[Comcast] is well positioned within a rapidly changing landscape.” McCormack set a price target for the stock at $52, indicating his confidence in a 25% upside.Comcast’s analyst consensus, based on all of its reviews over the last three months, is a ‘Moderate Buy.’ This consensus includes 7 buys and 3 holds. The stock is selling for $41, and the average price target of $48 suggests an upside potential of 17%.View CMCSA Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Waste Management, Inc. (WM)There’s not much out there more pedestrian than picking up the trash, but Waste Management manages to turn our messes into investor profits. Trash collection and disposal is big business, and with North America’s largest network of landfill sites, recycling plants, and collection trucks, Waste Management sets the standard for its competitors. WM’s trucks even operate on compressed natural gas, to reduce emissions, giving the company a reputation to match its green livery.Even better, for investors, is WM’s 28% year-to-date gain, well above the market average. WM shares got an immediate boost last week when two four-star analysts boosted their ratings of the stock. Writing for RBC Capital, Derek Spronck (Track Record & Ratings) pointed out WM’s “unique positioning within its sector.” Going into detail, he added, “We see Waste Management delivering out-sized earnings growth, driven by sustained organic growth rates and further enhanced by the announced acquisition of Advanced Disposal.” Appropriate to his upbeat outlook, Spronck upgraded his rating to ‘Outperform’ and gave WM a price target of $125, suggesting a potential upside of 9.8%.At the same time, Michael Hoffman (Track Record & Ratings) of Stifel also took another look at Waste Management, and bumped his price target up to $120. Hoffman, who made up upgrade after attending the company’s investor day, said, “The company and its senior leadership team are focused on … free cash flow growth with high quality incremental returns on capital.” He clearly sees management pursuing a successful path forward, as his price target for the stock indicates a 5.4% upside.Competent management pursuing cash flow and capital returns are not the only boon here for investors. Waste Management has a long history of steadily increasing its dividend payout. While the yield is modest – it currently stands at 1.72% annualized – each share earns over 50 cents per quarter. And WM has kept that payout reliable for nearly two decades.Waste Management gets a unanimous verdict from the analyst consensus – a ‘Strong Buy’ rating, based on 6 buys set in the last three months. The company’s shares currently sell for $113, so the $120 average price target gives an upside over 5%.View WM Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)And here’s the mature giant of the tech world, simply doing everything right. Microsoft has gained 32% year-to-date, head and shoulders above the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ indexes, and it has done so quietly, without generating the type of buzz that surrounds the FANG stocks. However quiet it may be, though, the success is unmistakable. On June 7, Microsoft became the third publicly traded company break above $1 trillion in market cap.The immediate driver of the company’s growth is the wild success of its Azure cloud computing service. Arriving several years after Amazon Web Services, Azure has enjoyed faster growth rates, a fact noted by Phillip Winslow (Track Record & Ratings) of Wells Fargo, who added, “The full multi-year impact of Azure's growth potential is still not properly reflected in consensus estimates for Microsoft.” Winslow’s estimate includes a price target of $145, indicating a possible 9.35% upside to the stock.That his estimate may be low is suggested by Bernstein’s Mark Moerdler (Track Record & Ratings), who puts a number to Azure’s potential: “Microsoft could generate more than $140 billion in cloud-computing sales over the long term.” Moerdler sees MSFT shares hitting $152, an upside of 14.6%.While the successful shift to the cloud and SaaS is powering the company’s current profits and returns, Microsoft is not placing all of its eggs in that basket. The company has made recent public demonstrations of its xCloud game streaming service, and the demos have highlighted several clear advantages in the field: a proprietary library of several thousand game titles; a ready audience in existing xBox customers; a network of data centers already supporting Azure and available to support game streaming. As Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s head of Project xCloud said, on how streaming is the future of gaming, “There are 2 billion people who play video games on the planet today. We're not going to sell 2 billion consoles. It's really about reaching a customer wherever they are, on the devices that they have.”Oppenheimer’s five-star analyst Timothy Horan (Track Record & Ratings) sees all of this – the success of Azure and the upcoming xCloud release – as linked. He says, “The company has totally restructured itself around the intelligent edge cloud. Microsoft sees Azure as a base layer that customers use to run their applications on top of but also as a building block for its services up the software stack through dozens of new PaaS and SaaS offerings.” Like Winslow (quoted above), Horan gives MSFT a price target of $145.Microsoft holds a ‘Strong Buy’ from the analyst consensus, based on no less than 23 buy ratings given in the last three months. The stock’s average price target of $142 gives a 7.7% upside to the current share price of $132.View MSFT Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailFind more fresh investing ideas in TipRanks’ Trending Stocks tool.

2019-06-13,"The fundamentals supporting fast food stocks are healthy today, and project to remain healthy for the foreseeable future. That's why I'm bullish on a select list of fast food stocks here and now.Favorable fundamentals will drive out-sized profit growth for these companies, and that growth will push their stocks higher over the next several months and years.Here's the fundamental backdrop. You have a healthy U.S. economy with low unemployment, big wage gains, low borrowing rates, and high consumer confidence. Putting all that together, the U.S. consumer today is about as healthy and as prone to spend as ever.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, consumers are increasingly fixated with elevated convenience and fast service, so they are increasingly drawn to fast food chains. These fast food chains are simultaneously re-inventing their menus to be more relevant, including incorporating healthier and trendier items like plant-based burgers. They are also improving the ordering process to be more convenient, and those improvements center around pairing up with online food ordering and delivery services.All in all, the fundamentals supporting fast food stocks are quite favorable. Stronger consumers coupled with smarter menu innovation and a strong delivery buildout equals strong growth for fast food chains.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy With Limited Trade War Exposure With that in mind, let's take a look at 6 fast food stocks to buy for healthy gains over the next several quarters. Fast Food Stocks to Buy: McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock At the top of this list, we have McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the king of the fast food industry that has been king for a long time, and projects to remain king for a lot longer thanks to its continued market-leading innovation.On the menu front, McDonald's has refreshed its menu from head to toe over the past several years. The company pioneered the All-Day Breakfast trend. They then introduced more chicken items onto the menu and more premium meat offerings.They've run promotions such as 2-for-$5, which have been huge successes. They've also incorporated bacon into their classic offerings. The company has also dabbled in the plant-based meat craze, offering the plant-based Big Vegan TS in 1,500 restaurants in Germany in April.Meanwhile, on the convenience front, McDonald's has rapidly scaled its presence in the delivery world. By most metrics, McDonald's now has one of the biggest delivery presences of any fast food chain. Also, McDonald's has integrated technology into its ordering processes. Many in-store ordering kiosks are now touch-screen, self-order kiosks.All in all, McDonald's has continued to improve its menu and service over the past the several months and years. These improvements put the company in a favorable position to grow for the foreseeable future as the U.S. consumer economy picks up steam. Yum (YUM)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrNext, we have Yum (NYSE:YUM), the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.With respect to menu innovation, Yum has done very well. Taco Bell is perhaps the market leader in menu innovation, seemingly rolling out a new, millennial-focused food item every few weeks.Taco Bell has also created ad campaigns to accompany those menu adds (see this Nacho Fries ad), and those campaigns only add to their appeal. KFC and Pizza Hut have been relatively light on the menu innovation front but have still kept their menus up-to-date with current consumption trends. KFC is also thinking about incorporating plant-based options on its menu, too.On the convenience front, Yum has also rapidly expanded its delivery capability through a big partnership with GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). Those delivery efforts for Taco Bell and KFC are still in their early days, with positive early reception and momentum. As such, the delivery expansion tailwind should remain vigorous for the foreseeable future.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 In sum, Yum's unique marketing and menu innovation, coupled with delivery build-out at Taco Bell and KFC, should help drive healthy sales and profit growth over the next several quarters. Jack in the Box (JACK)Source: Rojer via Flickr (modified)The third fast food stock which looks ready to rally is Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK).On the menu front, Jack in the Box has taken a unique and strategic approach to wallet share expansion and promotions. With respect to winning wallet share, Jack in the Box didn't just invent new menu items - they invented an entire new mealtime, which they dub &quot;late-night&quot;. This late-night menu caters to those who get hungry well past dinner hours, and in creating this menu, Jack in the Box has won consumer wallet-share. Meanwhile, Jack in the Box is finally figuring out how to create discounted combos which offer great value to the consumer without cutting into margins.Meanwhile, like many of the other chains on this list, Jack in the Box has rapidly scaled out its delivery capabilities over the past few years. At the end of last quarter, roughly 90% of all Jack in the Box locations were serviced by at least one delivery service. Thus, as the delivery market gains traction over the next several years, Jack in the Box will be fully levered to that growth, and consequently grow with the market.Overall, Jack in the Box's unique approach to menu additions and promotions, on top of its already huge delivery network, gives the stock a healthy growth outlook over the next several quarters. Shake Shack (SHAK)Source: Abdullah AlBargan via Flickr (Modified)Next up, we have rapidly expanding premium fast casual chain Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK).Shake Shack seems to really understand the importance of menu innovation. The company actually has a dedicated kitchen - dubbed the Innovation Kitchen - for testing and developing new products and LTOs (limited time only offerings). This Innovation Kitchen has cooked up some big new menu adds over the past few months, including Chick'n Bites and new unique shake flavors like tiramisu. So long as Shake Shack keeps pouring resources into the Innovation Kitchen - and so long as that Innovation Kitchen keeps pumping out exciting, new menu adds - Shake Shack's comparable sales performance should remain healthy.With respect to elevated convenience, the delivery business is rapidly scaling, and the company is doing everything it can to optimize that delivery business. Shake Shack is refreshing many of its stores to allow for a more streamlined and efficient pick-up process. All the new units are also being built with this in mind, too.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money Broadly, Shake Shack continues to put menu innovation and digital convenience at the forefront of its growth narrative, and in so doing, exposes itself to big growth potential over the next several years. Domino's Pizza (DPZ)Source: Shutterstock One of the more interesting fast food stocks on this list is Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ).On the menu front, Domino's - like many of its peers on this list - is one of the more innovative chains in the fast food world. Domino's started off as a pizza parlor. They are so much more than that now. The menu today includes pasta, chicken, sandwiches, and more. Further, Domino's has been very innovative with its marketing, including doing things like fixing pot holes so consumers don't drop their pizzas. In sum, these menu adds and marketing have kept Domino's atop the pizza game by a wide margin.The convenience story is a bit different. Unlike the other chains on this list, Domino's didn't just build out its delivery business. Domino's has been a delivery business for a long time. As such, the macro-delivery tailwind isn't really a tailwind at all for Domino's. Instead, it translates into more competition in the delivery space.Nonetheless, DPZ's sustained dominance atop the pizza market has enabled it to offset increased delivery competition, and the company has reported healthy comps for the past several years. So long as this remains true, DPZ stock should march higher. Restaurant Brands International (QSR)Source: Shutterstock Last, but not least, on this list of fast food stocks to buy is Restaurant Brands International (NASDAQ:QSR), the parent company of Tim Hortons, Popeye's, and Burger King.Menu innovation has been core to each three of QSR's big chains. Tim Hortons introduced multiple new items to its menu in 2018, including several new hot and cold beverages. Tim Hortons also rolled out Breakfast Anytime. Over at Popeye's, management has relied on LTOs and promotions to drive continued positive comps, such as the $5 tackle box and $5 shrimp offer. Meanwhile, Burger King is on the cutting edge of plant-based meat, and has already launched Impossible Whoppers, which have created a huge traffic surge at participating locations.With respect to convenience, QSR has invested in all the right things to maximize consumer convenience. The company has built out its delivery network to span about half of all its U.S. restaurants. The company has also invested big into self-order kiosks, mobile app ordering, and digital menu boards.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession Net net, QSR has done everything right over the past several quarters on the menu innovation and consumer convenience fronts, and those right moves lay the groundwork for QSR stock to rally over the next several quarters.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD, GRUB and DPZ.

2019-06-13,"Shares of Dave & Buster's (NASDAQ:PLAY) dropped sharply in mid-June after the arcade and themed dining owner reported first-quarter numbers that fell well short of expectations. At the same time, management reduced its full-year revenue and profit guides. Investors were disappointed. PLAY stock dropped more than 20%.Source: Shutterstock This big sell-off, though, is overdone, and with PLAY stock hovering around $40, the medium- to long-term bull thesis looks very compelling here.To be sure, the first quarter numbers weren't good. Comparable sales growth was negative. Revenue growth dropped below 10% for the first time in a long while. Margins compressed meaningfully. Profits growth came in at a multi-quarter low.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 But, if you zoom out, the long term trends here remain favorable. The shift towards an experience economy resonates well for Dave & Buster's comparable sales growth going forward.The unit growth trajectory remains favorable, and Dave & Buster's still projects to grow its unit base by 10% per year over the next several years. Margin compression is moderating and margins should ultimately stabilize.All in all, then, while the near term trends are negative, the long term trends are still positive. Against that backdrop, PLAY stock is trading at its cheapest valuation in recent memory. That combination ultimately paves the way for a huge rebound rally in PLAY stock over the next several months. The Near Term Is UglyThe situation at Dave & Buster's can broadly be summed up in one phrase: it's ugly right now, but it's pretty in the big picture.Right now, things are ugly for the themed dining restaurant and arcade. Comparable sales dropped 0.3% in the quarter, on top of a 4.9% drop last year, so comps are down more than 5% on a two-year basis. That's not good.Further, comps are expected to drop 0.5% this year, versus a 1.6% drop last year, so down more than 2% on a two year basis. That's not good, either. At the same time, margins are compressing, as the adjusted EBITDA margin has fallen by more than 100 basis points year-over-year for three straight quarters.The net result? Profit growth is being muted. A few years back, this was a consistent 20%-plus profit grower. Last quarter, D&B reported just 8.8% profit growth. The Long Term Is PrettyBut, if you zoom out, things are still pretty in the big picture.Most importantly, the experience economy continues to gain mainstream traction, and consumers are increasingly upping spend on experiences.This pivot towards experience-focused consumption benefits Dave & Buster's, since going to D&B is broadly seen by consumers as a fun experience that combines dining and gaming for a fun night out.That's why D&B comps were up 7.3% in 2014, 8.9% in 2015, and 3.3% in 2016. Comps did fall flat in 2017, and have retreated ever since, but that appears to just be normalization after a red hot streak in the middle of the decade.As the laps get easier, the comparable sales growth trend will improve, because the company is aligned with the secular shift towards an experience economy.Further, Dave & Buster's still only operates 127 stores. Management thinks the long term opportunity is 230 to 250 stores. Thus, this company can and will continue to grow its store base by 10% per year for the next several years.Meanwhile, margins are falling, but by less and less each quarter, so margin stabilization seems to be coming in the near future. Once comps improve, margins should improve, too.Overall, then, while negative comps and margin compression is the norm today, it won't be the norm forever. The long term norm here is positive comps and stable margins. D&B will get back to that soon, and when they do, PLAY will rally in a big way. Dave & Buster's Stock Has Big Upside PotentialFollowing the huge post-earnings slide, PLAY now trades at its cheapest valuation in recent memory with a mere 13-times forward earnings multiple.That's dirt cheap for the restaurant sector. The average forward earnings multiple in the restaurant sector is 25. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) trades at 25-times forward earnings. Yum (NYSE:YUM) trades at 28-times forward earnings. Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) trades at 20-times forward earnings.More importantly, this valuation discrepancy has nothing to do with growth potential. The average long term earnings growth rate across the restaurant sector is just over 10%. Dave & Buster's will drive 10% unit growth alone over the next several years.Assuming comps come back into slightly positive territory and margins stabilize, that 10% unit growth will produce profit growth well in excess of 10%.Thus, Dave & Buster's has a bigger forward growth trajectory than the average restaurant company, and yet PLAY trades at a huge discount to the average restaurant stock.This disconnect makes no sense and won't last forever. But, while it does last, investors should take advantage of it. This stock has tremendous upside potential from here in the medium to long term. Bottom Line on PLAY StockDave & Buster's had a bad quarter. But, the long term growth trajectory here remains favorable. As such, with PLAY stock plunging and trading at its cheapest valuation in recent memory, now seems like a good time to take advantage of near term weakness.In the medium to long term, PLAY stock will head considerably higher from here.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PLAY and MCD.

2019-06-16,"The voices are growing louder that the US economy is starting to sputter. From Morgan Stanley, stock strategist Michael Wilson said last month, “Recent data points suggest US earnings and economic risk is greater than most investors may think,” and the May jobs report, released on June 7, backed him up. The numbers were grim, with only 75,000 new jobs reported for the month, and the previous two months revised down by an equal amount. Other data has shown a slowdown in the services sector, and a nine-year low in manufacturing activity.The data is starting to point towards trouble, but the real problem with protecting your portfolio in a downturn lies in the lagging definition of a recession: two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Given that growth data is typically reported one month after the fact, this means that investors will always be 4 to 7 months late in taking protective measures. So, let’s be proactive about this, and take a look at TipRanks’ database to find some reliable stocks for defensive investing. These are not necessarily “classic” defensive stocks; rather, these companies have shown by recent performance that they can deliver profits even in a downturn.  Apple, Inc. (AAPL)First on our list today is Apple, partly because these days it seems you just can’t build a portfolio without a tech giant but mostly because Apple has proven both its long-term reliability and its short-term resiliency. For the long term, Apple is up 130% in the last five years, while in the short haul the company recovered well from the Q4 2018 downturn and has already made up more than half the losses from last month’s market swoon.More importantly, Apple has also shown that it can adapt and change. Steve Jobs’ unique vision underlay his company’s growth in the early 2000s, and his death in 2011 prompted fears that his successor, Tim Cook, would not fill his shoes and the company would stagnate. It is fair to say that events of the past three quarters have laid that fear to rest. While Cook is not Jobs, he hasn’t needed to be – he took over a mature company with established niches and a growing customer base. He has shown himself fully capable of meeting the challenges the market has posed.Cook met last year’s market dip head-on. He admitted that Apple’s core iPhone sales were not going to fully recover, and orchestrated a plan to meet the changing conditions by shifting the sales focus to Services, reconciling iPhone to a longer replacement cycle, and promoting the iPad, iMac, and Macbook lines. Under all of this, helping to ensure success, is the near-billion strong loyal customer base that the company has built over the past decade.So, Apple has the solid foundation that every defensive stock needs. Looking forward, the company made a favorable impression on market analysts earlier this month at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Kathryn Huberty (Track Record & Ratings) of Morgan Stanley said after Apple’s presentation, “After (Monday’s) announcements, we believe Apple Watch and Mac will more meaningfully contribute to App Store growth, while further solidifying Apple as the most attractive platform for app developers.” Noting the company’s commitment to increasing its Services sector, she added, “Apple's top growth opportunity is driving increased user engagement with apps.” Huberty gives Apple a buy rating with a $231 price target, seeing an upside of 19%.Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson (Track Record & Ratings) also gives Apple high ratings. Peering into the future of iPhone, he notes that 20% of current owners are interested in upgrading to 5G, and says, “Interest in 5G will only grow from here, so this is a favorable early sign that 5G is viewed as a key feature… we believe that as long as services revenue continues to perform well, it will tide many investors over until anticipation for 5G iPhones intensifies.” His price target on AAPL, $230, also suggests an 19% upside.The analyst consensus on AAPL shares is a ‘Moderate Buy,’ based on 19 buy ratings, 16 holds, 2 sells given over the last three months. Shares are trading at $192, so the $212 average price target indicates an upside of 10%.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)This one is a traditional defensive stock, and it has a reputation for being a bit staid, but don’t let that fool you: Johnson & Johnson offers real value, consistently delivering on both dividend and long-term equity growth. Both are markers of a strong defensive play.The company’s current dividend yield is 2.72%, which may seem small, but at current share prices it equates to an annual payout of $3.80. Better than the actual dividend payment, however, is JNJ’s dividend history. The company has been paying, and steadily increasing, its dividend since the early 1970s. This policy of consistently rewarding shareholders provides a steady source of income for investors, and also encourages them to reinvest that income in the company. It’s a win-win policy.As a long-term investment, JNJ has, like Apple, proven its worth. The stock has gained 56% in the last 5 years, and shows a 9% gain over the past 12 months. And also like Apple, JNJ has proven resilient in the face of adversity: last December, the stock took a hard hit from bad press related to the widely reported talcum powder recall, but has since regained most of that loss. In another example of corporate resiliency, JNJ was recently given a buy rating with a $157 price target by five-star analyst Joanne Wuensch (Track Record & Ratings) of BMO Capital, after she reviewed the status of current legal action the company faced in the state of Oklahoma in regard to the opioid abuse epidemic. Wuensch notes that the case will likely be resolved quickly, and points out, “Litigation is a common occurrence in the health care sector that takes significant time to resolve, and often headlines are worse than reality.” Her price target indicates confidence in the stock, and a 12% upside.Johnson & Johnson’s success rests on two separate bases. The first, and most widely recognized, is the company’s array of popular consumer brands. JNJ is the producer of Band-Aids, Listerine, and Tylenol, to name just a few. Consumer products provide a respectable 16.7% of annual revenue (nearly $14 billion), but the real money for JNJ lies in pharmaceuticals. To put it in perspective, two drugs – Remicade and Simponi – account for 11.3% of the company’s total revenues, two-thirds as much as all of the consumer products.Unlike many large-scale drug producers, Johnson & Johnson is not deeply exposed to payment issues with the Medicare and Medicaid systems. This is important for investors, as both programs have reputations for underpaying, and with an election year coming up both programs are likely to become political footballs as candidates promise ever more benefits. This is a key point noted by Terence Flynn (Track Record & Ratings). Writing for Goldman Sachs, Flynn says, “The company has the lowest exposure to Medicare/Medicaid within the group. As a result, the stock will be less impacted by potential drug pricing headlines/policy proposals ahead of the 2020 presidential election.” Flynn sets a price target of $163 for JNJ, suggesting an upside of 16%.JNJ’s consensus rating of ‘Moderate Buy’ is derived from 7 buy and 5 hold reviews. The stock’s $149 average price target and $140 share price equate to an upside potential of 7%.View JNJ Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)Fast food burgers might not come immediately to mind when you hear the phrase ‘Return on Investment,’ but McDonald’s has been delivering more than just quick eats. The company has gained an impressive 16% so far this year, rising from $176 on January 2 to a closing price of $205 on June 14. Even more impressive, between May 3 and June 3, while the S&P 500 was slipping 6.8%, MCD shares were gaining 1.2%.It’s all part of a steady-growth story going back to May of 2015, when current CEO Steve Easterbrook took over. McD’s had just posted its first sales decline in more than a decade, and the new chief’s mandate was simple: refresh a stale brand. His ‘Turnaround Plan’ got the company back to basics, emphasizing fresher, higher quality ingredients; a streamlined menu; and physical rebuilding efforts in the company’s aging franchise locations. Through it all, McDonald’s has maintained its high dividend; the payout is now $4.64 annually, for a yield of 2.26%.The market’s analysts agree that MCD is on a stable upward path. Writing at BTIG, Peter Saleh (Track Record & Ratings) says, “The company's menu strategy shift has boosted comps. Expect the increased menu focus on bundles and full price items – and away from deep discounts - to drive higher U.S. average check for the next couple of quarters.” Saleh boosted his price target to $220 on MCD, suggesting an upside of 7%.Saleh’s not alone. Weighing in from Merrill Lynch last week, Gregory Francfort (Track Record & Ratings) sees “2Q-4Q same-store sales (including 3.9%-4.2% for the U.S.) looking conservative with more upside potential than downside risk.” Like Saleh, he gives MCD a $220 price target.Overall, MCD has a ‘Moderate Buy’ consensus based on 19 analyst ratings given in the last three months, including 14 buys and 5 holds. The stock sells for $205 as of June 14, and the average price target of $216 indicates an upside potential of 5.5%.View MCD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW)If the US economy does turn down to recession, Lowe’s is in an excellent position to take advantage of the changed conditions. The do-it-yourself home improvement supplier operates on the big-box model, using bulk to offer discounts on the products and services that, in bad times, homeowners are more likely to handle as DIY.This puts Lowe’s strength as a defensive play is in its niche – the stores offer products that most people need, at discounts that grow more attractive in a downturn. Home maintenance won’t stop for a recession, and DIY really is a good way to save money. In addition, Lowe’s has maintained its lucrative contractor business.And now we get to the weakness in this stock. Lowe’s is the second largest home improvement superstore, after Home Depot (HD), and the company is having trouble boosting revenues and earnings against its larger competition. LOW shares have been on a roller coaster ride for the last 18 months, although they are up nearly 8% year-to-date. On an operational level, Lowe’s has had difficulty executing online sales strategy and home delivery, and managing inventory control. Both are putting serious drag on the bottom line, and holding down revenue growth.Pushing back is CEO Marvin Ellison, who took over in July of last year. He has marked both online sales and inventory control as key parts of a turnaround effort to improve the company’s sales and revenue growth. Early assessments of Ellison’s success are guardedly optimistic; LOW did beat sales and revenue expectations in its most recent quarterly report, although EPS missed by 8%. As Keith Hughes (Track Record & Ratings), of SunTrust Robinson points out, “The recovery will not be a &quot;quick story&quot;, even though we are positive on the re-set of expectations and maintain that the 10% projected earnings growth this year still tops Home Depot's (HD) expected flat growth.” Hughes sets a $120 price target on LOW, suggesting an upside of 20%.UBS analyst Michael Lasser (Track Record & Ratings) also sets a buy rating on LOW, with an upbeat $115 target and 15% upside. He writes, “The risk-reward ration on the stock is attractive.”On consensus, Lowe’s keeps a ‘Strong Buy’ rating, based on the 14 buys and 4 holds given in the past three months. While the company faces headwinds, it holds a strong position in a valuable niche, and is widely perceived as facing its difficulties effectively. Of the stocks in this article, LOW offers the best upside potential, at 16%, based on the $99 share price and $115 average price target.View LOW Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Walmart, Inc. (WMT)Like Lowe’s, Walmart gains its defensive-stock status from its business model. The king of brick-and-mortar retailers offers discount customers the ultimate in one-stop shopping, putting everything that consumers could want or need under one roof, from baby diapers to daily groceries to minor car repairs. Really, there’s nothing you can’t get at Walmart and that fact has made it the world’s largest company by revenue and the world’s largest private employer.Walmart’s biggest competition comes from Amazon.com (AMZN), but it is more of a whale and elephant story than a cage match. Each company is dominant in its own domain, and each has faced challenges trying to expand on the other’s territory. Walmart may have found a way to leverage its existing stores for an online advantage – rather than offer home delivery (an area in which Amazon already excels), Walmart offers online purchasers an option to pick up their merchandise at the nearest Walmart location. This is a viable alternative, since according to some estimates everyone in the US lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store.As a defensive play, Walmart’s greatest advantage is the pedestrian nature of its business. Everyone needs the products they offer, and in hard times, Walmart’s famously low prices will simply look more attractive. Writing after WMT reported FY20 Q1 earnings, Raymond James’ Budd Bugatch (Track Record & Ratings) said, “Investors should be most encouraged by the U.S. segment, which showed a 5.5 percent year-over-year increase in operating income to $4.1 billion. The business saw strength from a favorable sales mix while e-commerce margins came in better than management's own expectations.” While he believes the company is on firm footing, his price target, at $110, suggests only a modest 1% upside.Guggenheim’s Robert Drbul (Track Record & Ratings) sums up Walmart’s case quite well in his recent research note: “We believe the business remains quite healthy, with solid physical/digital results in recent quarters… We continue to believe WMT’s resources uniquely position it to successfully evolve in an ever-changing retail environment. While trade concerns/tariffs may create quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we believe the management team will astutely navigate any changes.” Drbul maintained a $115, which indicates a 5.5% upside from current levels.On average, WMT shares have a price target of $113, which gives an upside of 4.5% from the share price of $109. The analyst consensus of ‘Moderate Buy’ is based on 8 buys, 2 holds, and 1 sell set in the last three months.View WMT Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailYou can learn more about these stocks using TipRanks Stock Comparison tool.

2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Carrefour SA, Europe's largest retailer,  may be the latest Western company to pull back from China. It’s unlikely to be the last.On Monday, the hypermarket operator said it would sell 80% of its China business for 4.8 billion yuan ($699 million) in cash to Suning.com, the Chinese retailer backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Carrefour will retain a 20% stake. Over the past few years, the French company’s plans to shrink its China footprint has been one of the worst-kept secrets in banking. Though Carrefour sold the business pretty cheaply – with a valuation of 0.2 times 2018 sales, compared with the industry average of 0.84, according to Citigroup Inc. – loosening its ties to the mainland may be a smart move, whatever the price. With sales in the country flagging and losses piling up, the deal comes as China’s macroeconomic picture is also darkening.Yet the key challenge for Carrefour preceded the trade war. In recent years, online-only players such as Alibaba have been piling pressure on brick-and-mortar operations, with Tesco Plc, Best Buy Co. and Marks & Spencer Plc each announcing plans to pull back from the mainland market. Carrefour’s share of the country’s hypermarket segment fell to 4.6% last year from 8.2% in 2009, Citi writes.(1)   That’s a problem in a country with one of the world’s biggest rates of e-commerce penetration. China's online retail sales reached 3.86 trillion yuan in the first five months of this year, accounting for more than one-fifth of the country's total purchases of consumer goods, according to a recent report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. To make matters worse, foreign brands no longer have the cachet they once enjoyed – at least in low-end consumer goods. In a survey last year, Credit Suisse AG said that Chinese consumers preferred domestic purveyors in categories like food and drinks and home appliances. With the trade war whipping up nationalist fervor, that trend may accelerate: The bank's latest poll of shoppers 18 to 29 years old showed that 41% preferred phones made by Huawei Technologies Co., up from 28%, while interest for Apple Inc.’s products fell to 28% from 40%.For many firms, ceding control to a local partner is probably the best way forward. Carrefour appears to be borrowing a page from the playbook of McDonald’s Corp., which sold 80% of its China business in 2017 to a tie-up between state giant Citic Group Corp. and private equity firm Carlyle Group LP.Or consider Walmart Inc., which sold its e-commerce delivery site to JD.com Inc. in 2016 in exchange for a stake in the Chinese retailer. The U.S. firm now aims to open 40 of its Sam’s Club stores in China by 2020. Costco Wholesale Corp. is also betting on China’s appetite for bulk buying, with plans to open its first bricks-and-mortar store in August. Whether Costco can pull this off without a local partner remains unclear.What is clear is that Carrefour won’t be the last retailer to rethink its China strategy. Germany's Metro AG is also looking to sell its $1.5 billion Chinese business. At a time when Chinese acquisitions overseas have dried up, bankers at least can thank Western firms for managing to drum up some business from the mainland. (1) The bank citesEuromonitor International research.To contact the author of this story: Nisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2019-06-30,"JP Morgan has just released a valuable report setting out its tips for the second half of 2019. The firm takes a deep dive into an often-overlooked area of the market- the restaurant industry. Here we take a closer look at three of the stocks the firm’s John Ivankoe is recommending for 2H19, and one stock where it’s better to steer clear. Encouragingly, two of the stocks highlighted by the firm also boast a bullish Strong Buy consensus from the Street. The third still scores a cautious optimistic Moderate Buy rating. That’s based on all the ratings received by each stock over the last three months. Let’s see how the following top stock ideas stack up now: Stocks to Buy: Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ)First on the ‘buy’ list comes one of the world’s largest pizza sellers- Domino’s Pizza. But DPZ does much more than just sell pizza. JP Morgan describes DPZ as a technology company disguised as a marketing company disguised as a pizza company. The firm first upgraded Domino’s back in March with a $290 price target. That’s actually on the low-end vs the Street’s average price target of $313.  “We continue to remain constructive on shares of DPZ following our March 19th upgrade. We believe DPZ trends are easing down to the lower-end of its stated 8- 12% system-wide sales growth, but for such results to still leave them near/at the top of franchise-driven growth within global QSR [quick service restaurants]” explains the firm. In short, its Domino’s low-cost delivery model that keeps DPZ ahead of the game, says Ivankoe. That’s down to 4 key reasons, namely: 1) total pre-tip fees to the consumer are only $3-4 2) the 5,903 US store network allows excellent service times, 3) franchisees pay only $0.25 to receive a digital order (much cheaper than competitors), and 4) the popular 2-for-$5.99 each delivery promotion.Meanwhile superior customer insights, data-driven decision making, and system sales growth of 8-12% justify a premium multiple over peers, the analyst tells investors. Overall we can see how the stock scores 10 recent buy ratings from analysts vs just 1 hold rating:View DPZ Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Stocks to Buy: Mcdonald's Corp (MCD)From one food giant to the next, McDonald’s is another key stock that the firm recommends buying/ adding to now. Plus McDonald’s makes it to the firm’s elite Analyst Focus List of stocks set to outperform.“We continue to be constructive on MCD shares and given the strong top line momentum, feel comfortable owning into 2Q results” cheers Ivankoe.  “F19 lapping the difficult F18 in US, developed market strength should continue. Not too expensive” he added.Interestingly the analyst highlights delivery as a source of future upside for the stock. Right now delivery is available in over 9,000 stores (20,000 globally), but looking ahead it should become a more meaningful contributor. App integration is set for 3Q19 and national advertising around delivery is coming online in 2H19.“We continue to recommend MCD as a long-term core holding in the restaurant space for relatively low risk/solid absolute return” concludes Ivankoe. “We focus investors on the company’s FCF generation and long-term FCF potential matched with low sensitivities to comps and margins (both company-owned and franchise) and the company’s move to a lower-risk business model via refranchising.”As with Domino's, MCD boasts a Strong Buy Street consensus with 15 analysts making bullish calls on the stock, and 5 analysts staying on the sidelines:View MCD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Stocks to Buy: US Foods Holding Corp (USFD)US Foods is a leading foodservice distributor, with over 250,000 customers, including restaurants, regional chains and healthcare groups. Ivankoe sees USFD as well positioned to manage competition from Restaurant Depot and Amazon (AMZN), while noting that “Business transformation efforts focused on efficiency and effectiveness remain a major opportunity.”And according to JP Morgan this is by far the better choice over rival distributor Sysco Corporation (SYY). “We prefer USFD over SYY: USFD trades at a meaningful discount to SYY despite better volume trends and a more favorable 2019 margin setup” is how Ivankoe sums up the situation. He has a $40 price target on USFD. In fact, the analyst reveals that SYY recently pointed to weak industry volume trends, however, in a follow up call with USFD they noted no change in industry dynamics. “Distinctive merchandising approach and customer-facing technology allow for differentiation in what can be seen as a commoditized offering” states the analyst.Plus the company is gearing up to close its massive $1.8 billion acquisition of SGA Food Group. USFD is aiming for $55m of runrate synergies by the end of 2022. “This acquisition will significantly increase US Foods’ reach across key markets in the attractive and growing Northwest region of the U.S. and adds one of the most well-regarded regional distributors to our company,” commented US Foods CEO Pietro Satriano. View USFD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Stocks to Sell: Texas Roadhouse Inc (TXRH)The outlook isn’t quite so rosy for steak specialist Texas Roadhouse. The company, rated Sell by JP Morgan, is on track for a tricky second half of the year according to the firm. “We expect another relatively difficult quarter at Texas Roadhouse” writes the analyst, who expects continued store margin declines (down 95bp vs. consensus down 60bp) driven by higher labor costs. He notes that TXRH trades well on top of casual dining and vs. its 10-year monthly average multiples of ~20x. Indeed, Ivankoe’s $55 price target is only very marginally above the stock’s current share price of $53.67. “We would argue that MSD positive comps are priced in at this multiple and that even maintaining store margins at or above the 17.0% level (vs 17.4% in F18) will be difficult given persistent labor inflation and rising commodity costs.”See which other stocks top analysts are recommending from different industries here","JP Morgan’s 2H19 Outlook: 3 Stocks to Add, and 1 to Avoid"

2019-07-01,"With the generally pessimistic and sometimes sensational headlines surrounding the U.S.-China trade war, it may surprise some that viable investment sectors exist. Even more surprising are some of the market segments experiencing positive sentiment. For instance, restaurant stocks are charging significantly higher than they were at the beginning of the year.Don't take my word for it: check out the sector benchmark Dow Jones US Restaurants & Bars Index. On a year-to-date basis, the index is up over 24%. And while the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average is no slouch at 15% YTD, the performance difference is clear. So what's driving enthusiasm toward restaurant stocks?One explanation is that geopolitical headwinds are still too high level to impact most Americans. Yes, the trade war situation is absolutely crucial. Right now, the U.S. and China have agreed to a truce, not a trade deal. Still, the fallout from poor relations with China have not generated significant watercooler conversations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe second and more important point is that restaurant stocks have similar traits to so-called vice or sin investments. No matter what is going on with the economy, people need an outlet. Usually, going out to eat represents a relatively cheap form of entertainment.It's also an excursion that families can control. A major reason why professional sports attendance is declining is due to rising costs. However, families can choose which eateries to attend based on their cost preferences. Therefore, restaurant stocks have outpaced other event or entertainment-based investments.Finally, the National Restaurant Association forecasts a strong year for restaurant stocks. Better yet, every subsegment except one should experience a year-over-year uptick.  * 7 Stocks on Sale the Insiders Are Buying With that, here are seven restaurant stocks to put on your plate: Wendy's (WEN)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrOften lost in the mix behind big marquee names like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) or Burger King, Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) is still a name you shouldn't ignore. For one thing, the performance of WEN stock has done nothing but impress onlookers. Since the January opener, shares have soared nearly 28%.Better yet, if you're a big proponent of technical analysis, you can still make a bullish case for WEN stock. According to some momentum indicators, shares of the fast-food joint have a shot at moving past $26. Given the WEN stock price of $19.58, that would represent a sizable 33% swing.But more importantly, WEN stock enjoys fundamental justification for such a move higher. While the company has successfully brought in more people, they're gaining traction on another component: getting their customers to open their wallets deeper for higher-ticket items.It's no accident that profitability margins have improved in the first quarter of 2019. If that continues, look for WEN stock to gain accordingly. Denny's (DENN)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrLet's face reality: When you're considering a special night on the town, the name Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN) comes nowhere on your list. DENN stock is an investment toward comfort food, and not much else. But we also have to bring up another important angle. Comfort food isn't a bad gig, no matter what the market condition.As far as I'm aware, every single Denny's location is open 24 hours. Thus, if your night out extended a bit too long, there's Denny's. Also, many people go straight to Denny's to sober up after clubbing. If the job market is stable -- which it is right now -- the company benefits from being one of few eateries open at odd hours. In turn, that supports DENN stock.Also, we should see a record number of people hitting the road this summer. Invariably, that involves families stopping over to grab a bite to eat. And because we might see an unusually high uptick this year, that should play into higher valuations for DENN stock.  * 7 One-Stock Portfolios for Passive Investors Lastly, Denny's is cheap. So if we do have a downturn in the economy, DENN stock might avoid the brunt of the damage. Darden Restaurants (DRI)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)A powerhouse name among restaurant stocks, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) is enjoying a strong first half of the year. Since the beginning of January, DRI stock is up over 24%. Moreover, some of the same conditions that will likely benefit Denny's should also drive up Darden Restaurants.For one thing, Darden levers some of the most coveted names in sit-down restaurants. Not only that, its coverage is one of the most diverse when compared to other restaurant stocks. For comfort food, Darden owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse brands. But they also address consumers with more sophisticated tastes with brands like Seasons 52. This should help bring in the goods for DRI stock in terms of revenue and profitability.In fact, that's what we're seeing. Over the past few years, revenue has strongly moved higher. But earnings have also increased accordingly, which bolsters the case for DRI stock. In addition, because Darden offers multiple brands across the price spectrum, they'll enjoy the benefits of the aforementioned travel bump. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN)Source: Chris Waits Via FlickrDunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) is another name among restaurant stocks that's killing it so far this year. Since January's opening price, DNKN stock is up 27%. Undoubtedly, a major reason why is its coffee: worker bees love its coffee and Dunkin' Brands dishes up some delectable cups.Furthermore, the commodities market have had their say in DNKN stock. Although coffee prices have recently spiked up, they are still deflated relative to prior years' average prices. Theoretically, this should help Dunkin' in terms of its bottom line.Of course, no company can depend solely on fortuitous circumstances. What investors in restaurant stocks will key in on is management's push to attract millennials. To this end, they've embraced popular apps like Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay. Dunkin' has also advantaged the consumer-tech firm's iMessage platform to further engage with their young clientele.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever It's a move that makes perfect sense for DNKN stock. Over the next several years, millennials will represent the largest workforce in the U.S. They'll need lots of coffee and serving their needs is the most logical action they can take. Jack in the Box (JACK)Source: Rojer via Flickr (modified)I'm going to cut straight to the chase. Out of the restaurant stocks specializing in fast food, Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) is probably the riskiest. Back in December, management announced a &quot;strategic review&quot; of its financing options. That normally entails a sale of the company. However, no one is buying, which raises eyebrows for JACK stock.Another problem is infighting between franchisees and the corporate leadership. The former is concerned that the latter is merely focusing on nearer-term goals, like the JACK stock price. They argue that the organization should consider longer-term goals, especially to address the needs of millennial consumers.Although I don't have skin in this game, I find myself agreeing with the franchisees. As a San Diego-based company, Jack in the Box has a strong presence in the west coast. That's ideal since this region is always high in demand. Moreover, Jack also has several locations in Texas, which is experiencing an influx of people.That might bother the locals. However, if you're thinking about speculating on JACK stock, the population shift brings up an interesting argument. Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY)Source: Shutterstock Right now, the absolute riskiest name among major restaurant stocks is Dave & Buster's Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY). Unfortunately, extremely volatility visited PLAY stock after the underlying company posted disappointing Q1 earnings results. It suffered a decline in comparable-store sales, and management adjusted down full-year guidance.However, it wasn't all bad news. Dave & Buster's brought in sales of $363.6 million, up 9.5% from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, management opened seven new stores, up one from Q1 2018. That, however, was not enough to spare PLAY stock a huge double-digit loss.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains Still, I think the markets' response toward PLAY stock is greatly exaggerated. For one thing, Dave & Buster's provides a natural outlet to soak up demand that's leaving professional sports leagues. My argument is that people still need physical entertainment venues: Dave & Buster's has an opportunity to capitalize on this dynamic if it plays its marketing cards right. Chanticleer Holdings (BURG)Source: Shutterstock Before you think about taking a gamble on Chanticleer Holdings (NASDAQ:BURG), you should know that it's an extremely speculative name. With BURG stock trading hands at just above $1, this isn't something that you bank your retirement savings on. And although its financials are improving somewhat, it's still a rough picture.So why mention Chanticleer? Simply put, the company has some attractive brands. On one end, Chanticleer covers the decadence angle with its popular Hooters restaurants. Chanticleer is also well known (or perhaps notorious) for American Burger Co's &quot;Roadstar.&quot; That's four cheeseburgers in one.But on the other end, the holding company owns brands like Little Big Burger, Just Fresh and BGR. These names definitely cater to millennials and health-conscious consumers. Thus, BURG stock has something for everyone.Historically, this widespread approach hasn't helped BURG stock. However, shares have ticked up since early June. Again, this is a big risk: only buy it with gambling money that you can afford to lose.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-02,"As we start the latter half of the year, markets face uncertainty as to how the trade wars will develop, what the Federal Reserve will do next and whether the tensions with Iran will keep heating up. I am going to discuss three Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks that are appropriate for long-term portfolios: Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).Having a long-term focus enables investors to patiently get through the weekly noise of the markets while they relax with the knowledge that their portfolio stocks have the quality to weather short-term adverse developments. These investors do not need to make constant plans for the payment of capital gains taxes as they do not have to worry about selling their shares in the short-run.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer Finally, all three stocks pay stable dividends, which adds up over the years. Income investors know that they can compound their returns through reinvesting dividends from high-yielding shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pfizer (PFE)Source: Shutterstock Pfizer is one of the world's largest prescription drug companies. Its global portfolio includes medicines, vaccines, and consumer healthcare products.PFE stock's commercial operations fall under three segments:  * Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), a science-based innovative medicines business  * Upjohn, a global, off-patent branded and generic established medicines business  * Consumer Healthcare, which includes Pfizer's over-the-counter medicinesPfizer's robust clinical pipeline has provided the company with impressive returns over the past few years. The group owns two of the world's best-selling drugs: the breast cancer treatment Ibrance and the blood thinner Eliquis (co-owned by Bristol-Meyers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)).2019 has been a big year for pharma mergers and acquisitions (M&A). In June, Pfizer announced that it would be acquiring Array BioPharma (NASDAQ:ARRY), the cancer-fighting specialist biotech, in a deal worth $11.4 billion. ARRY's two drugs, Braftovi and Mektovi, have already been approved for treating metastatic melanoma. In Array BioPharma's last quarter results, the two drugs combined achieved $35.1 million in sales.This acquisition is likely to strengthen Pfizer's long-term position in oncology, which is regarded as one of the fastest-growing segments of the pharmaceutical industry. Although analysts regard this buyout as a good decision for Pfizer, it is likely to be several quarters before the positive financial effects appear in PFE's balance sheet.On April 30, the company reported Q1 2019 earnings that came to 85 cents. Total revenue stood at $13.1 billion, higher by 1.64% year-over-year (YoY).  The next earnings report will be out in late July. Most investors don't think of Pfizer as a high-growth biotech, but they do recognize it as a mature and defensive big pharma with stable revenues.If you are interested in buying into PFE stock, you may want to study the next earnings release to decide whether you should own it for the long-term. With its robust balance sheet, low volatility, and strong AA S&P rating, the shares could be suitable for diversified portfolios.PFE stock could also provide shareholders with a steady stream of income for decades to come. Pfizer's dividend, which currently stands at about 3.3%, has increased for nine of the last 10 years. Pfizer's cash flow is strong and should allow a dividend increase well into the future. Coca Cola (KO)Source: Coca-ColaCoca-Cola is the world's largest beverage company with 20 different brands that generate more than $31 billion dollars in annual revenues. Many investors have regarded KO stock as a reliable investment over the years.Coca-Cola stock tops the list of Warren Buffet's longtime favorite holdings. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) owns 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola, worth over $18 billion. In the last quarter of 2018 when many stocks suffered sizable losses, KO was the only green stock among the top 10 holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.Yet most of this decade, KO has had its share of challenges and seen declining revenues. There has been a drop in soda sales as the U.S. consumer moves towards healthier beverages like flavored water. It is worth mentioning that despite the decline in soda sales, gross margins have remained stable at about 60%.Management has steered the company toward offering a beverage portfolio that seizes on the public's increased appetite for flavored drinks. In 2016, the company announced its &quot;One Brand Strategy&quot; and introduced a common visual identity and creative campaign for all brands.This year, the company introduced a U.S.-wide ad campaign for its new flavor, Orange Vanilla Coke. As a result of the changes in product offerings, cherry and vanilla-flavored Cokes account for about 9% of the dollar volume but bring in 18% of the dollar growth.KO also recently completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee, the biggest coffee chain in the U.K. Wall Street believes the purchase could lead to increased diversification away from soda and revenues, especially prompted by growth in the Chinese market, where Costa Coffee has almost 500 stores.Offering hot beverages for the first time is yet another strategic step for the group as it addresses the shift in consumer taste and purchasing behavior.As you decide what may be next for KO stock fundamentally, you may also want to think about whether the global economy or the U.S. is headed for a slowdown or recession.During periods of market volatility or economic downturn, consumer staples tend to be among the last products removed from household budgets. In other words, defensive stocks like KO may help your portfolio when the going gets tough in the markets.Despite the question marks regarding future growth at Coca-Cola, its dividends make the shares rather attractive. In February, the company increased its dividend and declared a new share buyback program.  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 The current dividend yield stands at 3.1% -- another reason why I believe KO stock belongs to a capital-growth portfolio. The next dividend payment is scheduled for July 1, 2019 to shareholders who purchased Coca-Cola stock prior to the ex-dividend of June 13. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock McDonald's operates in the fragmented food service industry, which includes competitors like Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). It has over 36,000 restaurants in over 100 countries.McDonald's latest earnings results came in better than expected. Group revenues of $4.95 billion topped analysts' estimates of $4.94 billion. Management gave an upbeat outlook on long-term growth and profitability.In addition to the acceleration of U.S. sales, McDonald's stock has benefited from international growth. Comparable U.S. store sales rose 4.5%. Global comparable-store sales rose 5.4%, mostly thanks to promotional mixed-priced deals, as well as store renovations.As one of the largest fast food chains around the globe, over 90% of the restaurants are currently franchised. The franchising business gives McDonald's a competitive edge as the initial fees and ongoing royalties mean high margins. MCD's operating margins now stand at almost 30%. As the franchisees carry the operating costs and business risks, McDonald's does not have to worry about the expenses of running those operations.The company owns most of the properties where their restaurants operate and collects rent from franchisees. MCD leases those out to the franchisees, often at significant markups. It may not be wrong to say that the company is in the real estate business as much as food services.In 2015, management initiated a turnaround plan focused on making MCD more agile by slimming down the corporate structures, improving menu quality, and delivering better customer service. Almost five years later, the steps have been paying off.As part of its efforts to improve shareholder value, McDonald's has increased dividend payments since its first-ever dividend payment in 1976. The next dividend payment of $1.16 per share is expected to be paid out on Sep. 17. The current dividend yield stands at over 2.2%.On June 25, MCD stock price saw an all-time high of $206.39. Year-to-date, the stock is up 18%. Although there might be some profit-taking in the MCD stock price in the coming weeks, I'd regard any dip as an opportunity to go long the shares. The company is a core consumer staples holding for a well-diversified portfolio.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-03,"Finally, shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) have bounced. The 3M stock price has rallied almost 9% since late May, when MMM stock touched a three-year low.Source: Shutterstock That low was reached thanks to a hugely disappointing first-quarter earnings report in late April. Lowered guidance and a big miss led the 3M stock price down 13%; that's an absolutely huge move for a Dow Jones Industrial Average component.In fact, it was such a big decline that 3M alone took almost 200 points off the Dow. It was the biggest decline in MMM stock since the 1987 stock market crash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIncredibly, it got worse: 3M stock kept falling. At those lows, MMM had declined 27% in less than six weeks.From that standpoint, the rally of late isn't surprising or concerning to those of us who question broader market valuations. Dividend stalwarts like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) trade near all-time highs. Income investors looking for dividends and value are looking to 3M stock for the obvious: shares are seemingly &quot;on sale&quot; and yield a still healthy 3.3%.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer But it's not necessarily a good thing to pick one stock because others are too expensive. And the bounce in 3M stock ignores the fact that the decline occurred for good reason. 3M's business isn't healthy. Longer-term headwinds remain intact.Furthermore, MMM stock -- yield or no yield -- isn't that cheap. Investors looking to jump on 3M need to remember that price and dividend yield alone don't make a buy case. The Case Against MMM StockThe argument against 3M stock at this point is reasonably simple: significant end markets are in rough shape. As 3M CFO Nicholas Gangestad noted at a recent conference, 30% of revenue comes from automotive, China, and electronics.None of those markets seems healthy at the moment. Sales in the three markets combined fell &quot;mid-single-digits&quot; in Q1, leading organic sales on the whole to decline. But this isn't a single-quarter problem. &quot;Peak auto&quot; is a long-running concern. Chinese demand is slowing, and the trade war may well impact 3M's positioning longer-term. Electronics prices continue to fall, putting pressure on manufacturers which may make its way to 3M.What's notable is that beyond those three markets, it's not as if performance was all that impressive. 3M's commentary suggests that the other roughly 70% of the business maybe grew organic sales 1% in Q1.Plus, cyclical worries could hit demand. Inventories are at high levels, as analyst Stephen Tusa -- who has been prescient about the fall of General Electric (NYSE:GE) -- has noted. Growth is stalling out at the end of the cycle. This raises the question of what will happen once that cycle inevitably turns. The Case for 3M StockIt's easy to argue with 3M that this, too, shall pass. It's a 117-year-old company: 3M has been through worse and come out on the other side. Revenue is diversified. China may well bounce back. 3M is a dividend king, with 61 consecutive years of payout increases. That logic suggests the applied-sciences giant will be just fine.Meanwhile, a 17-times forward multiple leaves the 3M stock price relatively cheap, even after the bounce. A 3.3% dividend yield means investors &quot;get paid to wait&quot; for the business to improve.But that case seems too thin, and too high-level. There are real problems in the business right now. So real, in fact, that 3M had to cut guidance three months after it was issued.As far the broader argument about 3M's history, multiple, and dividend, investors could have made the exact same argument about GE. They could have said much the same about healthcare distributor Owens & Minor (NYSE:OMI), or Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).To be sure, I don't expect MMM stock to follow the trajectory of those names, who slashed their dividends and have fallen -- in the case of OMI -- as much as 90% in recent years. 3M's dividend may be at risk at some point, but it appears safe for now. (The company is pulling back on share repurchases, however, after its recent acquisition of medical products manufacturer Acelity.) And I'm not betting on 50%+ downside for MMM stock. Concluding ThoughtsBut this isn't a case where the market is overreacting. Neither is a nervous market taking down the 3M stock price. The market is at all-time highs, but 3M isn't.Therefore, investors aren't overreacting to some perceived external threat; 3M delivered the bad news itself. Anyone buying the dip here should keep that in mind.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-04,"Financial markets are starting to show some warning signs of a coming slowdown: housing starts are slowing, higher tariffs are stifling expansion, and estimates of 2019 growth have fallen from near-3% to 1%. While most economists are not saying a recession is on – yet – the investing landscape is growing ominous.Which means, it’s a good time to find reliable dividends. These are the stocks that will ensure an income for you when markets go south. Let’s look at some of the best dividend stocks available, see what makes their payouts so great, and find out Wall Street’s top analysts and financial bloggers think of them. Macy’s, Inc. (M)Like the rest of the US department store segment, Macy’s has seen hard times of late. Starting in 2015, the company closed more than 150 under-performing locations, and reported six consecutive quarters of declining sales.Those dark days may be behind the retail giant, however, which still operates nearly 600 suburban stores, primarily under the Macy’s and Bloomingdales names. Macy’s ended its last fiscal year in February with its first comp-store sales growth in five years, a deep reduction in debt load, and a free cash flow that remains over $1 billion annually. It’s an impressive turnaround for the chain.The turnaround assures the company’s near- to mid-term future, but for investors its most important aspect may be that it also assures the company’s dividend. While the payout is only $1.51 per share annualized, the share price of $21.27 puts the yield at an impressive 7.1%. In fact, M’s dividend yield is the fourth highest among S&P 500 companies. And remember that $1 billion free cash flow? It’s more than double the amount needed to cover the annual payout, which in fiscal 2019 totaled $463 million.With a high yield, safe payout, and low share price, Macy’s is a swing and a hit for dividend investors. Five-star financial blogger Bill Zettler lays out the supports for Macy’s case clearly: “Macy’s is successfully addressing threats to their retail business, paying down debt every year, and posses real estate holdings worth more than 3 times [the company’s] market value.”Analyst Robert Drbul, of Guggenheim, set a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, and noted, “We think annual comp gains of ~1% are achievable as initiatives such as Backstage continue to perform well, positively impacting brick and mortar sales… The company’s strategic initiatives continue to fuel growth, while digital remained strong and benefitted from online sales and mobile growth…” Drbul gives the stock a price target of $30, suggesting an upside of 41% in the next 12 months.Macy’s overall has a ‘Hold’ from the analyst consensus, based on 1 buy, 2 holds, and 1 sell given in the past three months. Shares are trading at $21 with an average price target of $24, indicative of a 12% upside potential. The company’s name recognition, established market niche, and recent financial stabilization are all supportive factors.View M Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)The fast food leader has benefitted from smart leadership and an effective business plan in recent years, as it recovered from declining sales and income losses early this decade. New initiatives, including store remodeling, menu streamlining, improvements to ingredients, and automated ordering kiosks all had the desired effects, and since the end of 2015 years McDonald’s has seen a consistent upward trend in share price.The rising share price has brought MCD’s dividend up to $4.64, or $1.16 per share in quarterly payouts, despite a modest yield of only 2.18%. And the company has maintained that regular payout while also implementing a $6 billion infrastructure improvement effort in its stores. It’s a measure of the company’s strong cash flow and profitable business model that it has managed both.Market watchers have been attracted to McDonald’s in recent quarters, impressed by the company’s ability to adapt to a changing fast food environment while maintaining its image and reputation. The five-star blogger Luke Lango wrote, in recommending MCD as one of his favorite food stocks, “McDonald’s has continued to improve its menu and service over the past the several months and years. These improvements put the company in a favorable position to grow for the foreseeable future...”Jefferies analyst Andy Barish is also bullish on MCD. He says, “…fresh beef Quarter Pounders, bundling promotions, delivery, and kiosks are all aiding McDonald's check growth,” while describing that check growth as “remaining robust.” Barish sets a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, along with a $230 price target. His price target represents a 2% increase, and suggests an 8% upside to the stock.With 16 buys and 5 holds assigned in the last quarter, MCD stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus rating. Shares are trading for $212, which gives it a modest 2.44% upside based on the average price target of $218. The reliable dividend, high in absolute dollars despite a low yield, makes this stock a winner for income investors.View MCD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Altria Group, Inc. (MO)Altria is a classic “sin stock.” The company is the parent of the famous Marlboro cigarette brand, and is moving into the legal cannabis industry with an ambitious $1.8 billion investment in Canada’s Cronos Group (TSE:CRON). The Cronos investment gives Altria a 45% stake in the marijuana company, North America’s fourth largest cannabis producer. In addition to cannabis, Altria has a 10% stake in the Anheuser-Busch Inbev (BUD) brewery company, and owns 35% of JUUL, a growing brand of e-cigarette.Cigarettes are still the core of Altria’s business, even with the company’s various related investments, and increasing social pressures toward non-smoking have pushed MO shares down in recent years. Share price has fallen from near $70 in June to 2017 to just under $50 today. At the same time, due to the addictive nature of Altria’s products, the company has been able to maintain cash flow by increasing prices. And Altria keeps investors happy by sharing that cash flow through a generous dividend.Altria pays out a notable $3.20 per share, in four quarterly payments of 80 cents each. The stock’s yield is an impressive 6.51%, putting Altria right behind Macy’s among the S&P 500’s top dividend payers, and the company has made increases to its dividend 53 times over the last 49 years. The last increase was made in October of 2018. Staying power counts in the financial world, as is clear from Warren Buffett’s dictum, “Our favorite holding period is forever.” In terms of longevity, yield, and absolute dollars, Altria’s dividend is a true champion.Altria’s longevity and dividend have attracted attention from financial blogger David Pinsen, who describes the stock as a core around which to build a “bulletproof” portfolio. He chose the stock for its combination of high returns, especially the dividend.Reviewing Altria for Wells Fargo, analyst Bonnie Herzog also sees the stock as a compelling choice. She gives it a ‘buy’ rating, noting the pricing increase on Marlboro but more importantly noting the increased in EPS forecast to $5.05 by 2020. Stating the case for MO, she says, “We increasingly believe MO has multiple levers to pull to offset decelerating cigarette volumes and drive increased profitability including; strong pricing power, cost savings and JUUL service agreement payments.” Her price target, $65, show her confidence in the stock; it suggests a 32% upside potential.Altria gets a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus, based on 2 buys, 1 hold, and 1 sell set during the last three months. Shares are trading for $49.19, and the average price target is $55.33. This gives the stock a potential for 12% upside in the next year.View MO Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailLearn more about these dividend champs with TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool.

2019-07-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last March, McDonald’s Corp. acquired the startup Dynamic Yield for $300 million, in the hope of employing machine learning to personalize customer experience. In the age of artificial intelligence, this was a no-brainer for McDonald’s, since Dynamic Yield is widely recognized for its AI-powered technology and recently even landed a spot in a prestigious list of top AI startups. Neural McNetworks are upon us.Trouble is, Dynamic Yield’s platform has nothing to do with AI, according to an article posted on Medium last month by the company’s former head of content, Mike Mallazzo. It was a heartfelt takedown of phony AI, which was itself taken down by the author but remains engraved in the collective memory of the internet. Mr. Mallazzo made the case that marketers, investors, pundits, journalists and technologists are all in on an AI scam. The definition of AI, he writes, is so “jumbled that any application of the term becomes defensible.”Mr. Mallazzo’s critique, however, conflates two different issues. The first is the deliberately misleading marketing that is common to many hyped technologies, and is arguably epitomized by some blockchain companies. I am reminded of the infamous Long Island Iced Tea Corp., which saw its stocks soar 289 percent in 2017 after it rebranded itself as Long Blockchain Corp., citing hazy plans to explore blockchain technology.(4)The second issue is that, unlike blockchain, the term AI is indeed both broad and vague — which opens the door to its widespread use as an idiom for &quot;something that solves hard problems.&quot; But this issue far predates the current period of hype, and is best understood by examining the field’s history and intellectual underpinnings.AI was born as a scientific field in 1956, in a summer workshop at Dartmouth College. According to the workshop’s mission statement, in two months the 11 attendees would “make a significant advance” in their task of finding “how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.”The scale of the founders’ vision is staggering, so much so that, six decades later, it continues to be a source of inspiration.(3) Admittedly (much) more than two months have gone by and we’re still far from realizing that vision, but it has given rise to a sprawling field of research. Even AI pioneer Marvin Minsky’s sweeping definition of AI — the “science of making machines capable of performing tasks that would require intelligence” if done by humans — doesn’t quite cut it at this point.Take the area of AI known as heuristic search, for example. It started in the 1960s with a team of researchers at the Stanford Research Institute, who were building a robot with the then-revolutionary capability of autonomously moving around and avoiding obstacles. Continuing a trend of imposing nomenclature — evident in their creation’s dignified name, Shakey the robot — the researchers called their first pathfinding algorithm A1. Its successor, the equally illustrious A2, was later renamed A*.As it turns out, moving from one point to another is similar to getting from an initial configuration of a puzzle to its solution. That makes A* an amazingly versatile algorithm; academics consider it to be one of the most fundamental and important tools in the AI arsenal. Yet the algorithm is so simple — it decides which action to take next by adding up two numbers,(2) something that monkeys can do — that it can hardly be seen as a proxy for human intelligence.A similar tale can be told of each of AI’s dozen diverse areas. One is the area of multi-agent systems, which focuses on designing the interaction between autonomous software agents such as self-driving cars. Another is automated planning. Yet another is machine learning, which many mistakenly view as being synonymous with AI. The staples of each area don’t quite jibe even with Minsky’s loose definition.Still, these ostensibly disparate areas have much more in common than just history and excessive optimism. As with other mature scientific disciplines, AI has a shared vocabulary, which allows the most compelling ideas and the most powerful techniques to propagate across areas.There’s also the periodic emergence of ambitious, cross-cutting enterprises that build on the synergies between AI’s areas. The 2000s brought us the DARPA Grand Challenge and the DARPA Urban Challenge, which supercharged the development of self-driving cars. In 2011, IBM’s Watson crushed two legendary Jeopardy! champions and fired the public imagination. And in recent years a variety of long-standing research threads have coalesced into a new agenda known as “AI for social good,” which aspires to make tangible progress on some of the biggest problems facing humanity.The moral is that AI is a bit of a misnomer, but it's an intellectually meaningful term that has always been inclusive. For that reason, it would behoove investors and journalists to demand that startups billed as “AI-powered” explain how their technology fits into the broader AI landscape, instead of jumping to conclusions based on the label itself. It’s a cliché that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, but it’s doubly true in the age of AI — and triply true if the book was generated by AI.(1) That particular story doesn’t have a happy ending: Long Blockchain Corp. was subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, delisted by Nasdaq, and eventually sold.(2) Or despair, for those who are squeamish about being pulverized and repurposed as paper clips(3) To be fair, one of those numbers comes from a heuristic function, which is exogenous to the A* algorithm but can be arbitrarily complex.To contact the author of this story: Ariel Procaccia at arielpro@cs.cmu.eduTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jonathan Landman at jlandman4@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Ariel Procaccia is an associate professor in the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University.

2019-07-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To outsiders, it may seem like the deepening rift between Japan and South Korea has blown up out of a clear blue sky.For all the wrangling over the legacy of Japan’s 35-year colonization of the Korean peninsula, which ended in 1945, there’s far more on paper to join than to separate them. Both are northeast Asian democracies that have close military and economic ties to the U.S.; potent exports of electronics, cars and cultural products; and a love of seafood and beef.After decades when post-war growth gave Japan the far wealthier population, its stagnation in recent decades has even put the two countries at roughly equivalent levels of gross domestic product per capita: $40,479 for South Korea versus $43,349 in Japan.For all that, though, there’s no strong web of ties binding these two nations. Disputes over restitution for Korean women forced into prostitution under Japanese occupation are now hurting South Korean sales of Fast Retailing Co. clothing. In turn, the government in Tokyo has moved to curb exports of specialty materials to Korea’s technology giants.Compare the Japan-Korea relationship to those between European countries, or the members of the North American Free Trade Association, or even stereotypically unfriendly neighbors like Argentina and Brazil, and you could be mistaken for thinking the two countries were locked in a cold war already.Just 7.5% of South Korea’s $1.07 trillion in bilateral trade is with Japan, making the European Union, the U.S. and China more important partners. The picture is even more dramatic in the other direction. Japan’s $80 billion in bilateral trade with South Korea amounts to just 5.8% of its $1.38 trillion total. That would seem to go against economic theory. The gravity model of trade predicts that commerce between two countries is largely a result of their respective outputs and the physical distance between them. Two large and adjacent economies ought to be quite closely integrated. That’s not what’s happened: Japan’s exports to Korea are far less than the gravity model would predict, and the same is true in the opposite direction.Foreign direct investment statistics paint a similar picture. The stock of South Korean assets in Japan in 2012(1) was about 1.8% of its outbound stock and a smaller sum than could be found in Canada, Vietnam, India, or Germany – not to mention the U.S., China and Hong Kong, which together account for almost half the total. Japanese investments in South Korea, similarly, come to about 2.5% of its total, well behind Brazil, Thailand, Singapore or Australia.The cold war even shows up in foreign-exchange markets. Trading between the Korean won and the Japanese yen is so slight that the Bank for International Settlements doesn’t even list turnover on the currency pair, although it does have data for the yen against the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, the Turkish lira, the South African rand and the Brazilian real.Human factors underline the chilly relationship. More Japanese migrate to the U.K., Australia and Brunei than to South Korea. While Koreans represent the largest migrant group in Japan (Softbank Group Corp. founder Masoyoshi Son is of Korean-Japanese heritage, as is Lotte Shopping Co. Chairman Shin Dong-bin and former Korean President Lee Myung-bak), they face prejudice even after generations of residency.Tokyo’s long-time governor Shintaro Ishihara was re-elected multiple times after making notorious derogatory remarks against people hailing from Japan’s former colonies in a 2000 speech. A 2011 protest by right-wing groups against Korean pop culture in the city reportedly attracted more than 2,000 demonstrators. For its part, South Korea banned Japanese cultural products outright until 1998.Ties aren’t improving much. More Japanese vacationed in South Korea in 2009 than in 2018; Japanese have fallen from about two-fifths of total visitors there a decade ago to around a fifth last year, despite a modest recovery in the past couple of years.In one sense, such links shouldn’t matter. The Golden Arches doctrine – that globalization inevitably begets peace, and no two countries with a McDonald’s have ever gone to war – has never really held true.Nonetheless, a more limited version of that view has merit. Close links in finance, migration, and culture may not prevent war, but they can at least provide a countervailing force when tensions flare – something that seems to have kept relations between Singapore and Malaysia, China and Taiwan, and even the U.S. and China far more stable than one might have predicted.The alternative of cold peace pursued by India and Pakistan offers a more fraught path, as my colleague Nisid Hajari has written. Japan and Korea, both dwarfed in their neighborhood by an increasingly confident China, ought to work harder to deepen their mutual ties. It’s better to stand together than to fall apart.(1) The last year for which figures from the UN Conference on Trade and Development are available.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-07-15,"A somewhat slack economic report out of China, the world's second-largest economy, stood in the way of stocks notching big gains Monday.Source: Shutterstock China said its second-quarter GDP rose &quot;just&quot; 6.2%, below economists' forecasts calling for 6.3% and good for the country's slowest pace of economic growth in 27 years. Chinese economists are now expecting 2019 growth of 6%, well below the original forecast of 6.5%.Here in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.17% while the S&P 500 added just 0.02%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.10%. That after the major domestic benchmarks touched record highs early in Monday's session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCitigroup (NYSE:C) got second-quarter earnings season rolling today, reporting that net income rose to $4.8 billion, or $1.95 per share, from $4.5 billion, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected per share earnings of $1.80.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy Citi is not a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but the bank's positive earnings surprise could be a sign of things to come. That would be a good thing with Dow components JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stepping into the earnings confessional on Tuesday. A Tasty WinnerMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) posted a modest gain today, but that was enough to extend its year-to-date returns to around 22%, solidifying the burger joint as one of 2019's best-performing members of the Dow. In a note out Monday, Tesley Group reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on McDonald's while boosting its price target on the stock to $230 from $210. That implies decent upside as Monday closed just above $214.McDonald's shares &quot;offer both offensive and defensive investment attributes for both good times and slower times, and with its menu of both premium and value-priced options,&quot; according to Tesley.Piper Jaffray and Wells Fargo also boosted price targets on McDonald's to $226 and $235, respectively. Options ActionMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the largest U.S. company by market value, reports earnings on Thursday. It is expected to be a bellwether report given the stock's sheer heft in broad market benchmarks and technology sector funds.Microsoft remains around the vaunted $1 trillion market cap. It appears some options traders are betting on good news from Microsoft's earnings report. At one point on Monday, calls were outpacing puts in the name by a margin of more than 2-to-1, according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. Historically, shares of Microsoft move nearly 3% following the company's earnings reports. Pharma and Politics … AgainThough in modest fashion, the Dow's pharmaceuticals components - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) - each closed higher today despite drug price commentary from former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic frontrunner.Biden &quot;unveiled a healthcare plan on Monday estimated to cost $750 billion and paid for partly by higher tax rates for the wealthy and doubled tax rates on capital gains,&quot; according to Reuters.This is not a &quot;Medicare For All&quot; gambit. Rather, Biden's healthcare proposal is seen as a refresher of Obamacare, which was implemented when he was vice president. Bottom Line for Dow Jones StocksIt's earnings season, meaning it's also complaining season for U.S. companies. Expect one of the primary complaints to be about the strength of the dollar.&quot;Of the 5% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, more than half of them cited a strong greenback as a headwind to their business in the second quarter, according to FactSet, which parsed through companies' conference call transcripts to look for specific factors weighing on company earnings,&quot; reports CNBC.With the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSEARCA:UUP) up nearly 3% year-to-date, dollar-related earnings commentary gets us back to a familiar theme: the impetus for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and do so soon.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

With such huge gains, it's time to start thinking about what Dow Jones stocks to sell.As you'd expect, when the market as a whole rips so much, it sets up some great profit-taking opportunities in individual stocks out of the Dow Jones' 30 components.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio From vulnerable healthcare stocks to overpriced consumer staples plays and more, here are five Dow Jones stocks to sell before the market slides again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks To Sell: Boeing (BA)It has been baffling watching Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock recently. You would have expected a massive correction in BA stock since several of the company's jets crashed, calling into question the safety of the Boeing Max line of jets.Instead, BA stock has been astoundingly resilient. This would be one thing if BA stock had already been cheap when the safety issues began. But no, BA stock wasn't cheap at all. It had just quadrupled in value since early 2016 and reached its highest P/E ratio in years in March.It seems that investors have forgotten that the airline industry is cyclical. Yes, oil prices are low right now. Airlines are making a lot of money for the moment. When airlines make huge profits, they order planes. In fact, they order too many planes. This cycle has happened every few years dating back to the 1960s. Yet investors seem to think this commercial aviation boom will go on forever. It won't.On the military side, yes, orders have been up. But analysts modeling this upturn in defense spending indefinitely will also be disappointed. What happens if and when the Republicans lose power in Washington? There's also the little matter that we have no idea how bad the issues will be from the Boeing Max situation. BA stock is still really expensive. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Shutterstock The chase for yield has investors rushing back into a lot of slow-growing defensive companies. The rationale makes sense on the surface. Lower interest rates mean that bonds are less attractive investments.Yet investors, especially retirees, still need current income. So they sell their bonds and other fixed income holdings to buy stocks with larger yields. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one such popular stock.It's not hard to see the appeal of KO stock as a bond alternative. It yields more than U.S. Treasuries or bank CDs while offering a dividend that Coca-Cola has increased every year for decades on end.However, cracks are forming in Coca-Cola's growth and income story. Namely, there's hardly any growth.Soda sales have plunged in America and other developed markets. Emerging market growth has largely offset this so far, but there are limits to that. Soda sales may drop even more sharply going forward as more jurisdictions implement sugar taxes. As a result, Coca-Cola has hardly grown in recent years - it has taken on more debt and boosted its dividend payout ratio to keep the yield going up. That works for a while, but without organic growth, Coca-Cola's dividend stream will turn to a trickle over time.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Based solely on earnings, for a slow (or at times no-) growth company like Coca-Cola, you'd rarely pay more than 20x earnings, if that. As such, it's hard to justify KO stock being worth more than $45 now. If you own KO stock solely for the dividend, it's a fine holding. But don't anticipate much, if anything, in the form of share price gains over the next year or two. McDonald's (MCD)One has to wonder if McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is about to launch CBD-infused burgers. Or perhaps a national Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) burger rollout. That is to say, investors are bidding up MCD stock like it's a hot craze, even though its business momentum is decidedly pedestrian at best.In fact, many of the company's franchisees have been complaining. All-day breakfast greatly increased complexity for operators and raised labor costs without doing much for overall revenues. McDonald's is also asking its franchisees to make extensive store overhauls even though the local operators haven't exactly been rolling in cash flow lately. Franchisees sent a harshly-worded letter around earlier this year demanding that:&quot;We can NOT afford the waste that a 'one size fits all' reinvestment program creates […] We must allow our owner operators to take back control of the reinvestment that is happening, stop the useless and problematic investing, and focus our reinvestment in what will actually produce a return on investment (drive thrus and kitchens).&quot;Over on Wall Street, however, no one seems worried about McDonald's questionable strategy in recent years. MCD stock is up 36% over the past 12 months and is up more than 22% year-to-date. This has led McDonald's to sport a bloated 28x P/E ratio. Investors are likely to get indigestion when they look back at paying more than $200 a share for MCD stock. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: Shutterstock If you watched the first Democratic presidential debate, you probably won't be too surprised by this pick. A sizable number of candidates, when asked if they would get rid of private for-profit health insurance, raised their hands in affirmation. The political world has moved a lot since 2016, when Bernie Sanders' suggestion of abolishing private health care seemed radical.Now, there's a decent chance that the eventual Democratic nominee will be pushing to outlaw or at least greatly curtail private insurance going forward. Would that nominee, if elected, be able to push legislation through what will likely still be a Republican Senate in 2021? Probably not.Still, do you want to own a private insurer like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) ahead of the election? Absolutely not. Even if you think the Republicans will keep the White House, think back to 2015.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Hillary Clinton went on the attack against Martin Shkreli and biotech firms for jacking up prescription drug prices. Biotech stocks collapsed shortly thereafter. Private health insurers are about as popular as nuclear waste dumps with a large portion of the electorate. With the presidential election still a year away, politicians have plenty of time to threaten and demonize firms like UnitedHealth. Sell this recent pop in UNH stock; it's toxic given the political environment. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Shutterstock On a similar note, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also exposes investors to a great deal of political risk ahead of the election. JNJ is a highly diversified business with many consumer care products that are (mostly) above reproach.But JNJ also sells a lot of prescription drugs, and both Trump and the Democrats are making loud noises about going after pricing, which would cut into JNJ's margins. Trump's efforts to curtail drug prices appear to be stalled for the time being. But make no mistake, the issue is a perfect one for politicians to use to drum up votes during election season.Johnson & Johnson also has its liability issue related to baby powder products which allegedly led to cancer. It is exposed to large verdicts against it related to this. Presumably JNJ will be able to reduce its liability greatly over time as cooler heads prevail, but for now, it's another big overhang on JNJ stock. If JNJ stock were cheaper, you could discount the political worries; it's a very strong and diversified company. But at this valuation, JNJ stock could easily have more downside before it bottoms.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned JNJ stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-07-26,"(Bloomberg) -- McDonald’s Corp. grew at a blistering pace in the latest quarter, with the world’s biggest restaurant chain reporting its best global sales rise since 2012 as new delivery partnerships and investment in breakfast are proving to be the right sauce.Same-store sales climbed 6.5% globally, bolstered by a 5.7% rise in its critical home market. Both gains surpassed analyst estimates compiled by Consensus Metrix.Key InsightsNew breakfast items like donut sticks have helped McDonald’s compete in a hyper-competitive U.S. fast-food market. Discounting has also drawn in diners, with its two-for-$5 deals especially resonating. Gordon Haskett analysts called the lack of margin expansion the “lone knock” on the quarter.The positive report comes on the heels of a similarly strong quarter for breakfast rival Starbucks Corp., signaling global consumers are still looking for convenience and value at big-name chains.McDonald’s is investing in delivery to help fuel sales, especially in the U.S. market, and it’s working. This month, it added provider DoorDash Inc. to its existing partnership with Uber Eats. Going forward, there’s more room to grow delivery internationally, with the U.S. now pretty well covered.Still, there are pressures ahead. The burger chain is facing rising labor and commodity costs, which have already resulted in some increased menu prices. International commodity prices will be up 2.5% this year compared to last year because of rising protein costs, the company said on a call, worse than the 2% gain the company had been forecasting heading into the latest quarter.Market ReactionThe shares rose as much as 1.7% as of 9:31 a.m. Friday to $218.16, the highest intraday level on record. They had already risen 21% this year through Thursday’s close, just outpacing the S&P 500 index.Get MoreFor more on the results, click here.For the company statement, click here.&#92;--With assistance from Leslie Patton and Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Olivia Rockeman in New York at orockeman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder, John LauermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",McDonald’s Posts Biggest Global Sales Gain in Seven Years

2019-08-02,"One of the biggest themes of financial markets in 2019 has been plunging rates. The 10-Year Treasury yield (alongside pretty much every other fixed income rate) has plunged in 2019, dropping from 2.7% on Christmas Eve 2018, to just over 2% in late July 2019.Source: Shutterstock The catalyst? Slowing economic expansion across the globe, which central banks want to curb. As such, central banks around the world project to cut rates in an insurance move to prolong the current economic expansion. Rates have plunged in anticipation of these cuts.Will rates stay lower for longer? Probably. The Federal Reserve will likely cut rates a few times in the back half of 2019 to prolong the current economic expansion and breathe life back into the sluggish industrial economy, which has been hurt by rising geopolitical tensions. As such, the plunging rates theme of 2019 projects to turn into a consistent low rates theme in the second half of 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are two big implications for equities in a low rate world. First, equity valuations will move higher, since lower fixed income yields justify lower earnings yields, and therefore, a higher equity multiple. Second, investors will flock to stable dividend stocks, since many of those stocks are now yielding more than fixed income instruments.Consequently, investors should do two things here. One, stay long the stock market. The environment remains favorable for stocks to go higher. Two, consider playing defense by buying some dividend stocks. So long as rates remain low, these stocks should have huge investor demand.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold With that in mind, let's take a look at seven big dividend stocks investors should consider in today's rate world. Big Dividend Stocks to Consider: CVS Health (CVS)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrDividend Yield: 3.6%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~5.5%The Thesis: The bull thesis on CVS Health (NASDAQ:CVS) is pretty straightforward. This company breaks down into two parts: consumer pharmacy and PBM. On the consumer pharmacy side, fundamentals have been depressed by competition. But, the company is rapidly expanding the value prop of its already extensive retail footprint, integrating technology and data to create things like HealthHUBs and minute clinics, the sum of which should drive continued share expansion and healthier revenue growth trends.On the PBM side, fundamentals have similarly been depressed by the growing threat of government regulation. But, the White House recently scrapped plans for a drug rebate plan that would've been disastrous for PBMs like CVS. As such, headwinds on the PBM side should ease going forward.Broadly, the fundamentals on both the consumer pharmacy and PBM sides of CVS are set to improve, and as they do, depressed CVS stock (3.6% yield with a mid single-digit projected earnings growth rate) should take off. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.9%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~5%The Thesis: As is the case with the bull thesis for CVS, the bull thesis on AT&T (NYSE:T) hinges on the idea this company's darkest days are behind it, and that things will get better going forward.The big headwind which has killed AT&T stock over the past several years has been cord cutting. AT&T makes a bunch of money from cable subscription and related fees. But, consumers have rapidly pivoted from linear to streaming TV, and in the process, have cancelled their cable subscriptions. AT&T's growth trends have consequently suffered, as growth in wireless hasn't been sufficient to offset wired losses.But, both the wired and wireless businesses should improve from here. On the wired side, AT&T has enough content with the acquisition of Time Warner (think HBO, Cinemax, CNN, so on and so forth) to launch a compelling streaming TV service, which should attract enough subs to help offset the cord cutting headwind. Meanwhile, on the wireless side, 5G is coming, and it increasingly appears that the 5G tailwind will provide a big boost to the entire wireless industry, AT&T included.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Net net, AT&T's depressed fundamentals should improve over the next few years. As they do, AT&T stock will bounce back. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~6%The Thesis: The bull thesis on utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) is very simple, and it centers around two things: yield and stability.On the yield side, this is a stock with a 3% yield that 1) has consistently sported a yield above 3% for the past 30-plus years, and 2) has consistently hiked its dividend from ~40 cents at the beginning of the decade, to nearly 70 cents today. Meanwhile, on the stability side, American Electric Power is a company that 1) operates in the secular demand electricity services industry, and 2) has a track record of consistent and healthy revenue, profit and cash flow growth over the past decade.Broadly, then, American Electric Power is all about yield and stability. Investors buy shares, get their yield, and don't have to worry much about the stock. Over the past decade, AEP stock has risen nearly 200%. During that massive 200% rally, the stock never once fell into bear market territory (a 20% draw-down from recent highs).As such, if you're looking for yield and long-term stability, AEP stock is the cream of the crop. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.1%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~8%The Thesis: When it comes to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the bull thesis is secular in nature. Long story short, this is the world's largest and favorite fast food chain, built on two value props that will never go away -- unprecedented convenience and low prices.McDonald's has consistently innovated and iterated over the past several years to continue to dominate those two value props. They have reinvented their menu to offer more relevant, healthier options, at still low prices. They have heavily invested in technology and data to implement digital ordering kiosks, refreshed drive-thru infrastructure and much more, all of which has simply shortened wait times and enhanced customer convenience.As such, McDonald's has continued to dominate on price and convenience over the past several years. In so doing, the company has driven consistently positive comparable sales growth, which has in turn driven MCD stock higher.  * 7 Charts That Should Concern Marijuana Stock Investors All signs indicate this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. McDonald's is doubling down on fresh beef options throughout its menu, and management is leaning more heavily into data to enhance business efficiency. For the foreseeable future, then, McDonald's should continue to dominate on price and convenience. Continued dominance on those two fronts will support positive comps over the next several years, which will support MCD stock continuing to make new highs. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.9%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~6%The Thesis: There are two pieces to the bull thesis on Target (NYSE:TGT) stock: a near-term bull thesis, and a long-term bull thesis.In the near term, Target's revenue trends are firing on all cylinders right now because the company has successfully built out an e-commerce business while expanding its omni-channel capabilities. These two things together have driven Target's strongest streak of comparable sales growth in over a decade. But, building out e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities isn't cheap. It requires huge investments. Those huge investments have weighed on margins over the past few quarters.They are now starting to phase out (since Target's omni-channel capabilities have already been mostly developed), and as these investments completely phase out over the new few quarters, Target's robust top-line growth will be joined by equally robust margin expansion and profit growth. This reinvigorated profit growth will drive TGT stock higher.In the long term, Target has shown an impressive ability to innovate and adapt to the dynamic retail landscape. This should give investors confidence that -- no matter how consumption habits change over the next several years -- Target should be able to leverage its huge reach and resources to adapt to those consumption changes. Consequently, in the long run, Target should grow alongside the U.S. consumer economy, meaning that revenues, profits and the stock should all trend higher over time. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Coca-ColaDividend Yield: 2.9%Projected Long Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~7%The Thesis: When it comes to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), you buy KO stock for three reasons.One, this company is the king in the secular growth global beverage industry, which has stable and enduring demand drivers. No matter what, consumers around the world have to drink. And when they choose to buy a drink, chances are high they are going to buy a Coca-Cola product, considering that Coca-Cola owns about 40% of the global non-alcoholic beverage market.Two, Coca-Cola has found a winning formula to stay atop the non-alcoholic beverage market. Coca-Cola uses data to identify up-and-coming beverage trends. They invest in the small beverage brands that have the most exposure to those trends. They then test those brands by putting them selectively into their global distribution channel. If one of those brands does really well, Coca-Cola acquires the whole brand, and launches that brand everywhere. In so doing, Coca-Cola has discovered a strategy wherein no matter how beverage market trends change, Coca-Cola will always be the company that sits atop the industry.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends Three, KO stock is a symbol of stability with a big yield. KO stock isn't volatile. At all. And, in the absence of volatility, the stock pays investors a nice near 3% yield. This combination of stability and yield makes KO stock a solid investment for any investor. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.3%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~18.5%The Thesis: Global chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is about to enter a golden era over the next several years. Thanks to a renewed multi-year licensing agreement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm is once again the single most dominant player in the mobile phone chip market.That's a favorable position to hold in 2019. In the back half of 2019 and into 2020/21, 5G coverage is set to go mainstream. That's a big deal. 5G isn't just a step up from current coverage standards -- it's an entire new level of coverage that will enable an entire new set of possibilities in today's smart device dominated world. As such, it will present a tremendous earnings growth opportunity for Qualcomm, which is why analysts project this company to grow earnings at nearly a 20% compounded annual pace over the next few years.If Qualcomm can capitalize on the huge 5G opportunity in front -- they should be able to, given their dominant position in the market -- then QCOM stock will head higher over the next several years. A stock with a 3.3% yield and a ~20% projected EPS growth rate is simply too attractive for most investors to pass up on.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long CVS, T, MCD, TGT and QCOM.

2019-08-05,"Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day so far this year. The index containing 30 American blue-chip stocks, posted its largest one-day percentage loss since December, with it falling 767 points or 3%. The August 5 drop comes after China answered Trump's tariff threats with another escalation of the trade war. China allowed the Yuan to fall to its lowest level in over a decade and told state-owned companies to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products. In response to this move, the U.S. then labeled China as a &quot;Currency Manipulator&quot;. This decline follows the Dow's previous 1% drop on July 31, which occurred after the Federal Reserve sent mixed messages regarding whether or not it would cut interest rates further. All of this has led to a great degree of economic uncertainty. However, some analysts believe that a few Dow stocks look poised to not only withstand the current climate but also to outperform. Here are 3 top rated Dow Jones stocks that analysts are saying make compelling investments even in an uncertain economic climate.  Visa, Inc. (V)Despite a 2% drop in the last three days, the payment processing giant is looking strong. Visa’s long-term growth prospects appear unchanged as the number of consumers relying on non-cash payments to make purchases is only growing. Global non-cash payments volume is expected to increase by at least 10%. Not to mention the company has continued to expand and diversify its product pipeline. On July 17, Visa announced that it will acquire payment gateway software company, Payworks. This technology will allow V to create a white-labeled omnichannel payment management platform for in-store, in-app and online purchases. Earlier in June, the company also launched new installment capabilities for cardholders and released its B2B payment network that allows financial institutions to process high-value corporate cross-border payments much more quickly.  Five-star analyst, Josh Beck, said, “Visa's momentum in the core business is coupled with recent M&A deals and organic momentum as evidence by a triple-digit transaction growth in Visa Direct suggests Visa has a long growth path ahead and investors should be buyers of the stock.” On July 24, the KeyBanc analyst reiterated his Buy rating while raising his price target from $190 to $195, suggesting 10% upside. He has an 82% success rate and gets an average return of 26% per rating.Another top analyst, Brett Huff, sees more upside for Visa based on its robust pipeline of renewals and new deals as well as its better-than-expected foreign exchange impact on full-year revenue and EPS. On July 29, he reiterated his Buy rating and raised the price target from $185 to $190, indicating 7% upside potential. The Stephens analyst boasts an impressive 90% success rate and average return rate of 33% per rating. The Street remains bullish on Visa. The stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $202 average price target, suggesting 14% upside potential.  McDonald’s Corporation (MCD) The second Dow stock on our list gained 1% in the three days following the Fed’s announcement. With the fast-food chain up 21% year-to-date, MCD looks poised to serve investors with continued growth.  Steve Chiavarone of financial services company, Federated Investors, argues that fast-food companies stand to benefit from the current economic backdrop. “Low unemployment, rising wages and low gas prices mean more money in consumers’ pockets, which means the consumer is going to show up and dine out with frequency,” he said. MCD has also shifted focus towards expanding its digital initiatives in an attempt to attract younger customers. Management attributes the second quarter same-store sales growth to tech-focused store renovations. On July 26, MCD reported U.S. same-store growth was 5.7%, beating the 4.5% consensus estimate.    The company is expanding upon these efforts, with it planning to invest $1 billion dollars during fiscal 2019 to modernize its American locations. By 2020, all U.S. restaurants will have self-service ordering kiosks. Also inspiring confidence, McDonald’s announced in March that it would acquire AI software company, Dynamic Yield, to help it gain actionable insights from the data it collects.“We like McDonald's heightened focus on digital initiatives, which should yield benefits near and long-term, and believe ongoing momentum should continue to support a premium to its historical valuation,” Credit Suisse analyst, Lauren Silberman, said on July 30. She reiterated her Buy rating and raised her price target from $230 to $236, suggesting 10% upside potential. The analyst boasts a 75% success rate. Top financial blogger, Luke Lango, adds, “The premium valuation underlying MCD stock is warranted by strengthening fundamentals and a favorable market backdrop, as the company is firing on all cylinders as rates plunge to new lows. So long as the company continues to do so — and so long as rates remain low — MCD stock should stay on a healthy uptrend.”The Street is cautiously optimistic about MCD. It has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $228 average price target, suggesting 6% upside.  Chevron Corporation (CVX)While shares have declined 3% in the three days after the rate cut, investors shouldn’t abandon Chevron just yet. On August 2, Chevron reported that its second quarter profits jumped 26% as a result of higher oil and gas production. Daily oil and gas production grew 9% from the year-ago quarter to a record breaking 3.08 million barrels. U.S. shale production also increased by 21% in the quarter. Its results were improved by the one-time $1 billion payment it received after Occidental Petroleum ruined its deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum. Despite not closing the Anadarko Petroleum deal, the company remains committed to expanding its portfolio, specifically its liquified natural gas (LNG) prospects.  “We’re always working the portfolio, and LNG is one of the asset classes that we're interested in, and we will pursue opportunities in that space,” CFO Pierre Breber said. Morgan Stanley analyst, Devin McDermott, said, “The current market obsession with oil-sector (free cash flow), dividends and buybacks plays well to (Chevron’s) strengths.” On July 12, he reiterated his Buy rating and lowered his price target from $146 to $144. Even with the price target drop, the analyst still believes share prices could rise by as much as 19% over the next twelve months. CVX has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $140 average price target, suggesting 16% upside.",3 Top Dow Jones Stocks Amid Economic Uncertainty

2019-08-12,"It was a tough day on Wall Street, with investors hitting the exits on trade worries, concerns over Hong Kong, and as bond prices again rally. The markets are often volatile in August, and 2019 is proving to be no exception. Here are a few top stock trades to watch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: RokuAt one point, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock was up 8% on Monday. The move adds to Roku's three-day gain, with shares up more than 30% since reporting earnings last week.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMonday's move was inspired by the analysts at Nomura, who upped their price target to $150 per share. Despite the big move, shares are hardly overbought -- at least technically speaking via the RSI indicator (blue circle).  * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now A move into the upper $130s or lower $140s is still possible, with a Fibonacci extension near the latter. If the overall selling pressure in the market is too great, though, Roku may not be immune. In that case, see if prior short-term channel resistance (black line) can act as support on a pullback. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: PinterestPinterest (NYSE:PINS) outperformed the market on Monday, but did so in a very strange way.In midday trading, shares suddenly spiked higher, surging to $36 before retreating and giving up almost all of its 6% intraday gain. $34 remains a tough level for the stock, even after its strong earnings report last week.That said, it continues to hold $32 and its 8-day moving average. However, like other stocks, support may give way should overall market selling pressure pick up. Keep an eye on $32 support, and $31.50 just below that. Breakout traders may consider going long PINS on a close over $34. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: NetflixNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock held up okay on Monday, but its chart still looks concerning. Below, the $305 to $310 level is a concern. It will put the August lows near $297 on the table. A close below that opens up NFLX to a decline down the $270 to $275 area.On a rally, see if NFLX stock can reclaim its 20-day moving average. If it can, its 200-day is the next upside target. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: DeereDeere (NYSE:DE) stock is looking ugly. Shares rallied into former support at $155 as well as its 200-day moving average before tumbling more than 4% on Monday. The company reports earnings on Friday, adding more volatility into the stock.At this point, DE stock either needs to reclaim the $155/200-day moving average area or pull back to range support near $135. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: McDonald'sMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock may be a flight-to-safety name, but shares are under pressure on a day where the stock market is in decline as well.The selling pressure comes as shares run into channel resistance. Now I'm looking for a test of channel support. That would put MCD in play somewhere near $213. As much as I'd hate to see MCD break channel support, a dip to $210 and the 50-day moving average would also be attractive.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-13,"Investors are constantly looking for stocks that will hold up regardless of economic uncertainty. A good starting point is recent analyst activity. A ratings boost or a price target increase can give us a better sense as to whether a company has the potential to outperform the rest. Not to mention these changes can have an effect on share prices. For example, Salesforce.com (CRM) is up 2% after Compass Point initiated its coverage with a Buy on August 13.Here are 10 trending stocks based on recent analyst activity.       McDonald's Corporation (MCD)The fast food giant just received good news from MKM Partners. Brett Levy, a three-star analyst according to TipRanks, initiated his coverage of MCD with a Buy and set a $250 price target. He thinks share prices could increase by 15% over the next twelve months. “We believe that strong domestic and international sales growth is sustainable for the restaurant chain,” Levy explained on August 12. The analyst has an impressive 71% success rate.MCD boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $230 price target, suggesting 6% upside potential.  D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI)D.R. Horton is one of the largest home construction companies in the U.S. On August 12, SunTrust Robinson’s Rohit Seth initiated coverage with a Buy rating and set a $56 price target, suggesting 19% upside potential. “We see the stock as a premier large-cap homebuilder offering attractive cash generation with superior position in the rapidly growing entry-level segment. We expect D.R. Horton to outperform in the second half of this year with orders and price mix as the homebuilding industry growth accelerates thanks to lower interest rates,” he noted. The four-star analyst has a 58% success rate and gets a 12% average return per rating. The Street is bullish on DHI. The stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $52 average price target, implying 12% upside. Humana Inc. (HUM)The health insurance provider just received a ratings boost from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper after it posted strong second quarter earnings results. On August 12, the five-star analyst upgraded the rating to a Buy and set a $345 price target, implying 17% upside potential. He argues that the company's strong 2Q19 results were fueled by continued success in Medicare Advantage and cost management. &quot;MA continues to grow at a nice clip, and HUM’s recent Louisiana Medicaid contract award demonstrates its success outside Medicare. Importantly, we believe the company’s investments in population health management and social determinants of health will accelerate growth over time,” Halper added.The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic. HUM has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $326 average price target, suggesting 10% upside potential.   Walt Disney Company (DIS)Some investors have expressed concern regarding Disney's earnings miss. However, Credit Suisse’s Douglas Mitchelson stated, “While Disney [stock] has outperformed the S&P 500 by 8% YTD, we see scope for further upside to Disney+ investor sentiment into its U.S. launch. We see a number of positive catalysts the next few quarters and believe downside risks to Disney estimates are now well understood by investors.&quot; On August 8, he upgraded DIS to a Buy and raised the price target from $130 to $150, indicating 11% upside potential. The five-star analyst has a 61% success rate and gets an average return of 15%. DIS has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $157 average price target, indicating 16% upside potential.  PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)Jeff Cantwell, a five-star analyst, believes that the online payment company’s valuation represents an improved opportunity for investors. On August 13, the Guggenheim analyst upgraded PYPL from a Sell to a Hold. “We note the recent pullback in PYPL’s shares, which has occurred against a backdrop of increasing macro uncertainty; shares have now fallen below our prior $104 PT. We believe the current level probably better reflects PYPL’s fair value; in that context, we see risk/reward as being more balanced,” he explained. Cantwell has a 74% success rate and an average return of 16% per rating. The Street is optimistic about this stock. PYPL has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $131 average price target, suggesting 27% upside potential.  Roku Inc. (ROKU)On August 12, Needham’s Laura Martin gave the streaming platform a vote of confidence. The five-star analyst, reiterated her Buy rating and raised the price target from $120 to $150, suggesting 12% upside potential. The price target hike sent shares surging 7%. “Roku is an arms dealer in the streaming video space, as its hardware facilitates multiple streaming platforms. Roku is therefore able to present a highly targeted proposition to advertisers, as each new Roku user is assigned a unique device ID and all content viewed can be extracted for superior targeting,” she said. Martin has a 63% success rate and gets an average return of 21% per rating.  Roku has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and an average price target of $115, implying 14% downside.  Zendesk (ZEN)Zendesk provides customer service software and support ticketing services. After a second quarter that produced strong growth, the company received a boost from Compass Point analyst Marshall Senk on August 13. The five-star analyst initiated coverage with a Buy and set a $100 price target. He thinks share prices could soar by as much as 34% over the next twelve months. Senk has a 77% success rate and gets an average return of 22% per rating. The Street is also bullish on ZEN. It has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $102 average price target, implying 38% upside potential.   Creditcorp Limited (BAP)Creditcorp is the largest financial services holding company in Peru. The company just received a positive signal from J.P. Morgan after its August 9 Q2 earnings release. Three-star analyst, Domingos Falavina, upgraded BAP to a Buy and raised the price target from $232 to $250. He believes the stock could surge by 24% over the next twelve months. Falavina has a 70% success rate and gets an average return of 9% per rating. BAP has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $250 average price target, suggesting 24% upside potential.  William Lyon Homes, Inc. (WLH)The home construction company just got a ratings boost from Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless. The three-star analyst upgraded his rating from a Hold to a Buy and raised the price target from $20 to $21, indicating 23% upside potential. He notes that the recent pullback in shares has effectively discounted the reduction in his 2019 EPS estimates following the Q2 results. &quot;Overall, we view the shares as undervalued at current levels,” McCanless added on August 13.WLH has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $21 average price target, implying 18% upside.   New Relic Inc. (NEWR) Despite the slowdown reported in its first quarter earnings, one analyst is vouching for the software analytics company. Joseph Bonner, a five-star analyst, upgraded NEWR from a Hold to a Buy and set a $93 price target on August 13. He believes share prices could jump 47% over the next twelve months, arguing that the slowed growth is not a long-term trend. The Argus Research analyst has a 67% success rate and gets a 12% average return per rating. NEWR has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $95 price target, suggesting 50% upside potential.

2019-08-14,"The restaurant industry typically has razor-thin profit margins, but one analyst sees plenty of return potential in three popular chains. MKM Partners’ Brett Levy (a 3-star analyst according to Tip Ranks) initiated Buy ratings on Outback Steakhouse parent Bloomin’ Brands, McDonald’s, and Papa John’s Pizza. All have interesting stories behind them, and each presents a different case for investors. Levy lays out a clear bull case for each stock. Bloomin’ Brands, Inc. (BLMN)Best known for its chain of Outback Steakhouse restaurants (whose signature ‘Bloomin’ Onion’ dish gives the parent company its name), Bloomin’ recently beat its Q2 earnings expectations by 2.8%, reporting EPS of 75 cents. It was the fourth quarter in a row that BLMN had reported an earnings beat, although Levy notes that the company’s annual sales have been steady in the range of $3.5 to $4.5 billion for the past several years, and says, “Posting in-line results or even modest beats versus a long-term growth profile won't be enough to impress investors.”Levy sees the company making the necessary changes, however, and positioning itself to improve those annual sales numbers. He writes, “Bloomin' Brands' top strategic priorities consists of improving sales through store remodels and relocation, enhanced menu through a focus on value, enhanced promotions, and superior in-store execution… At the same time the company is focusing on growing segments of the restaurant industry, including take-out growth, delivery expansion, and a new multi-branded loyalty program.”In line with his approval of BLMN management’s forward plans, Levy started coverage on this stock with a Buy rating and a $20 price target. BLMN currently sells for $16.78 and has a 30% upside based on the $21 average price target. The stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is derived from 6 buys, 1 hold, and 1 sell assigned in the past three months. It is worth noting here that even Bloomin’s lowest price target, $18, implies an upside of 7%; even those analysts hedging their bets on the restaurant chain believe it has potential for growth. McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)The early innovator in the fast food industry has long been a staple of the stock market. And while founder Ray Kroc was notoriously close-fisted, the company has a history of generously rewarding investors. The stock has shown consistent gains over the last three years, is up 23% year-to-date, and the dividend, while yielding a modest 2.11%, pays out a lucrative $4.64 annually due to the high share price. It’s no wonder that Mickey Ds would draw the attention of a stock analyst opening coverage of the restaurant sector.In his note on McDonald’s, Levy writes, “McDonald’s valuations continue to test new highs, but the company has continued to produce strong and consistent results, outpacing other highly franchised global concepts. We believe the combination of strong domestic and international sales growth is sustainable and when coupled with strong cash flow generation and consistent returns to shareholders, is supportive of a premium valuation...”McDonald’s is the strongest of the stocks in this article, with a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 17 buys and 5 holds given in the last three months. MCD shares are currently trading for $219, and have a 4.5% upside based on an average price target of $229. Levy’s price target, $250, suggests room for a substantially higher 13% upside. Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA)It’s no secret that Papa John’s Pizza has been hurting in the past year. From founder and now-former CEO John Schnatter’s mouthing-off problems, to basic issues like menu and product quality and franchisee relations, Papa John’s has faced a series of challenges that have impacted the bottom line. To underline the trouble, starting in Q3 of last year the company reported three quarterly losses in a row.That is starting to change with Q2, as PZZA has just reported its first quarterly profit in a year. The $8.4 million in net gains for the quarter was less than Q2 2018, but still a dramatic improvement from losses, and the 28 cent adjusted EPS was a welcome boon for investors. The company’s new CEO, Steve Ritchie, described Q2 as, “our third quarter of sequential improvement…” and said of the turnaround efforts, “I’m not going to say that we are out of the woods. But the franchisees do have confidence that we have a strong brand and new leaders.”Analyst Levy, in examining PZZA, noted three key points in the company’s strategy: “Greater value focus and new marketing initiatives [they have taken on Shaquille O’Neal as brand ambassador]; Fostering a better relationship with franchisees, including financial assistance; and, Bringing new operational and strategic talent, including the recent appointment of activist investor and Starboard Value CEO Jeff Smith as chairman.”He goes on to say, “Papa John's is implementing a return to basics, back to its ‘Better Ingredients, Better Pizza (BIBP)’ motto, but a turnaround is never easy... The case for buying Papa John's isn't made solely on easy comparisons from recent operating struggles. Rather, a new collaborative approach across the entire company and a willingness to bring new products and ideas could potentially result in a fundamentally led stock performance recovery.” PZZA gets a Buy rating from Levy, who quips that, in the pizza business, “it’s better to be early than late.” His price target of $55 indicates confidence in a 21% upside.Overall, Papa John’s has a Moderate Buy rating based on an even split – 3 buys and 3 holds given in the last three months. The stock sells for $45, and the average price target matches Levy’s at $55.Visit TipRanks’ Analysts’ Top Stocks page to find out what else is trending in today’s markets.",MKM Partners Initiates Buy Ratings on 3 Popular Restaurant Stocks

2019-08-21,"Stocks rallied Wednesday after President Donald Trump implied he's open to making a deal with China on trade, but gains were capped by the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Those minutes revealed that some of the central bank's governors pressed for a cut of 50 basis points last month, but they were obviously out-voted as the Fed proceeded with a reduction of just 25 basis points. What put a lid on today's upside for equities were comments that the July rate cut was not necessarily a precursor for more reductions.&quot;In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally favored an approach in which policy would be guided by incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook and that avoided any appearance of following a pre-set course,&quot; according to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill Currently, Fed funds futures are pricing in another 65 basis points of rate cuts this year, indicating there is room for markets to be left disappointed by the U.S. central bank.Still, the Nasdaq Composite notched an impressive gain of 0.90% today while the S&P 500 settled higher by 0.82%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 0.93% amid broad-based strength in the blue-chip index. In late trading, 29 of the 30 Dow stocks were higher. Dow Winners GaloreWhile the Fed minutes may have lacked the punch investors were hoping for, there were some solid earnings reports (non-Dow stocks) out of the retail sector that gave market participants reason to be the oft-discussed recession is a long way from materializing. On that note, Nike (NYSE:NKE) was the Dow's best performer today with a gain of 2.83%.Sticking with consumer cyclical fare for a moment, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) rose 2.25% after SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett opined that the company's current Buy One, Get One (BOGO) for $1 promotion won't be a drag on profits. He's got a &quot;buy&quot; rating and $240 price target on McDonald's.The analyst's &quot;research shows that McDonald's new offer is less promotional than its two for $5 mix-and-match deal that the company has cycled through in recent years--meaning McDonald's isn't meaningfully lowering the bar on prices in a way that would force rivals to discount as well,&quot; according to Barron's.I'm not saying it's all clear to wade into the energy sector, but it is encouraging to see more positive action out of oil giants Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), both of which traded higher today on the back of some bullish analyst chatter.BMO analyst Daniel Boy said Exxon and Chevron, the two largest U.S. oil companies are the &quot;lowest risk&quot; names and best of breed in the energy patch. Specific to Chevron, that's the second time in a matter of days an analyst has been cheery on the company.Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA), the Dow's largest component, added 2.49% today on news that the company is looking to fill hundreds of temporary jobs related to getting the 737 MAX passenger back in the air. Wall Street is hoping that will happen by the end of this year and if it does, Boeing shares likely move higher. DJIA Bottom LineIt's easy to get wrapped in the aforementioned Fed &quot;disappointment,&quot; if it can really be called that. Additionally, it's easy (and warranted) to be skeptical of President Trump's comments on deals with China because recent history shows this situation is fluid.Maybe what investors should be honing in on is the likelihood of recession. Look at Target (NYSE:TGT) earnings. That stock surged over 20% today on volume that was nearly seven times the daily average because it guided higher. Companies like Target don't guide higher when recessions are right around the corner.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-21,"McDonald’s stock has climbed in 2019, but some investors are worried that the fast-food giant’s latest promotion will mark a return to painful discounting in the sector. Don’t count on it, says SunTrust.","McDonald’s Stock Can Continue to Rally Because Its Latest Promotion Is Less of a Deal, Analyst Says"
2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Strong economies and tight labor markets put strains on fast-food companies. How can they remain profitable when wages are rising? The social media frenzy over the new chicken sandwich at Popeyes shows the success of one classic play: introduce an iconic new menu item, and charge more for it.At $3.99, the item is asking a bit more from customers than Chick-fil-A’s competing sandwich does – but apparently it’s not asking too much. It has been so popular that restaurants are selling out of food. The New Yorker magazine declared on Tuesday: “The Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Is Here to Save America.” If there's a new chicken sandwich king, we can thank the strong consumer economy.The fast-food industry is very responsive to consumer tastes and budgets because it's so huge and price-competitive. When times are bad, fast-food companies don't have to worry about rising food or labor costs, but at the same time their customers are on a tighter budget, so value menus and promotions might be the order of the day. But when times are good it's a different matter. Consumers are still choosing fast food because they're looking for a deal, but as companies struggle with rising food and labor costs, their margins are getting squeezed. Raising prices on existing menu items can help maintain profit margins, but go too far and consumers might revolt. A different kind of &quot;inflation&quot; is introducing new product offerings (at higher prices) to woo existing or new customers.Perhaps it's no surprise that the two iconic burgers in the fast-food industry -- Burger King's Whopper and the McDonald's Big Mac -- were both introduced during times of low unemployment like we have today. The Whopper came first in 1957, in a year when the unemployment rate dropped as low as 3.7%. Burger King's co-founder noticed that a rival establishment was selling well with a bigger burger, and he sought out to imitate it.The Big Mac owes its success to a particularly entrepreneurial McDonald's franchisee in Pittsburgh. Jim Delligatti came up with the idea in his Pittsburgh restaurant as a way of increasing sales. In 1967, with the national unemployment rate also below 4%, what later became known as the Big Mac was born in Pittsburgh. It went national a year later.It's a somewhat similar story for the Six Dollar Burger from Carl's Jr and Hardee's. In the late 1990s Carl's Jr was a stagnant franchise getting squeezed by McDonald's and Burger King at the low end and by higher-priced fast casual concepts. The Six Dollar Burger -- priced at $3.95 -- was a way of offering a premium product that still offered fast-food speed and value. It rolled out in what turned out to be the last month when America still thought the late 1990s boom might continue, in August 2001.The fast-food industry also suffered some blowback from its profit-inflating strategies in the late 1990s. In 1993 McDonald's promoted a &quot;Dino-sized&quot; value meal in response to the opening of the movie “Jurassic Park.” It became such a hit that super-sizing was born. That led to a super-sizing arms race throughout the industry for the rest of the decade, leading to surging fast-food profits in the late 1990s … coinciding with a growing obesity crisis. After public outcry in response to the documentary &quot;Super Size Me,&quot; McDonald's phased out super-sized portions in 2004.These two dynamics -- the fast-food industry's need to find a new source of profits in a good economy with growing cost pressures, and the industry's reputation as a bad actor in the obesity crisis -- provide the backdrop for the product launches the industry has produced this year. Before the Popeyes sandwich came the splashy announcements from the industry about menu items featuring Beyond Meat or Impossible products. In addition to not being real meat and hence having the veneer of health-consciousness, Beyond Meat products aren't cheap.The Popeyes chicken sandwich isn’t trying to be bigger or cheaper; the hook is really about trying to be a better chicken sandwich than Chick-fil-A's by featuring a brioche bun, a full layer of pickles, and either a spicy Cajun spread or mayonnaise. While the nearest Chick-fil-A to me sells its chicken sandwich for $3.49, the Popeyes one is 14% higher at $3.99.The economy’s good times can’t go on forever, but some booms give us a gift that lasts: the Whopper, the Big Mac, the Six Dollar Burger -- and now, perhaps, the Impossible Burger and the Popeyes chicken sandwich.To contact the author of this story: Conor Sen at csen9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Philip Gray at philipgray@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

This stands in sharp contrast to the market's expectations for the start of an aggressive rate cut campaign.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential With all the crosscurrents, investors would do well to focus their attention on the more defensive names in the market.

2019-08-27,"These days technology seems to be everywhere. From banking to our workplace, our lives are becoming ever-more linked to technology and digitized. That's why overweighting tech stocks makes a ton of sense for the long haul. And believe it or not, technology is finding its way into your local burger joint or where you buy a cup of coffee.A variety of restaurants have caught the technology bug.Plowing billions of R&D spending into new apps, artificial intelligence, data mining and other tech-based applications, many restaurants aren't just a place to grab a drink or a bite to eat. They are quickly becoming some of the biggest adopters of hottest trends in tech. Today, the decidedly low-tech French fry has plenty in common with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). You might even say that some restaurant shares deserve to be called tech stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills And those early adopters in the restaurant sector do earn that title. Thanks to these tech upgrades, sales, profits and margins have been surging. Proof that you can get plenty of growth by thinking differently. To that end, these three restaurants are really wonderful tech stocks in disguise. Food-Based Tech Stocks to Buy: McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com Fast-food giant and burger slinger McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) may soon want to change its name to McData. The Golden Arches has gone full hog into adding tech into a variety of its processes. This includes products to speed up order and fulfillment, mobile apps and even a hefty dose of A.I.To start with, MCD's made mobile ordering a key piece under its &quot;Velocity Growth Plan.&quot;  Through the app, customers have the ability to choose when and how they want to pick-up their food. More importantly, the app is synchronized to a customer's digital wallet and their delivery partnership with Uber (NASDAQ:UBER).What's wonderful for McDonald's is they've found that when a consumer uses the mobile app or one of its new self-ordering kiosks, they tend to order more food or extra side items. This has helped boost comparable-store sales. Last quarter, tech helped the Golden Arches see same-store-sales jump 6.5% -- the biggest jump in four years. Meanwhile, earnings surged 7%.And more gains could be in store for MCD thanks to McDonald's big buyout of Israel's Dynamic Yield. The firm's software is being used to change its menu displays and offer recommendations based on the time of day, weather, restaurant traffic and trending items. So far, the initial test with the software has been a real success and MCD is planning on rolling it out nationwide.Looking out further, MCD's could use Dynamic Yield's software to offer a truly personalized experience when coupled with self-ordering kiosks, its app and rewards programs.In the end, the focus McDonald's has had recently has made it sound similar to many tech stocks. And the firm also has the growth behind it to be considered a tech stock in disguise. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Pulling the perfect espresso shot is an art form. Equally artistic is getting people to pay $6 for that shot of coffee and some milk. But coffeehouse Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is doing just that and the key has been its transformation into a tech stock.A few years ago, SBUX unveiled its rewards program and its mobile app. This alone helped drive sales and repeat traffic. But lately, its efforts to ramp up the app/rewards program has become the foundation of its new digital flywheel program. Here, SBUX is moving to a new cloud-based system that allows for more personalization, rewards, payment and ordering options. Through its new tech investments and upgraded A.I.-based applications, Starbucks will be able to update rewards programs in real-time to target subsets of customers. The idea is that consumers can keep the &quot;wheel&quot; going as they are rewarded. In turn, they spend more, get more personalized rewards, etc.Moreover, the next phase of its integration will be connecting inventory and point-of-sale systems together to reduce costs and waste. Starbucks also recently took a stake in Brightloom -- a firm that develops software for mobile orders and delivery.And its efforts seem to be working. During its last earnings report, SBUX mentioned that 42% of tender occurred via its digital operations. And during its latest conference call, CEO Kevin Johnson mentioned that these digital efforts contributed two percentage points to its 6% same-store sales growth in the U.S. during the quarter. The best part is that the number of rewards members continue to grow. SBUX saw 12% and 13% membership growth in the last two quarters.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income As you can see tech is really working for SBUX and firm digital ambitions make a force in the sector. Domino's Pizza (DPZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) could be the restaurant to thank for the many of them acting like tech stocks. Back in 2007, DPZ was one of the first restaurants to offer online ordering and it was one of the first to launch an iPhone app. It has since built upon those beginnings and unveiled its AnyWare technology suite.AnyWare allows customers to order a pizza from 15 different methods, including their phone, Facebook's (NYSE:FB) Messenger app, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa devices and even Slack (NASDAQ:WORK) while at the office. Moreover, to appeal to millennial and younger consumers, they've &quot;gamified&quot; the ordering process with badges, virtual pizza builders and its now-famous order tracker bar.The moves have paid off -- with more than two-thirds of its sales starting from digital ordering channels.But Domino's isn't done with tech. Its next step is to improve the delivery of pizza. It has unveiled new &quot;Hot Spots&quot;, such as beaches, parks and other public locations, that consumers can have their food delivered to. Again, Hot Spots are integrated into its AnyWare suite.DPZ is taking delivery one step further and has invested in autonomous vehicle tech through a series of partnerships. Soon, a robot or self-driving car may be dropping off your pizza and breadsticks. This is all possible thanks to its fortressing strategy. Like AMZN with its massive fulfillment center network, DPZ is working on building out a massive portfolio of stores. The hope is to cut down on delivery times and make automated delivery possible.It's no wonder why management at DPZ considers itself an &quot;eCommerce company that just happens to sell pizzas.&quot; With that, Domino's remains one of the best tech stocks to buy today.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held a long position in AMZN.

2019-08-29,"Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has had a rough go of it since its launch in 2013. It had a great deal of promise just like many of the young social media companies did. Subscribers to the free service were growing and the platform was very popular. While building a micro-blogging site is relatively easy, TWTR dominated the competition so quickly that it was the main player in the space without much difficulty.Source: Worawee Meepian / Shutterstock.com But then, it ran into the same challenges as its social media peers, like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). It had to monetize all those people who had signed up. And that is far more complicated.Imagine McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) gave away a new sandwich. It's easy to get people to eat a free lunch. But getting them to buy a meal is significantly harder. What's different for social media companies like Twitter is that you're not selling a subscription, you're courting advertisers to use the platform to sell to users.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt first, like with Facebook, advertisers flocked to the platform as a great way to add to their digital advertising portfolios. Their clients wanted exposure in new media as older forms of marketing were losing steam. But there's an old adage in direct mail. It's easy to give something away, but getting people to pay, even a penny, is something entirely different. And Twitter found this out.Advertisers were not impressed with their initial efforts. There were challenges with how ads could be presented both from the back end and the front end. And working out those challenges took a while. This problem wasn't unique to TWTR -- FB also went through similar struggles. But the market didn't care. It expected great things immediately and had priced in a significant premium for monetizing subscribers.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week When TWTR stumbled, it was punished.Some of the challenges for Twitter were the direct result of its micro-blogging platform. It was easier for FB to shift its format and deliver an advertising-friendly platform much more easily. As TWTR struggled, the stock slid. And critics were beginning to think that TWTR may never truly realize its potential.But the digital world is very impatient. This whole story has unfolded in a mere six years. The Bottom Line on TWTR StockNow, Twitter has re-emerged, in part thanks to a United States president who uses the platform to get around traditional media and speak directly to his followers. But it's not only the growing popularity of the platform, it's also the fact that TWTR has found traction in its advertising revenue.TWTR stock is up 17% in the past 12 months and has really taken off in 2019 -- it's up almost 48% year-to-date. But the thing is, its trailing price-to-earnings ratio still sits just below 14.My Portfolio Grader give TWTR stock an &quot;A&quot; rating.

2019-08-29,"No one can predict the future. But nonetheless, the warnings coming from the Street sound particularly ominous right now. “Even as we have been revising our growth projections lower, we continue to highlight that the risks remain decidedly skewed to the downside,” Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley’s chief economist, recently cautioned. “We expect that if trade tensions escalate further... we will enter into a global recession (i.e., global growth below 2.5%Y) in three quarters.”That’s why it’s best to get your portfolio in shape before trouble hits. Here are five stocks worth keeping an eye on. All five stocks score a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus from the Street thanks to their compelling outlook. The consensus is based on the last three months of ratings. A couple of these stocks are also top-notch dividend picks. Let’s take a closer look now: 1&#92;. Medtronic PLC (MDT)Ireland based Medtronic is the world's largest medical device company. It has just announced that Geoff Martha will succeed Omar Ishrak as CEO. The news comes after the company reported impressively robust earnings reports. Every reported segment came in above consensus' expectations, with notable strength in Neurovascular, Spine, and Structural Heart.“We don't think that the selection of Martha to succeed Ishrak comes as much of a surprise and we believe that investors think highly of Martha given his track record leading the Spine business and RTG after that” commented Needham’s Mike Matson on August 28.If Martha can further improve upon MDT's execution, Matson believes its multiple could continue to narrow the gap to its large-cap med tech peer group average. Right now, MDT shares trade at a CY20E P/E of 19.4x a roughly 17% discount vs. its large-cap peer group.Net-net: “We reiterate our Strong Buy rating given MDT's improving product cycle and revenue growth and its P/E discount to its large-cap peers”. Out of 17 analysts covering MDT, 14 rate the stock a buy. MDT also pays a 2% dividend yield, with a $2.16 annualized payout; the result of 41 years of consecutive dividend growth.  2&#92;. Clean Harbors Inc (CLH)Clean Harbors is a leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services. That includes everything from hazardous waste management to industrial cleaning and recycling services. The stock is on a tear so far this year, with shares up 50% year-to-date. And analysts are confident further growth lies ahead.Four out of five analysts covering the stock rate CLH a buy. This includes a recent upgrade from top-rated Oppenheimer analyst Noah Kaye. He bumped the stock from hold to buy with an $88 price target (19% upside potential) following CLH’s beat-and-raise quarter. “We believe Q2 results and commentary provide evidence that Clean Harbors can still generate healthy margin expansion in a low-growth environment, and that consistent execution along with potential catalysts can support another leg up for the shares,” he told investors on August 1. 3&#92;. KB Home (KBH)KB Home- the first company to be traded on the NYSE as a home builder- is enjoying a wave of bullish sentiment from the Street right now. Over the last few months the company has received no less than 6 analyst upgrades. Given that analysts tend to reiterate their ratings, multiple upgrades speak volumes about the stock’s potential. “In the midst of a homebuilding sector where individual stock returns are likely to be highly data-driven, we believe KBH is well positioned with its focus on the entry-level and its strong community count growth” cheers Evercore ISI analyst Stephen Kim. This top-rated analyst upgraded KBH last month, writing “KBH should show some of the highest growth in the space this year, and if the company sustains its order momentum, it has the potential to produce order growth of 30%+ in 4Q.” Meanwhile SunTrust Robinson’s Rohit Seth describes KB Home as “an attractive turnaround story.”  4&#92;. McDonald’s Corp (MCD)Fast food empire McDonald’s has just received its highest price target yet. On August 13 MKM Partners analyst Brett Levy initiated coverage with a buy rating and $250 price target (vs the $230 average analyst price target). McDonald’s “valuations continue to test new highs,” Levy states “but the company has continued to produce strong and consistent results, outpacing much of the other highly franchised global concepts.” Indeed, MCD’s latest earnings report revealed stellar global same-restaurant sales growth of 6.5%, easily beating the 5% consensus estimate. The analyst continued: “We believe the combination of strong domestic and international... sales growth are sustainable through its potential uptick in unit expansion and solid same-store sales generation (through a balanced menu approach and ongoing investments in its stores, systems, technology).”And don’t forget, MCD is also an elite ‘Dividend Aristocrat’. That’s thanks to 42 years of consecutive dividend growth. Investors currently receive an annualized payout of $4.64 on a 2.13% dividend yield. 5&#92;. SilverCrest Metals Inc (SILV)Last but not least we have SilverCrest Metals, an intriguing precious metals exploration company. According to the Street, its flagship Las Chispas project in northwestern Mexico has the potential be one of the highest return projects (+70% IRR at spot prices) in the precious metals space.Indeed, in the last three months, five analysts have published back-to-back buy ratings on SILV. That’s with an average price target of $7.25. And most notably, RBC Capital’s Mark Mihaljevic has just singled out the stock for special praise. He places SILV on RBC Capital’s Q3/2019 list of Canadian Small Cap Conviction Stocks. “We believe SilverCrest’s Las Chispas silver/gold (50%/50%) project has emerged as one of the most promising advanced exploration- stage assets given near-surface high grade mineralization, low capital intensity, and exploration potential” explains Mihaljevic. He believes SilverCrest is a high potential takeover target, as Las Chispas “can add a high-grade, high- margin, high-return project and help fill out the pipeline for many of the [larger] producers.” So watch this space.

2019-08-30,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Seemingly everywhere you look there are signs of a recession The yield curve is inverted There are negative interest rates everywhere across the globe The 30 Year Treasury yield is at an all time low,5 Recession Resistant Stocks to Buy for Protection
2019-08-30,"Seemingly everywhere you look, there are signs of a recession. The yield curve is inverted. There are negative interest rates everywhere across the globe. The 30-Year Treasury yield is at an all-time low. The U.S.-China trade war is escalating. Manufacturing activity globally is slowing. Corporate insiders are selling stock in bulk. Business confidence is eroding.To be sure, I think a lot of this recession chatter is noise, and that most -- if not all -- of those &quot;indicators&quot; are red herrings. My base case scenario today remains for the U.S. economy to stay in expansion mode for the next 12 months, and for the S&P 500 to grind higher.Still, one cannot ignore all those dour signs, and it may be smart to at least start preparing for the worst. As the old saying goes: prepare for the worst, hope for the best.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the investment world, how does one prepare for a recession? It's simple. Buy safe stocks with a track record of recession resistance.Those stocks are tough to find. Most stocks don't make the cut. Instead, most stocks plunge alongside the market during recessions. But, a few don't, and the few that don't are the ones that should be on your &quot;prepare for the worst&quot; radar.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September Which stocks make the cut? Let's take a look at five safe stocks to buy with recession resistance. Safe Stocks to Buy With Recession Resistance: Walmart (WMT)Alpha Generated in Last Recession: 58%Why: Consumers migrate to discount retailers when money becomes tight.The Thesis: The bull thesis on Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as a safe stock to buy in a recession is pretty simple.Recessions hurt the U.S. consumer -- they don't outright kill U.S. consumption. As such, consumers still shop during recessions because they still need things like food, clothes and other essentials. The only difference in a recession is that they are doing this &quot;essentials&quot; shopping at discount retailers. Walmart is the king of the discount retail segment. Thus, when times get tough, consumers flock to Walmart to save money on their &quot;essentials&quot; shopping.The result? Walmart's numbers can actually improve during a recession, and WMT stock can actually move higher. Just look at the last recession. The S&P 500 peaked in October 2007, and bottomed in November 2009. During that stretch, the index lost about 56.5%. WMT stock gained 1.5% over that same stretch, thereby generating 58 percentage points of alpha over the market during the last recession.Could the same thing happen during the next recession? Yes. And it probably will, given that Walmart has only extended its dominance in the discount retail game. McDonald's (MCD)Alpha Generated in Last Recession: 50%Why: Consumers buy cheap food when money becomes tight.The Thesis: Much like the bull thesis on Walmart, the recession-proof bull thesis on McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is similarly simple.During recessions, most people keep their jobs -- the unemployment rate jumped to just 10% in the last recession. Wage gains fall flat, but consumers are still making incomes. Thus, in a recession, consumers don't all become unemployed and broke -- instead, most actually remain income-earners. That income just becomes tighter. When it becomes tighter, consumers start to look to cut down their expenses wherever they can.One place to do so is on food. Consumers still have to eat. But, they don't have to eat as expensively. The real world translation? During a recession, McDonald's dollar menu starts to look a lot tastier.That's why McDonald's can actually get a boost during a recession, and why MCD stock can generate tremendous alpha. While the market plunged more than 56% from late 2007 to early 2009, MCD stock fell just 7%. That represents an impressive near 50 percentage points of alpha during the last recession.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Will such out-performance happen again? Yes. McDonald's has widened its lead in the discount QSR segment since 2007, and in so doing, it has become an even safer bet during a recession than a decade ago. Planet Fitness (PLNT)Alpha Generated in Last Recession: N/AWhy: Consumers still want to work out, but don't want to spend as much on gym memberships.The Thesis: Although there is no stock performance data to back the recession-proof thesis on Planet Fitness (NASDAQ:PLNT) -- the stock wasn't public during the last recession -- the bull thesis on why this stock should generate big alpha during an economic slowdown is nonetheless compelling.Now, more-so than ever before, consumers want to workout, look good and live a healthy lifestyle. Doing so comes with added costs, such as gym memberships. Those aren't cheap. Gym memberships can cost anywhere from $40 a month, to several hundred dollars per month. But, Planet Fitness offers gym memberships for as low as $10 per month.In an economic slowdown, consumers still want to workout, look good and live a healthy lifestyle. They just want to do it for less. How do they accomplish that? By canceling their 24 Hour or LA Fitness gym memberships and signing up for Planet Fitness.How many people will do this? Not a lot. But, enough to where Planet Fitness' numbers could actually improve during a recession, meaning that PLNT stock could actually move higher against a plunging market. Flowers Foods (FLO)Alpha Generated in Last Recession: 55%Why: Consumers always need to eat, regardless of the economic backdrop.The Thesis: When it comes to Flower Foods (NYSE:FLO), the bull thesis behind why to buy this stock in a recession is very straightforward.Consumers always need to eat. But, during a recession, they become more selective about what they eat. That is, they cut back on the filet mignon, and bulk up on low-cost baked goods. Flower Foods is the second largest producer of packaged baked goods in the country, owning popular brands such as Nature's Own and Wonder Bread. As such, this company actually gets a tailwind when the economy slows, because more consumers pivot into buying their low-cost baked goods.The proof is in the numbers. During the last recession, the market plunged more than 56%. Over the same stretch that the market lost more than half of its value, FLO stock dropped less than a percent. That's right -- less than a percent. At the same time, FLO stock paid shareholders a 2% dividend yield.  * 7 Mega-Cap Tech Stocks on a Rebound Now Can this huge out-performance repeat itself during the next recession? I don't see why not. All the fundamentals are the same, and FLO stock has a 3%-plus dividend yield now. Ross Stores (ROST)Alpha Generated in Last Recession: 58%Why: When money becomes tight, consumers stop shopping at full-price retail stores and start shopping at off-price retail stores.The Thesis: When it comes to Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), the bull thesis on why to buy ROST stock during a recession is a slight iteration of the WMT recession-proof bull thesis.That is, during tough economic times, money becomes tight. But, consumers still need to live, so they still need to buy things like food, clothes, so on and so forth. In a recession, they just migrate all that shopping from full-price stores to off-price stores. Ross Stores owns two of those off-price stores -- Ross Dress for Less and dd's Discounts.Those stores did quite well during the last recession. Comparable store sales at Ross Stores rose 1% in 2007, then accelerated to 2% growth in 2008 and 6% growth in 2009. So, not only did Ross Stores hold up during the last recession, the company's growth trajectory actually accelerated -- likely thanks to the aforementioned consumption shift from full-price to off-price.ROST stock reflected this out-performance. From late 2007 to early 2009, while the market shed more than half of its value, ROST stock rose nearly 2%.This same out-performance should repeat come the next recession, mostly because Ross Stores remains one of the very few big brand names in the discount retail segment, and thus, will benefit from the broad full-price to off-price consumption shift.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long WMT, MCD and ROST.

For the S&P 500, the $2,940 level has been a graveyard in the sky where rallies go to die. Today, we'll see if buyers can finally push through it.Source: Shutterstock Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.54%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.55%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.54%.Optimism's return fueled call volumes in the options pits yesterday. Overall volume bumped higher than the past few trading sessions with about 17.9  million calls and 15.5 million puts changing hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, over at the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked slightly higher to 0.66. The spate of low readings seen during the market's rise this week continues to pull the 10-day moving average lower. It closed just above 0.66.Options traders favored calls in the most active stocks on Thursday. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) was flooded with activity ahead of today's ex-dividend date. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is on the cusp of a breakout and the bullishness is drumming up call demand. Finally, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) scored a robust rally but saw an uptick capture trading.Let's take a closer look: McDonald's (MCD)Hamburgers and fries care little about the trade war. So says the chart of McDonald's which boasts one of the best uptrends on the Street. This week's rally returned MCD stock to within a whisker of new record highs. Its year-to-date gains of 24% are outpacing the S&P 500's rise of 17%.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September Today's ex-dividend date lit a fire under options trading yesterday, launching McDonald's to the top of the most-actives leaderboard. Dividend seekers buy call options for short-term control of MCD to capture some cash. This quarter's payment of $1.16 translates into an annual yield of 2.12%.As is always the case on the eve of the ex-dividend date, calls went bananas. Activity swelled to 202% of the average daily volume, with 78,958 total contracts traded; 91% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility dropped to 18%, placing it at the 19th percentile of its one-year range. That means prices are low and long premium plays are the way to go. Bull call spreads are my strategy of choice here. Twitter (TWTR)Twitter is another stock remaining above the fray this month. The popularity of its options trading has created multiple appearances here at Vital Data. Thursday was no exception with its price rally drumming up options interest.On the price front, TWTR stock is on the cusp of completing a month-long base or consolidation pattern. The sideways chop has fully digested last month's robust earnings gains and is setting the stage for another leg higher. Watch for a break above $43.50 to signal the advance has begun.Traders flocked to calls throughout the session. Total activity jumped to 115% of the average daily volume, with 91,629 contracts traded. Calls contributed 71% to the day's take.The stability of Twitter's stock price is keeping implied volatility low. It closed Thursday at 38% or the 16th percentile of its one-year range. That said, the absolute level of IV is high enough to keep cash flow trades like naked puts interesting. So you have your pick of any number of bullish strategies here. Long calls or call spreads for aggressive directional bets and naked puts for high probability. Micron Technology (MU)The trade war troubles took a bite out of Micron Technology shares, but buyers returned this week at a critical moment. MU stock probed below its rising 50-day moving average before bulls emerged to defend support and keep its nascent uptrend intact. Yesterday's upside follow-through confirmed their dominance and has the stock eyeing a breakout over short-term resistance.  * 7 Mega-Cap Tech Stocks on a Rebound Now A break above $45.50 should kick-off a run toward its prior peak near $49.On the options trading front, puts drew a bigger crowd than calls and despite the stock rally total, activity grew to 106% of the average daily volume, with 127,469 contracts traded. Puts accounted for 54% of the session's sum.Implied volatility slumped to 47% placing it at the 30th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $1.31 or 2.9%, so set your expectations accordingly.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-04,"Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) got a late start in the food game. It was launched in August 2014 but has since accumulated three of the hottest quick service franchises in North America today.Source: Shutterstock Under QSR stock's umbrella is Canada's version of Dunkin (NASDAQ:DNKN), Tim Horton's. In the U.S. QSR operates Burger King and Popeye's.Each of these brands is independently operated. QSR is the holding company. It began as a merger between Burger King and Tim Horton's in 2014, then Popeye's was added in 2017. It's the fifth-largest quick service company in the world.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy The names in its brand connote much more than size and power. They are actually some of the most beloved names in fast food. It's the quality products and distinctive identities of these brands that really add value to Restaurant Brands International and QSR stock. QSR Stock's New BFF: A Chicken SandwichA perfect example is the recent furor over Popeye's chicken sandwich launch. For months before the launch there was an untold numbers of stories out there talking about the Chick-fil-A brand as America's most beloved chicken sandwich and fast food restaurant. Then Popeye's dropped their sandwich, and the market went nuts.Now, the stories are about how incredible the sandwich is. The CEO is even doing interviews apologizing for not expecting the enormous popularity of the sandwich. The sandwiches sold out in most stores in a matter of days. And there are accounts of people pulling guns on employees, demanding the sandwiches.That is how you change a news cycle and attract diners. Quirky marketing might be smart, but the best way to attract and keep customers is by serving good food; and food your customers want.While Burger King is like the smart-alecky, smaller younger brother to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) who can't fight him toe-to-toe, so he just annoys him to no end, Tim Horton's is the quiet down-to-earth older brother to Dunkin' and hipster sister Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).And Popeye's marches to the beat of its own drummer as well. All make for a compelling company that goes about its business making money around the world.Tim Horton's has 850 restaurants in the U.S. - Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, New York, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maine - and 4,400 systemwide, with most of the remainder in Canada. Bottom Line on Restaurant Brands International StockQSR stock is up 44% year to date and 31% in the past 12 months, plus it delivers a very respectable 2.55% dividend.Obviously, QSR stock is gaining some attention at this point. But this is the kind of stock that is attractive in this sector because its brands are somewhat unconventional. They attract younger customers that are looking for quality brands that stand for more than just cheap food to stuff in their mouths.Bear in mind that the company recently released that it will be launching a secondary share offering of just under 1.7 million shares later this month. The public float is 268 million shares, so this won't be too dilutive.Regardless of how well or poorly the economy is moving forward, QSR stock should continue to do well as its price points and quality products make it attractive to consumers in all seasons.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-09-09,"Shares of coffee retail giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have been on fire over the past year, rising nearly 80% over that stretch versus a mere 3% gain for the S&P 500.Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Ostensibly, the huge rally in SBUX stock makes sense. After a multi-year stretch from 2015 to 2018 wherein competition flattened out SBUX's growth trajectory, the coffee retail giant has since regained its groove, and is now consistently topping Street estimates on the only metric that matters in the retail world -- comparable sales.As comparable sales growth has consistently topped analyst expectations over the past year, SBUX stock has taken off like a rocket ship.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt first glance, it makes a ton of sense. But, upon closer inspection, there are some red flags which make me worried that the big rally in Starbucks stock may be on its last legs.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September What are those red flags? Let's take a closer look. The Fundamentals Appear StretchedThe first big red flag on SBUX stock near $100 is that the fundamentals appear stretched.Everyone is celebrating the fact that management issued guidance which calls for Starbucks to be a 3-4% comparable sales grower and 10%-plus profit grower over the next several years. Sure, those are great growth projections. But over the past five years, Starbucks has averaged 5% comparable sales growth on profit growth that was largely above 15%, and often above 20%.During that stretch from 2013 to 2018, SBUX stock traded around 25-times forward earnings. Today, SBUX stock trades at 30-times forward earnings.See the disconnect? Starbucks projects to grow materially slower over the next several years, than it has over the past several years, yet Starbucks stock is trading at a 20% richer valuation than it has over the past five years.That doesn't make much sense. Indeed, history says a 30-times forward multiple just doesn't work for Starbucks stock. The last (and only time in the past decade) that this stock had a 30-times forward multiple was in 2015. In 2016, SBUX stock dropped more than 7%, while the S&P 500 was up more than 10%. The Optics Could Get Ugly In A HurryThe second big red flag on SBUX stock is that, while the optics remain good today, they could get ugly in a hurry.Right now, everything looks good for Starbucks. Traffic growth has come back into the picture. Comparable sales growth is stabilizing. The China growth narrative appears healthy. Margins are stable. The technology and delivery integrations are working.But I'm worried that all those positives could turn into negatives in a hurry.Positive traffic growth? It could turn negative given that indie coffee shops are still rapidly expanding and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is being relentless in its breakfast snack and drink menu expansion. Stabilizing comps? They could decelerate again if traffic growth flips back into negative territory from competition. Healthy China growth? Luckin Coffee (NYSE:LK) is growing very quickly in China, and will only become a bigger threat to the Starbucks China growth narrative over time. Stable margins? Competition could erode pricing power, forcing Starbucks to cut prices to drive traffic, which will weigh on margins.Overall, I see very real and sizable risks on the horizon which could turn today's favorable optics into unfavorable optics rather quickly. The Technicals Imply A TopThe third big red flag on SBUX stock is that the long-term technicals imply that the stock could be peaking here and now.   Click to EnlargeSee the attached chart. For the most part, Starbucks has traded within very well defined bands dating back more than thirty years. Breaks above the upper band are solid medium-term selling opportunities. Breaks below the lower band are solid medium-term buying opportunities.Right now, SBUX stock is breaking above the upper band of this trading range. If it continues to rally, it will break a trading pattern which has held true for over three decades. As such, I don't think it will continue to rally, and am worried that the next move in Starbucks stock could be significantly lower. Bottom Line on SBUX StockIt seems everyone loves Starbucks stock right now. But, when I see everyone falling in love with Starbucks stock, I am reminded of the age old Wall Street adage -- stocks advance on a wall of worry, and decline on a slope of hope.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy That adage doesn't always ring true. But, in this case, I think it will. There are enough red flags on SBUX stock here to warrant staying away from this red hot stock for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The idea is to eventually have a machine, instead of a person, on the other side of the intercom to relay orders to kitchen staff. In Chicago-area restaurants where the system is already being tested, employees still oversee drive-thru order-taking and can step in when needed.The acquisition is McDonald’s third tech deal in the past six months, and fits into the company’s push to lean more heavily on machines and artificial intelligence to boost sales. McDonald’s is also using Apprente’s headquarters in Mountain View, California -- also home to Google owner Alphabet Inc. -- to start a tech lab, with plans to add employees there.“We believe we’re at the right stage now to build out our capacity and have a greater presence in Silicon Valley,” McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said.McDonald’s sees Apprente, which has fewer than 20 employees, helping it move cars through the drive-thru lane more quickly and take orders more accurately than employees. The company is also investing to add ordering apps and kiosks in its restaurants and digital menu displays.In the U.S., fast-food companies are looking for an edge amid intense competition. While many chains have turned in robust sales results this summer, a lot of that growth has been rooted in high prices and new locations, rather than traffic gains. While McDonald’s last quarter posted a 6.5% gain in same-store sales -- its best result in seven years -- guest counts in the U.S. remained down.Founded in 2017, Apprente says its technology can accurately interpret conversational language -- such as a customer ordering a hamburger with no onions and extra sauce. McDonald’s already is testing the technology in two locations in the drive-thru lane, which makes up about 70% of the company’s business. It plans to roll Apprente’s technology out nationwide, Easterbrook said. He predicted it will have a “positive impact on more than half of our customers.”Dynamic, PlexureEarlier this year, McDonald’s spent $300 million on Dynamic Yield Ltd., which helps retailers improve performance by collecting personal data from customers to fine-tune sales pitches and promotions. McDonald’s uses Dynamic Yield’s tools to suggest food and drinks to diners based on factors such as time of day, weather and traffic. In April, it bought a small stake in Plexure Group Ltd., which develops mobile apps.Shares of McDonald’s fell as much as 2.8% to $211.24 in New York Tuesday. They had gained 22% this year through Monday’s close, outpacing gains in the S&P 500 Index.McDonald’s, which declined to disclose terms of the deal, may expand the use of Apprente’s technology to markets beyond the U.S. The company wants to make sure it can work with different accents, such as in Australia and the U.K., and work in languages besides English, Easterbrook said. The company also sees the technology being used at kiosks and in mobile apps.“We’d like to get a second language developed very quickly,” he said. “We see it as being a global solution.”(Adds share trading in ninth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder, Lisa WolfsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",McDonald’s Buys Startup to Add Automated Drive-Thru Ordering

2019-09-11,"Stocks that pay good dividends and also have significant stock buyback programs provide numerous benefits to investors. These benefits include:  * Share reductions from buybacks allow the stock to increase its dividends per share.  * Buybacks act as a natural buffer for the stock.  * Earnings per share increases for the same amount of net income.  * Buybacks act to sterilize share dilution from management and employee options.  * Lower share counts over time increase the remaining shareholders' stake in the company.  * Compared to dividends, buybacks are a much more tax-efficient return of capital.For these reasons, there is a clear trend in the United States stock market for companies to spend more on share buybacks. CNBC recently reported that according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) study, U.S. share buybacks are expected to hit $1 trillion this year. Corporations are using over 104% of their free cash flow for buybacks, up from 82% last year.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September I'm going to focus on five stocks that pay shareholders dividends and have large share buyback programs. Combined, these dividends and buybacks provide large total yields. And over time, these stocks are likely to be good investments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dividend Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Source: thanat sasipatanapa / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.4%Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has an attractive 1.4% dividend yield. But it returns even more capital to shareholders through its large share buyback program. AAPL has spent over 107% of its free cash flow on buybacks in the past year. The company has cut its shares by 32% in the last six years.Based on recent analysis, Apple stock will have an estimated 6.5% buyback yield over the next year, giving it a nearly 8% total yield.For example, AAPL recently reported that it spent $17 billion in share repurchases and $3.6 billion in dividends in its most recent quarter. The buybacks alone, if continued each quarter, represent on an annualized basis just under 7% of its market value ($68 billion dividend by $975 billion).Expect good things from Apple's stock buyback program in the years to come, including higher dividends per share and higher earnings per share. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.4%Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock yields 1.4% and has a large share buyback program. It just completed a $25 billion share repurchase program. In the past quarter alone, MSFT spent $7.7 billion on shareholders, including $4.2 billion in share buybacks.These repurchases have reduced the amount of MSFT shares outstanding by over 30% in the past 15 years. Since Microsoft stock has a $1 trillion market value, its annual spending of over $16 billion in buybacks represents a 1.6% buyback yield. Combined with the 1.4% dividend yield, MSFT sports a 3% total yield. Oracle (ORCL)Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.7%Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock has a 1.7% dividend yield, but has a massive buyback program. In the past year alone, ORCL spent $36 billion on buybacks, representing 20% of its $182 billion market value.In its last eight fiscal years, ORCL has reduced its share count by over 33% using its free cash flow to repurchase shares. All eyes are going to be on ORCL's August fiscal first-quarter earnings statement to see how many shares it has bought back. Since ORCL spent over 280% of its free cash flow on buybacks, effectively drawing down its cash balance, I suspect ORCL's buyback activity may have been reduced for the August quarter.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Nevertheless, at the rate its buybacks occurred last fiscal year (ending in May), Oracle stock sports an annualized 20% buyback yield. Its free cash flow yield is 7.5% of its market value.ORCL will post its earnings Sept. 12, including its cash flow statement which will show the share repurchase amounts. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.8%Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock has an attractive 2.8% dividend yield. Cisco stock also has an attractive buyback program. This is because the company is expected to make $7.7 billion in share repurchases this year.Compared to its $206 billion market value, this gives CSCO stock a 3.7% buyback yield. Its total yield is an appealing 6.5% (2.8% dividend yield plus 3.7% buyback yield).In the past ten years, CSCO has reduced its shares outstanding by 27%, and should reach close to a 30% reduction this year. The main reason for this is that CSCO produces abundant free cash flow -- over $15 billion in this year alone.Expect that shares will continue to fall at CSCO. This has the benefit of allowing CSCO to be able to raise its dividend per share for the same amount of earnings its produces. It also increases earnings per share. Lastly the share buybacks act as a continuing source of demand for the stock, will help push the stock higher over time. McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.2%McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock enjoys a 2.2% dividend yield, but also engages in large share buyback activity. MCD reported that it expects to complete its three-year $25 billion share buyback program by the end of this year.This represents an average of $8.3 billion in share buybacks per year. Since MCD stock has a $158 billion market value, the average buyback yield is 5.3% of its stock market value.Combined with the 2.2% dividend yield, the buyback yield gives MCD an estimated 7.5% total yield. This means that over 7% of MCD's stock value is returned to shareholders on average each year through either dividends or buybacks.On Aug. 30 Mark Hake launched the Total Yield Value Guide, which focuses on high-total-yield value stocks.

2019-09-11,"After almost 20 years as CEO of Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK), Patrick Byrne resigned from the company and board August 22. The highly controversial leader's resignation caused OSTK stock to briefly jump by more than 15%. However, shares dropped to $15 by the beginning of September.Source: Shutterstock As I write this, Overstock stock has recovered most of those losses trading around $20. Still, it's well below its January 2018 all-time high of $89.80.My InvestorPlace colleague, Dana Blankenhorn, recently highlighted logistics consultant Brittain Ladd's belief that Byrne should have been fired years ago. It's hard to argue with that sentiment. Byrne was not the man or woman you would want running the local McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), let alone a company with more than 2,000 employees and revenues of more than $1.8 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPerhaps it was Byrne's family's relationship with Warren Buffett that kept the board at bay all these years. Or maybe it was Byrne's significant ownership stake in the company. Whatever the case, Byrne is gone from the company. Currently, Jonathan E. Johnson III, the head of its Medici Ventures blockchain subsidiary, is running Overstock on an interim basis.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Anybody but Byrne would be a better CEO at this point. As my colleague stated about OSTK in August, it's hard to see any future for the company. Or for that matter, Overstock stock.That said, I'm sure some would choose to speculate on OSTK stock.Is $15 the buy zone? Or should you wait for single digits? It Isn't Worth $15In March, I suggested that speculative investors might be interested in buying OSTK stock below $15. That's because Byrne might sell its hugely unprofitable retail business to focus on its blockchain investments.Of course, we know that never happened under Byrne's watch. But as recently as the end of June, the former CEO is on record suggesting offers were possible.&quot;Two very attractive acquirers that I would have put high up on my list have shown up,&quot; Byrne said June 25 at the Fortune Brainstorm Finance conference in Montauk, New York. &quot;People have seen that our earnings have turned.&quot;How much could Overstock get for a business that saw revenues decrease by 23% in the second quarter while reducing its loss by 62%, from $64.9 million in the second-quarter 2018 to $28.2 million this past quarter?Wayfair's (NYSE:W) gross profit margin in Q2 was 23.9%. It trades at 1.4-times sales. In the latest quarter, Overstock's retail business had a retail gross margin of 19.7%. OSTK trades at 0.4-times sales.Let's assume that its retail business could go for halfway between Wayfair's multiple and its own. That would mean a multiple of 0.9 or $1.47 billion based on trailing 12-month revenue of $1.63 billion.This assumes that the company could find someone to buy its retail operations. Secondly, GARP Research analyst Bill Baker stated in February that he thought Overstock could fetch $100 million for its retail business, a far cry from $1.5 billion. OSTK Stock Below $10 Might Be A BuyLet's assume Overstock could get $100 million for its retail business. At a current market capitalization of $721 million, this suggests the blockchain businesses are worth $621 million or $17.64 a share.Medici and tZero generated tremendous losses in the second quarter from just $6.2 million in revenue. This means that the blockchain assets would have to be worth significantly more than what the balance sheet says they are or as a multiple of sales or earnings.Frankly, I don't think there's a hope in Hades that its blockchain assets are worth anywhere near $18 a share.However, below $10, a speculator might bet on those assets adding up to more than $350 million on a combined basis.With or without Patrick Byrne, I wouldn't go near OSTK stock unless &quot;risk&quot; is your middle name.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- California’s State Assembly has just passed a bill aimed at forcing Uber, Lyft and other so-called gig-economy companies to treat their workers as employees rather than as independent contractors. Uber, for example, has long argued that its drivers weren’t actually employees, labeling them “driver-partners.” But the California Legislature didn’t buy that argument. The new law stipulates that companies can only contract out tasks that are “outside the usual course” of the company’s business, and that contractors must be “free from the control and direction” of the company. Any workers who aren’t contractors must receive benefits, like health insurance and paid time off.Some expect the new law to lay waste to the gig-economy business model. California is a huge, important market — some estimate that the change could cost Uber as much as $500 million a year. And there’s the chance that other states will follow California’s lead. Uber immediately denied that the ruling applied to it, saying that drivers weren’t part of its usual business, but the argument seems unlikely to hold up in court.But the truth is that gig-economy business models weren’t looking very healthy anyway. Although it isn’t unusual for a company to record losses before going public, Uber and Lyft’s losses were unusually large:Uber continues to be a cash-burning machine. In the second quarter of 2019, partly because of costs associated with going public in May, it had a net loss of  $5.2 billion — more than 10 times the highest estimates for what the new California law could cost it. But even in a normal quarter, the company’s losses are on the order of more than a half-billion dollars, and it has never made an operating profit.These huge losses could be justified if the company were expanding rapidly, but although it continues to book more rides, its revenue is barely rising:Lyft is also losing money. Fundamentally, if these companies can’t grow their way out of losses, their business model is doomed, whether their drivers are treated as employees or not. In its IPO prospectus, Uber warned that it may never achieve profitability. New laws like California’s might allow gig-company founders a face-saving way to claim that it was regulation that killed them, not the bleak unit economics of the basic business model. But the truth is that any business that could only stay afloat by giving its workers fewer benefits than Walmart or McDonald’s probably wasn’t long for this world in any case.The importance of California’s new law could go far beyond the gig economy. It could represent the first real attempt to address the rise of contracting and outsourcing in general — what some call the fragmented workplace.The gig economy is a tiny portion of the U.S. labor market. And the number of independent contractors(1) has actually shrunk a bit in recent years. But together with so-called diversified workers, who have a variety of income sources, these contingent workers number in the tens of millions:The rise of contingent-work arrangements isn't some dramatic recent trend, and it might figure in the decline in labor’s share of national income and the failure of compensation to keep pace with productivity.California’s new law could therefore open the door to a more comprehensive attack on inequality and wage stagnation. Forcing companies to do more for contractors could be one part of a strategy to redistribute corporate income toward workers.Even more intriguing is if it marks the first step toward a comprehensive offensive against outsourcing itself. Outsourcing goes way beyond the use of freelancers or independent contractors; companies now regularly contract out many of their business functions. This can make it easier for employers to evade regulations: If one fly-by-night contractor is punished for mistreating its workers and folds, three more equally shady companies may stand ready to take its place.California’s law could signal that state legislatures are more interested in restraining not just the gig economy or the use of independent contractors, but the rise of contracting in general. If so, it may prove much more important than the relatively minor fight over Uber and Lyft drivers.(1) Disclosure: I am one of them.To contact the author of this story: Noah Smith at nsmith150@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-09-12,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the move thanks to an improved trade war outlook after China offered to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products if the U.S. lessened restrictions on Huawei last week. The index, which is comprised of 30 American blue chip stocks, has climbed 3% in the last five days. This has not escaped the Street’s attention, with analysts saying that a few Dow stocks are heating up.“It seems like the tone on trade has gotten better. As long as we don’t have another tweet storm around trade, I think the market can stay in the upper end of this range,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we were able to see how a few of the index’s stocks measure up against each other. We just typed in up to seven tickers and the tool compared each of the stocks based on market cap, PE ratio, analyst consensus and average analyst price target. Based on the results from the comparison, we were able to find 3 Dow stocks that have garnered substantial support from Wall Street with a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. This is based on the last three months’ worth of ratings from all other analysts.    Let’s take a closer look. Visa Inc. Visa Inc. (V– Get Report) has had a tough week, with the payments processor seeing shares plummet almost 6% in the last three days. A few analysts say that the stock market's &quot;sector rotation&quot; as investors rotate out of big winners and into the biggest underperformers ahead of year end was to blame for this dip. That being said, some analysts are telling investors that its core strategy will pay off long-term. Even with the pullback Visa shares have gained 33% year-to-date, with the company standing to reap the benefits as the world goes cashless. According to its July 23 fiscal Q3 2019 earnings release, the company looks solid. Total payments volume, the dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying Visa’s branding, jumped almost 9% year-over-year to reach $2.23 trillion on a constant dollar basis. To further capitalize on the cashless payments movement, the company recently partnered with MoneyGram (MGI) on a peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer option that lets customers in the U.S. send money domestically through the MGI website or app to an eligible debit card. The product, which was unveiled on September 9, starts at $1.99 and enables 24-7 transfers using Visa’s real-time push payment platform, Visa Direct.Adding to the good news, the Foreign Trade Commission (FTC) granted antitrust clearance for Visa’s acquisition of Verifi. The deal will give V access to improved dispute management technology. One top analyst points out that its substantial efforts to expand its business to business (B2B) payments arm are especially exciting, highlighting its July PayMate investment and Rambus acquisition back in June. As a result, Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell reiterated his Buy rating and $199 price target on August 28. The five-star analyst sees potential for 14% upside.All in all, Wall Street agrees with Cantwell. Visa boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus as well as a $202 average price target, indicating 14% upside potential.  McDonald's Corporation With the fast food company already gaining 18% year-to-date, some analysts believe investors should still put McDonald’s Corporation (MCD– Get Report) on their plates.While MCD is known as a burger chain, the company is making a name for itself as a tech company thanks to its significant focus on digitization. These efforts include products to speed up ordering and fulfillment such as self-ordering kiosks in many of its locations. Management noted in its July 26 Q2 earnings release that its global comparable sales growth shows the kiosks are already paying off, as customers tend to order more food or extra side items when compared to traditional ordering.  With its mobile app, diners have the option to choose the time and pickup method. Not to mention the app can be synced with a user’s digital payment wallet. To further strengthen its delivery options, MCD announced its partnership with online food delivery service DoorDash in July. Most exciting though is the fast food giant’s foray into the world of artificial intelligence (AI). The company announced on September 10 that it’s set to acquire voice-based AI startup Apprente in order to improve the drive-thru experience. The startup, which will be housed under the new “McD Tech Labs” unit, will allow MCD to create voice-activated drive-thrus, speeding up the process as well as requiring less staff to operate restaurants. This is on top of its $300 million acquisition of online personalization company Dynamic Yield back in March.While some investors originally expressed concerns over MCD’s discounted pricing, SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett believes the above factors will keep MCD on an upward trajectory. “We think the MCD buy-one-get-one for $1 promotion shows an effort to drive traffic, but also highlights the restaurant chain's focus on franchisee profitability,” he explained. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating and $246 average price target on August 27. The five-star analyst believes shares could gain 17% over the next twelve months.   With 16 Buy ratings vs 5 Holds assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that MCD is a ‘Strong Buy’. Its $231 average price target suggests 9% upside potential.  The Walt Disney CompanyDisney (DIS&#92;- Get Report) has attracted substantial buzz from the Street thanks to its new streaming service, Disney+, with shares already gaining 24% year-to-date. That being said, the house of mouse has seen shares dip 2% in the last three days thanks to Apple’s (AAPL) product update on September 10.Apple announced at its September 2019 Keynote that its new streaming service, Apple TV+, will start at a much lower price point than previously expected. After its November 1 launch, Apple TV+ will be available starting at $4.99 per month. This directly undercuts Disney as its own service will start at $6.99 per month, with the premium bundle running at $12.99 per month. It should be noted that Apple’s streaming service will feature less content than Disney’s.  One top analyst believes that competition from Apple doesn’t change Disney’s strong long-term growth narrative. Credit Suisse’s Douglas Mitchelson conducted a survey of 40 investors in order to measure investor sentiment. The headline results were resoundingly bullish, with 58% now overweight vs 37% pre-Analyst Day in April as the Disney+ launch on November 12 is expected to be a major catalyst. That being said, in order to see significant upside Disney will need a big launch. DIS should also get a boost from its collaboration with Target (TGT) that includes the opening of 25 Disney stores within TGT locations on October 4. Investors have yet another reason to be excited as the company has an ambitious plan to give its Epcot theme park a major upgrade with new interactive elements, show space and new rides based on popular Disney films.Based on all of the above factors, Mitchelson reiterated his Buy rating and $150 price target. The 4.5-star analyst thinks shares could surge 10% over the next twelve months. 10 Buy ratings and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months add up to a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. Its average price target of $158 implies 16% upside potential.

2019-09-17,"Dividend stocks are a well-worn prescription for what ails an investor's upset stomach. Are a cascade of troubling headlines and fears of Wall Street volatility making you nauseous? A regular stream of cash distributions can help smooth out your returns and restore your sanity.But investors also are increasingly targeting a more direct solution to volatility: low-volatility funds. These products are designed to piece together a basket of stocks whose movements aren't as exaggerated as the rest of the market, and they're gaining in popularity. The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV), for instance, had enjoyed nearly $6 billion in net inflows through 2019's midway point. Invesco S&P; 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV), which is roughly a third of the size of USMV, had brought in $2 billion.Fortunately, dividends and low volatility aren't an either/or proposition. You can get both, and DIVCON can help us discover these more stable dividend stocks.The DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares examines the payout health of all dividend stocks among Wall Street's 1,200 largest companies. It does that by poring into metrics including profit growth, free cash flow (how much cash companies have left over after they meet all their obligations) and even the Altman Z-score, which helps assess a company's likelihood of a bond default or bankruptcy. The resulting rating system (a 1-5 scale in which DIVCON 5 indicates the healthiest of payouts and DIVCON 1 indicates dividends at the most risk) provides a measure of a dividend's sustainability and chance of future growth.Here are seven dividend stocks for a little peace of mind. All seven stocks not only boast strong DIVCON 4 ratings, but have exhibited lower volatility and total-return outperformance (that's price plus dividends) versus the S&P; 500 over the past year.

But the real prize will be the fast-food giant’s roughly 14,000 locations in its home market, and that race is still anybody’s game.The restaurant chain said it will sell the new product, featuring a patty crafted exclusively for McDonald’s, at 28 restaurants in Ontario during a three-month trial run.The new sandwich will be assessed to “learn more about real-world implications of serving the P.L.T,” which stands for plant, lettuce and tomato. “During this test, we’re excited to hear what customers love about the P.L.T. to help our global markets better understand what’s best for their customers,” Ann Wahlgren, McDonald’s vice president of global menu strategy, said in a statement.Shares of Beyond Meat surged as much as 16% to $160.60 on Thursday -- the most in more than three monhts. McDonald’s rose 1% to $214.72.U.S. PrizeThe question now is whether a successful Canadian test run could portend a similar tie-up in the U.S., McDonald’s biggest market and the ultimate goal for imitation-meat companies. Rival Burger King has picked the faux-meat market’s other prominent startup, Impossible Foods Inc., for a veggie burger in the U.S. Meanwhile, McDonald’s -- and its massive supply chain -- appears to be taking a more measured approach to choosing a vegan patty brand in the U.S.“McDonald’s is an enormous company, and the U.S. such a big market, that they’re taking their time in deciding which is best for them,” said Alain Oberhuber, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “We have yet to see which brands will do better in retail, and who knows, there may be another big player entering the game. McDonald’s is taking a wait-and-see approach.”A spokeswoman for the company declined to say Thursday whether McDonald’s was close to selecting a supplier for a similar U.S. product.“This test allows us to learn more about real-world implications, including customer demand, customer experience, the restaurant logistics of cooking and serving this product to guests, the supply chain logistics of making this product available, and other important information that may inform future decisions,” spokeswoman Lauren Altmin said in an email.Don Thompson, a former McDonald’s chief executive officer, is an investor in Beyond Meat and has been on its board since 2015.German SupplierMcDonald’s announcement about the Canadian test run comes a day after Nestle SA started shipping a new plant-based burger to U.S. supermarkets. The U.S. fast-food company previously selected Nestle for the launch of a meatless burger in Germany. McDonald’s has also opened vegetarian restaurants in India.“The burger chain used Nestle in Germany, and due to their scale seem like the most likely candidate to supply McDonald’s U.S.,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michael Halen. Nestle declined to comment.McDonald’s will not be advertising the P.L.T. in Canada as vegan, even though the patty is made with plant-based protein. That’s because the standard P.L.T. contains non-vegan ingredients like processed cheddar and mayonnaise-style sauce.“As always, guests can customize and request to hold the cheese and mayo, or any ingredients. However, the patty will be cooked on the same grill as other burgers, meat-based products, and eggs,” Altmin said.The same is true at several rival chains, including Burger King, where employees cook their vegan patties on the same broilers as regular burgers and chicken unless a customer asks for it to be prepared separately.Will Slabaugh, an analyst at Stephens, said he doesn’t expect a “full-blown alternative beef rollout in the U.S. in the near term” because of McDonald’s complex supply chain. An alternative chicken product is more likely in the next two years, he said, something “we would view as more novel and a likely larger sales driver.”(Updates share trading and adds analyst comment in final paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Marthe Fourcade in Paris at mfourcade@bloomberg.net;Corinne Gretler in Zurich at cgretler1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Anne Riley Moffat, Jonathan RoederFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","McDonald’s Picks Beyond for Canada Trial, U.S. Prize Remains"

2019-10-04,"Shares of fast casual Mexican eatery Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) have been on fire ever since February 2018, when the company brought on new CEO Brian Niccol from Taco Bell and began down a recovery path defined by three big growth initiatives: menu innovations, unique marketing, and digital business expansion. These three growth initiatives have paid off in a big way, and since February 2018, Chipotle stock has rattled off a 225% gain as customers have come flying back into stores.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com That's a huge gain. To put it in perspective, the S&P 500 is up less than 10% over that same stretch. But, while management continues to do everything right to secure a healthy long-term growth trajectory for the restaurant chain, investors should be aware that, at current levels, Chipotle stock has large valuation risks.That is, because Chipotle has been so good for so long, investors are expressing abundant optimism with respect to management's ability to continue to drive big growth for a lot longer. This has led to aggressive buying, and has left Chipotle stock with one of the richest valuations in the entire restaurant category.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut here's the problem -- the restaurant industry is tough. It's fickle, as consumers bounce from restaurant to restaurant without much thought or consideration. It's dynamic, as what works in drawing those customers to stores today, may not work tomorrow. And it's fiercely competitive, with hundreds of chains across the U.S. competing for the same consumers.In a tough, fickle, dynamic, and fiercely competitive industry, premium valuations are not warranted. But, Chipotle stock features a premium valuation. Ultimately, that means that at current levels, CMG stock offers investors more risk than reward. Chipotle Stock Is on FireMake no mistake about it. Chipotle is on fire today because management is doing everything right.That is, management is making sure Chipotle stays relevant everywhere. On the food front, Chipotle has wholly embraced vegetarian and paleo options to account for the fact that more consumers than ever are choosing these diets. They are also rolling out multiple new menu options, including carne asada and queso blanco.On the digital front, Chipotle is aggressively expanding its footprint both through its own channels and third-party delivery channels. On the marketing front, Chipotle is running a bunch of on-trend promotions like a TikTok dance challenge during National Avocado Day, Meatless Monday promotions during National Vegetarian Month, and free delivery Sundays in September for the back-to-school season.Big picture: Chipotle is doing everything right to stay fresh and relevant to the consumer. So long as Chipotle continues to execute on this front, sales and profit trends will remain robust. CMG Stock May Not Be On Fire ForeverChipotle won't stay fresh and relevant to the consumer forever. That's just nearly impossible to do in the fickle, dynamic, and fiercely competitive restaurant industry.Consumer tastes and preferences simply change far too often, far too quickly, for anyone to stay on top forever. Arguably, the only restaurant chain that has been able to do this is McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and that's a function of industry-low prices and industry-best convenience (there's a McDonald's seemingly on every street corner).Chipotle isn't the lowest priced player in the QSR world -- they are cheap, but not the cheapest. Nor are they the most convenient -- service is quick, but lack of drive-thrus is a problem from a convenience standpoint. As such, while Chipotle is on fire today thanks to various menu options, digital, and marketing initiatives, those growth initiatives won't power high single-digit comparable sales growth forever. Instead, growth is big right now because Chipotle finds itself on the right side of a few macro consumption trends, such as alternative diets.But, those macro trends will change with time, and Chipotle won't always find itself on the right side of the trend. As such, today's high single-digit comps will slow over time, and such deceleration could spell a problem for CMG stock. Chipotle Stock Isn't Priced For Any CoolingChipotle stock trades at 46.8-times forward earnings. The market average multiple is 16-times forward earnings. The average multiple in the consumer discretionary sector is 21-times forward earnings, and the average restaurant stock multiple is 27-times forward earnings.In other words, at current levels, CMG stock trades at: 1) a 275% premium to the market, 2) a 185% premium to the consumer discretionary sector, and 3) a 120% premium to its restaurant peers. Bulls say this premium is warranted because of Chipotle's bigger profit growth prospects -- adjusted EPS rose nearly 40% last quarter.It is, but to a degree. Aggressively, let's assume Chipotle continues to open about 150 new stores every year, and continues to comp in the mid-single-digit or better range into 2025. That should power consistent about 10% revenue growth. Margins will run higher with positive comps, and buybacks will remain in the mix. So, EPS growth should run north of 20%, paving runway for EPS to hit $45 by 2025.Let's throw a restaurant sector average 27-times forward earnings multiple on that. We arrive at 2024 price target for CMG stock of $1,215. Let's discount that back by 10% per year. We arrive at a 2019 price target of $750.Thus, at $800, Chipotle stock is priced for perfection … and then some. That's a dangerous place to be in the restaurant industry. Bottom Line on CMG StockValuation risks on Chipotle stock will eventually rear their ugly head, and when they do, this stock could find itself in a &quot;look out below&quot; situation, considering just how stretched the valuation is today.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD.

2019-10-08,"There's little question as to what makes the most recession-resistant stocks to buy so resilient. Many of them offer products that Americans simply can't go without, or that are much more attractive when money is tight.What's less certain is when investors will need these companies.The man who predicted the dot-com crash of 2000 and the housing crisis that led to the most recent recession believes the odds of a 2020 recession are less than 50%. &quot;Whether it's coming next year, I can't be sure,&quot; Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller told the Financial News on Sept. 9.However, a National Association for Business Economics survey found that while economists are modelling a 20% chance of recession by mid-2020, they put the odds at 69% by mid-2021. They also widely see GDP growth slowing from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.3% this year, then to just 1.8% in 2020.Some are even more pessimistic. Also in September, Jeffrey Gundlach - CEO and founder of DoubleLine Capital LP, a Los Angeles-based investment firm with $140 billion in assets under management - said he believes there's a 75% chance of a recession before the 2020 presidential election.Here are 15 top recession-resistant stocks to buy if you want to get ahead of the risk. Among the things you should know about recessions: The organization in charge of actually determining whether a recession has occurred typically needs six months to do so. Investors won't know it's happening until it has been underway for quite some time.

2019-10-17,"Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) remains in an expensive technology arms race against McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). It's also in an expensive creativity race with Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR).Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Consumers, however, are reading a different story. They're reading that Yum! unit Taco Bell recalled 2.3 million pounds of seasoned beef over possible contamination. It reminded some of a decade-old battle over whether there was much meat in the tacos at all.People are chuckling over that debate with their lattes this morning. For investors, that story is a classic nothingburger. But if it reminds you of how Yum! has scored a 21% gain so far in 2019, it's going to be tasty.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Tech RaceThis week Yum! spirited away Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Chief Information Officer Clay Johnson, naming him chief digital and chief technology officer.Johnson was recently named CIO of the Year by CIO Dive. He has a reputation for &quot;a maniacal focus on cost&quot; and being &quot;a good coach for his team.&quot; At Yum! he will be working alongside Chief Strategy Officer Gavin Felder. Felder had been chief financial officer for the KFC unit. The duo's charge is to integrate technology across all operations and automate the restaurants.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy It's going to be an uphill climb. Starbucks began the automation trend early in this decade. McDonald's got a shout-out during the recent Democratic debate for getting rid of cashiers.McDonald's has also been increasing its presence in Silicon Valley. It bought Dynamic Yield to automate its drive-thru menus based on weather, traffic and time of day. It is buying Apprente for its voice ordering technology. The company has also bought a piece of Plexure, a mobile app vendor. The Yum! Brands Menu RaceThen there's the menu race. This went into overdrive when Restaurant Brands' Popeyes unit pushed out a chicken sandwich to match that of privately held Chick-fil-A. Restaurant Brands also brought Impossible Foods' burgers to its Burger King units.Yum! has responded with a successful test of faux chicken at a Georgia KFC unit, alongside Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND).The strategy is to move alongside other brands, as in 2012's Doritos Locos Taco at Taco Bell -- Doritos is part of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Now Pizza Hut is rolling out a &quot;Cheez-It&quot; pizza, a calzone made with the Kellogg's (NYSE:K) snack cracker. Via KFC, Yum! Brands is also launching a &quot;Doughnut Sandwich,&quot; a riff on chicken and waffles.This creativity extends to grocery stores, where Taco Bell will soon sell chips made with cheddar cheese. The idea of making cheese into chips has been around a while. (Try making them with mounds of good ground Parmesan, on a silicone mat, in the oven for 6 minutes at 400 degrees). Taco Bell already sells a variety of chips in convenience stores. The new crackers will be a follow-on to its toasted cheddar chalupa, with cheese baked into the taco shell. Buy YUM Stock LaterWith its current gains YUM is selling at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 26.3. The 42 cent per share dividend yields just 1.5%. That's expensive. The one-year price target for analysts is just $120 per share, $8 higher than its Oct. 17 opening price.Adding technology and rolling out new menu items is going to cost money, which is why some analysts think the shares should be avoided. But both tech and menu creativity get a big reward from customers, who have tired of the same old thing. Improving fast food's technology is especially valuable because it locks customers into the brand while lowering overall costs.If you're in your 30s and can wait for a return, then YUM stock should be on your radar, at least as a means of diversification. Put it on your list, wait for your opening and buy a few days after everyone screams &quot;sell.&quot;Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

In September, McDonald's started testing a Beyond Meat plant-based burger in Canada. Mickey D's results come out on Tuesday. </p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Caterpillar - another global economic bellwether is due to report. Not only is it coping with a sluggish global economy - its business is being negatively impacted by the steel and aluminum tariffs slapped on by the Trump administration. Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock heading into the results, citing what it called deterioration in Caterpillar's three key end-markets:  construction, energy and transportation, and resources.</p>
              <p>Fresh off allegations from the Federal Aviation Administration that Boeing employees may have misled about the safety of the now grounded  737MAX before two deadly plane crashes, Boeing reports results. This will also be the first time investors hear from CEO Dennis Muilenberg since he was stripped of his chairman title. </p>
              <p>Rounding out some other key results: Microsoft reports on Wednesday, followed by Amazon on Thursday.</p>
              <p>On the economic front:  Updates on sales of new and previously owned homes. And investors get preliminary manufacturing survey data for October.

Shares slipped.Same-store sales rose 5.9% globally, outpacing estimates for 5.7% growth, according to Consensus Metrix. But the chain is still struggling to pull more customers in its doors in the U.S. In that key market, sales rose 4.8%, below analyst projections and slower than the prior quarter’s roaring growth of 5.7%.Key InsightsMcDonald’s gets more than a third of revenue from the U.S., where it’s been having a hard time luring more diners, especially during the morning hours. And it’s getting more crowded: Burger King is trying to improve its coffee lineup, Dunkin’ is introducing Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches nationwide and Wendy’s Co. is planning to re-enter the morning market with a big push next year.Gains in U.S. comparable sales were driven by advertisements, along with menu price increases -- but customer traffic remains a challenge. That market also saw higher wage and commodity costs from a year earlier in company-owned locations.With competition heating up, Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook has been investing heavily in technology. That includes delivery, making it easier to reorder on the company’s mobile app and adding smart-tech like license-plate scanners to drive-thrus -- conveniences plugged-in Americans are increasingly demanding.Investors would love to know more about the chain’s plant-based ambitions in the U.S., but it hasn’t let slip who it’s considering for its 14,000 locations in that market.

2019-10-30,"The Federal Reserve again lowered by interest rates by 25 basis points today -- the central bank's third rate cut this year -- but as was the case following last month's rate reduction, stocks did a whole lot of nothing following the news.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Fed speak may have been the culprit behind the tepid reaction to the rate cut news by equities today. In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) didn't say anything about acting &quot;as appropriate to sustain the expansion,&quot; which some market participants took to mean that after today's cut, the central bank will be on hold for the foreseeable future.On a related note, there was some good news on the economic data front today with the Commerce Department saying third-quarter GDP grew 1.9%. While that's below the 2% level seen in the second quarter, the initial third-quarter reading is better than the 1.6% economists expected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsImportantly, that data set featured a 2.9% increase in consumer spending, well ahead of the 2.6% economists expected. There are no guarantees, but today's data points augur well for the October jobs report due out Friday.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Struggle to Continue Payout Hikes On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.33% while the S&P 500 added 0.33%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 0.43% with 21 of its 30 components finishing to the upside. Quick UpdateOn Tuesday, I noted that shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were halted late in the session for pending news. The blue-chip pharmaceuticals name rallied 2.78% today, good for one of the best performances in the Dow, after revealing that a test showed no traces of asbestos in its popular baby powder.However, there's more to the story, indicating that investors may want to take the positive JNJ news with a grain of salt. The lab that conducted the test that turned up the no asbestos result is run by an expert witness that receives compensation from JNJ, according to a Reuters report.&quot;Andreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defence against plaintiffs' claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers,&quot; according to Reuters. Pre-Earnings GlanceRemember that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports earnings after the bell today. The stock traded slightly in advance of that report, but there was some good news on the name out today. A Bloomberg article that ran late Tuesday indicates Google's newest smartphone, the Pixel 4, has lost its long-held camera lead to the recently launched iPhone 11.&quot;With the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, Apple closed the photography gap with better low-light image quality,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;Its camera software also makes those photos easier to take by automatically enabling night mode when required. Apple remains way ahead of any other phone maker when it comes to video quality.&quot; November IdeaThe eleventh month of the year starts on Friday and for investors looking for stocks to buy in November, Dow component McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is a name that makes some sense due to its propensity for bullish November performances.Over the past 10 years, McDonald's has averaged a November gain of 3.32% and finished higher in all 10 of those November's.Other November ideas include any of the Dow's industrial names (20% of the index) and perhaps chemicals maker Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) due to favorable seasonality for the industrial and materials sectors in the eleventh month of the year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayOne quick U.S./China trade update: the meeting at which President Donald Trump was scheduled to sign Phase 1 of the trade deal was canceled due to political chaos in Chile, so expect updates on that scenario in the coming days. As for what to expect into year-end for domestic stocks, assuming the trade deal remains on course and data remains solid, a slow slog higher is probably what's in store.&quot;We think 2019 could be similar (to 2016) but acknowledge this time could be riskier simply because the cycle is older and the economy has less slack to offer a buffer,&quot; said BlackRock in a recent note. &quot;Yet we don't see this as the end of the economic expansion―or equity gains. End of cycle is usually marked by spiking commodity prices, wages that are rising too quickly, and the Fed lifting rates to avert economic overheating. None of these are evident today. In fact, it's just the opposite. One potential upshot: A continuation of slow growth and a stock market that can grind higher.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-04,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock benchmarks climbed to all-time highs, while Treasuries tumbled as trade optimism fueled demand for risk assets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed Monday to claim its first record since July. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes also hit new highs after a report that the U.S. and China are closing in on a partial trade deal and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.78% and the dollar advanced versus major peers.In company news, McDonald’s Corp. fell after firing its chief executive and Under Armour Inc. sank after disclosing an accounting probe -- both declines weighing heavily on consumer shares. Banks and industrial firms led the Stoxx Europe 600 Index toward a four-year high after the U.S. commerce secretary said tariffs on importing vehicles into the American market might be unnecessary. All major Asian markets advanced. A gauge of emerging-market stocks was set for its biggest gain in three weeks.Investors are trying to push up stocks for a fifth successive week and add to the 18% gain this year already notched by a global gauge of equities. Earnings continue to roll in around the world, with Uber Technologies Inc. and Marriott International Inc. still due Monday. In China, trade data at the end of this week will give details for October against a backdrop of easing tensions on negotiations with U.S. counterparts.“The earnings season primarily has been so much better than we expected it to be,” JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “Not that it’s an unbelievable earnings season, but it’s been so much above expectations. The rhetoric on tariffs has been mostly positive and we continue to see positive numbers out of particularly employment, but really in general about the economy.”Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross expressed optimism the U.S. would reach a “phase one” trade deal with China this month and said licenses would be coming “very shortly” for American companies to sell components to Huawei Technologies Co.

2019-11-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Steve Easterbrook’s run at the helm of McDonald’s Corp. has come to an abrupt and unceremonious end — but shareholders shouldn’t worry that his departure will leave lasting cracks in the Golden Arches.The fast-food giant said late Sunday that Easterbrook would be leaving the CEO job, which he had held since 2015, after the board of directors found he had violated company policies by having a consensual relationship with an employee. Easterbrook has been replaced by Chris Kempczinski, who had been leading the company’s U.S. business.Investors might have some trepidation about Easterbrook’s departure given all that he accomplished in the job. He oversaw a years-long stretch of sales growth — no small feat when restaurant traffic has generally been sluggish — thanks to initiatives such as an aggressive restaurant remodeling program and the introduction of all-day breakfast. He also was proactive about preparing McDonald’s for a more digital-centric future, including with its partnership with Uber Eats and by acquiring technology company Dynamic Yield.Of course, it’s never a good thing when a company finds itself splashed across homepages because its leader exhibited poor judgment.Nevertheless, shareholders should be reassured that the company’s board made the right decision in a difficult situation, demonstrating that these kinds of violations will not be tolerated at any level. That sets a tone of accountability and fairness for the whole organization that could prove essential in fostering a healthy corporate culture.Given that McDonald’s has recently faced allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination in some of its restaurants, it was an especially important moment for the board to show itself to be responsive. The board also appears to have handled this swiftly and decisively,  voting for Easterbrook’s termination on Friday and announcing new leadership by Sunday.And Kempczinski is a safe and logical choice. He has been a key lieutenant of Easterbrook from his perch running the U.S. business, so he’s familiar with the slate of long-term initiatives the company has in place to keep taking market share. He told the Wall Street Journal in an interview, “There isn’t going to be some radical, strategic shift. The plan is working.”As Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein, points out, the head of the company’s U.S. business has often been considered the heir apparent for the top job at McDonald’s. So this is an instance of the company working from a tested succession playbook — one that should help it move on quickly from an unfortunate episode.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-11-05,"The major U.S. equity benchmarks probed new highs again Tuesday, but after few days of solid upside, there was a listless feel to the action today, broadly speaking.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com On the trade front, China remains insistent that President Trump backed away from tariffs if the two sides are to reach a trade accord of any substance.According to Reuters, &quot;Apart from hopes of a resolution to the trade war, stocks have received a boost from a largely better-than-expected third-quarter earnings season, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut and an upbeat economic data&quot; last week have fueled the recent Wall Street rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose have proven to be important catalysts, but they were mostly absent today. Among members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average still to report earnings, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) does that Wednesday after the close of U.S. markets.For today, the action was fair, not great, but it was enough to lift the Nasdaq Composite by 0.02%, while the S&P 500 inched lower by 0.12%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.11% with 16 of its 30 components higher in late trading. Wow, WalgreensThat is a rare sentiment given that Walgreens Boot Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been one of the worst-performing members of the Dow this year, but for one day at least, that status changed as Walgreens was the Dow Jones' leader today.To be fair, shares of Walgreens are higher by almost 7% over the past week and 12.60% this month, perhaps indicating that someone may have known something. That something being that the company is mulling going private in a transaction that could be worth $55 billion, slightly more than its $50.83 billion market capitalization entering Tuesday. If Walgreens does that, it would mark the largest leveraged buyout on record.  * 10 Stocks to Buy Regardless of Q3 Earnings &quot;In recent months, Walgreens has held preliminary discussions with some of the world's largest private equity firms about putting together what would be the biggest ever leveraged buyout, the sources said,&quot; according to Reuters. Repeat AppearancesAs noted earlier, some familiar names commanded plenty of headlines among Dow Jones stocks today. Let's start with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which regained some of the ground lost Monday in the wake of now former CEO Steve Easterbrook's departure.One interesting item out today pertained to Chris Kempczinski, who is replacing Easterbrook. That report noted that the new CEO isn't yet an actual shareholder in the world's largest fast food chain, though that's likely to change sometime very soon.McDonald's shares performed well under Easterbrook, prompting Wall Street to speculate if the good times can continue with Kempczinski running the show. The new CEO faces some obvious challenges.&quot;Appearances aside, the new McDonald's chief faces an uphill climb. Same-store sales growth is decelerating. Earnings estimates have been revised lower,&quot; according to Barron's.Regarding the other repeat appearance here, that's Boeing (NYSE:BA), which gained 2.24% today, ranking as one of the Dow's top performers.In terms of Boeing headlines today, the bag was undoubtedly mixed. In an interview with CNBC, Chairman Dave Calhoun praised CEO Dennis Muilenburg for his performance during the 737 MAX controversy, one that could linger for longer than investors would like.While Muilenburg is likely to forego compensation bonuses this year, that's not much compensation for investors that were hoping the 737 MAX could be in the skies before the end of 2019 or early 2020. The timeline for that happening could stretch into 2021, said Calhoun. Tuning InKeeping with the theme of familiarity, let's not forget that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its streaming service, Apple +, this month. It's still early, but reviews of some of Apple's original content and Apple+ itself thus far have been tepid, but analysts still believe in streaming as a potential catalyst for the already hot stock.&quot;We don't see the present content slate as worth $5/month in comparison to more robust, built-out content libraries of competitors, but such competition does not matter much, in our view, when upwards of 100 million-pluis iOS users (if the present free for a year promotion sustains into 2020) will have access to TV+ content free of charge for a year,&quot; said Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong in a note to clients. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWith third-quarter earnings season winding down, it may be instructive to look at what the fourth quarter may have in store.  * 7 Under-the-Radar Retail Stocks to Buy Now &quot;Expectations for earnings growth for Q4 2019 have been falling over the past few months. On June 30, the estimated earnings growth rate for Q4 2019 was 5.6%. By September 30, the estimated earnings growth rate had fallen to 2.4%. As of November 1, the earnings decline stood at -0.4%,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;Five of the 11 sectors are now projected to report a year-over-year decrease in earnings for the fourth quarter, led by the Energy (-29.7%) and Consumer Discretionary (-10.3%) sectors.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-05,"(Bloomberg) -- McDonald’s Corp. fired Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook because he had a consensual relationship with an employee, losing the strategist who led the company’s charge into online ordering and delivery.The burger chain’s board voted Friday to terminate Easterbrook, 52, after investigating the relationship, which violated company policy, according to a statement Sunday. McDonald’s policy doesn’t allow the CEO to have a relationship with anyone in the company. Chris Kempczinski, who runs U.S. operations, was promoted to president and CEO.“This was a mistake,” Easterbrook said of his actions in an email sent to employees. “Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.”Easterbrook resigned as director from the board of Walmart Inc., the retailer said in a Nov. 4 filing adding that the decision to leave was not due to any disagreement over its policies or practices.McDonald’s shares fell as much as 2.9% in New York Monday, hitting its lowest point since April. The stock had almost doubled since Easterbrook took over in March 2015, more than twice the gain in the S&P 500 Index, giving the company a market capitalization of $147 billion.Easterbrook was seen as relentless in his push to capture a new generation of customers who would be willing to order through smartphone apps, pay online, and choose to have food delivered to home or work instead of venturing into outlets. To stress urgency, he tied executives’ compensation to the speed and breadth of the delivery rollout, and worked with vendors including UberEats.His strategies are paying off: Same-store sales, a key metric of success, recovered with the arrival of all-day breakfast, and he axed poorly selling items and added new ones while creating lower priced value menus to draw in diners.Strong Argument“You can make a very strong argument that Easterbrook was the best CEO in the restaurant industry,” said Michael Halen, who covers the sector for Bloomberg Intelligence.He is eligible for 26 weeks of severance pay -- equal to about $675,000 based on his annual salary of $1.35 million -- and 18 months of health benefits, according to filings on Monday. He also signed nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and will keep some options and equity awards. Kempczinski, meanwhile, will receive a base salary of $1.25 million with an target annual bonus of 170% that amount.Will Slabaugh, an analyst with Stephens Inc. said Easterbrook’s departure will likely “come as a fairly significant negative for investors, given his history of impressive and consistent global results,” including turning around the core U.S. business and driving stock gains.However, he cited Kempczinski’s established relationship with franchisees and past involvement in strategy and development as a positive for the incoming leader.Higher ExpensesHis relationship with restaurant owners will be crucial, because Easterbrook’s changes caused some franchisees to chafe at the expenses being pushed down from the corporate headquarters in Chicago.McDonald’s independent group of franchisees, the National Owners Association, didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. Store owners are scheduling a private conference call to discuss how to respond and protect the brand, according to a person familiar with their plan who asked not to be identified.“Large public companies are less likely to tolerate such behavior because of reputational risk concerns,” said Yuen Teen Mak, a professor at NUS Business School in Singapore wrote in an email. “The nature of the business may also be a factor -- after all, their target customers are families and children.”Regardless of Easterbrook’s successes, the company’s board had little room for error in how it handled the British executive’s transgression at a time when even consensual relationships draw scrutiny -- and especially when there’s an imbalance of power. In May, the company revamped its harassment policy after coming under pressure from employees, labor advocates and members of Congress.In a letter responding to an inquiry from U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth, from the chain’s home state of Illinois, Easterbrook said the company has improved its policy and is committed “to ensuring a harassment and bias-free workplace.”“In the current MeToo climate, it will be even more difficult for corporations to retain a CEO in such situations,” said NUS’ Mak. “It is absolutely the right thing for McDonald’s to do and to do it swiftly.”For the first time in 19 years, more CEOs were dismissed for ethical lapses than for financial performance or board struggles in 2018, according to a study by one of the PriceWaterhouseCooper’s units that analyzed CEO turnovers in the world’s 2,500 largest companies.Must ForfeitExecutives who depart after violating company policy typically don’t get to collect severance and must forfeit any unvested long-term compensation. Easterbrook held unvested shares and stock options worth roughly $31.3 million as of Friday’s close in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Easterbrook is divorced, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.​At the time, the American Civil Liberties Union and the union-backed Fight For $15 just announced a handful of new lawsuits and 20 complaints to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. They accused the company of failing to prevent misconduct including groping and inappropriate comments from supervisors, as well as retaliation for speaking up.With Easterbrook now out of the picture, it’s left to Kempczinski to continue the push into delivery and electronic ordering. He joined McDonald’s in 2015 to oversee global strategy, business development and innovation. He most recently served as president of the U.S. business and, like Easterbrook, was deeply involved in the drive to expand online delivery.‘Important Partner’“Chris has been an important partner to me over the last four years and is the ideal person to take on the role of CEO,” Easterbrook said in his departure note. Joe Erlinger, who joined the company in 2002, will become president of the U.S. business. He will receive $775,000 in base salary with a target annual bonus set at 100% of that amount.Kempczinski, who helped implement many of the recent changes as head of U.S. operations, will maintain his predecessor’s focus on technology and believes the company’s investments will pay off, according to an interview with the Wall Street Journal.“There isn’t going to be some radical, strategic shift. The plan is working,” the new CEO told the Journal, adding that he wants to discuss any concerns with franchisees.Kempczinski, who’s also joining McDonald’s board, is taking over a behemoth chain, with more than 38,000 locations in 100 countries, including 14,000 in the U.S.He’ll have to contend with stagnant customer traffic across the restaurant industry. Growth has been fueled in recent quarters by higher prices, but chains have struggled to bring in larger volumes of diners. Competition has intensified as consumers eat out less and buy more prepared foods from grocery stores.In recent quarters, McDonald’s has been one of the industry’s best performers, with same-store sales rising 5.9% globally in the latest quarter, more than analysts had projected.Comfortable FootingIt hasn’t been quite as easy in its home market, where heavy discounting by rivals and more competition at breakfast has made it harder to get customers in its doors, resulting in a slowdown in customer traffic last quarter. But those who do come in are spending more and more, keeping the company on comfortable footing.The company has sought to renovate its image by remodeling its locations -- but franchisees have complained about the high costs associated with changes like building a wall to hide the kitchen operations behind the cash registers. In 2018, it slowed the pace of remodels, letting operators complete them by 2022 instead of the initial goal of 2020.The improvements have also included self-ordering kiosks and even extra drive-thru lanes in some locations.While the company’s fundamentals are solid, the CEO change could presage additional disruption, Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan said in a note.“Our experience leads us to take a more cautionary view, noting the potential lack of momentum and time involved in formalizing a new team,” she said.(Updates with details on Easterbrook’s resignation from the board of Walmart in the fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Hailey Waller, Anders Melin, Ari Altstedter and Lisa Wolfson.To contact the reporters on this story: Matthew G.

2019-11-06,"(Bloomberg) -- When I first met Silicon Valley lawyer David Estrada in 2014, he was an executive at Lyft Inc. who was tussling with New York City regulators. Lyft wanted to allow its drivers to ferry passengers around the city without special licenses. He lost that battle but won the war, helping to persuade dozens of states and countries to change their laws and usher in the age of ride-hailing.It turns out that Estrada’s two years at Lyft were just one part of a 15-year slalom through some of Silicon Valley’s most disruptive companies. He had previously worked at Google X, crafting the first autonomous vehicle legislation in states like California, Florida and Nevada. After Lyft, he moved to Kitty Hawk, Larry Page’s secretive flying car company, and then became the head of legal and policy at Bird Rides Inc., nudging more than 100 U.S. cities and several countries to accept (though not necessarily embrace) street-side electric scooter rentals.Now Estrada is taking on a new role at Nuro Inc., a Mountain View, California-based self-driving car startup founded by two of his former Google colleagues and backed by nearly $1 billion from SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund. Nuro envisions autonomous cars not only without drivers but without passengers, either. Its goal is to create lightweight vehicles designed for delivering packages, groceries and meals to people’s homes.“My hope is that I can help Nuro achieve the first commercial success with autonomous vehicles, which is really what I set out to do when I started on this path back at Google,” says Estrada, who must first convince regulators and citizens who will likely be skeptical of another wave of Silicon Valley-style disruption in their communities.Nuro completed a pilot program to deliver groceries this year in Scottsdale, Arizona. Next year in Houston, it plans to start delivering food from Kroger Co. and Domino’s Pizza Inc. via an upgraded electric vehicle prototype that can travel up to 25 miles per hour.Estrada will eventually have to navigate a tangle of state and federal authorities. States license individual drivers and oversee their roads and highways, while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates federal motor vehicle safety standards. The Feds must be convinced to accommodate an entirely new class of self-driving delivery vehicles that theoretically don’t need steering wheels, seats, seat belts, windshield wipers or rear-view mirrors. Nuro’s application for an exemption from safety standards for its vehicles is pending.Estrada plays up the safety of Nuro cars, which are designed to tolerate damage to its cargo in collisions (what’s a few broken eggs in a crash?) while minimizing the impact to other vehicles, pedestrians and pets.He’ll face other concerns as well. In addition to further congesting already clogged city streets, driverless delivery vehicles threaten to put more than 400,000 delivery drivers in the U.S. out of business.Estrada argues that Nuro cars won’t supplant existing delivery people but expand the overall market while creating more jobs inside supermarkets and restaurants and lowering the cost of home delivery services like DoorDash and UberEats. Of course, he’ll have to deliver that message at a time when Amazon.com Inc. is trying to eliminate cashier jobs with its Go store, and chains like McDonald’s Corp. are working on automating functions like the drive-through.Which is why Silicon Valley companies pay him the big bucks. Nuro co-founder and President Dave Ferguson acknowledges the formidable regulatory and PR challenges and says he hopes Estrada can “push us over the finish line.”This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology’s Fully Charged newsletter.

2019-11-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Steve Easterbook, the now-former CEO of McDonalds, will retain his role as a visiting fellow at the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation, reports Business Insider. At first blush this may seem deliciously ironic — a corporate titan, fired for having a relationship with a subordinate, giving lectures on PR! But I’d be more interested in hearing what he has to say now than I would have been before his ouster.Think about it. Who better to give lectures on corporate reputation than someone who has stumbled? Too many of these lectures are full of pious platitudes from people with squeaky-clean pasts. It’s like a nun giving a lecture on sex education. (No offense to nuns.) It would be more educational to hear from someone who has faced the public spotlight’s unforgiving glare, someone who has made mistakes and lived to learn from them.Moreover, while the McDonald’s board was right to show Easterbrook the door for violating company policy — which unambiguously forbids leaders from having romantic relationships with subordinates, whether they’re direct reports or not — there’s been no indication that this relationship was otherwise improper. A single man having a consensual relationship is not the kind of thing that should get one blacklisted from every corporate board or side project, even if it did violate the organization’s rules.But it’s very easy for confounding factors to cloud this particular case. First, there are our still-raw feelings over MeToo.For corporate America, MeToo provided catharsis. For too long, too many women had been belittled, intimidated and violated. Too many powerful men had been protected, often at great cost to their firms. Too many good guys were oblivious to what was happening.MeToo is also what social scientists call a “norms cascade” (a useful phrase I learned from law professor Joan Williams). What used to be OK suddenly isn’t anymore, and now no one knows how to act. It’s natural, after a norms cascade, to question which behaviors should be jettisoned and which are still acceptable. So it’s healthy to take stock of things like consensual work relationships with power differentials, which can be tricky to navigate even in the best cases.But we can’t forget that MeToo was about harassment, not sex. It might seem that a great way to eliminate harassment would be to ban sex, but they’re two different things. And given that about a third of people have dated a coworker — and about one in three of them ended up getting married — I hope no overzealous compliance officer tries anything as silly as banning workplace romances entirely. Finding love is hard enough already.The second confounding factor in Easterbrook’s case is executive compensation. In an era of well-publicized income inequality, lots of us have capital-F Feelings about CEO pay. Much has been made of Easterbook’s $42 million going-away gift from McDonalds, a company where burger-flippers can earn less than $10 an hour.According to the Economic Policy Institute, CEO compensation is up almost a thousand percent since 1978, while worker pay has risen only 12%. CEOs today earn more than 200 times what the typical schmo earns — even as recently as 1989, they made only 58 times as much.It makes sense that the rest of us might feel a certain schadenfreude when CEOs stumble. After all, sanctimony is one of life’s free pleasures. It also seems reasonable to hold chief executives to a relatively high standard of behavior, perhaps one that’s approximately 58 times higher than what goes for the rest of us.Even so, for Easterbrook, losing such a high-profile job is surely punishment enough. Let the man keep his Oxford lecturing side-hustle. He probably has more insight to share now than he did a couple of weeks ago.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Green Carmichael at sgreencarmic@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mary Duenwald at mduenwald@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Green Carmichael is an editor with Bloomberg Opinion.

2019-11-08,"Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock is down over 60% from July. After its initial public offering (IPO) on May 2, BNYB stock price exploded to a peak of $234.90. Even with the steep plunge, BNYD stock is still up over 20% from its May 2 closing price.Source: Shutterstock But the party may be ending for the plant-based meat substitute producer. BYND was one of the last of the so-called unicorn stocks to fog investors' mirrors. Even though it has yet to show a profit, BYND stock price climbed over 700% from its initial IPO price of $25.Some of this was based on the altruistic reasons that some consumers have for reducing or eliminating meat from their diet. But emotion only takes a stock so far, and the problem for BYND stock is that as more facts are coming out about the product and consumer acceptance (or lack thereof), the stock may have further to fall.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Excess Optimism Might Hurt Beyond Meat StockA recent poll commissioned by Herbalife Nutrition found that 71% of the 2,000 respondents polled were open to including more plant-based foods in their diet. In addition, 53% said meat did not play a very large role in their diet. A key finding was that 16% of those surveyed said they didn't eat &quot;meatless meat&quot;. However, when presented with additional facts, many conceded they were not aware &quot;meatless meat&quot; was not made in a lab.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Before They Roll Over Undoubtedly statistics like this helped propel Beyond Meat's stock to stratospheric levels. And Beyond Meat looked to be building its brand with new product offerings and expanding margins that would, theoretically, lift the company into the black.However, all of that was based on the company continuing to grow its 2.1% market share. That looks to be in doubt. Is Beyond Meat a Healthier Alternative?In a recent op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Rick Berman wrote in detail why plant-based meat was not any healthier than meat itself. The article points out that unlike the trend toward &quot;clean food&quot; which has no additives, plant-based meat is going in the opposite direction. And as consumers figure that out, they may turn away from BYND products.It appears that may already be starting. Berman writes that BYND's touted partnership with Tim Hortons is falling apart. The chain has pulled BYND products from all Canadian stores outside of British Columbia and Ontario. Del Taco (NASDAQ:TACO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) are also reporting disappointing sales numbers.As I see it, this is touching on a fundamental problem for Beyond Meat. If they are going to grow their market share, they will need to draw in more than vegans and vegetarians. This presents two concerns.First, this represents a very narrow section of the population.  According to a 2018 Gallup poll of 1,000 U.S. adults, only 5% identified themselves as vegetarian and only 3% identified as vegan. Gallup has been conducting this poll since 1999 and the percentages have stayed stable.Second, it's dangerous to assume why a vegetarian or vegan is choosing that lifestyle. Finding a plant-based burger substitute that &quot;tastes like a burger&quot; may not be their issue. And, as Berman wrote, a Beyond Meat burger may not be a very healthy alternative anyway. Will Traditional Meat Eaters Give BYND a Shot?So that means Beyond Meat needs to convert traditional meat-eaters to give its product a shot on an occasional basis. Here again I see a problem.If I want a burger, I want a burger. And if I don't want a burger, even if that's for altruistic reasons, I can choose a range of other foods - none of which are a burger. In fact, I can choose a vegetarian or vegan entree. It's that simple. There are a lot of choices. The Bottom Line on BYND StockIf it sounds like I'm down on BYND stock, it's because I am. When I look at the product, I see the company doesn't have a proprietary formula. When I look at the market, I see competition that is growing by the day.Beyond Meat does not have a moat to protect its business model. What it has is emotion. And investors all too often buy on emotion. But when investors buy on emotion, they will, at some point, need to justify with facts.The facts right now are that consumers can find different options to signal their objection to meat. And as more information about &quot;how the sausage is made&quot; is released, consumers will begin to realize that a Beyond Meat burger may be good for the environment, but not good for their health.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Let's take a look at what exactly is happening off and on the SHAK stock price chart to allow for a stronger risk-adjusted determination.Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com This week's been marked by some ugly sessions for SHAK stock. In a nutshell, mixed quarterly results and a side order of costly 'customer experience' store upgrades and temporary closures next year had Wall Street heading for the exits. But was Shake Shack stock's single-largest price shellacking of 21% deserved?By the numbers, the burger chain delivered a 10-cent profit topper on earnings of 31 cents per share of SHAK stock. The significant 47% bottom-line beat also came in well-above last year's Q3 EPS of 17 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe sales picture came in a bit more mixed. Revenue of $157.8 million did eke out a beat of consensus views pegged at $156.9 million. And sales compared to 2018's rake of $119.6 million certainly looked smart. But that's not the entire story.Investors selling and an analyst community, by and large, trimming price targets on SHAK stock appear to have been motivated by a couple other troubling factors and trends.  * 7 Earnings Losers That Were Hit Hard This Season Same-store-sales rose 2%, but failed to meet Street forecasts of 2.7%. Some analysts taking their cue from management's prior quarterly release blamed the miss on &quot;volatility&quot; tied to making Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) Shake Shack's exclusive delivery service. Further, unit-level margin of 23.1% also came up short of analyst views of 24.3%.Lastly, with management trimming its same-store sales full-year outlook from 2% to 1.5% and bumping its revenue guidance but still falling short of analyst views of $600 million by roughly 0.08%, investors had enough ingredients to place an order for near-term pain over long-term promise. SHAK Stock Price Monthly ChartIf misery loves company SHAK stock investors are far from alone this earnings season. In fact burger giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock and GRUB shares have also both taken it on the chin following their quarterly confessionals. More important, is Shake Shack now in position for investors to buy stronger value on the price chart? I don't believe SHAK stock price is there yet.  * 7 Under-the-Radar Retail Stocks to Buy Now Looking at the monthly price chart, shares of SHAK have broken their 50% Fibonacci retracement level and roughly 6% from challenging the 62% line. Zone testing like this can and often does lead to bottoms with requiring a picture perfect touch of support. But in this case that's unlikely to happen.With SHAK's stochastics rolling over from an overbought condition -- and monthly Bollinger Band failing to back up a buy decision inside the zone -- there's a certain lack of evidence promoting a low in shares is nearby. My interpretation is Shake Shack stock could easily makes its way toward $50.Bottom line seems that the $50 area is where the 76% level, an angular support line and an appealing whole number come into play. There's also the possibility a rising, but currently removed from the action lower Bollinger Band could act as an additional support. Net, net there's still plenty of time and dollars to go before the proverbial dinner bell will be ringing loudly for SHAK bulls to take notice.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-11-14,"[Editor's note: &quot;The 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable Returns&quot; was previously published in October 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]One of the most popular investment strategies is to focus on fast-charging growth companies. The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adage cash is king. The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call &quot;cash cows.&quot;While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a business' lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. That's why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnother reason to look at a company's money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options. They can choose to put money to work through key investments, or to expand operations.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 And if the worst happens, and the underlying industry hits a recession, cash cows can better weather the storm. Because of this dynamic, you'll want to at least peek at the cash flow statement for your target investments.Below are the eight best cash cow stocks to buy now: McDonald's (MCD)I'm going to make a confession straight off the bat. I don't understand why people eat at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), particularly those who do so regularly. Admittedly, they make great coffee and their French fries are to die for, but the rest of it? Not quite so appetizing.Source: Shutterstock Nevertheless, I don't need to understand a phenomenon to recognize that it's working. Moreover, those who are looking primarily for reliable stocks to invest in should seriously consider MCD stock.Last year, the iconic fast-food company generated net income of nearly $6 billion. In its most recent reported quarter, MCD produced earnings per share of $1.99, in-line with analysts' average estimate.Additionally, McDonald's enjoys consistent FCF every year, offering invaluable confidence in a rising, but unpredictable market. Plus, MCD pays out a 2.57% dividend yield, which management should have no problems sustaining. Aflac (AFL)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com We often say that there are two guarantees in life: death and taxes. In reality, we should add a third, which is random events that conspire to ruin your day. Whether it's a massive accident or a debilitating illness, stuff happens.When it does, Aflac's (NYSE:AFL) insurance products can help you or your family recover financially.It's amazing how much a relatively common occurrence, such as a broken leg, can add up to serious out-of-pocket expenses. Just for the consistent demand, AFL should be on most people's list of stocks to buy. And as you might expect, Aflac enjoys robust cash flows from operations.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 AFL is one of those conservative stocks to buy that have performed well in the markets. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up 11%. Better yet, Aflac pays out a 2.1% dividend yield. Steady growth and passive income? AFL is too good to ignore. Paychex (PAYX)Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com If you're asked to come down to the human resources department, chances are, it's for unpleasant reasons. Nevertheless, HR plays a crucial role as it deals directly with a company's most valuable asset: people. You can never go wrong with experts in this field, which is why Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a consistent winner.But another factor boosting PAYX is their product flexibility. Despite their big-name brand, they offer scaled solutions for virtually any organization. From tiny businesses with a lone employee to major, multinational firms, PAYX can tailor-fit an effective, efficient platform. That will come in handy over the next few years as new businesses focus on agility rather than brute size.As you might expect, Paychex features a healthy balance between growth and cash flows; PAYX is up 28% so far this year. Activision Blizzard (ATVI)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com The video game sector offers some of the best stocks to invest in. Thanks to gaming culture and tournaments going mainstream, this is an industry that will perpetually rise higher. Over the longer-term, this presents a viable tailwind for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).Admittedly, though, the ride in ATVI hasn't been an easy one. While its YTD performance is pretty much flat, shares have gyrated severely multiple times.Investors have an understandable concern that they're buying into ATVI near at or near its highs. Moreover, Activision has suffered significant competition; namely, Epic Games' &quot;Fortnite.&quot;Still, I'm not worried. In terms of first-person shooting games, ATVI is still the king. Its &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series is legitimately a cash cow. Furthermore, Activision's financials have consistently demonstrated rising cash flow from operations. That might take a hit this year due to the competitive environment.  * 7 Great High-Yield Stocks With Payouts Over 5% However, don't count out ATVI. Not only can Activision leverage its own strengths in shooter games, &quot;Fortnite&quot; mania may be peaking. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Out of all the cash cow stocks to buy, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands alone. One of the chief reasons why is due to the company's prevalence across multiple lucrative markets. From laptops to cloud computing to driverless-vehicle technology, GOOG disrupts any sector it wishes.But the biggest reason I like Alphabet is that it dominates the internet. I realize that it's a tired argument because everybody has mentioned it. That doesn't mean, though, that the argument is any less valid.For instance, we all know that Google is the most popular search engine, but the gap between first place and second-ranked Bing is a whopping 66%!Moreover, Google is the unquestioned leader of mobile and tablet search engines with a 93% market share. In order to get anything done online, you essentially must go through Alphabet. And if your company doesn't rank well on Google, you're dead in the water. Philip Morris International (PM)Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com On the surface, it appears big tobacco firms like Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) face a double-whammy.First, Americans are smoking cigarettes at a significantly reduced rate. Also, the under-18 crowd isn't taking up the habit like prior generations had. Second, the vaping market has exploded in popularity thanks to its cleaner platform.I don't think it's over for Philip Morris. For one thing, several markets, including the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, have witnessed a lift in smoking rates. That, of course, suits PM perfectly, which is the international arm of the iconic tobacco firm. PM stock has rebounded this year. On a YTD basis, shares have jumped 25%.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth Best of all, Philip Morris is a cash-rich organization. That provides substantial confidence in the company's generous 6.1% dividend yield. Gilead Sciences (GILD)Source: Shutterstock Thanks to an unpredictable political environment and an extremely competitive atmosphere, several pharmaceuticals have underperformed this year. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is no exception, with GILD shares having fallen 1.6% YTD under choppy conditions.But in the long run, I don't expect this pressured situation to continue. Earlier this year, Gilead announced positive results from a late-stage clinical trial of a rheumatoid arthritis drug.Additionally, management is looking forward to developing iterations of its HIV drug, Biktarvy. GILD could develop an injectable version of Biktarvy for patients who are resistant to the drug.If nothing else, GILD belongs on your list of stocks to buy thanks to its cash position. Even under a challenging environment, Gilead managed nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow last year. The company is more than stable enough to continue supporting its dividend yield, which currently stands at 4%. BCE (BCE)Source: Shutterstock As Canada's biggest communications firm, BCE (NYSE:BCE) essentially has a moat. In this day and age, no one can survive without internet access.As such, BCE leverages extensive broadband and wireless networks that have a value north of $4 billion. The company's broadband footprint extends out to 9.2 million locations, and it offers LTE wireless coverage for almost every Canadian.These impressive stats finally have started to translate into market success. So far this year, BCE shares are up 21.5%.Shares have grown slowly and steadily since the beginning of the year, suggesting the worst of the volatility is behind it. Second, BCE's revenues have steadily increased over the past three years, and we're on pace for a fourth. Finally, BCE offers a generous 5% dividend yield, which the company can support.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Before They Roll Over Last year, the telecom firm had $5.8 billion in operating cash flow, and $2.6 billion FCF. Unless Canadians suddenly stop using the internet, you can trust BCE.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The big returns come over time, from regular dividend increases, which lift the yield an investor receives on his or her original cost basis.But while these dividend-hiking stalwarts usually aren't known for their hot growth prospects, a few are indeed poised to outperform in 2020.To find price upside among dependable dividend stocks, we started with the Dividend Aristocrats. For the uninitiated, the Aristocrats are an index of 57 S&P; 500 companies currently that have raised their payouts annually for at least 25 years.Next, we calculated the implied upside for all 57 Aristocrats based on analysts' average price targets. A price target is the level at which analysts forecast a stock will trade at some point in the future, typically 12 months out.After running the numbers, we were left with 10 Dividend Aristocrats that offered projected upside of at least 10% in the year ahead.

2019-11-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If the U.S. is going to make a big dent in income inequality and raise living standards for the middle class, it’s going to need a multipronged approach. Higher taxes and more spending on health care will help. Minimum-wage laws can raise pay for workers at the bottom without reducing employment much, but they only benefit a relatively small slice of the workforce. But something else is needed.One big idea is to bring back unions and collective bargaining. Several teams of economists have examined the historical record and concluded that unions were important in reducing inequality. But although unions are still important in the public sector, in the private sector they’ve been almost wiped out.People argue about the cause of the decline. Some blame weak enforcement of labor laws or the rise of state right-to-work laws. Others blame global competition and technology. But Martin Manley, an entrepreneur who previously served as assistant secretary of the Labor Department under President Bill Clinton, thinks he has the answer. In a new book titled “A Better Bargain: Organizing Employers and Workers to Grow America’s Middle Class,” Manley argues that the U.S. union system was doomed from the start.Before 1935, Manley notes, there were several types of collective bargaining in the U.S. But the one that ended up being enshrined in law, in the National Labor Relations Act, was called enterprise bargaining. Under that law, workers at each workplace have to vote to unionize; if they do, all workers at that workplace are covered by the union contract. If they reject the union down, however, there’s no collective bargaining.This system has a huge downside: competition. Suppose the workers at a McDonald’s want to form a union. The managers know that if the workers unionize, wages will go up and prices for hamburgers at that McDonald’s will rise. That will put the restaurant at a competitive disadvantage versus the non-unionized Burger King down the street, eventually resulting in layoffs. The managers will make this argument to the workers, who probably will find it convincing.If both the McDonald’s and the Burger King could coordinate and unionize together, competition would be no problem; wages would rise and the profits of the two giant corporations might fall while consumers paid higher prices for burgers. But because U.S. labor law forces each workplace to act independently on unionization, they can’t effectively coordinate. The situation is even worse for companies such as General Motors that face international competition because there’s no way for GM workers to coordinate with Volkswagen workers in Europe or Toyota workers in Asia.Manley has a two-pronged solution to this problem. Both pieces would require a major rewrite of U.S. labor law. And both would involve a shift from enterprise-level bargaining to sectoral bargaining, with negotiations taking place in an entire industry, not individual workplaces or companies.The first piece is industry associations — groups of companies in the same industry and region that bargain collectively with their workers all at once. Though it might seem counterintuitive to let employers collaborate like this, it would remove the competitive threat that unions represent, because the resulting agreements would constrain all businesses equally. Manley suggests that industry associations could also collaborate to create more efficient and flexible labor markets by providing worker training, sharing knowledge about workers across company lines and so on.Second, Manley would make unions nonexclusive. Under his preferred system, an industry association would bargain simultaneously with all the organizations that workers in that industry belonged to, be they unions, worker co-ops, professional associations or advocacy groups. The various worker groups would be awarded representation at the negotiating table proportional to their membership (which could overlap). Manley envisions various worker groups competing with each other for members by offering services other than wage bargaining.These are good ideas. To really be effective, they’ll require one crucial element: that workers who don’t belong to any organization are all covered by the contracts that result from sector-level labor negotiations. A law like this is the reason that the French and German workforces are still mostly covered by collective bargaining, despite falling unionization:If combined with Manley’s idea for competing labor organizations and proportional representation in negotiations, sectoral bargaining would undo the decades-long decline in private-sector collective bargaining almost overnight. It wouldn’t require unions to rebuild their membership; all it would need is a few worker organizations to pop up and start bargaining on behalf of everyone. At first, these early movers would get almost all the seats at the negotiating table, which would induce other workers to form other organizations to get a piece of the action.Presidential candidates such as Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren have backed sectoral bargaining, showing that the idea is catching on. Innovative ideas like Manley’s could allow sectoral bargaining to take root even faster and to be carried out in a way that many employers would embrace. Ultimately, a more cooperative relationship between workers and management would result in a more sustainable system for supporting the middle class.To contact the author of this story: Noah Smith at nsmith150@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-12-05,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Mark Wiseman, who was seen by many as a likely heir to BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, is now out of a job. The details we have are scant. In a memo, Wiseman explained: “I am leaving BlackRock because in recent months I engaged in a consensual relationship with one of our colleagues without reporting it as required by BlackRock’s Relationships at Work Policy.”An additional wrinkle: This consensual relationship was also an extramarital affair. Wiseman is married to Marcia Moffat, head of BlackRock’s Canadian division.Coming on the heels of Steve Easterbrook’s ouster as CEO of McDonald’s Corp. for a consensual relationship with an employee, comparisons are bound to be made. But the two cases are different, and while a line back to the MeToo movement will inevitably be drawn, let’s be clear: Neither of these cases involve allegations of sexual harassment or assault.Both cases are about violating company policy – BlackRock’s rule that relationships must be disclosed, and the McDonald’s rule that no boss can date a subordinate, direct or indirect. Companies can’t let senior leaders get away with violating the rules they’re asking their employees to follow.The question we should be asking, then, is not whether workplace relationships are wrong, but whether HR edicts seeking to control them are a good idea.Such policies seem to have sprung up like mushrooms after the spring rain of MeToo. The problem is that that they seek to do away with the “harassment” part of sexual harassment by controlling the “sexual” part. That’s wrongheaded.In fact, the whole post-MeToo conversation has focused a little too much on sex. (I suppose it’s natural; we’re only human.) In the aftermath of that movement, I fielded somewhat panicked questions from men about whether it was OK to ask a cute co-worker out for coffee or compliment a colleague’s outfit. Such innocent overtures were never the problem.Yet in this overheated environment, corporate HR departments seem to have decided that the best way to protect their firms from liability, and perhaps clarify some matters for a few confused men, would be to draw a bright line: No sex with colleagues. Or: No sex with colleagues less powerful than you. Or: No sex with colleagues, or colleagues less powerful than you, unless you tell HR about it. (And what could have a more libido-deflating effect than imagining that particular meeting?)This all seems needlessly Victorian – and tough to implement besides. When exactly are you supposed to disclose your new paramour to HR? Do you need to ask your boss’s permission before you start flirting? Do you have the “Are we boyfriend and girlfriend?” conversation before or after the “Are we HR official?” chat?The fact is, Americans work long hours, and lots of us are obsessed with our jobs. The more time we spend at work, the less likely it is we’ll meet someone outside corporate HQ. Estimates vary, but a significant number of people meet their spouses at work.With work and sex both being fairly central parts of the human experience, it’s inevitable that they’ll occasionally overlap. And it’s really none of HR’s business, though I realize they always like to have a seat at the table.Moreover, as such assortative mating increases and two-career couples become more common, more companies see recruiting top talent as a double act rather than a solo show. In high-flying careers where relocation is the norm, it’s no longer unusual for organizations to recruit both members of a power couple.That development represents progress for women, who are still much more likely to be the trailing spouse. If HR departments seek to ban sex, I worry it will curtail this promising development.HR departments don’t need to ban sex (impossible) in order to ban harassment (imperative). They should focus less on prurient details and more on punitive tactics. Colleagues shouldn’t bully, coerce or browbeat each other, regardless of whether such behavior has a sexual undercurrent. Company policies that clearly delineate what constitutes harassment and protect employees would have a much better result than attempts to track their sex lives.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Green Carmichael at sgreencarmic@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brooke Sample at bsample1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Green Carmichael is an editor with Bloomberg Opinion.

2019-12-06,"The November jobs report delivered today before the opening bell brought some holiday cheer and that was enough to send stocks soaring to close the week as the major equity benchmarks closed higher for a third consecutive day.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 surged 0.91%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.22%  * The Nasdaq Composite soared 1%  * For the second time this week, industrial 3M (NYSE:MMM) was the Dow's daily leader, advancing 4.32% on news of an asset saleThe Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 266,000 new jobs last month, while the October number was revised higher to 156,000. Economists were expecting the addition of 180,000 jobs in November.Alright, so let's assume there are naysayers out there and there probably are. They'll say, and they're not wrong, that November report was aided by 41,000 General Motors (NYSE:GM) employees heading back to work, seasonal hiring for the holiday shopping season and census hiring. All true, but even combined, those factors likely didn't account for 266,000 jobs in a single month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends Moreover, the unemployment rate dipped to a 50-year low of 3.9% while wages rose 3.1%. Some investors may be apt to look for the political implications of these numbers and there are undoubtedly some, but these numbers also reveal that near-term downside for stocks may be limited and that's obviously good news.In late trading, 27 of the Dow's 30 components were in the green and of the three losers, downside was limited. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow's worst performer today, but its Friday loss was modest and that stock has been on a tear of late. 3M RenaissanceIndustrial conglomerate 3M is one of the Dow's worst-performing names this year and it will take a miracle, Christmas or otherwise, for the shares to finish the year flat. A 13.70% year-to-date loss is difficult to overcome with not many trading days left in the year.However, 3M did give investors reasons to cheer today as it paced the Dow on rumors that the company is mulling a sale of its drug delivery systems unit, which could command $1 billion. That's not jaw-dropping news for a $95 billion company, so the stock's move today was likely more attributable to the jobs report and news that China is planning to waive some tariffs on U.S. commodities imports.That's relevant to 3M because the stock is trade sensitive and with China showing a gesture of good faith, President Trump may decide to back off of tariffs slated to go into effect on Dec. 15. Consumer CheerThe aforementioned jobs report wasn't the only cheery piece of economic data out today. The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index for December jumped to 99.2 from from 96.8 last month. An interesting element of that report is that respondents were divided along partisan lines with Republicans feeling good while sentiment among Democrats declined.Politics aside, the Dow's three consumer discretionary names -- Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) -- all closed higher. Underscoring the strength in that trio, McDonald's was the worst performer today, adding about half a percent.Keeping with theme of consumer strength, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the largest domestic retailer, meaning it's highly levered to the jobs and consumer sentiment data points, added 0.94%. Disney DividendWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced a modest dividend increase, saying its payout for fiscal 2019 will be $1.76 a share, up from $1.72 in fiscal 2018. That works out to 88 cents per share on a semi-annual basis.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice &quot;This has been a monumental year for The Walt Disney Company, marked by the launch of our new streaming service Disney+ and the completion of our acquisition of 21st Century Fox,&quot; said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. &quot;We are pleased to deliver another substantial dividend to shareholders as we continue to invest in the company's future.&quot; Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayFor those addicted to Federal Reserve rate cuts, today's data points weren't good news, but that's good news for the rest of the market. Sure, November's pace of job creation will be difficult to maintain, but even it remains simply &quot;strong,&quot; the Fed won't be compelled to trim rates again anytime soon.&quot;We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market and stable inflation,&quot; said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in Congressional testimony last month. &quot;There is nothing in the November jobs report would seem to undermine that view.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In 1905, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent Frank Meyer to China to look for interesting seeds. Over the next three years the Netherlands-born plant explorer, who had trained at the famous Hortus Botanicus in Amsterdam (and changed his name from Frans Meijer when he emigrated to the U.S.), would send back thousands of seeds, cuttings and whole plants. Among that bounty were the slightly sweet variety of lemon that was later named after him, and 44 varieties of soybean.These weren’t the first soybeans in the Americas. Benjamin Franklin had sent some back to Philadelphia from London in 1770, noting that in China people were said to make “a cheese” out of them. Five years before that a former East India Company sailor had planted a few in Savannah, Georgia, and later even figured out how to make soy sauce. In the 1800s there more U.S. soy-growing experiments, and laborers recruited from China and Japan began to bring not only the beans but also a taste for things made out of them. By the time Meyer traveled to China there were dozens of tofu shops catering to Japanese immigrants up and down the West Coast.But Meyer’s beans were part of a concerted effort that by the early 1940s had enabled the U.S. to pass China to become the world’s top soybean producer. His employer, the USDA, was the most important agent of soy’s rise, but there were many others, from agricultural-science professors at Midwestern universities to Seventh-day Adventists in search of protein-rich vegetarian foods to business titan Henry Ford, who envisioned a world in which more or less everything would be made of soy, including cars and clothing.The $39,000 “soybean suit” that Ford proudly donned in 1941 was only one-quarter soy fiber, though (the rest was wool). Soy fabrics proved impractical, and most of the other non-food soy uses envisioned by Ford and others in the 1930s and 1940s never panned out. Despite the spread of Chinese and Japanese cuisine and occasional commercial successes such as Tofutti, soy milk and the Gardein Holiday Roast that a team of Bloomberg News journalists recently judged to be the best vegan Thanksgiving “turkey,” soy has never entirely captured the hearts of American consumers, either. For the past two decades, demand has been dampened somewhat by concerns about soy allergies and side effects of the estrogen-like isoflavones naturally present in soy.This hasn’t stopped U.S. soybean acreage and production from continuing to rise, though. It is the second-most valuable crop in the U.S., not far behind corn and way ahead of everything else, as well as the country’s most important agricultural export. Those exports have fallen 29% since 2017 because of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, but the pain this has caused in the Midwest and the billions of dollars that the Trump administration has forked over to assuage it are yet another indication of how important soybeans have become.Where do all these soybeans go? Mainly into livestock feed here and abroad. In the U.S., soybean meal is used most intensively in chicken feed, which is significant because per-capita chicken consumption has more than quadrupled since the 1950s, while beef and pork consumption are down.The second most important product derived from soybeans is oil. Some of that ends up in inedible products such as wood stains and tires, but most goes into food. This country produces four times more edible oil from soybeans than from the No. 2 source of vegetable oil, corn. Few people set out to consume soybean oil, but it’s the No. 1 ingredient in Hellman’s Real Mayonnaise, its doppelgänger from Best Foods, Crisco shortening and Wish-Bone Italian dressing. It’s No. 2, after flour, in Ritz crackers. McDonald’s fries are cooked in a mix of it, corn oil and canola oil.This ubiquity of soybeans in the U.S. demands explanation. When I went searching for one a couple of weeks ago, I found that someone had recently devoted an entire book to giving one. Historian Matthew Roth’s “Magic Bean: The Rise of Soy in America” came out in 2018, and it’s great. Almost all the soybean history recited so far in this column is derived from it. And while I would advise the curious just to go out and buy the book, I have a few more thoughts inspired by it.Roth wonders in the introduction to “Magic Bean” whether the soybean’s American triumph was destined from the start or the result of a succession of lucky breaks. The argument for destiny is that it’s a plant rich in protein that makes an excellent complement to what was already the nation’s signature crop: maize, aka corn. With help from bacteria that like to hang out among their roots, soybean plants put back into the soil the key nutrient, nitrogen, that corn takes out. That’s why soybeans and corn are usually grown in rotation, together dominating the U.S. agricultural landscape from the middle of Nebraska to western Pennsylvania, from northeastern North Dakota to northeastern Louisiana.Still, other bean crops fix nitrogen in the soil, too, and — edamame aside — it takes a lot of work to transform soybeans into something palatable and useful. Major investment in soybean-processing equipment and technology had to coincide with major diversion of cropland into soybeans, which is what happened in the 1930s and 1940s.This was partly the doing of risk-taking private actors such as Henry Ford, Illinois-based soybean processor A.E. Staley and the Glidden Co.’s Adrian Joyce, who steered the manufacturer of paints and foodstuffs into soy in a big way in the early 1930s. But it probably couldn’t have succeeded without the U.S. Congress, which repeatedly aided soy without really meaning to.The yellowish tint of unbleached soybean oil, for example, offered a way around a federal tax on artificially colored yellow margarine that had been enacted in 1902 at the behest of the dairy industry. This tax was extended to all yellow margarine in 1932, but a tariff on foreign vegetable oils imposed two years later offered another boost to soybeans. The landmark Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, meanwhile, paid farmers to let fields lie fallow in an effort to stabilize agricultural prices. Crops planted to improve the soil were exempted from the law’s restrictions, which led to lots of acres being planted with soybeans. Most of these were initially just plowed back under, but the USDA started granting exemptions to struggling farmers that allowed them to use the beans as feed or even sell them.After World War II, which brought new soybean uses such as the biscuits made of soy, wheat and oat flour that were a key part of military K rations, soybean farmers had become a big enough constituency that Congress began to help them intentionally. The margarine tax was repealed in 1950, and the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 began a policy of subsidizing food exports that proved hugely beneficial for soy. Many government actions since then have been aimed at helping U.S. soybean farmers.Still, the news from Washington hasn’t always been good. In June 1973 the Richard Nixon administration, misreading signals from soybean futures markets that officials thought portended a major shortage, imposed an embargo on soybean exports. It lasted only a week, but is widely credited with jump-starting the rival Brazilian soybean industry because buyers in Japan no longer felt they could rely on U.S. supplies. The subsequent embargo of the Soviet Union imposed by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 in retaliation for the invasion of Afghanistan may have cemented Brazil’s rise as a major soy power.China’s economic growth and ravenous demand for soy to feed its hogs subsequently provided a huge new market, enabling U.S. soybean exports to keep growing even as competition from Brazil and elsewhere intensified. About half the soybeans grown in the U.S. in recent decades have ended up overseas, exported mostly as whole beans but also in the form of meal or oil. Over the past two years, though, China has sharply reduced soybean imports from the U.S. in retaliation for tariffs on Chinese goods imposed by President Trump. As recompense, the Trump administration has handed over $8.6 billion (and counting) in subsidies to soybean farmers, according to an Environmental Working Group analysis of USDA data, with soybean payments now accounting for about one-third of all farm subsidies, up from 11.6% over the past quarter century.I emailed “Magic Bean” author Roth, who is now assistant director of the Andrea Mitchell Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of Pennsylvania, to get his take on these developments, which were too late for inclusion in his book. After reviewing the negative impact of the embargoes of 1973 and 1980, he concluded:Whatever the shakeout from the trade war more generally, it looks like the effect on soy farmers may be long-lasting. (Though when it comes to predicting the future, don’t ask an historian.)This week China began waiving tariffs on U.S. soybeans in a sign of a possible winding-down of the trade conflict. Still, tensions between China and the U.S. aren’t going away, and like their Japanese counterparts nearly half a century ago, Chinese entrepreneurs and officials are now looking for ways to reduce their dependence on U.S. soybeans. The country can’t feasibly grow enough domestically to meet demand, reports business publication Caixin, so among other things it has been exploring new soybean frontiers just across the border in Russia. Could Donald Trump end up indirectly launching a Russian soybean industry? Well, stranger things have happened.To contact the author of this story: Justin Fox at justinfox@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stacey Shick at sshick@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2019-12-11,"McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) were among restaurant stocks receiving attention from Wall Street's sell-side Tuesday. But do their shares have what it takes for a nice boost beyond the morning cup of Joe? Let's take a look at the latest finding off and on the price chart to allow for a stronger risk-adjusted determination for investors.The broader market has taken to both Grinch-like and spirited Santa Claus rally behavior this December. And for seemingly good reasons. From NATO to impeachment proceedings and jobs data, the major indices have been moved by both volatile jeers and joyous cheers over the past week.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) illustrates this frenetic, headline-driven price action well enough. And there's more to come with the Fed on tap and next week's Dec. 15 tariff deadline. But restaurant stocks MCD, SBUX and DNKN have all looked more like a cup of cold mud with investors. Now though, Wall Street has taken notice.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 4 Beaten-Up Pot Stocks Worth Considering in 2020 As part of a larger outlook for the sector, RBC's Christopher Carril initiated coverage on MCD, SBUX and DNKN stock. Let's take a look at those expectations and the price charts to decide whether these restaurant stocks can give investors' portfolios a caffeinated boost or otherwise. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Charts by TradingViewMcDonald's is the first of our restaurant stocks. Shares of MCD received an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and price target of $218. RBC cited substantial investments, reasserted earnings growth, accelerating cash flow, as well as $27 billion in dividends and buybacks as primary drivers.Technically, the provided monthly chart shows MCD stock has corrected over the past three months. Following a solid rally which more than doubled McDonald's share price over four years, today's healthy pullback appears to be a counter-trend buying opportunity.MCD Stock Strategy: If this restaurant stock can confirm the hammer test of the 38% retracement level tied to 2018's corrective low, it's a buy. Put MCD stock on the radar for purchase on a move through $197.I'd recommend taking partial profits at RBC's target price of $218. That's effectively a challenge of the prior highs. To contain downside risk, a blended 6% stop which effectively limits exposure and only exits if the hammer is broken makes sense. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Charts by TradingViewStarbucks is the next restaurant stock. Shares of SBUX were also initiated with an &quot;outperform&quot; rating. Like MCD stock, RBC's price target of $97 offers similar upside expectations for the next 12 months.Supporting this bullish outlook, RBC noted investor concerns from 2017 and 2018 have been fixed by Starbucks management. SBUX also sports a rare combination of double-digit earnings growth despite its $100 billion-plus market capitalization.Technically, Wall Street's worries during the prior two calendar years were manifested as part of a large, mostly lateral three-year basing pattern. But shares of this restaurant stock did go on to gain more than 50% over several months after breaking out of the base last November.After consolidating those gains the past four months, SBUX stock has established a bottom. Earlier this month shares confirmed November's monthly hammer which found support slightly above the 38% Fibonacci level. It's bullish price action with a sprinkle of bearish worry as Starbucks has also broken its uptrend line of the past one-and-a-half years.  * 7 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Now SBUX Stock Strategy: Given Starbucks's superior growth prospects, I'd buy SBUX today as the hammer signal trumps our trendline-related concern. A 7% stop effectively minimizes dollar and pattern risk and further eases any worries. On the upside, I'm a bit more optimistic than RBC. I'd look for a move into $100 - $103 and slightly above Starbucks all-time high before reducing position risk. Dunkin Brands (DNKN)  Source: Charts by TradingViewDunkin Brands is the last of our restaurant stocks. Unlike the bullish &quot;outperform&quot; ratings assigned to MCD stock and SBUX, RBC has started DNKN stock with a &quot;sector perform&quot; and price target of $79. The firm cited a lack of positive traffic, intense competition, and price multiple concerns. RBC also sees Dunkin Brands need to continue building out its digital footprint and brick-and-mortar customer experience as backing the tempered outlook.DNKN Stock Strategy: Technically, there is also some reason to be concerned with DNKN stock. Despite serving investors a nice combination of yet another similar-looking corrective base within its uptrend, stochastics bearishly diverged during the most recent peak in share price. The warning from the stochastics indicator could turn out to be a false negative. However, given DNKN's monthly hammer attempt at bottoming is also aligned with RBC's modest price target, the combination is enough to put a 'hold-off' recommendation on this restaurant stock.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-12-11,"Who’s hungry? Investors.As the decade winds up, investors are on the lookout for the names that have what it takes to outperform the market and to fork over solid returns in the years to come. However, given the uncertainty hanging over the market as we head into 2020, zeroing in on the most compelling investment opportunities isn’t an easy job. So what’s an investor to do? We suggest following Wall Street’s lead as the analysts can provide a wealth of investing inspiration.Setting out on our own search, we rolled up our sleeves and got down to business, turning to the best of the best, investing firm RBC Capital. Not only does the firm take first place on TipRanks’ Top Performing Research Firms ranking, but it also houses some of the top rated analysts on the Street.Using the in-depth market data and investing tools from TipRanks.com, we were able to get the full scoop on 3 buy-rated restaurant stocks that one of the firm’s analysts, Christopher Carril, recommends snapping up. Let’s dig in.Restaurant Brands International (QSR)Restaurant Brands owns some of the most well-known quick service restaurant brands including Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes. With over $32 billion in system-wide sales and about 26,000 restaurants, the RBC analyst likes QSR’s position in the industry.Carril just started up his coverage of the restaurant company by telling investors that QSR has a lot going for it. QSR is clearing the path to reach 40,000 units over the next eight to ten years, with Carril citing Burger King as the key driver of growth. However, even with the above average global systems sales growth witnessed year-to-date and accelerating comp growth for Burger King and Popeyes, its valuation matches that of its competitors in the space. This is partly due to Tim Hortons weakness, which is responsible for about half of the total operating profit. Having said that, the analyst points to QSR’s “near best-in-class unit growth (5%+), current momentum at BK/PLK, significant scale and potential to add brands in the future as key positives for a stock that remains attractively valued” as making it a stand-out.Adding to the good news, Carril believes that the company can turn things around at Tim Hortons. “Continued store remodels should provide a stronger foundation for Tims to add to its dominant market share in its home market, where competition has sharpened its focus in recent years. Furthermore, we see adjustments to the recently launched Tims Rewards program—such as transitioning members to the digital platform—as important to unlocking the long-term value of the loyalty program,” he commented.Bearing this in mind, Carril initiated coverage by issuing an Outperform rating and setting a $77 price target. Given this target, he believes that shares could rise 15% in the next twelve months. (To watch Carril's track record, click here)In general, the rest of the Street agrees with the RBC analyst. With 11 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that QSR is a Strong Buy. To top it all off, other analysts are more aggressive with their forecasts as the $79 average price target indicates 18% upside potential. (See Restaurant Brands stock analysis on TipRanks)Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)The iconic coffee company just received a vote of confidence from Carril thanks to changes that have taken place over the last few years.Part of the excitement related to Starbucks has been generated by its back to basics approach. Back in 2017 and 2018, the company pivoted away from its strong service and beverage-led innovation strategy as concerns regarding the emerging third-wave coffee threat and cannibalization arose. Carril argues that SBUX appears to have “course-corrected”, revamping the in-store experience by refocusing labor towards guest-facing tasks and improving its beverage platform. These efforts already appear to be paying off as its Nitro Cold Brew has driven 3%-plus traffic growth in the last two quarters.The improvements haven’t stopped there. The coffee company has given its business model a refresh by shifting almost 900 company stores to licensed across various markets, agreeing to a licensing deal for its packaged goods and foodservice segment with Nestle, bumping up shareholder returns through share repurchases and dividends as well as taking advantage of its full company ownership in its China business.“We see these changes as supportive of SBUX's ‘growth at scale’ strategy, aiming to deliver on its long-term earnings growth objectives,” Carril wrote in a note to clients. Further, he adds, “SBUX is among only a handful of $100B+ market cap consumer companies expected to drive double-digit EPS growth over the next three years. We see the recent pullback given the expectation of below double-digit EPS growth in full-year 2020 (following two years of +17% growth) as providing a compelling entry point.”To this end, Carril initiated his SBUX coverage with a bullish call. Along with the Outperform rating, the $97 price target puts the potential twelve-month gain at 13%.Turning to other Wall Street analysts now, opinions are split. Out of 13 total analysts covering SBUX, 7 agree with Carril while 6 recommend a Hold, making the consensus a Moderate Buy. In addition, the upside potential comes in slightly lower than Carril’s estimate at 12%. (See Starbucks stock analysis on TipRanks)McDonald's Corporation (MCD)The fast food company symbolized by those famous yellow arches has definitely lagged year-to-date, up 10% compared to the S&P 500’s 25% gain. That being said, Carril thinks that McDonald’s is creating an “experience” that should serve as the foundation for future upside.MCD has made a significant investment in its domestic business. Through its acquisition of Dynamic Yield, which will enable it to use AI to improve the customer experience, and its Experience of the Future (EOTF) store remodels, the company could see substantial same store sales momentum.Carril also cites accelerating free cash flow (FCF) and a return of capital to shareholders as key positives. Overall capex is expected to drop starting in 2021 with the completion of the EOTF upgrades. “This should help to drive an acceleration in FCF (RBCe 15%-plus year-over-year to ~$6.6 billion in 2021) and supports MCD’s continued return of capital to shareholders. We expect a new three-year cash return target to be unveiled in early 2020, and model $27 billion in total dividends and share repurchases over the next three years, which is above consensus’ ~$26 billion estimate and greater than the expected $25 billion returned from 2017-2019E,” he explained.Not to mention Carril expects the burger chain to return to HSD EPS growth in 2020 as a result of the “underappreciated” Dynamic Yield purchase and ETOF. “While we acknowledge incremental depreciation (related to the EOTF rollout) and G&A (from tech acquisitions) will remain headwinds in the near-term, we see continued top-line strength—driven by global system sales growth of ~5%—as the key driver for our 2020 EPS estimate of $8.37 (7%-plus year-over-year), which is slightly more conservative vs. consensus of $8.48,” he noted.All of the above factors prompted Carril to start his coverage with a bang, namely an Outperform rating. The $218 price target conveys his confidence in MCD’s ability to move 12% higher in the twelve months ahead.What does the rest of the Street have to say? Given the 17 Buys and 6 Holds received in the last three months, the consensus among analysts is that MCD is a Moderate Buy. Also, the $220.15 average price target brings the upside potential to 13%.

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many of the retail industry’s challenges in 2020 will be familiar, such as adapting to the rise of e-commerce and trade-related uncertainty from Washington. But the lineup of CEOs navigating those conditions will include many new faces.There were more CEO exits in the retail industry in 2019 than in any year since at least 2010, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.(1)The leadership shake-ups in retail don’t appear to fit any particular pattern. There were carefully choreographed, harmonious baton passes, such as Best Buy Co. naming Corie Barry to succeed Hubert Joly. There were bombshells such as Steve Easterbrook’s abrupt ouster from McDonald’s Corp. over an inappropriate relationship with an employee. There were rebukes of poor performance, such as Art Peck’s departure from Gap Inc. And there were some left-field surprises, such as Tractor Supply Co. poaching Hal Lawton from Macy’s Inc.Retail’s recent bout of turbulence at the top is not such an outlier in corporate America; Bloomberg Opinion’s Stephen Mihm recently noted an uptick in CEO departures overall in the past few months. But it adds a certain intrigue about which retailers will end up in the winners’ circle next year.Here are predictions for how some of the more high-profile episodes of C-suite musical chairs will play out.CEO changes that are reason for optimism: By the time activist investor pressure finally led Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. to dump longtime CEO Steven Temares, the move was long overdue. But the board has scored by luring Mark Tritton — the chief merchant at its on-fire competitor, Target Corp. — for the job. Tritton’s experience creating covetable private-label brands and reimagining store displays are exactly what the big-box home goods chain needs. Meanwhile, though Gap has not yet named a permanent successor for the now-departed Peck, the company may be better off without a leader who tried but failed for five years to revive its flagship brand.CEO changes that are reason for pessimism: The biggest headscratcher comes from Nike Inc., which announced that CEO Mark Parker is to be replaced in January by John Donahoe, a former ServiceNow and eBay Inc. executive. Sure, Donahoe knows Nike’s business from serving on its board, but his tech-centric resume is a weird fit for a company that thrives on its marketing savvy and merchandising expertise. There is potential for trouble, too, in the leadership plans of Under Armour Inc., where founder Kevin Plank is set to relinquish the CEO title to COO Patrik Frisk in the new year. Plank is to become chairman and “brand chief,” and Frisk will still report to Plank. This set-up is reminiscent of when Ralph Lauren first tried to step back from the CEO role of his namesake company while staying on in a creative position. The fashion mogul clearly had trouble releasing the reins, and it cost the company a highly capable CEO, Stefan Larsson.(2)Elsewhere in the apparel world, Ascena Retail Group Inc., corporate parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and other brands, probably will regret tapping an insider, Gary Muto, to replace David Jaffe. This company needs the kind of total overhaul that an outsider would be better equipped to pull off.CEO changes that promise business as usual: Electronics giant Best Buy is in good hands under Barry, a veteran executive of the chain who had served as its CFO and chief strategic growth officer. Thing is, the electronics giant was already in good hands under Joly, who had steered the chain through an improbable comeback. So expect steadiness for the retailer in the year ahead —by no means a bad thing. Same goes for McDonald’s: Even though it said goodbye to a successful CEO under far more soap-operatic circumstances, his replacement, Chris Kempczinski, is a close lieutenant poised to stick to the same playbook that has fueled the fast-food giant’s recent strength.CEO change wild card: It’s understandable that Tapestry Inc.’s board had lost confidence in recently departed CEO Victor Luis. The company that used to be named Coach has been struggling to boost the Kate Spade brand it acquired in 2017, a bad sign for a company intent on transforming into a luxury conglomerate. Luis has been replaced by Jide Zeitlin, a longtime Tapestry board member. He has little experience in the retail or fashion worlds, which is concerning. But his finance industry chops could prove invaluable in future deal-making — an essential ingredient in the company’s quest for growth.(1) The Challenger data in the chart is for the retail sector only. The apparel industry, which includes manufacturers such as Nike, is a separate category that also saw a particularly high number of exits in 2019. So far, apparel has 12 CEO exits, matching the 2015 annual total that was the highest this decade. Restaurants such as McDonald’s are included in the entertainment and leisure category in Challenger’s data.(2) Lauren seems to have settled into his new role alongside current CEO Patrice Louvet, who took that job in 2017 after Larsson’s exit.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-12-13,"Stocks surged Thursday on the back of movement on Phase I of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, but the party may have been a little too raucous because there was some hangover today as equities barely budged.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 added just 0.01%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 0.01%  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.20%  * For the second time this week and again on light news, American Express (NYSE:AXP) was in the spotlight, leading the Dow on what appears to be a technical breakoutSo here's where we're at with trade: Phase I appears to be a go and the tariffs that the U.S. was set to impose on Chinese imports on Sunday will be averted, explaining why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ascended to a record high today.Explaining why Thursday's ebullience waned today, the White House is leaving in place some of the tariffs it previously levied on Chinese goods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;We have agreed to a very large Phase One Deal with China,&quot; said President Trump on Twitter. &quot;They have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of Agricultural Product, Energy, and Manufactured Goods, plus much more. The 25% Tariffs will remain as is, with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder.&quot;In speaking with the press today, Trump mentioned desire on China's part to get to work on Phase II of a trade package, but investors should not expect much action on that front over the near-term.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade With just 13 of the 30 members higher in late trading, the Dow was likely reflecting expectations that Phase I is as good as gets for the time being. Fighting Off DataThe Commerce Depart said today that U.S. retail sales rose 0.2% last month, well below the 0.5% increase economists were expecting, a scenario almost universally blamed on Thanksgiving arriving a week later than usual. Taking some of the sting off that result was the October number being revised up to growth of 0.4%.&quot;The data suggest a slowdown in business investment and weakness in manufacturing is weighing more broadly on Americans' willingness to spend, which could mean a soft holiday-shopping season despite a relatively strong labor market, improved wage gains and record stock prices,&quot; according to Bloomberg.That's a somewhat gloomy take, the accuracy of which is challenged by the fact that on a day in which a weaker-than-expected retail sales number was revealed, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Dow stocks with significant exposure to consumer spending, all traded higher. Speaking of the Consumer…Nike (NYSE:NKE) was another one of the Dow's consumer discretionary names trading modestly higher today. Nike is a name to watch over the next several days because the athletic apparel giant reports fiscal second-quarter results on Dec. 19.Wall Street is expecting year-over-year earnings per share growth of 10.5% on sales growth of 7.5%. Investors appear to be betting on a solid report from Nike because the stock is up more than 9% just this month. Gaming UpdateMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) added nearly 1% today after the company revealed plans for the Xbox Series X, the next generation of its popular video game console. As I've recently noted, 2020 is setting up to be a big year on the hardware upgrade front in the video game industry where Microsoft is one of the dominant players.Microsoft &quot;said it will run 4K graphics at 60 frames per second, though the system has the capabilities to hit up to 120 FPS, with support for Variable Refresh Rate and 8K capability,&quot; reports Barron's.Both the Xbox Series X and the rival PlayStation 5 will be available during the 2020 holiday shopping season.

More upside could be in store next year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayAlthough Nike reports next week, there's some time between now and the true start of fourth-quarter earnings season, but there are some data points for investors to mull in that regard.&quot;The estimated (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for CY 2019 is 0.3%, which is below the 10-year average (annual) earnings growth rate of 9.1%,&quot; notes FactSet. &quot;If 0.3% is the actual growth rate for the year, it will mark the lowest annual growth rate for the index since CY 2015 (-0.6%). Six sectors are projected to report year-over-year growth in earnings, led by the Utilities and Health Care sectors.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Imagine if Toyota Motor Corp. stopped making Corollas, or Coca-Cola Co. stopped making Diet Coke, or McDonald’s Corp. stopped serving Big Macs.That’s the best way of looking at reports that Boeing Co. is considering halting production of its troubled 737 Max single-aisle jet. Making and servicing commercial airplanes accounts for about 80% of Boeing’s operating income, and the 737 series in turn accounts for about 70% of commercial deliveries. A Boeing that’s not making 737s is shutting down close to half its business.The company could disclose a decision as early as Monday on whether to further cut production levels or halt the line altogether, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. Pausing production is increasingly seen as the most viable option, the people were quoted as saying.You might be surprised that Boeing has been making the 737 Max at all since the global fleet was grounded back in March — but an aerospace production line is more like a perpetual motion machine than something you can switch on and off with a click of the fingers.On one hand, there’s the question of what to do with Boeing’s workforce and idled facilities. On the other, there’s its vast network of suppliers, which have been pushed hard in recent years to deliver parts more cheaply and quickly than ever before, and as a result have a particularly thin safety cushion if orders dry up.That’s meant keeping production going has been a better option than stopping the lines altogether, albeit at a reduced rate of 42 a month rather than the 57 a month that were planned for this point. Finished 737s have been stacking up in parking lots like the one outside Boeing’s Renton plant. Right now, there’s in the region of 400 such planes waiting for regulators to give the go-ahead to start flying again, worth about $50 billion at list prices.There’s still vast uncertainty about when the stalemate will end. Federal Aviation Administration head Steve Dickson took the planemaker to task in an unusually public dressing-down Thursday, saying its timetable for bringing the aircraft back into service looked “not realistic” and was “designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.”American Airlines Group Inc. last week took the Max out of its schedules through early April. Flights could stay grounded into May in Europe, where the air safety regulator is carrying out its own checks, Ryanair Holdings Plc said last week. The airline is the 737’s biggest European customer.Put that way, it starts to become clearer why at some point Boeing has to pull the plug. It costs the company hard cash to make each plane, but it’s not collecting anything from customers until regulators give the say-so to resume deliveries. Operating cash flow in the third quarter hit minus $2.42 billion, the worst result on that measure in a generation and below the weakest performance during the 2008 financial crisis.“At some point you decide you can’t keep pouring money into building airplanes,” said Scott Hamilton, managing director of aerospace consultancy Leeham Co. “Even Boeing with all its financial resources, at some point just has to stop the bleeding.”Even halting production won’t mean the end of the 737 Max. Airlines don’t want to find Airbus SE turning into a monopoly supplier of single-aisle jets in the mold of the 737 and A320. Such planes are the workhorses of medium-haul, lower-cost routes where they make most of their money. As a result, carriers want the Max to succeed as much as Boeing does.In theory, Boeing could try to make up numbers with the previous 737 NG models while going back to the drawing board with the Max, but production of that plane has already stopped and it can’t compete economically with the A320neo now streaming off Airbus production lines. As a result, Boeing and the aviation industry as a whole have no option but to keep pushing forward.That doesn’t mean the road ahead will be easy. The longer the delays go on, the more Boeing loses the trust of passengers and by extension its customers, the airlines. That will eventually show up in a harder bargain driven over future aircraft orders, while suppliers that have helped to fatten Boeing’s margins at the expense of their own in recent years may find an opportunity to fight back.Valuation of aerospace companies tends to be very long term, and Boeing is still priced well above Airbus on most metrics. Should the current turbulence persist, don’t be surprised to see that premium start to stall. To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-12-18,"It's obvious in retrospect that Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock was in a bubble after its initial public offering. Indeed, it was obvious at the time. BYND stock, almost unbelievably, gained over 800% from its IPO price of $25 in less than three months on the public markets.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com Since that peak, the story has been very different: Beyond Meat stock now has declined some 69% from those highs. Monday's close of $73.60 represents the lowest end-of-session price for BYND since May 13, its eighth session of public trading.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Even after the pullback, Beyond Meat stock isn't cheap. That said, the story here is better than trading over the past few months would suggest. It's tempting, perhaps, to compare BYND to cannabis play Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), 2018's biggest post-IPO bubble. That seems incorrect. Beyond Meat has a real business -- and it's performed exceedingly well so far in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsValuation isn't perfect, and there are real &quot;falling knife&quot; concerns in the chart. One more key risk lurks. That said, investors shouldn't just assume that because the bubble has popped, Beyond Meat stock will keep tumbling. At some point, this stock simply will be too cheap. The Case for Beyond Meat StockAgain, BYND certainly was a bubble as its price cleared $200. But at $73, this doesn't look like a bubble stock. Valuation is reasonably expensive: backing out net cash, Beyond Meat stock trades at about 14x this year's sales, and almost 200x next year's earnings.Those multiples aren't inexpensive, to be sure. But in the context of current growth, they're at least in the ballpark of reasonable. Sales so far this year have risen 253%. That's actually an acceleration from 2018, when revenue increased roughly 170%. Earnings should rise nicely once profitability is reached next year, as margins expand and sales growth continues: Wall Street expects a 73% increase on the top line in 2020.Whatever an investor thinks of the underlying product, consumer response seems awfully positive. Revenue in 2015, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was just $8.8 million. It should increase over 30x in just four years, and over 50x in five.Beyond Meat isn't giving those sales away, either. Gross margins so far this year have expanded by sixteen full points to 33.2%. The company posted positive operating and net income in the third quarter. This a company with a huge opportunity that, at least in the early going, is capitalizing on that opportunity. Yet shares keep falling. The Risks to Beyond Meat StockOf course, shares have fallen because BYND stock became so overpriced at the highs. Beyond Meat stock still trades at almost triple its IPO price. It's still up 12% from its opening-day close after the biggest first-day pop since the dot-com bubble.And valuation is a question mark. 14x 2019 revenue and over 8x 2020 sales doesn't sound that expensive in a market where a name like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is trading at over 25x. But this is a manufacturing play; gross margins might top out in the 40s once scale is reached. There's still an enormous amount of growth priced into BYND stock at the moment.There's also a large debate as to how big Beyond Meat's market truly is. The company actually has struggled to expand its portfolio past the Beyond Burger. While plant-based, the company's products aren't necessarily healthy. And it's not clear that vegans will embrace a product that's supposed to mimic meat.In its prospectus, Beyond Meat suggested its worldwide market could be as large as $35 billion annually. If that figure is too optimistic (and it may be -- it's too early to tell definitively) then peak sales may be much lower than the company, and its shareholders, hope.And Beyond Meat probably needs a big addressable market because that market is going to be crowded. Privately held rival Impossible Burger is driving sales through Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) chain Burger King, and continues to raise capital for its expansion.Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) and Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) are among the meat producers moving into plant-based alternatives. Kellogg (NYSE:K) will expand its vegetarian-focused MorningStar Farms brand. Above $200, BYND stock was priced as if the company had the market to itself. Above $70, that might still be the case. Understanding BYNDFrom here, the two biggest risks seem to be valuation and competition. Beyond Meat has helped create a brand-new category, but that doesn't always guarantee long-term success. National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ) had a first-mover advantage in sparkling water, but has struggled as deeper-pocketed competitors have moved in. BYND stock may be cheaper than it was, but again there's still substantial growth priced in.That said, there is a sense that some investors are misreading BYND stock even at these levels. There are arguments over whether the product is healthy or whether there are enough vegans to drive sales -- when Beyond Meat isn't pitching its products to vegans or as a lower-calorie/healthy option. Some investors might assume that the trajectory here will follow that of TLRY, whose shares haven't really stopped sliding from last year's peaks.It's worth remembering that Beyond Meat itself had nothing to do with the parabolic rise in its shares after the IPO. And it's worth considering what this story might look like if, say, the company had gone public at $40 and peaked at $85 instead of $239. The narrative here might be more about how well the company had performed this year, and what its opportunity might be going forward. Will McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) finally come around? Can restaurant sales, which have quintupled this year, keep soaring?Crazy trading this summer shouldn't change that narrative. Beyond Meat has performed well. It has an enormous opportunity in front of it. I'm not quite convinced that combination makes BYND stock compelling at $73. But it's certainly more attractive than skeptics seem to think.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-12-18,"(Bloomberg) -- There are plenty of catalysts that can go either way for Beyond Meat Inc. next year. But even if stars align for the plant-based meat maker, Wall Street analysts are unconvinced the stock can repeat its gangbuster performance from 2019.At $76 a share, Beyond Meat has rallied more than 200% since its initial public offering in May. Despite losing two-thirds of its value since a peak in late July, the stock ranks among the top 10 best-performing new issues in the U.S. this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Still, its nearly $5 billion valuation keeps many investors and analysts on the sidelines as competition heats up with rival offerings from Nestle SA, Kellogg Co., Tyson Foods Inc., and others. Its nearest peer, closely held Impossible Foods Inc., has been rolling out its veggie patty in U.S. supermarkets and plans to expand its retail presence in 2020.“We expect more of the competitive products to be gaining traction both in restaurants and retail,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus said in a telephone interview. “We’ll be watching how well Beyond Meat can preserve the inherent first-to-market status” that it held at retail stores, she said.Shares fell as much as 1.1% on Wednesday, despite news that the parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s will expand its partnership with Beyond Meat.While the company continues to score new deals, investors are waiting to see what happens with the current trials at McDonald’s Corp. and Subway Restaurants, and the one-day-only test at KFC over the summer. Will there be national roll-outs, or will the “limited time offers” turn out to be just that? A deal with McDonald’s would be a big win, but even that may not be enough to take Beyond Meat back to its summer highs.“July levels would be tough even with McDonald’s,” Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Rupesh Parikh said in a telephone interview. The analyst, who has a market perform rating on the stock, still expects Beyond to post “significant” growth next year, but cautioned that competition concerns could weigh on the stock, which remains “very pricey.”The $104 average analyst 12-month price target on the stock implies a 37% increase from its current trading price. Even the most bullish estimate of $185 would translate into a smaller gain than the 200% rally in 2019.Details about the McDonald’s test in Canada are scant. While Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said he’s optimistic about the company’s relationship with the fast-food giant, reports about the test have been mixed. Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard wrote last month that the trial “has not been a blowout success thus far.” She estimated a 50% chance of success and projected Beyond Meat’s total sales could grow to $910 million by fiscal 2021 from an estimated $276 million this year, if a deal in the U.S. materializes.UBS analyst Steven Strycula estimated a $300 million opportunity for Beyond Meat if McDonald’s picks the company as a sole supplier for the plant-based burgers. The analyst wrote last week that surveys indicated the fast-food chain could look at multiple suppliers if it decides to permanently add the item to its menu.For all the anticipation, Berenberg analyst Donald McLee cautioned that investors may have to wait a little longer. “That’s something that’s probably a couple of quarters away,” he said by phone.“From the McDonald’s side, there’s a lot of focus on operations and how the impact of adding a new line item to the menu impacts the speed of the drive-through and the in-store experience,” said McLee, who has a buy rating on Beyond Meat shares and a price target of $100.International ExpansionAnother key development analysts are watching is the company’s expansion efforts abroad. El Segundo, California-based Beyond Meat derived 18% of its revenue from international markets in the third quarter and is “aggressively” building infrastructure in Europe while also eyeing Asia, Brown said on the earnings call in October.Unlike Impossible Foods, Beyond has an “international advantage” that is misunderstood by investors, McLee said. In both Europe and China, Impossible will need government approval for heme, its “magic ingredient” that’s made from genetically modified yeast. Beyond Meat says it’s not using genetically modified ingredients.Still, despite the advantage, Asia can prove “a bit more challenging,” given the region’s varying palates, McLee said. China, for example, may have more than a billion mouths to feed, but it also has a very different culinary and social culture where plant-based proteins are nothing new, meat is still very much a status symbol, and environmental concerns have yet to sway consumer behavior.“There’s a lot more demand for forms like dumplings and things like that as opposed to just plain sausages,” the analyst said. “So that’s an opportunity, but they need to probably expand the portfolio a bit before they really target that market.”Beyond Meat CEO Brown said on Monday that the company will have updates on poultry products next year.See AlsoElection Year Once Again Rekindles Hope for Infrastructure PushChip Analysts Struggle to Get Excited About 2020 After RallyEnergy Stock Carnage Sets Up ‘Rinse and Repeat’ Start to 2020Software Analysts See More Volatility in an Uncertain 2020Facebook and Google Face ‘Supercharged’ Regulatory Risk in 2020Airbus Secures Lead Over Boeing as 737 Max Weighs Into 2020Strategists Butt Heads on Materials Stocks as Trade War Drags OnAfter ‘Blood-Spilled’ Year, Pot Firms Brace for Repeat in 2020Small-Caps Set to Retake 2020 Market Lead After Three-Year LagS&P 500 Melt-Up Is So Hot It’s Making Cheerleaders Into Skeptics(Adds share move, CKE deal in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Deena Shanker.To contact the reporter on this story: Tatiana Darie in New York at tdarie1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Richard RichtmyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Beyond Meat Investors Should Expect Less Crazy Gains in 2020

2020-01-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Mid Valley Megamall in Kuala Lumpur has more than 100 restaurants, cafes, and snack stands to meet every kind of craving. As of this month, that list includes a novel and seemingly quixotic option: Santan, a cafe that serves airplane food in cardboard boxes.As restaurant concepts go, “quick airplane food” isn’t an obvious winner. But Santan is owned and operated by AirAsia Group Bhd, the region’s most successful budget airline. With profits declining in the industry, the company is looking to diversify — it wants to reduce flying from 80% of its business to about 40% by 2025 — and earthbound airplane food is central to its vision. Over the next few years, it plans to open more than 100 new Santans.“A year ago, when I first conjured the idea of turning ... our in-flight food choices into a fast-food restaurant, everyone thought I was crazy,” says Tony Fernandes, the company’s chief executive officer. “Just as they thought 18 years ago when I said I was starting an airline. Look how that turned out!”That may seem like an inapt comparison. But the idea of creating “the first Asean fast food franchise,” as Fernandes puts it, isn’t inherently crazy. Southeast Asia’s expanding middle class is increasingly keen on upgraded dining options. And Western fast-food outlets, such as McDonald’s and KFC, have been proliferating. In Malaysia, Yum! Brands Inc., owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, has opened more than 1,000 outlets, making it the country’s — and the region’s — most successful food-service operator.So the market is potentially vast. The problem for AirAsia is that winning customers in Southeast Asia’s cutthroat restaurant industry will be much harder than winning passengers on budget aircraft. For one thing, Fernandes may be misreading the competition. Those American fast-food outlets make up a mere fraction of the 167,000 food and beverage businesses in Malaysia, the vast majority of which serve local fare. That makes KFC a relative novelty: an expensive foreign twist on a local favorite (fried chicken). A one-piece chicken-and-rice combo there costs about $3.00, while a plate of Malaysian chicken rice typically goes for half that.Another problem is that what Fernandes calls “Asean food” — using the acronym for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — doesn’t really exist. Santan’s menu is a puzzling hodgepodge of vaguely regional dishes: nasi lemak, pho, Cambodian pineapple fish-fillet noodles and others. It’s the kind of error that only an airline would make. In the air, a menu is a compromise intended for a diverse set of customers who don’t really expect much choice. On the ground, a menu needs to match quirky and far more specific cravings. Nobody, anywhere craves “Asean food,” just as nobody craves “European Union food.” Instead, Southeast Asians seek out — and often debate — the highly distinctive cuisines of respective nations, such as Thailand or Vietnam.Of course, if Santan’s food was uniquely good, that might not be such an obstacle. But it isn’t. On a recent Saturday, my son and I visited the inaugural store and ordered three dishes. The Nyonya curry laksa had little flavor beyond the chili; Uncle Chin’s chicken rice was salty and greasy; and the chicken satay with peanut sauce was, in my son’s estimation, “fuzzy and too cooked.” Even worse, for a cafe in an emerging market, Santan offers poor value: Meal prices average 15 ringgits ($3.62) with a drink, about 25% more than a chicken-and-rice combo at KFC, and double what a similar meal would cost in a local joint.And that’s the biggest problem for AirAsia. A chain offering generically regional dishes can’t hope to compete with the hundreds of thousands of small, independently owned eateries that make Southeast Asia one of the world’s great culinary destinations. It’s like Taco Bell trying to win over Mexicans or Olive Garden hoping to entice diners in Tuscany. Why choose the corporate compromise when you can have the real thing?Two decades ago, AirAsia revolutionized consumer expectations in the region with the catchphrase “Now everyone can fly.” But everyone in Southeast Asia can already eat — and eat better than airplane food.To contact the author of this story: Adam Minter at aminter@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Timothy Lavin at tlavin1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-01-02,"Thanks to the emergence of the Millennial generation and its subsequent societal and workplace shifts, the fast-food industry has become even more complex and competitive. Old rules simply don't apply, which partially explains why Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has surged in the markets. Since the start of 2019, the Chipotle stock price has nearly doubled.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com What makes the tremendous momentum in CMG stock all the more remarkable is its recovery from almost certain disaster. Back in late 2015, the fast-casual restaurant suffered a health crisis from a food-poisoning outbreak. It shattered what had been up to that point a sterling reputation. Worsening matters, the outbreak launched a federal investigation.That's behind the company now, as you can see from the Chipotle stock price. After concerted efforts to win back consumer trust - including margin-killing discounts and special offers - CMG gradually entered back into customers' good graces.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHonestly, I shouldn't have been so surprised. As we saw from the massive Equifax (NYSE:EFX) data breach, Americans are willing to forgive almost anything. * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places But like any good company, Chipotle is not satisfied with merely recovering from disaster. Instead, management is now targeting a platform that has long been a staple of the fast-food business: the drive-thru. If implemented successfully, it could spark a new leg up for CMG stock.I think it's a brilliant idea. Anecdotally, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has made their drive-thrus more attractive and efficient. In my opinion, they're lightning-quick. What's not anecdotal is how much McDonald's invested in their drive-thru business.Similarly, CMG could deliver efficiencies in the drive-thru and pick-up window platforms, which could then drive up the Chipotle stock price. But with the already dramatic valuation bump, is this rally still viable? Stagnation a Worrying Factor for Chipotle StockFrom a purely strategic perspective, you've got to like what management is doing. Implementing both drive-thrus and pick-up windows for online orders will compete directly against traditional fast-food establishments, knocking out their key advantage. After all, Chipotle arguably beats them in taste and health; bringing added convenience to the table makes fast food increasingly irrelevant.Sometimes, though, the investment narrative doesn't always align with positive, smart strategies. That's the case with CMG stock. Despite a remarkable turnaround effort and continued innovations, CMG represents a &quot;three-quarters&quot; investment: all of 2019's gains between January through September.It's curious, then, that the bulls are having trouble pushing the Chipotle stock price beyond the $840 level. Rather than blaming irrational trader psychology, I believe this resistance area has a fundamental explanation.Back in 2006 - the year of its initial public offering - Chipotle's total revenue (including global sales) was equal to 0.23% of U.S. restaurant and eatery sales. By 2015, this metric was an impressive 0.83%. For perspective, McDonald's U.S. sales in 2018 only took 1.2% of domestic restaurant sales. Clearly, Chipotle was challenging everyone in the space, bolstering the case for CMG stock. Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto But in 2016, the fast-casual eatery absorbed substantial fiscal pain from the food poisoning epidemic. As a result, the company's total revenue slipped to 0.68% of U.S. restaurant sales.To be fair, 2019 is on track to be a record sales year for Chipotle stock. Therefore, it's possible that the company's revenue is back to equaling 0.83% of total domestic sales. But it would also mean four years of unnecessary stagnation.Additionally, as Chipotle attempts to expand its footprint, it must deal with the law of large numbers. That means investments in growth will yield smaller percentage gains. And that's where I worry about the competition. Fast Food (or Fast Casual) Is a Tough BusinessDon't get me wrong: Chipotle's recovery story should be covered in every business class. Further, management is doing exactly what they should. But the reality is that proving the doubters wrong (like me) was the easy part. Now, they're back to the year 2015, minus the health crisis. How can they grow from here?Although the common assumption is that millennials eschew fast food for healthier fare, I think the matter is more nuanced. Millennials are diagnosed with obesity-related cancers at an alarming rate, so they're not nearly as healthy as they think. This also suggests that convenience, not health, is the motiving factor for young eaters.If that's the case, I wouldn't bank too heavily on CMG stock. Simply put, competition in the fast food or fast casual space is fierce. You have names like Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) and El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO), among many others competing for consumer dollars.Some of these names may offer better upside because of their lack of heightened expectations. For instance, LOCO is an interesting idea because it serves healthier food than your typical fast food joint. They also have generous portions, making them better value picks for the consumer.Ultimately, I appreciate what Chipotle has done. I'm sure many books will be written about their exploits. But the real work starts now. Given the high probability that the good news is priced in, I'm going to let Chipotle stock cool down.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-02,"The bull market went into overdrive in 2019. The S&P; 500 rushed ahead by 29% - its best showing in six years. But as much as investors will always welcome such returns, it does make it tougher to be an income investor.When dividend stocks go up in price, their yields go down. The dividend yield on the S&P; 500 started 2019 at more than 2% but finished the year at 1.8%. Yes, the market keeps setting new all-time highs, but the rally that seems to never end also makes it difficult to find excellent dividend stocks with generous or even decent payouts.High-quality dividend stocks with better-than-average yields do exist, however.

2020-01-02,"I'm of the view that for the average investor, buy-and-hold investing may be one of the best ways to grow personal wealth. And, when it comes to financial returns, numbers speak louder than words. So, to demonstrate how successful long-term investing strategy can be, I like to look at a number of large cap, Dow Jones stocks every so often to see how much a single, $1,000 investment five years ago would be worth today.This time around, I have picked out five stocks from the coveted Dow Jones Industrial Average. In 2019, the index was up about 22%. As our readers may well remember, many stocks started 2019 from a point of weakness. Therefore, most of the blue chip, Dow Jones stocks became strong performers during the year.So, by taking a longer view that extends to five years, we can better gauge the importance of investing for the long-run. Let's take a closer look.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What the numbers meanUnder each company name, I state how the price has changed over the past five years and what this change equates to in terms of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Then, I show how $1,000 would have fared since late 2014.Please note that all of these companies pay regular dividends that can also be reinvested. However, the calculation below does not take into consideration the actual dividend or the reinvestment of that income.Past prices are as of late-December 2014. Current prices are as of this writing at close on Dec. 24.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for January and Beyond Finally, I have not factored in any brokerage commissions or taxes. 5-Year Returns for 5 Dow Jones Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock price has increased from $113.99 to $284.27.CAGR: 20.05%$1,000 would have become $2,493.51.AAPL is expected to report earnings in early February. In 2019, the company overall released strong quarterly results and launched a number of services, such as Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade and Apple TV+. Nonetheless, iPhone revenue is still its bread and butter business. If the recent trade truce between the U.S. and China continues well into 2020, the stock is likely to see increased iPhone demand in China -- something that could easily boost earnings.In 2019, broader markets performed quite well, and Apple stock -- which is up about 89% over the past year -- clearly outperformed many of its large cap peers. Therefore, there may be some volatility and short-term profit taking, especially prior to the earnings release date. Long-term investors may consider buying AAPL dips; Its current dividend yield stands at just under 1.1%. Disney (DIS)Source: Divina Epiphania / Shutterstock.com Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock price has increased from $95.03 to $145.29.CAGR: 8.86%$1,000 would have become $1,528.77.DIS is expected to report earnings in February. As its streaming business is just getting started, analysts are likely to pay special attention to Disney+ metrics. For many viewers, content quality is extremely important when it comes to entertainment. The Disney brand, coupled with its powerful and unparalleled intellectual property (IP), will likely be the magnet that draws viewers to its streaming service.  * 7 Excellent Value Stocks to Buy for 2020  I'd be a buyer of the shares, especially if the price drops to $130 or below. Also, its current dividend yield of Disney stock stands at 1.2%. McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock price has increased from $94.78 to $196.67.CAGR: 15.72%$1,000 would have become $2,075.11.McDonald's will likely report earnings in late January. In terms of customer loyalty -- a crucial metric in the restaurant business -- McDonald's is among the top-scoring chains. In addition to its food and drinks revenue, the group also has an impressive real estate portfolio. And that is partly why I'm always interested in MCD shares.Last quarter of 2019 has seen the MCD stock price pullback from a 52-week high of $221.93 on Aug. 9 to the current $199 level. In early November, CEO Steve Easterbrook resigned as a result of a personal relationship with another McDonald's employee -- a factor that weighed in the the fall in the stock price. Now, investors have a better entry point into MCD stock. Its current dividend yield stands at 2.5%. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock price has increased from $47.88 to $157.38.CAGR: 26.87%$1,000 would have become $3,286.96.Earlier in the month, the Financial Times named Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella its &quot;Person of the Year.&quot; He has been credited with recognizing the growing importance of the cloud business, especially at the enterprise level.  * Where the FANG Stocks Sit Heading Into 2020 MSFT will likely report earnings in late January, and many analysts are expecting the company to gain further market share in the cloud space. Long-term investors looking for robust capital gains should consider buying the stock at every weakness. Its current dividend yield stands at 1.3%. Walmart (WMT)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock price has increased from $86.91 to $119.51CAGR: 6.58%$1,000 would have become $1,375.24.WMT is expected to report earnings in February. The group's recent robust third quarter earnings report showed growth in its domestic operations as well as e-commerce. Therefore, the Street will analyze these key metrics closely to see if they have accelerated in the holiday season, too. With a late Thanksgiving, retailers have had a shorter shopping season in 2019. So, the Street will be watching fourth quarter sales numbers, not just from Walmart, but from its competitors, too.In the past few weeks, Walmart stock has been trading near all-time highs. The run up in price since August, as well as its forward price-earnings ration (P/E) of 23.7, are making me wonder if there may be some profit-taking around the corner. Finally, its current dividend yield stands at 1.8%. End-of-year takeawayOver the past five years, all five of these Dow Jones stocks have been good investments. Shareholders in any one of them would have also received dividends, and that passive income would have increased the returns -- especially if those dividends were reinvested.It would also be correct to say that AAPL and MSFT have especially been growth stocks leading the market higher.If you are new to investing or do not feel comfortable analyzing individual stocks, then you could also buy into an ETF that tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average.While past performance may not exactly repeat in the months ahead, the index's track record highlights its growth potential. It is home to many well-managed conglomerates that have robust earnings and are bellwethers of our economy. Thus, an ETF such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA:DIA) or iShares Dow Jones US ETF (NYSEARCA:IYY) may be appropriate for many portfolios.Understandably, investors are wondering how much longer the rally in broader markets and individual names can last. I believe the numbers from many blue-chip companies indeed show that robust, long-run returns are likely to be achieved in the future, too. It would take a brave contrarian to bet against the positive trend not continuing over the next decade.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride.That's the trader's reaction. But what should investors do? A Turning PointI wrote when Trump was first elected that he was a Bizarro World version of Jimmy Carter. He is Carter's opposite in every way, and on every policy.Carter was using a Cold War playbook that was approaching its sell-by date. Trump seems to be using the Oil War playbook which replaced it. It has now reached a sell-by date. Trump's policy is based on controlling resources. His alliances are with Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two other oil powers in today's world.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers The OPEC+ (OPEC plus Russia) deal reached last month has bulls predicting $100 per barrel of oil, and they may get their wish in the short term. But can Russia be trusted?The real oil story is that, just as technology makes alternatives like solar and wind cheaper, it also makes it easier to find new pools and exploit older ones through fracking. During 2019 new fields were discovered in Russia, Guyana and off Cyprus. There were new finds in Iran and the Gulf of Mexico.Slowly, the oil era is ending, while that of technology rises. The Gating FactorIn the battle to sell their supplies against a backdrop of efficiency, war is oil's ally. The Trump years have seen nationalism stoked around the world. The result is growing conflict between nations and groups.But there's another force against which nationalism has no answer, climate change. This is shaping up to be a year of utter disaster on the climate front. There's a growing reaction against what is happening. The losers in the near term are technology companies. Many were overbought in the late-decade run-up. They're bound to sell off.But technology, which can reach across borders, remains the major trend of our time. Wireless networking, cloud computing and cheap devices have brought over 1 billion people into the global market, and the global conversation in the 21st century. They're not going away.Jack Dorsey of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Square (NYSE:SQ) isn't the only technology executive looking for talent in Africa. Africa's median age is under 20, half what it is in the United States, at a time where the gating factor to growth is human capital.Smart, motivated, educated and mainly young people are the source of most money today, not resources. People can create new battery designs, windmills that don't kill birds and more efficient solar panels. They can also put intelligence into everything, creating efficiency, and make DNA a programming language. The Bottom Line on IranThe year 2020 will go a long way toward determining whether mankind has a future, not just your investments.The present economic path is unsustainable. A new path has opened in the last decade.Expect a lot of volatility in the markets over the next few months. Expect to lose money. But on the other side of the present crisis is a new era.

During the past 15 years (60 quarters), the average decline in the bottom-up EPS estimate during a quarter has been 4.4%. Thus, the decline in the bottom-up EPS estimate recorded during the fourth quarter was larger than the five-year average, the 10-year average, and the 15-year average.&quot;This is probably priced into stocks right now, meaning there will be some burden on companies to reveal upbeat guidance for the current quarter and year when given the opportunity.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd. is planning to significantly reduce its stake in McDonald’s China Co. more than two years after it bought into the fast-food chain, as rising costs pinch the franchise’s profit.McDonald’s China said in a statement Wednesday that Citic is looking for buyers for a 22% stake, which will bring its share in the chain’s China operations down to 10%. The bottom price for the stake is set at 2.17 billion yuan ($312 million) and the bidding process is ongoing, said a disclosure document filed by Citic to the Beijing Equity Exchange.Separately, Citic Capital Holdings Ltd.-- partly owned by Citic Ltd. -- said it’s interested in buying the stake. It currently owns 20% in McDonald’s China.“Citic Capital is confident with the future growth and prospects of the business and we’re actively participating in the bidding process,” said a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman.McDonald’s Sells Control of China Business to Citic, Carlyle Citic Ltd. said in an emailed statement that the transaction was “purely a business decision.” Citic and its partners have added more than 1,000 new restaurants in mainland China and Hong Kong since they took over and will continue to benefit from the development of McDonald’s China, it said.Citic Ltd. said Chicago-based McDonald’s Corp. holds a 20% stake in the China business.The stake sale comes as the fast-food chain saw revenue and profit growth stall amid fierce competition in China’s dining scene. Food chains have also been hit by rising costs due to the ongoing African Swine Fever epidemic, which has wiped out a quarter of the world’s pigs and caused animal protein prices in China to surge.Citic’s disclosure document showed that revenue for the McDonald’s China master franchiser, called Fast Food Holdings Ltd., was HK$24.8 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2018. For the first 11 months of 2019, it was HK$24.4 billion.Operating profit for the first 11 months of 2019 was HK$16.2 billion and net profit for the same period was HK$856.2 million, according to the statement. This is compared to HK$16.4 billion and HK$1.15 billion, respectively, for all of 2018.McDonald’s China said that same-store sales have risen for three years consecutively since Citic and its partners bought over the franchise in 2017.(Updates with Citic Ltd comment in the fifth paragraph.

2020-01-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The appetite for major consolidation sweeping the global food delivery industry has finally reached the U.S. Now the big question is, which combination would be easier to stomach? The fly in the soup may, as ever, be SoftBank Group Corp.Waves of dealmaking have reduced the number of online food delivery players in markets such as the U.K. and South Korea to just two or three. In Germany, there’s only one — Takeaway.com NV. Yet the U.S. still has four major rivals: Grubhub Inc., SoftBank-backed DoorDash Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., another company in SoftBank’s stable, and the smaller Postmates Inc.Grubhub is “considering strategic options including a possible sale,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The biggest U.S. player until 2018, it has lost market share to its venture capital-backed peers, and the stock had fallen 63% from its peak before the news hit.The Chicago-based firm’s business model differs from its rivals. While the likes of Uber Eats provide a network of couriers to deliver food from their network of restaurants, Grubhub has operated largely as a digital platform since its founding in 2004. It simply connected restaurants to customers, leaving the eateries responsible for actually delivering the food. Under CEO and co-founder Matt Maloney, it became the dominant destination to order food online in the U.S.His platform approach was a lot more profitable. Because Grubhub didn’t have to shoulder the costs of couriers, and just took a cut of each meal ordered, it was able to enjoy Ebitda representing more than 20% of sales between 2013 and 2017, when competition started to ramp up. Its rivals have always been loss-making.But that model also made it harder to attract major fast-food chains such as McDonald’s Corp., which don’t want to have to take on the fixed cost of maintaining a network of couriers themselves. So Grubhub has belatedly started building out that capability in an effort to defend its market share. However, that’s hurt profitability. Still, despite those headwinds, Grubhub remains an attractive business, not least because of its dominant position in New York, where credit-card data analysis firm Second Measure estimates it has 67% market share.The difficulty lies in the deal price. Based on Grubhub’s cost of capital and anticipated 2022 earnings, a buyer would probably need to find annual savings exceeding $500 million by the end of that period to justify paying a 30% premium — even to the share price the day before the Wall Street Journal report, which would value the firm at about $6 billion including debt. Such savings would be a near impossible ask: Grubhub’s operating expenses over the past 12 months totaled just $1.2 billion. It would instead be a risky gamble on increased pricing power allowing the new firm to improve profitability enough to service any new debt. And the path to profitability for firms with their own couriers remains unclear. That probably rules out an approach by Amsterdam-based tech investor Prosus NV, which has no local business, reducing the opportunity both to find synergies and to remove a market competitor.A merger with one of Grubhub’s existing U.S. rivals therefore seems a more rational solution. An all-stock combination would reduce concerns about justifying a capital outlay on a firm with low returns, while offering greater opportunities for cost savings and increased pricing power. And combining Grubhub’s major network of restaurants with a rival’s couriers could prove attractive.But there are problems here, too. San Francisco-based DoorDash, arguably the most logical candidate strategically, was valued at nearly $13 billion in its most recent funding round. That sky-high figure would be a problem for Grubhub shareholders. Their firm may not be growing as quickly as DoorDash, but it is similarly sized and a lot more profitable. It’s hard to see them accepting a merger where DoorDash investors ended up with more than two-thirds of the combined entity.Yet giving Grubhub shareholders a bigger stake could require DoorDash’s investors to write down the value of their holdings in the company. And that’s the last thing that SoftBank needs, fresh as it is from a year where underperforming investments such as Uber and troubled coworking-space trailblazer WeWork already prompted a $4.9 billion writedown. SoftBank is one of DoorDash’s biggest investors.A combination with Uber Eats is the best alternative to DoorDash. But SoftBank again might create difficulties. If push came to shove, it’s more likely to favor an Uber Eats-DoorDash tie-up, rather than continuing to back two companies fighting each other for customers and restaurants.Which leaves Postmates, the San Francisco-based firm which delivers everything from groceries to pizza and just expanded beyond food with an alliance with retailer Old Navy. It’s the less attractive solution for Grubhub, which would have to be the acquirer, and would be unlikely to add the scale needed to compete effectively. But such a combination does have some industrial logic — adding Postmates’s network of couriers to Grubhub’s restaurants — and is less likely to raise the hackles of antitrust regulators.Were SoftBank not at the table, a combination with DoorDash or Uber Eats would make the most sense. But as it stands, Grubhub could be left fighting for the scraps.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-01-10,"Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) reached a market value above $14.7 billion, not long after its IPO, and BYND stock soared to over $240 per share.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com This was absurd. Beyond Meat made revenue of just $230 million in the last 12 months ending September 2019 trading for over 64 times 12-month revenue for that period.That ratio of price-to-sales was so high it would be considered pushing the envelope even if it was a measure of price-to-earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTherefore, it is no surprise that BYND stock has fallen significantly. It is now down to $81.48 or so. That gives Beyond meat stock a market value of over $5.1 billion.  * The Top 15 Stocks to Buy in 2020 That still seems extraordinarily high. After all, BYND still is not making a cash flow profit. Its free cash flow in the last year was negative $53.6 million. So Why Is Beyond Meat Still Trading So High?First of all, Beyond Meat gave an outlook for its full-year 2019 EBITDA cash flow. It said to expect $20 million in EBITDA for the year to December 2019.Moreover, the company upgraded its full-year estimate for 2019 revenue. On Oct. 28, 2019, BYND said its 2019 revenue is expected to be between $265 million to $275 million. That is an upgrade from its prior estimate of $240 million.But like I said, free cash flow was negative. You can't pay bills with EBITDA. In the latest quarter to September, free cash flow was negative $2.3 million.In fact, if it weren't for another $37.7 million equity shares that BYND sold during Q3, its cash balance would have gone down. I estimate that the balance would have been $275 million, down 12%.Keep in mind that without Beyond Meat's IPO in Q2, which raised $256 million, it would have been out of cash, or deep in debt. Analysts Love Beyond Meat StockBYND stock is a classic momentum stock. Analysts are in love with it. This is reflected in their projections for 2020 revenue and earnings.For example, analysts surveyed by Seeking Alpha estimate that 2020 revenue will be $486 million. This is 73% higher than their estimates of $281 million for 2019. (Note this is higher than the 2019 outlook guidance given by Beyond Meat).That 2020 estimate puts Beyond Meat stock on a forward price-to-revenue ratio of 10.5 times revenue. That is much lower than the historical TTM ratio of 64 times I mentioned above.However, these same analysts believe Beyond Meat will produce 2020 earnings of 33 cents per share. That means Beyond Meat stock is still over 250 times income.This is the classic scenario for momentum type stocks. The price is so high since investors are willing to pay up many years in the future for its estimated growth. McDonald's - Lovin Beyond Meat?Reports came out recently, that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has been testing using Beyond Meat in some of their locations in Canada. Barron's just reported that Beyond Meat's competitor Impossible Foods would not be used at McDonald's.This could help Beyond Meat stock, as, if this is true, winning the MCD account for all U.S. locations for BYND would be huge. Or would it?Interestingly, it appears that rural locations were not very interested in Beyond Meat hamburgers. So this is good news and bad news. The bad news is that McDonald's may as a result of the tests in Canada not roll out the Beyond Meat to all its locations - only its more urban ones. What Should Investors Do With Beyond Meat Stock?I do believe that Beyond Meat will grow its revenue significantly over the next year. In fact, its earnings and cash flow may turn significantly positive.But the key is to try and buy BYND stock when there is an element of a bargain price. Typically this will be during negative news.

2020-01-15,"A new calendar year doesn't always mean a fresh start. But when it comes to three of 2019's more painful investments, well-built technical bottoms and out-the-gate momentum in January are favoring turnarounds that become full-fledged, bullish momentum stocks in 2020. Let me explain.I've said it before and it bears repeating, every dog has its day. In the markets this is akin to down and out stocks, which unexpectedly surprise investors with a jump in share price. But not every doggish stock is bound to be sent back into the proverbial dog house. Some will go on to become momentum stocks.As discussed earlier this month at InvestorPlace.com, rotations into underappreciated or even vilified stocks can turn into massive opportunities as overly bearish sentiment and price action turn aggressively around. Often these disruptive shifts in investment behavior occur early in the calendar year. If for no other reason this phenomenon can be tied to institutional investors who can move more freely into last year's dogs without having to defend a stock with fleas to stakeholders at year-end.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 Having said that, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) are three investment vehicles that demonstrate potential as momentum stocks in 2020. Momentum Stocks to Buy: Beyond Meat (BYND)  Source: Charts by TradingViewAfter getting scorched in 2019 faux-meat producer Beyond Meat has quickly become a sizzling investment with Wall Street. Shares are up roughly 50% in just over a handful of trading days in 2020's early going. The catalyst? The initial headline driver was privately held rival Impossible Foods was throwing in the towel on its bid to land a spot on the McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) menu. And that leaves the door wide open for BYND stock.Technically speaking and aside from the huge gain in share value, BYND stock has firmly broken price resistance formed during the construction of a key lateral congestion pattern.BYND Stock Strategy: Our recent recommended strategy nailed a huge win in this momentum stock. But while resistance has been overcome, BYND stock is also incredibly volatile and overbought near term. My advice, put shares on the radar for purchase in-between $95 - $105 as part of a married put or collar options-based position. Pinterest (PINS)  Source: Charts by TradingViewPinterest is the next of our momentum stocks to buy. When all was said in done in 2019, the popular web-based visual discovery platform saw shares cut in half from their highs and modestly below their IPO stock price of $19. But now investors might be smart to recognize what a difference a day can make.In truth, shares were already on the move out-the-gate in 2020. But Tuesday's near-10% gain has shares looking like a bonafide momentum stock. The headline driver was a report PINS stock has overtaken Snap (NYSE:SNAP) in users and only trailing social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and the company's Instagram app.Technically, PINS stock has confirmed December's bottoming hammer candlestick formed around the 1.27% extension level and begun a move into a large gap area. This could produce a vacuum-like sweeping of shares higher before an eventual pullback.  * 7 Socially Responsible ETFs to Buy in 2020 PINS Stock Strategy: This momentum stock can be bought today in anticipation of the price gap being filled. On a challenge of the $25 area, I'd recommend buying a protective put on the cheap and leave the upside open-ended until after earnings in February. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the last of our momentum stocks to buy. GBTC stock is a listed trust tied to the cryptocurrency market's largest play. Investors pay a premium versus owning the actual contract. However, due to the transparency of listed OTC securities, as well as the product's strong liquidity, I believe this is a more suitable way for most investors to gain exposure.Any investor with even a passing interest in the markets has heard of bitcoin's dazzling run and equally impressive crash over the past couple years. But if there's one game-changing technology in the market right now, the cryptocurrency space would definitely deserve to be in that conversation. And right now there's reason to see another bullish cycle emerging and GBTC's status as a momentum stock back in action.Technically, shares of GBTC have formed and confirmed a bullish higher low pattern between the 62% and 76% Fibonacci levels on the monthly chart. With GBTC up roughly 22.50% in January, it's fair to say this is a momentum stock opportunity. Yet another glance at the big picture also strongly suggests bitcoin is just now turning the corner for bullish investors.GBTC Stock Strategy: Buy this momentum stock today. But don't go all in. I'd recommend adding if confirmation of the rally is backed by a bullish crossover from GBTC stock's monthly stochastics. Use the recent low for exiting if needed and stand ready to take partial profits at the 2019 high near $17.50.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management currently own positions in Beyond Meat (BYND) and Bitcoin (GBTC) securities, but no other investments mentioned in this article.

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Navinder Singh Sarao, the British trader blamed for helping cause the 2010 Flash Crash from his bedroom, should serve no additional jail time, U.S. authorities said in a recommendation before his Jan. 28 sentencing in Chicago.The government cited Sarao’s “extraordinary cooperation,” his autism diagnosis and the fact that he lost most of the 45 million pounds ($58.5 million) he made trading to fraudsters, according to a memo filed with the court Tuesday. He spent four months in a London jail, and the Justice Department said an additional term term wouldn’t deter other traders, and would pose serious risks to the 41-year-old’s mental health.“For the foregoing reasons, the government respectfully recommends that this court depart significantly below the advisory sentencing guidelines range,” prosecutor Michael O’Neill wrote. “Specifically, the government agrees with the probation officer and the defendant that a sentence of time served would be appropriate.”The U.K. citizen was arrested in 2015 for contributing to the volatility of May 6, 2010, when markets dropped 5% in a 5-minute period, earning him the moniker the ‘Flash Crash Trader.’ For five years starting in 2009, he spoofed U.S. futures markets, including using a software program he designed himself called the NAVTRader. He was extradited to the U.S. where he pleaded guilty in November 2016 to spoofing and wire fraud.Since then, Sarao has been working with the government on building cases against other market cheats. Unusually, he was allowed to return to the U.K. during his cooperation. He spent days with prosecutors in London, going through videos he’d made and schooling the CFTC, the DOJ and the FBI on the world of high-frequency trading and how to identify market cheats.Spoofing involves placing and then quickly canceling orders in a bid to deceive other traders about supply and demand and therefore hopefully move the market.“The defendant’s keen insights and explanations regarding both general and specific patterns of deceptive and manipulative trading have illuminated the government’s understanding of similar spoofing,” O’Neill wrote. “As a result, he has substantially assisted and informed the government’s nationwide efforts to detect, investigate, and prosecute these crimes.”Last year, he also testified against his former programmer, Jitesh Thakkar, who was charged with conspiring with Sarao to spoof the market. Thakkar was acquitted at trial.Beyond his cooperation, the government pointed to the fact that Sarao barely touched the money he made as further reason to treat him leniently.“The defendant clearly was not motivated by money, greed, or any desire for a lavish lifestyle,” O’Neill said. “His only significant purchase was a 5,000 pound car. Of his remaining trading profits, the defendant lost over 40 million pounds to three apparently fraudulent investment schemes.”Sarao continues to live in his parents’ house in the London suburb of Hounslow, where he sleeps “in a child-like bedroom that includes multiple stuffed animals” and “uses coupons to buy food at McDonald’s,” the Justice Department wrote. He has been diagnosed with autism, which a psychologist described as “both a disability...and a talent.”The final decision on Sarao’s sentencing will be made Jan. 28 by the judge presiding over the case in Chicago. The government originally recommended a custodial sentence of between 78 and 97 months.To contact the reporter on this story: Liam Vaughan in London at lvaughan6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Elser at celser@bloomberg.net, Ambereen ChoudhuryFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Recommends No Jail Time for Flash Crash Trader
2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you’re a typical wage earner, then your employer is obligated to pay you at least the federal minimum wage, along with overtime if you work beyond 40 hours in a given week. But who is your employer? On Sunday, the administration of President Donald Trump brought a common-sense answer to this important and, surprisingly, unresolved question.Determining who is liable for violations of employment law is more complicated than it may seem. Take a cashier at, say, an independent McDonald’s franchise. Certainly she works for the franchised restaurant. But does she also work for McDonald’s, the national brand? What responsibility does McDonald’s Corp. have for her?The waters are similarly murky for an employee of a staffing agency or a contractor who is assigned to a business, like a security officer who is assigned to a law firm. If the guard is owed overtime but doesn’t receive it, who should be held accountable? The agency? The law firm? Both?These issues have grown in importance as companies increasingly contract with outside firms for many services and functions that would once have been taken care of in-house. At large employers, it is now common for building maintenance, security, kitchen, laundry and custodial staff not to work directly for the company they report to each day. Today, it is even common for hotel rooms to be cleaned by employees of temporary staffing agencies. The same goes for the workers who load trucks at retail distribution centers. This remains true as well for activities that have long been outsourced, like payroll and accounting services.This creates complications for the enforcement of employment law, because what workers actually do on the job — their schedules, the quality standards they are expected to meet, the procedures the need to follow — is often determined by their indirect employer, even though they are direct employees of a staffing agency or a franchise.How much responsibility do indirect employers have for compliance with employment regulations? The uncertainty around this question has been a burden for businesses, creating compliance costs and duplicate record keeping. It has exposed national brands and businesses that hire contractors to litigation when employment regulations are violated, and in other instances.Now the Trump administration has adopted a four-factor test to assess whether an indirect employer is a joint employer that would bear legal responsibility for violations of minimum-wage and overtime regulations. Take the example of McDonald’s and an independent franchise. McDonald’s would be deemed a joint employer if it hires or fires employees of the local franchise; supervises and controls employees’ work schedule or other conditions of employment to a substantial degree; determines employees’ pay; and maintains workers’ employment records.Typically, a company would have to meet some or all of these criteria to be liable for wage and hours violations.This is a narrower standard for determining joint-employer status than the practice that existed under the administration of President Barack Obama, which expanded the responsibilities of indirect employers in January 2016. The International Franchise Association (the largest organization representing franchises worldwide) argues that the broader criteria previously in place cost U.S. franchisees between $17 and $33 billion per year.The new rules — which will affect the behavior of workers and employers, and will influence court decisions — are a victory for common sense. They more clearly define the roles and responsibilities of different parties, which will make it easier for them to work together productively and efficiently. Indirect employers will know what steps to take to avoid legal liability and compliance costs and record-keeping costs. National brands will be shielded from litigation over employment issues in local franchises they could not control. Court decisions will become more uniform, which will help businesses. By reducing compliance costs, employers in the low-wage labor market will have more resources to grow their businesses.Sunday’s Department of Labor guidance is limited to regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act, a landmark piece of New Deal legislation that determines rules about wages and hours of work and prohibits child labor. It is part of a broader conversation about joint-employer status. The National Labor Relations Board, the government agency responsible for enforcing collective-bargaining laws, is expected to issue a similar rule in the next few weeks, reversing Obama-era policy that made it easier for contractors and workers in franchised businesses to unionize.These are welcome developments that will, on balance, accrue to the benefit of workers in the low-wage labor market. But it is important to point out that violations of labor law are all too common. A 2017 report by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, found that low-wage workers lose billions of dollars per year due to minimum-wage violations alone. Still, the best solution is better enforcement of labor law, not muddying roles and responsibilities in economic relationships.The Trump administration touts deregulation as one of its major accomplishments. These claims can be overblown. But this guidance is a feather in its cap.To contact the author of this story: Michael R.

2020-01-21,"In late 2019, shares of premium fast casual restaurant chain Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) plummeted on the heels of a disappointing third-quarter earnings report that included the company's slowest comparable sales growth rate in a year, significant margin compression and a reduced full-year comparable sales and margin guide. SHAK stock, which was flying high around $105 just a few weeks earlier, crashed to $55 a few weeks after the print.Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com Then, this year, Goldman Sachs turned bullish.Following an investor presentation from management, the analyst team at Goldman Sachs recently released a hugely bullish report on Shake Shack with a simple yet compelling thesis that went something like this:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShake Shack reported bad third-quarter numbers because of delivery headwinds related to the company moving from multiple delivery platforms to just one -- GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). Over the next quarter and into next year, those delivery headwinds will turn into tailwinds driven by marketing synergies with GrubHub, while menu innovation and international expansion tailwinds kick in. As that happens, the numbers will improve and Shake Shack's stock will bounce back.  * The 10 Best Value Stocks to Own in 2020 The market liked the sound of that. In response to the GS report, SHAK stock popped more than 10%. But I'm wary of this rebound.For one, there are bigger headwinds here than the delivery platform transition alone. I don't see those headwinds going away any time soon. And SHAK stock is still very richly valued. Ultimately, this combination of persistent headwinds and a full valuation could limit further upside in shares. Shake Shack Has Some ProblemsBulls want to blame Shake Shack's bad third-quarter performance -- 2% comparable sales growth (the worst in a year), 1.3% two-year-stack comparable sales growth (also the worst in a year), a nearly 300 basis point drop in restaurant-level operating margins (continuing a multi-quarter trend of huge margin compression), and a reduced full-year comps and margin guide -- on the fact that Shake Shack went from multiple delivery platforms to one delivery platform in the quarter.But does one small change really impact all of those financials that much?No. There are some much larger and longer-running headwinds at play here.First, new Shake Shack stores aren't performing up to par. Average weekly sales and average unit volumes have been in decline since 2015, and that decline isn't moderating. It's getting worse, because the more Shake Shack grows outside of its core high-income, urban-centric markets, the less well their stores perform on average. No matter how many new chicken options the company adds to the menu, this dynamic won't change, because it's built into Shake Shack's business model of high prices and small portions.Second, persistent cost pressures -- including rising wages, higher delivery packaging costs and food inflation -- are weighing on margins. These pressures aren't going anywhere. The labor market is full, so wages will keep rising. Delivery is the future of fast-food distribution, so those costs are sticking around. Food inflation will keep running higher as demand grows with strong economic activity.Third, the company is sticking to a cadence of roughly 40 new company-owned stores per year. That's a problem, because the store base is growing, but the number of new stores being added is not. So the unit growth rate is slowing, which is creating a natural drag on revenue growth rates. Shake Shack Stock Is Priced Too RichlyAll things considered, Shake Shack's numbers likely won't bounce back in 2020. If they don't, SHAK stock won't bounce back, either, because even after the selloff, shares remain very richly valued.The average restaurant stock trades around 26-times forward earnings. Shake Shack stock trades at 115-times forward earnings. Bulls will argue that Shake Shack only has 151 locations in America, versus 14,000 for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), so SHAK stock deserves its premium valuation because of its huge long-term growth potential.Fair enough on the face of it. But let's play that scenario out.Shake Shack will never be as big as McDonald's. McDonald's caters to the entire income spectrum; Shake Shack's customers are in the $100,000 and up income bracket. Only 30% of American households belong in that bracket, and far less at a global level. But to be aggressive, let's assume that in a best-case scenario, Shake Shack can one day be 30% the size of McDonald's.McDonald's is a $160 billion company. The 100th McDonald's store opened in 1959, so to go from 100 stores to where they are today, it took McDonald's 61 years. Again being aggressive, let's say Shake Shack can go from its 100th company-owned store (opened in 2Q18) to 30% of McDonald's size in about 30 to 35 years, implying a roughly $50 billion market cap for Shake Shack by around 2051.Now let's discount that market cap target back by 10% per year. That equates to a $2.6 billion market cap today.Shake Shack's market cap as of this writing is over $2.6 billion. Even if you assume that Shake Shacks gets to 30% the size of McDonald's globally within 30 to 35 years (which, to my mind, is a best-case scenario), then SHAK stock today still isn't undervalued. Bottom Line on SHAK StockBulls would have you believe that Shake Shack's bad third-quarter numbers were the result of near-term delivery headwinds that won't persist for much longer. I don't buy that. There are much larger- and longer-running headwinds at play that will continue to adversely impact Shake Shack's growth trajectory for the foreseeable future.SHAK stock, at a triple-digit forward earnings multiple, isn't priced for this.

2020-01-21,"Coronavirus worries weighed on stocks, as investors try to balance buying the dip and remaining cautious. Let's look at a few top stock trades for this shortened trading week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Roku (ROKU)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has been trading really poorly lately, with the exception of Tuesday. Despite its nearly 5% rally, there's still a lot of &quot;junk&quot; overhead. That is to say, the chart just isn't clean right now.Some investors will say Roku is clearing downtrend resistance (purple line), while others will say it has yet to do so (brown line). Either way, it's trying to reclaim its 20-day moving average, and is still below its 50-day moving average.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI don't really like messy charts. However, we can simplify this one. On the upside, let's see if Roku can clear the 50-day moving average near $141.75. Above it puts $150 on the table, a notable level since August, and it's also where the backside of prior uptrend support (blue line) comes into play.  * The 10 Best Value Stocks to Own in 2020 On the downside, look to see if Roku breaks below $127.50 support. Below puts the $117.50 to $120 area, and the 200-day moving average on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Netflix (NFLX)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comOn Tuesday after the close, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will report earnings. While the stock suffered badly in the third quarter, it has performed quite well since the start of the fourth quarter. Even though bulls are in control at the moment, this one tends to be a wild mover on earnings.Shares have reclaimed the 200-day moving average and continue to ride the 20-day moving average higher. However, the stock hasn't been able to reclaim prior range support near $340.The setup now is simple: Either bulls rally NFLX stock on earnings and reclaim $340, or shares pull back.If it's the former, look to see if NFLX can fill the gap back up toward $362. Above it puts $370 on the table, followed by range resistance at $385. On a pullback below the 20-day moving average, look for support from the 200-day moving average near $323, with the 50-day moving average and uptrend support at $315. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Yeti (YETI)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comYeti (NYSE:YETI) posted big gains on the day, but is hitting a critical level on the upside. The $35 to $36.50 zone has been a big level of resistance over the past year, as investors have failed to sustain any of the stock's rallies over this area.On the plus side, the stock continues to put in a series of higher lows and is not overbought -- technically speaking.If Yeti can clear Tuesday's high, it puts the 2019 high just over $38 on the table. Over that, and $40-plus can be achieved amid a powerful breakout. Likewise, resting in this $35 to $37 zone could give Yeti stock a necessary pause before continuing higher too.  * 4 Marijuana Stocks to Buy for the Big 2020 Rebound Below $35 may keep resistance in play for the time being, and likely puts the 20-day moving average in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: McDonald's (MCD)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock began struggling in October, but was then hammered after earnings. The stock fell 15% from peak to trough, and dropped below all of its major moving averages.Since bottoming in early November, McDonald's stock has been acting much better, and the stock has really taken flight so far in 2020. Shares are technically overbought (blue circle), but are now taking pause.If MCD continues higher, look to see if it can reclaim $215. Over $215 puts $220 resistance on the table. However, a controlled pullback to the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) would be ideal for bulls to buy the dip. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Beyond Meat (BYND)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) remains volatile, rallying about 11% on Tuesday and moving out of that nice bullish consolidation from last week.Let's see if BYND can take out last week's high near $135. Above $140, and the $170 area may be possible. On a pullback, see that $110 buoys Beyond. Below the backside of prior downtrend resistance (blue line), and the 20-day or 50-day moving average is possible.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-01-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude posted the worst weekly decline in more than a year on concern that the spread of China’s coronavirus will cripple fuel demand. Brent futures sank 2.2% in London on Friday. Deaths from the coronavirus rose to at least 26 and China expanded travel restrictions for about 40 million people in an attempt to halt contagion. The U.S. is monitoring more than 60 people for potential infection and lawmakers said health authorities are expected to confirm a third case.The Asian virus has spooked traders even as the World Health Organization stopped short of declaring a global health emergency. The contagion is disrupting travel during the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions normally fly or ride home. The selloff has accelerated as trend-following funds turned bearish, according to TD Securities.“Contagion fears are spiking ahead of the biggest yearly migration ahead of new year,” said Daniel Ghali, a commodities strategist at TD Securities. “The fear factor is the risk of contagion, synonymous to what happened in 2003 with SARS which led to a 2% drop in Chinese economic growth.”The fast-spreading virus is the latest challenge for a market that’s been buffeted this year by geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the phase-one trade deal between Beijing and Washington. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said earlier this week that, if the coronavirus has an impact similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, demand could be curbed by 260,000 barrels a day. While this is not the first time global oil markets contend with an epidemic threatening demand, the current supply environment could worsen the situation.“The slightest fear of any economic slowdown will spur a long wave of liquidations because the market is so oversupplied,” said Walter Zimmermann, chief technical strategist at ICAP Technical Analysis.Some businesses in China including McDonald’s Corp. and Starbucks Corp. temporarily shut some stores in efforts to contain the virus.See also: China’s Economy Was Brightening This Month Before Virus Fear HitBrent crude for March settlement fell $1.35 to settle at $60.69 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in New York putting its premium over WTI for the same month at $6.50 a barrel. Brent futures fell 6.4% this week.West Texas Intermediate futures for March delivery slipped $1.40 to end the session at $54.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level since October. Meanwhile, based on the commodity’s relative strength index, WTI is sitting in oversold territory and is due for a rally.Options traders are paying the most since Oct. 31 for protection against price swings, according to the CBOE/CME WTI volatility index.&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill, Grant Smith and Saket Sundria.To contact the reporter on this story: Jackie Davalos in New York at jdavalos10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Jessica Summers, Mike JeffersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oil Posts Worst Week in a Year as Virus Selloff Deepens
2020-01-24,"McDonald's Corp.  said Friday that it has shut stores in Wuhan and surrounding cities in China due to the coronavirus outbreak. In a statement from McDonald's in Asia, the company said that the fast-food giant's operations in the Hubei province are normally in cities where public transportation is accessible. In Wuhan, Ezhou, Huanggang, Qianjiang and Xiantao, public transport has been suspended. Across China, McDonald's has taken measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, including a required system of measuring worker body temperatures when they arrive for work; the distribution of masks to crew members and hand sanitizers to customers; and stepped up cleaning of delivery boxes after they return to the restaurant.

2020-01-24,"Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) continues to capture investors' interest. After surging to almost $240 per share in July, the stock when on a cold streak. Shares continued to tick lower and just when it looked like Beyond Meat stock might really crack, the bulls came surging back.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com Shares erupted over resistance and ran more than 80% as the stock price climbed from $75 to more than $135 in just a few trading sessions. As should be expected at this point, Beyond Meat stock remains as volatile as ever. Partnership PotentialBeyond Meat stock has been on fire this month, but much of the catalysts have come from the headlines. For instance, innovations from privately held Impossible Foods sparked BYND's rally earlier this month, as the company is pushing into plant-based meatless pork and sausage products.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be fair, Beyond has already gone in this direction, and supplies it for breakfast sandwiches at some Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) locations. But as the industry continues to expand and gain momentum, so too does Beyond Meat.  * 10 Stocks to Buy as the 2020 Presidential Election Approaches Impossible Foods not working with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) due to supply constraints and McDonald's expanding its pilot with Beyond also sparked a rally in BYND stock. So too did reports of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) exploring plant-based menu options.These are big-time players in the fast-food and fast-casual space that could trigger plenty of long-term future demand. Of course, the risk is that consumer demand peters out, which is exactly what hurt Beyond Meat stock after such a hearty rally. News that Burger King will lower the price of its Impossible Whopper due to waning demand weighed on Beyond Meat stock on Wednesday, although the stock recouped some of its losses before closing lower by 5.25%.At the end of the day, potential partnerships with Starbucks, McDonald's and others would mean big business for Beyond Meat. But if the stock rallies aggressively before any deals are announced, it could lead to short- and intermediate-term disappointment, especially if no deal materializes. Trading BYND StockBeyond Meat stock has surely minted some traders with a boatload of cash -- and dealt swift blows to others. The stock has been a tough one to get a handle on, as you can see on the chart below.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comHowever, those that have gotten aboard the stock in the right direction have seen big-time payouts. Look at the latest run for an example. Shares ripped from $75 to $135 -- an 80% rally -- in six trading sessions. Two days later and BYND had shed almost 20%.So, what now?I'm looking at the $110 and $136 areas. The latter was notable support throughout the summer and has twice acted as resistance amid the current rally. If Beyond Meat cannot reclaim this zone, lower prices may be in order.As for $110, this level marks the backside of prior downtrend resistance (blue line) and was (roughly) the breakout level from the stock's short-lived consolidation phase this month (purple wedge). Below $107 -- the consolidation zone low -- and $100 or lower may be on the table.It's very important to use discipline with a stock like this. If you don't have discipline, don't touch Beyond Meat stock! Bottom Line on Beyond Meat StockBeyond Meat stock isn't unlike cannabis stocks. That is to say, the valuation based on today's numbers is just silly and the price action is simply erratic and unpredictable. But investors who believe in its long-term potential may justify a position in this speculative play.I say speculative because of the volatility and how unpredictable its industry may be. I personally think meatless products have a market, but I'm not sure how big that market is. Or how big it will become in two years, five years or ten years. Does it remain a niche category or does it become widespread?It's too hard for me to tell.Beyond has reported three out of its four fiscal quarters for 2019. While analysts expect it to lose 18 cents per share for the year, they call for a turn to profitability in 2020. Consensus estimates call for earnings of 41 cents per share next year. That's on a 74% gain in sales to $488 million.So far, Beyond Meat stock has beat on earnings and revenue estimates in all three of its public earnings reports. If -- and this is a big if -- Beyond Meat can deliver on profit in 2020 and hit $500 million in sales, bulls may be able to maintain momentum and give the short-sellers a good squeeze.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-01-24,"Are you buying what Wall Street is selling today? If it involves Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock I'd suggest politely declining headline worries and instead work on placing a first order in shares or even a second helping. Let me explain.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com Wednesday wasn't a great day using a straightforward price performance metric in BYND shares. The faux-meat upstart and recent IPO finished the day off by 5.25%. Thursday saw another 3.7% trimmed off the price before after-hours trading gave back 2%To be sure, a drop of that size could be and most often is considered a large eye-poke for most publicly traded companies. Importantly though, in Beyond Meat stock you could rightfully label the price action a case of mild indigestion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe fact is BYND stock has been one of the markets standout performers in early 2020. Shares have soared more than 60% in less than three weeks. Earlier this month rival and privately held Impossible Meats announced it was axing its pursuit to get on to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) menu. That's good news as Beyond Meat looks to lock up its own licensing agreement with the fast food behemoth. And in turn, investors sent shares soaring by as much as 80% in six trading sessions.  * 9 Up-and-Coming Small-Cap Stocks to Watch This week BYND stock saw another supportive flame lit under shares. On Tuesday Beyond Meat jumped 18% after coffee and breakfast-fix giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) announced plans to explore plant-based menu options as it strives to become a &quot;resource-positive&quot; company.In 2020's more complete context, the combined Wednesday-Thursday 8.3% grilling is mostly insignificant and easily chalked up to simple profit-taking. But if you're aching to point fingers somewhere else, look no further than Burger King's largest franchisee Carrols Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:TAST).On Wednesday the company announced sales of its Impossible Foods-based Whooper are off to 28 per store per day from 32 in its last reporting period. Unsurprisingly, the news stoked concern the fake meat market is dead in its tracks. But is it? At the end of the day, if baby bull markets are raised out of fear and forced to climb walls of worry, BYND stock has a lot going for it off and on the price chart. Beyond Meat Stock, by the Chart  Source: Charts by TradingViewYou could say I've been an early advocate of Beyond Meat stock. Not only is the company's product routinely found in my fridge, but in early January, I also detailed an early-bird buy strategy at $81 in front of BYND's massive breakout from a key congestion pattern.  * The Top 5 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for 2020 The resulting price action has re-established Beyond Meat's deserved reputation as a volatile momentum stock. It's not for the faint of heart. But for those investors comfortable with those risks and owning one of the market's top growth and hotly contested battleground stocks, there are ways to reduce the chances of owning a fatty investment that's unkind to the portfolio.One way to enter into Beyond Meat stock is momentum-based and wait for a price move through $138. This entry is a couple percentage points above the recent high. It makes an allowance for price volatility while also clearing the Fibonacci 38% resistance level. I'd use this week's closing high of $129.18 as an initial stop to guard against possible larger losses.Bottom line, this is a potentially very fast, money-style trade and taking initial profits near the 50% retracement level at $155 makes sense in relation to the risks taken on the price chart. Moreover, with earnings less than two weeks out, this exposure needs to be actively reassessed. And if you're like me, that should include using Beyond Meat stock's options market for more secure, risk-adjusted opportunities.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management currently own positions in Beyond Meat (BYND) stock and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.

2020-01-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Adyen NV will process payments for tens of thousands of Subway Restaurant’s stores in the U.S. and Canada, under a deal with the fast-food chain announced Tuesday.Adyen Chief Operating Officer Kamran Zaki said in an interview that his company would help Subway process orders in more than 20,000 venues across North America, adding that the fast-food firm is one of the biggest in terms of number of locations. Adyen has already started processing Subway payments in some stores.The Dutch company is facing off with firms like San Francisco-based Stripe Inc. to sign on more merchants, positioning itself to bank a slice of customers’ transactions. EBay Inc. in 2018 announced it would ditch its longtime partner PayPal Holdings Inc. in favor of Adyen.The deal to process payments for orders in-restaurant, online and through the Subway app comes as Adyen signs on a growing number of customers in the food and beverage industry. Adyen in December said it’d clinched a deal to process McDonald’s Corp.’s mobile app transactions.“This is material and not a side project with a fantastic name,” Pieter van der Does, Adyen’s chief executive officer, said of the Subway partnership in an interview.As global e-commerce continues to rise and as merchants look to facilitate customers’ payments, Adyen’s shares have increased three-fold since its initial public offering in June 2018. The Amsterdam-based company offers merchants payment processing both online and in stores and in a variety of local currencies. Other customers include Uber Technologies Inc., EasyJet Plc and Birchbox Inc., according to its website.In a statement, Subway Chief Information Officer Mike Macrie said “Adyen’s payment platform will further allow Subway to bring the latest digital payment technologies to market,” as it continues its digital push to offer guests greater convenience.To contact the reporter on this story: Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels at ndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Nate LanxonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Subway Inks Payments Deal With Adyen for U.S., Canada"

2020-01-31,"With its sprint toward $60 per share during January, the market capitalization of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) passed that of Verizon (NYSE:VZ).Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com Over the last five years, shares in the flavored water company have gone up an average of 8% per year. The dividend has averaged a yield of about 3%. The latest move upward, in anticipation of what turned out to be very good earnings, dropped that yield to 2.8%.Earnings came in at $2 billion, 48 cents per share, more than doubling 2018's $870 million and 20 cents, while revenue of $9.1 billion was up 16% on last year's $7.8 billion. The numbers were only a slight beat on estimates and the stock rose about 3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Conservative GrowthThe numbers, and the reaction to them, mask the basic truth of Coca-Cola as an investment. This is one of the most conservative stocks you can own. The company has raised its dividend for 57 consecutive years.Coca-Cola is conservative in the nicest possible way. Profits grow slowly, but steadily. The company is constantly adjusting the product mix and marketing message to meet changing tastes. This time it was Fuze tea and various flavors of Coke that got the credit.  * 7 Under-the-Radar European Stocks to Buy for 2020 Revenues had been declining since 2015, but 2019 represented a return to growth of about 10%. This is another knob the company can adjust. It bought out bottlers early in the last decade, then refranchised them later in the decade. This is similar to what fast food companies can do, either controlling all the cash as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) does or holding just the most profitable franchise parts as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) does.These structural changes led Credit Suisse to upgrade Coca-Cola shares early in January, driving the rally. Coca-Cola passed its 100th anniversary as a publicly traded company last year and has always communicated with the Street. Coffee or Plastic?If you're looking for what's next, Coca-Cola completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee last year. Costa is one of the biggest coffee shop franchises Americans have never heard of, but it's very big in the United Kingdom, where it rivals Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).Costa was the first big deal for the company under Englishman James Quincey, who became CEO in 2017. Costa had 449 shops in China at the time of the deal. It also sells a packaged coffee called Costa Express.Quincey's second big deal has been to treat Coca-Cola itself as a brand, not a soda. In addition to various &quot;flavors&quot; of Coke, there are now Coca Cola Energy drinks, with extra caffeine and additives like Guarana.At this year's World Economic Forum Coke came under fire for its use of plastic bottles, which are much lighter than glass and thus cheaper to transport. The company responded with a plan to move toward biodegradable plastics. As with everything else, it will move deliberately. The Bottom Line on Coca-Cola StockAs investors grow more cautious, stocks like Coca-Cola become more popular.Coke shares fell almost 50% during the 2008 financial meltdown but quickly began recovering in 2009. Their strength led the general market early in the decade, then fell behind, but the shares have doubled in value during the recovery.When a new recession hits, expect that pattern to return. The company's share price passed its 2008 high early in 2011 and never looked back, while delivering steadily rising income.That's what you're looking for when you buy Coca-Cola. It won't make you rich, but the stock symbol KO won't hurt you either.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2020-02-04,"There are thousands of stocks traded in the major exchanges, and it’s not easy to track their movements. A head for numbers helps, but so does a knack for timing. Understanding both helps to make sense of the earnings season.Once every quarter, publicly traded companies are required to release their financial results – revenues, sales numbers, earnings, and the like. These are the metrics that stock followers use to decide their investment allocations, and share prices tend to rise and fall on the expectations, and the realities, of the quarterly reports.Just last week, three great stalwarts of the Dow Jones index reported their earnings for the final quarter of calendar year 2019. The Dow, of course, is the classic stock index – a group of 30 companies selected to represent the larger market, as their smaller number makes them easier to track collectively – and the companies comprising the index are major names in their sectors.Using the Stock Comparison tool from TipRanks, we can look at these three companies, side by side, comparing their attributes. All are Buy-rated, show an upside between 5% and 10%, and are on an upward trajectory. Let’s take a closer look. McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)McDonald’s – the modern fast-food colossus created from the vision of salesman Ray Kroc – has shown strong gains in recent years, the fruits of an ambitious turnaround plan by now-former CEO Steve Easterbrook. While Easterbrook had to leave the company in disgrace this past November, causing the stock to dip sharply in response, his plan continues to bolster the company’s prospects. MCD shares gained 12% in 2019, less than the broader market but still a reliable gain. Also good for investors is the dividend, which at 2.31%, yields significantly more than the market average.The company’s earnings disappointed in Q3, but Q4 gave MCD shares a boost. EPS came in at $1.97 and revenues were reported at $5.3 billion, both in line with the Street’s forecast. The numbers were a relief, coming from a company that had to fire its CEO during the quarter. In better news for investors, and a testament to the company’s success at rebranding itself, global same-store sales numbers grew 5.9%, well above the forecast. Investors have been sanguine about MCD’s prospects heading into 2020, and the stock is up 9% so far this year.Writing on the stock for Evercore ISI, 5-star analyst David Palmer says, “We believe 2020 is positioned to be a strong year for McDonald’s. A large portion of the US EOTF investment heavy lifting is in the rear view mirror and there is strong system alignment around the outlook for 2020 with a focus on: 1) advertising effectiveness, 2) value marketing efficiency, 3) premium menu innovation/renovation, 4) improving focus on operations, and 5) technology integration…”In line with his bullish view of the stock, Palmer maintains his Buy rating and puts a $230 price target on MCD, implying a possible upside of 7%. (To watch Palmer’s track record, click here)McDonald’s holds a Strong Buy consensus rating from the analysts, based on a lopsided split of 16 Buys to 3 Holds. There are no sell-side reviews. Shares are trading for $215.18, and the $229.88 average price target suggests a potential upside of 7%. (See McDonald’s stock analysis on TipRanks) Coca-Cola Company (KO)Our next stock is a beloved staple of Warren Buffett’s portfolio. The investing guru has always loved the product, but even more, he loves the stock. Coke’s superb branding (everyone recognizes it), long-term gains (it’s up 41% over the past five years), and its reliable dividend (at 2.74%, the yield beats the market average and Treasury bonds) combine to make the stock a fine vehicle for steady returns.Coke’s steady momentum shows in its 2019 gain of 20%. It underperformed the broader market by about a third, but nothing seems to slow it down. The 40-cent dividend is reliable, paid out every quarter, and the 71% payout ratio shows that the company can afford the dividend and is committed to sharing profits with stockholders. This is a near-perfect long-term investment, as Buffett would attest.KO met or exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for 2H19, with solid performances in both Q3 and Q4. The Q4 report showed EPS as forecasted, at 44 cents, while revenues beat the consensus estimate at $9.07 billion. Even though soda consumption has been slowing in recent quarters, the company has compensated with a combination of new products and smaller cans. This drove a 135% increase in net income from the year-ago quarter.The analysts are pleased with Coke’s performance. Nik Modi, of RBC Capital, laid it out clearly, saying, “KO continued to ride on its momentum and exited 2019 with solid results, with a top-line beat and in-line earnings growth. 2020 guidance was in line with consensus and our expectations. A really good quarter with hardly any holes to poke.”Modi gives KO shares a Buy rating with a $66 price target, raised from his previous target of $60. His new target implies room for 13% share appreciation. (To watch Modi’s track record, click here)Analyst Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank concurs, writing in his recent review of the stock, “We have great confidence that KO is well-positioned to grow in line with its +4-6% top-line algorithm into the future, given global revenue growth management initiatives, innovation, portfolio expansion, and general global system alignment.”Powers maintains his Buy rating and $64 price target, indicating 9% upside potential. (To watch Powers’ track record, click here)With 14 reviews, including 11 Buys and 3 Holds, KO shares have a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The average price target of $63.57 suggests upside potential of 9% from the current share price of $58.58. (See Coca-Cola stock analysis on TipRanks) Apple, Inc. (AAPL)Last up is Apple, Steve Jobs’ baby that continues to shape the way we interact with the digital world. From the iPod to the wearable Apple Watch, this company has always positioned itself with one foot solidly at the forefront of technology. The strategy has worked, and today, Apple is the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $1.35 trillion.Like the other stocks on this list, Apple has momentum on its side. Shares are up 160% over the past five years, rose 89% in 2019, and have started 2020 with a 5% gain. It’s a steady record of share appreciation for stockholders’ benefit. The company pays a modest dividend, with a yield of just 1%, but the payment is reliable. Apple has also raised the dividend twice in the last three years.Adding to the good news, AAPL beat the forecasts in every quarter of calendar year 2019, with the fourth (fiscal Q1) showing the widest margin. EPS beat the forecast by 44 cents, coming in at $4.99. Revenues were $91.8 billion, where the forecast was $88.5 billion. Additionally, iPhone revenues rose after a disappointing Q3, gross margins rose to 38.4%, and the company raised its Q2 guidance.Among the bulls is Brian White, of Monness. He says of AAPL, “Looking forward, we anticipate healthy demand for Services and Wearables to continue. Also, we expect Apple to benefit from the launch of its first 5G iPhones in September… Our balanced view of this cycle reflects the maturity of the smartphone market and our expectation that consumers will take a measured approach to upgrading to 5G…”White raised his price target on AAPL from $300 to $370, implying an upside of 20%, and gives the stock a Buy rating. (To watch White’s track record, click here)In agreement with White is Daniel Ives, 5-star analyst from Wedbush. After watching the Q1 earnings presentation, Ives said, “We … view last night as one of Cook’s crowning achievements which put the finishing touches on a comeback story for the records books.” Ives believes that Apple will reach a $2 trillion valuation within two years.In line with his uber-bull stance, Ives gives AAPL shares a $400 price target and Buy rating. His target indicates confidence in a 30% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)Apple has the most mixed reviews of the stocks on this list, 36 of them, including 22 Buys, 12 Holds, and 2 Sells. Shares are not cheap, at $308.66, and the $340.43 average price target suggests an upside potential of 10%.

2020-02-06,"When it comes to dividend stocks, yield isn't everything. If you're an income investor in it for the long haul, you know that steadily rising payouts are a vital factor, too.For one, dividend increases lift the yield on an investor's original cost basis, meaning today's 1% yield might be much more in the future. They're also indicative of a firm's ability to withstand the ups and downs of the economy, as well as the stock market.Enter the Dividend Aristocrats.The Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the S&P; 500 Index that have improved their annual payouts every year for at least 25 consecutive years. It's a mix of household names as well as companies with less name recognition that nonetheless play an outsize role in the American economy, even if it's mostly behind the scenes. But all of them offer some size, longevity and familiarity, providing comfort amid market uncertainty.Here are the current 64 Dividend Aristocrats - including the newest faces that were just added in January 2020.

2020-02-07,"Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is rolling again, despite being one of 2019's biggest bubbles. Beyond Meat stock climbed from an initial public offering price of $25 on May 1 to almost $240 by the end of July. By year-end, the company had fallen over two-thirds from its peak.Source: Shutterstock Of course, even after the decline, those investors fortunate enough to get in at the IPO price had tripled their money. Shares rose 163% on the first day, and another 15% over the rest of the year. And Beyond Meat stock has turned up again in 2020: its 46% rally makes it the eleventh-best mid-cap performer so far in 2020, of over 1,100 such stocks.Certainly, the optimism makes some sense. The market for plant-based meat will be large. Beyond Meat turned a profit in the third quarter. Wall Street expects increased earnings in 2020 and for years to come. Investors, meanwhile, have proven in recent years that they will pay dearly for fast-growing and profitable revenue.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut there are reasons for caution as well. Two key risks, in fact, present potential stumbling blocks to Beyond Meat stock in 2020. And while I don't necessarily expect another bubble to pop, I do expect that the company will at least see a correction or two as the year rolls on. Plant-Based Meat Takes a LeapThe plant-based meat industry unquestionably took a huge step forward in 2019. Restaurant Brands International's (NYSE:QSR) Burger King launched the Impossible Whopper, from Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods. Impossible products are available at White Castle, Qdoba and even in Disney (NYSE:DIS) theme parks.Beyond Meat has expanded its distribution as well, to the likes of Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN), Carl's Jr., Subway and TGI Friday's. Meanwhile, retail sales have skyrocketed as well. Through the first nine months of 2019, Beyond Meat generated over $100 million in retail sales. The figure increased nearly 200% year-over-year.  * 7 Biotech Stocks to Buy That Could Beat the Coronavirus Sales are skyrocketing. Distribution continues to expand. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) still looms as the &quot;Holy Grail,&quot; assuming a trial of the &quot;P.L.T&quot; in Canada goes well. Surely, given recent growth, fake meat doesn't seem like it could be a fad. Is 'Fake Meat' a Fad?But I've tried plant-based burgers myself. I didn't hate them … but I'd hardly eat one every week. And I can't help but wonder how many consumers feel the same way. Sales for Beyond Meat and other plant-based burgers are getting a big bump right now from curious consumers. It remains clear how many of those first-time buyers will become regular consumers -- or even just second-time buyers.And the industry needs big sales beyond the vegan market. That market simply isn't large enough, and it already has an established provider in Kellogg (NYSE:K) unit MorningStar Farms. I'm one of the many customers who like plant-based meat. But how many of us like it enough?Meanwhile, plant-based meat is not healthy: whether it's the Beyond Burger or the Impossible Whopper, &quot;they are super, highly processed foods,&quot; as Whole Foods CEO John Mackey put it. Real meat has health concerns too. But if there's a trade-off with taste for little, or no, nutritional improvement, plant-based meat remains a curiosity at best. Beyond Meat stock is not priced for its product to remain a curiosity.Again, I'd expect that sales and revenue will still grow going forward. But Beyond Meat has a market capitalization over $7 billion. Impossible Foods reportedly is looking to raise capital at a $5 billion valuation and could itself go public in the next year or two. These are big numbers that require a big market. If any restaurant partners fall away -- as Tim Hortons did just last week -- investors may wonder if that market really is big enough. The stock simply isn't priced for that risk. The Competitive Risk to Beyond Meat StockAnd even if the market for fake meat is as large as hoped, Beyond Meat's competition is going to stiffen in 2020. Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods get most of the headlines, but giants are targeting plant-based meat as well.Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) is making a big push. Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), which invested in Beyond Meat before its IPO, is developing its own fake meat. Sysco (NYSE:SYY) has developed a plant-based burger patty for its foodservice customer, including colleges. There's no doubt that they're an attractive market.Beyond Meat has the first-mover advantage. But that doesn't guarantee success. As regular readers know, I'm always looking for major trends that can deliver huge returns. Plant-based meat might be one of those trends. Even if it is, the returns also might be spread out among several, if not dozens, of companies.Beyond Meat isn't Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) or even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in that it's years ahead of competitors. Those competitors are on its heels. And they're catching up. A History LessonLast decade, one of the big trends in U.S. food was &quot;gluten-free.&quot; That industry's leader was Boulder Brands, whose portfolio included Udi's, Glutino, and Earth Balance plant-based butters.Gluten-free became a buzzword. And Boulder stock soared. Beginning in 2012, it more than tripled in less than to years, reaching a price above $16. Within a year, the stock lost 40% of its value. The company sold itself to Pinnacle Foods for $11.National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ) almost single handedly created the sparkling water market with LaCroix. Its growth has stalled out amid increased competition, and its stock has dropped over 60%.Obviously, there are differences between Beyond Meat, LaCroix and Boulder Brands. But there may well be similarities as well. Consumer tastes change. Trends aren't always as sustainable as they appear. &quot;Hot&quot; markets attract new, larger competitors with deep pockets.This doesn't mean Beyond Meat is a bubble. It doesn't make the stock a short. But history does suggest at least some caution. After the big 2020 rally, Beyond Meat stock looks priced for perfection.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-02-14,"Year-to-date, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock is up an eye-popping 54%. Yet that BYND share price is still more than 50% below its all-time high of $239.71 seen on July 26, 2019, leaving many investors wondering if now maybe a good time to buy into the shares.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com As the California-headquartered company is scheduled to report earnings later this month, I expect increased volatility in the coming days, possibly with a downward bias in BYND stock. Long-term investors may regard a dip below $100 and especially toward the $80 level as opportunity to get long in the shares. What to Expect from Beyond Meat's Q4 EarningsThe plant-based meat substitute company topped estimates and reported its first quarterly profit with its Q3 earnings in October. Revenue of $92 million was better than the estimated $82.2 million. Earnings per share also came at 6 cents vs. the 3 cents expected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs for the revenue streams, Beyond has two main segments: Gross Fresh Platform (over 95% of revenue) and Gross Frozen Platform (about 5% of revenue). Restaurant and foodservice accounts for about 45% of sales, while retail makes up the other 55%. Management highlighted that sales grew across both customer segment.Analysts would like to see that the positive Q3 trends continued into the year's final period.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends Although the group raised revenue outlook for the year from about $240 million to a range of $265 million-$275 million, BYND stock dropped from about $108 to a low of about $71 in a matter of weeks following the earnings report. However, since then the share price has recovered and is currently hovering around $117. Long-Term CatalystsRecent research led by Christopher Gardner of Stanford University discusses the protein-consuming habits of Americans, including various drawbacks and ways to eat better. Both nationwide and globally, the debate on the effect of animal meat on environmental, health, and ethical concerns is indeed increasing.Many scientists and analysts agree that discourse around reduced consumption of animal-based meat is likely to gather pace in this new decade. And the number of people switching to or at least trying meatless, plant-based protein foods will likely increase. Therefore, Beyond Meat is possibly at the right place at the right time.Companies like beyond meat offer products that &quot;approximate certain aesthetic qualities, such as texture, flavor, and color, and nutritional characteristics of specific types of meat.&quot;Q3 earnings showed that the group is working to increase its restaurant partnerships, including McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) KFC unit. Management has also expressed interest to expand internationally, including China.However, the maker of plant-based burgers is also facing increased competition from traditional food companies as well as new entrants into the industry. For example, products by privately owned Impossible Foods is getting consumers' attention.Furthermore, in January, Restaurant Brands International's (NYSE:QSR) Tim Hortons said that the group would not offer Beyond Meat products any more. In other words, the meatless segment within the industry will draw in more companies with a wide range of plant-based food offerings. And the increased competition is likely to compress the margins of BYND stock and affect its valuation levels. What Could Derail BYND Stock?Valuation: Successful investing requires discipline. Therefore, I cannot advocate buying shares of companies at expensive valuations without doing extensive due diligence. Currently BYND stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 285, expensive by any standard.Another metric I pay attention to is the stocks's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which stands at about 26x. To put the metric into perspective, the S&P 500 index average price-sales ratio is 2.3x.The company can possibly still persist for several quarters in holding expensive valuation ratios well above S&P 500 or industry averages. For example, we have recently experienced such high valuations in many cannabis stocks in the past few years. However, then 2019 saw the bubble burst in most marijuana shares.In other words, if the company cannot keep up with the current aggressive growth assumptions, then shareholders may become more concerned about these rich valuation levels and the stock price could easily suffer.Profit-taking: If you are an investor who also pays attention to short-term technical charts, you may be interested to know that the short-term analysis is urging investors to exercise caution. While long-term investors would like to see BYND stock go over the $125 level, traders are likely to keep the range between $90 and $110.Therefore, based on your own risk/return profile, you may want to review your BYND stock holding and take some money off the table. Alternatively if you are experienced in hedging with options, you may consider initiating a covered call or protective put position.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy For Insulation From Volatility Finally, if you believe that you'd be able to ride out any short-term potential decline in the share price, then you may decide to do nothing at this point. The Bottom LineQ4 results from Beyond Meat should give a better indication as to whether the manufacturer will be able to satisfy investor risk appetite in the months ahead. It is important to remember that the company operates in a niche segment within the food industry. Therefore, beyond the initial hype most investors will eventually judge the company by the industry's average valuation metrics.Although I believe management will successfully take the necessary steps to grow the company profitably in the long run, I do not think the stock will repeat its recent exponential up-move in the next few weeks.This is a momentum stock. Therefore, investors should expect increased volatility around the earnings report date. Unless the group reports extremely strong numbers, we may have a repeat of the price action following the Q3 results, whereby Beyond Meat stock price initially decreases as many investors decide to take profits.Yet within three or four years, investors who buy the shares on the dips are likely to be rewarded handsomely. In the meantime, Beyond Meat may also find itself in the middle of a bidding war from various competitors to be acquired.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-14,"With a booming economy, one of the natural places for people seeking growth opportunities are food and restaurant stocks. Under belt-tightening conditions, you'll typically see more demand for discount-centric businesses. But as it stands, the headline numbers are positive -- bolstering the case for the wider restaurant industry.That said, I'd be remiss not to mention the inherent risks of the coronavirus from China. At the latest count -- and this will surely change for the worse - over 60,000 cases are confirmed, with at least 1,300 dead. Moreover, business consultancy firm Bain & Co. estimates that China's GDP for this year could be negatively impacted to the tune of $43 billion to $72 billion. Obviously, that's not the greatest news for restaurant stocks, especially those with exposure to China.On the flipside, food and restaurant stocks benefit from demographic realities. According to the Pew Research Center, millennials represent the largest generation in the workforce. While they may not be the richest generation -- that still belongs to the baby boomers -- they have cash flow due to their employment status.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs studies have shown, just their presence alone is creating changes in the food-service industry. Further, experts in the space predict that millennials will be the biggest food and beverage spenders within a decade. So, while the coronavirus presents an immediate threat, restaurant stocks are riding a much longer-term bullish wave.Plus, fears about the coronavirus may offer discounted opportunities in various food stocks. At some point, health officials will get a hold of the crisis. And when they do, the narrative will presumably shift positively.  * 20 Stocks to Buy From the Law of Accelerating Returns So, with that in mind, here are nine food and restaurant stocks to buy that investors should dine in on. Food and Restaurant Stocks to Buy: Domino's Pizza (DPZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com At first glance, Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) doesn't appear to be a viable name among restaurant stocks to buy.After all, studies suggest that millennials prefer fresh and healthy foods. And that trend may &quot;exacerbate&quot; for fast-food eateries, as older millennials become parents. Still, I think you should consider DPZ stock for one very important reason: Americans love pizza!In 2012, pizza restaurant sales totaled $36.8 billion. By 2019, this figure increased to $46.3 billion. With few exceptions, sales have steadily risen every year. More importantly for DPZ stock, Domino's has a massive footprint in the U.S. In 2018, the company rang up $6.59 billion domestically, beating out big names like Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) Pizza Hut and Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA). McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is in a similar boat with Domino's in that MCD stock doesn't immediately appear a strong candidate for a restaurant stocks to buy.Given millennial consumers' penchant for healthy foods, the Golden Arches is basically the Donald Trump of fast food. In other words, it's the opposite of what the modern consumer wants.However, fast-food consumption has accelerated over the years, presumably because economic and labor force conditions warrant such expenditures. Therefore, there are more people that eat fast food at least one to three times per week versus those who eat less than once per week.  * The Top 3 Infrastructure Stocks to Own in 2020 Combined with McDonald's efforts into making their stores more technology friendly, MCD stock may offer healthy, longer-term performance. Darden Restaurants (DRI)Source: Shutterstock Many names have stumbled due to the coronavirus causing a direct impact to their businesses. However, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) is not one of them. In fact, DRI stock has performed very well since the beginning of January -- up 12% year-to-date. Part of the reason is that Darden isn't as levered to the international markets as other competing restaurant stocks.However, another key reason for bullishness in DRI stock is that Americans today prefer to eat out. Studies show that consumers would rather eat out consistently than to only visit a restaurant once a month, which is a minority segment.This makes Darden's decision to expand their physical footprint rather prescient. And, it makes DRI another one of the great restaurant stocks to buy. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE)Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com If there's any name that could benefit from sustained economic momentum, it's Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE).Since early 2017, CAKE stock has generally traded in a bearish trend channel. However, with more people willing to spend their discretionary income on restaurants, Cheesecake Factory may finally get back on its feet and move forward.Additionally, another factor that distinguishes CAKE stock from other restaurant stocks is the underlying company's footprint. It's not so much how many but where they are located. Typically, Cheesecake Factory restaurants are located in happening retail outlets in major metropolitan areas.  * 3 Mid-Cap Growth Stocks to Buy So, don't be surprised to see CAKE trek higher -- especially if this economic growth holds up. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Despite present enthusiasm for dining out, preparing dinner and other meals at home is a financial necessity for most. Even if you can afford to eat out every day, the margins that you bleed for visiting your favorite restaurants does not make sense.Therefore, Kroger (NYSE:KR) and KR stock benefits from a longer-term secular bull thesis.However, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) you say? The tech company has been involved with order groceries online, and curb-side pickups. But, while the disruption of e-commerce trends in the grocery space is a concern, it might take years for full integration. According to a 2018 Gallup poll, customers prefer buying their groceries themselves. This makes sense because you're putting the product in your body, which augurs well for KR stock.Therefore, food stocks like Kroger are still relevant. Uber Technologies (UBER)Source: Shutterstock When people think about food stocks, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) may not immediately come to mind.However, the ride-sharing giant and overall tech disruptor is more than just a revolutionary platform to bring folks from point A to point B. Instead, UBER stock represents a lifestyle investment, with significant implications for the food industry.As you know, few other names like UBER stock is emblematic of the gig economy. And for those who ply their trade in this burgeoning sector, time is money. Honestly, it makes sense that if you're going to eat out anyways, you might as well pay a premium to save the hassle.  * How One Innovative Company Escaped Getting 'Blockbustered' I've personally tried Uber Eats, the company's food delivery service and the results are very impressive. Kura Sushi (KRUS)Source: Shutterstock Due to extreme panic of the coronavirus epidemic, many Chinese restaurants in the U.S. and globally have suffered sharp sales declines. Now, I viewed this as an opportunity to visit my favorite Japanese restaurants. But let's face it: to most Americans, it's all the same stuff.Boy, was I wrong! Japanese establishments in my city are packed to the hilt, just like they've always been. I believe this is a huge opportunity for Kura Sushi (NASDAQ:KRUS). As one of the most popular culinary options in America, KRUS stock has natural upside.Additionally, Kura came to fame because of its conveyer-belt delivery system. Just punch in what you want on the ordering system, and you have your menu item whisked to you. It's a fun and technologically-advanced way of enjoying sushi -- which is a net positive for KRUS stock. Noodles & Co (NDLS)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com In the markets, you'll often hear the phrase, don't fight the tape. Even if a phenomenon doesn't make sense, if it's part of a larger trend, don't bet against it. Well, the investment thesis for Noodles & Co (NASDAQ:NDLS) fortunately makes a lot of sense. Americans love their pasta and noodles, which bodes well for NDLS stock.Moreover, Noodles & Co should appeal to a broad consumer base. Go into one of their restaurants and you'll find a plethora of options, ranging from the Italian-based classics to Asian noodles to of course the American favorite: mac and cheese.  * 9 Excellent Vacation Stocks to Buy This culinary diversity truly fits well with the equally diverse millennial demographic, which should serve NDLS stock well down the road. Shake Shack (SHAK)Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com Perhaps no other rivalry epitomized the bitter feud between east and west coasts than 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G. But in the culinary world, we have two burger joints going head-to-head: California's favorite In-N-Out Burger and New York's Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK).Unlike musical preferences, this fight has a clear winner: SHAK stock.For one thing, Shake Shack is a publicly traded company whereas In-N-Out will never go that route. Second, Shake Shack resonates with millennial diners seeking an experience. Unlike the simple, perhaps spartan decor of In-N-Out, Shake Shack's interiors are far classier and modern.Apparently, Shake Shack's burgers are amazing and worth their premium price tags. And that's another win for SHAK stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-20,"Pop culture has always loved the bad boy. From James Dean's Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause to Harrison Ford's Han Solo of Star Wars fame, everyone roots for the lovable rogue. But that's generally not true in the stock market, where &quot;sin stocks&quot; or &quot;vice stocks&quot; often get the stink eye.Investors, and particularly large institutional investors, have reputations to manage. Pensions and endowments, in particular, increasingly have environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) mandates that prohibit them from investing in industries that are politically incorrect or deemed to be socially harmful.In the past, this has generally meant vice stocks such as tobacco, alcohol, tobacco, gambling and even defense companies. (No one in polite company wants to be branded as a merchant of death.) But today, the net is cast a little wider. Oil and gas stocks are now personae non gratae in many ESG-compliant portfolios, as are opioid-producing pharmaceuticals. Companies with a lack of diversity on their boards of directors are also often singled out.Of course, if we take this to an extreme, nearly any industry could find itself blacklisted. Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) contribute to the obesity epidemic. Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB) have become mediums for hate speech, and Alphabet (GOOGL) tracks a scary amount of data on its users that could be used for nefarious purposes.The point here is not to justify bad behavior by companies or knock the idea of socially responsible investing, however. If you find a company's products or business practices objectionable, there's nothing wrong with excluding it from your portfolio. But a sin stock that one person finds objectionable might be personally fine to another. Some of the best stocks of the past decade included companies that glued people to their sofas and stuffed them with carbs.Today, we're going to look at seven of the best sin stocks to buy now. Betting against the least ESG-friendly of stocks isn't without its risks. But if you're willing to dip your toe into sectors that are politically incorrect, the rewards can be substantial. And most of these picks offer value pricing and/or significant dividend yield. SEE ALSO: All 30 Dow Stocks Ranked: The Analysts Weigh In",7 Dividend-Rich Sin Stocks to Buy Now

2020-02-21,"Last year, I visited China and I was struck at how much major cities like Shanghai have rapidly modernized. But nowadays, the world's second-biggest economy has been forwarding its own innovations. One is a relatively underappreciated company called Luckin Coffee (NASDAQ:LK). A homegrown rival to global juggernaut Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), LK stock has soared since its initial public offering in May 2019.Source: Keitma / Shutterstock.com As you might imagine, I'm long-term bullish on the organization. But what might surprise some readers is that I'm not bothered by the nearer-term challenges. Of course, I'm referring to the coronavirus from China. While we've seen some sharp volatility in LK stock from last month's highs, I regard any ensuing corrections as buying opportunities. LK Stock Offers a Contrarian DiscountBrowse the blogosphere long enough and you'll come across doom-and-gloom prognostications. Even some mainstream sources are hinting at a dire outcome. But as I've said before, history tends to rhyme, if not outright repeat. Eventually, Chinese and international health authorities will assert control over the outbreak.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGenerally, that's not where sentiment is right now, which explains the sharp drop in LK stock since the second half of January. Yet patient investors should regard this circumstance as a discount. Years from now, you'll thank me for pushing the bullish thesis.Even before the coronavirus outbreak occurred, one of the most compelling arguments for Luckin was its underlying business model. Contrary to Starbucks, Luckin's emphasis has never been about large physical footprints for customers to lounge about. Instead, Luckin focuses on smaller stores, often integrated into corporate buildings and college campuses. Here, the purpose is pickup orders: Get your coffee and leave!Coincidentally, this distinctive business model plays almost perfectly into the coronavirus outbreak. I highly doubt that during a health crisis, our everyday cravings go away. More to the point, millions upon millions of Chinese professionals have to make a living. While they're out grinding away the hours, they might as well pick up a cup of joe.And that's all they're doing -- getting their coffee and heading off to their next destination. Neither the customers nor the workers want unnecessary interaction. And that favors Luckin but not so much SBUX.Further, Luckin is taking its small footprint model to its logical conclusion: smart unmanned vending machines. By the end of last year, the company reported 4,507 self-operating stores. Again, this was a great business choice for fast-paced China without the coronavirus. With it, it's a vital mitigating factor. Behavioral Shift Might Benefit LuckinAs you know, it wasn't until relatively recently that China emerged as a legitimate superpower. But that also means that for many decades, its citizens were deprived of many cultural experiences that the West takes for granted.Thus, mundane acts for us Americans -- such as buying coffee at Starbucks or eating out at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) -- are what the Chinese regard as status symbols. Particularly, China's millennials and the nation's burgeoning middle class want to show off and flex their financial muscles.But today, that thought process has all but died. The immediate concern is to not get sick. And prancing around in high-density metropolitan areas is simply not in the cards. Again, the emphasis is on the product and how quickly you can get it, not on the experience.This might turn a lot of new customers onto Luckin, especially its unmanned stores. In a strange way, the coronavirus isn't just creating a discounted opportunity in LK stock. It's also one of the main, albeit temporary reasons to actively buy shares.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-02-21,"Back in September, I wrote about how the biggest problem with Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock is that the market was pricing in too much into the success story. At the time, the stock was trading at around $150. Since then, shares have dropped to around $70, but another surge in January has them back to the $126 level.Source: Shutterstock There is no question Beyond Meat has exceeded expectations. It is, in fact, a success story. But even success stories must be appropriately valued, and Beyond Meat stock is still priced well beyond perfection. Beyond Meat Stock Bubble&quot;Stock market bubble&quot; has a very negative connotation, and rightfully so. However, some of the best companies and markets are the ones that often find themselves in the middle of a bubble.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's natural for stock bulls to push back when critics call a stock's meteoric rise a &quot;bubble&quot; because the insinuation is that the stock is not worth its share price. But just because a stock isn't worth its current share price doesn't mean it's not valuable.  * 7 Lessons Businesses Can Learn From the Girl Scouts Back on July 30, 2019, former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said Beyond Meat stock was an &quot;obvious bubble.&quot; At the time, he predicted the stock price would drop from above $200 to below $100. Within three months, the stock hit his target.Tilson's friend and Valens Securities CIO Joel Litman recently took a second look at Beyond Meat stock after its January rally.&quot;As competitors continue to muscle in on the plant-based burger space, it will be hard for Beyond Meat to charge large premiums for its products… which the company will need to do to justify its current valuations,&quot; Litman said. The NumbersLitman isn't the only one taking a second look at Beyond Meat stock following its recent rally. Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery says Beyond Meat is undoubtedly the early leader in a massive emerging market for plant-based meat products. Unfortunately, the numbers on Beyond Meat just don't add up at this point.Beyond Meat currently has a market cap of more than $7.7 billion. Lavery projects the global plant-based meat market will grow rapidly over the next several years to reach between $6 billion and $8 billion by 2025. In other words, based on Lavery's projections, Beyond Meat is currently valued greater than the entire global market for plant-based meat five years from now.One of the big drivers of Beyond Meat's January rally was news that partner McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is expanding its PLT burger test to more locations. Once again, nobody is questioning the fact that McDonald's is a major opportunity for Beyond Meat. But the stock added $3.1 billion to its market cap in January. Remember that number.&quot;Looking ahead, we expect further distribution gains to drive growth and estimate McDonald's could be a $100M annual opportunity in the US (~$150M globally),&quot; Lavery said.Let's say the PLT is a huge hit for McDonald's. How many years would it take to justify the $3.1 billion in market cap Beyond Meat added?&quot;We see a long runway of growth in the plant-based meat space, but we believe Beyond's valuation has already priced in expected upside from McDonald's distribution,&quot; said Levery.Piper Sandler has a &quot;neutral&quot; rating and $115 price target for Beyond Meat stock. The RisksThere are two major problems with stocks like Beyond Meat. The first problem is that, even if you assume the absolute best-case scenario, the stock is fully priced. In other words, assuming a bull-case scenario for the McDonald's partnership, Piper Sandler estimates Beyond Meat is already trading at more than 10 times 2021 revenue projections. Where is the upside?The other major red flag is the fact that the best-case scenario very rarely ends up actually happening.Piper Sandler conducted a survey of 3,500 U.S. adults and asked them if they consume plant-based meats. The problem isn't the number of respondents that haven't. The problem is the 62% of respondents who answered, &quot;No, and I am not interested in it.&quot;In other words, Beyond Meat's biggest risk may simply be demand.In the same survey, 60% of respondents said they are more interested in a new chicken sandwich than a meatless burger. At least for now, it seems chicken is the preferred option compared to plant-based burgers.Either way, Beyond Meat investors are in a difficult situation. Assume the best-case scenario plays out over the next few years. Beyond Meat's business may eventually grow into its current valuation. But that would mean little upside from its current share price.If, however, the plant-based meat boom runs into some difficulties along the way, there is some major downside potential.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

2020-02-21,"There are two advantages to restaurant stocks in good times.The first is that people have more money to spend, so going out to eat isn't just reserved for special occasions. When times are tight, though, people tend to forego the &quot;luxury&quot; of dining out and buy nicer cuts of meat or brand-name goods at the grocery store and cook at home.Second, it's not about the big splurge. It's about grabbing something on the way home for the family rather than slapping together a meal when you get home. And, the fact that many places that weren't known for healthy eating -- like fast food joints -- are now building quality-focused menus with healthier options.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOverall, fast casual dining has become a &quot;thing,&quot; and it has changed what people expect from fast food. It has re-imagined how we can eat well and quickly, and even customize our meals for our personal tastes.Furthermore, delivery options have also changed the landscape -- but that's for another time.  * 10 Dividend Stocks to Buy That Are Off to a Fast Start in 2020 So, with that said, let's dive in and focus on these seven delicious restaurant stocks to buy. Restaurant Stocks to Buy: Chipotle (CMG)Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is one of the pioneers of fast casual dining. It is also one of the pioneers of curating your meal as it's prepared.People love to pick each item that gets rolled into their burrito or put into a bowl. And CMG has had a reputation for buying quality products, like sustainable meat from smaller producers.Recently, it has introduced menu items to go along with the newest diet trends in mind and with sensitivity to gluten and other allergies.And if you have ever seen how big the line can get during popular meal times, CMG has also begun using pick-up service -- using an app you can put on your phone. They also deliver using various app-based delivery companies.Additionally, Chipotle turned in stellar earnings in 2019. All these reasons -- and no more issues with tainted lettuce -- have helped power CMG stock back to the big time.Up 54% in the past year, it has a bright future ahead and is a staple of my Growth Investor recommendations. Wingstop (WING)Source: Eric Glenn/Shutterstock.com Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is another story of big growth from a niche market. Like CMG stepping into the game with Mexican fare that took off around the country, WING started about the same time by selling buffalo-style chicken wings in Garland, Texas.Today, it has over 1,350 locations worldwide -- including in Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, the U.K. and the U.S.Unlike CMG, though, WING is a franchise business. That means the company licenses its name to people who want to start their own Wingstop. Then, they brand it and operate it according to rules set down by the company.Obviously, the world loves a good chicken wing. And that's pretty much what WING sells. However, it doesn't try to please every palate.  * 3 Wild Stocks To Wrangle In This Bullish Market So if you want wings and sides, that's what you get -- and it's working. The stock is up 51% in the past 12 months, and it continues to expand. Shake Shack (SHAK)Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) is the newest phenomenon to hit fast casual in a while. New York City restauranteur Danny Meyer caught a tiger by the tail when he opened his first Shake Shack in a NYC park with a hot dog cart in 2001.It was the hot dog stand and burger joint reimagined. It took a high-end view of the simple foods and grew them to another level. And now, there are 168 Shake Shacks in the U.S. and 86 around the rest of the world.That said, it can be argued the Meyer started the new burger movement that's currently happening in the U.S. A decade ago, paying $12 or more for a hamburger was a crazy concept. But now, in every city there's at least one or two burger joints with local or humanely raised beef, free range chickens and veggie burgers. And, great fries.With that, you have Shake Shack to thank -- or curse.The stock is up 41% in the past year, and is a &quot;Buy&quot; in the stock-rating system I use to find great Growth Investor plays. So while its expensive, there's plenty of growth out there for this elegantly simple concept; Especially in the U.S as the economy continues to expand. Papa John's (PZZA)Source: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA) has been on quite a ride since mid-2017, when the founder John Schnatter was ousted as CEO. He had been caught out making inappropriate racial comments more than once, and the board had finally had enough as sales dropped and investors walked.With that, PZZA has been working hard to get out of his shadow. But, they have been making big changes internally as well as rebranding their organization to consumers.In turn, the stock is up 59% in the past year, which shows that progress is underway. And this should be a good pizza year, as deliveries usually spike in an election year when people hunker down for debates or sporting events like the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.  * 5 Tech Stocks Vying to Win the AR/VR Race Overall, having made headway before the Super Bowl should help the current quarter's numbers as well. Most important, now that the cloud has lifted, its franchise operations both domestically and globally should get back on track soon too. McDonald's (MCD)Source: ATIKAN PORNCHAIPRASIT / Shutterstock.com McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) has a lot going for it.Granted, for a few years it was touch and go -- having waited a bit too long to upgrade its offerings with new choices for a younger demographic.Even simply deciding to serve breakfast all day was a game changer for this behemoth. And it's size means its impact on the agriculture industry is huge.Also, when it announced that it was moving to cage free eggs, that changed the egg industry. In some ways, it has more power over some agriculture sectors than a national government.Furthermore, on Wall Street, MCD is a blue-chip stock that's also a dividend aristocrat. That means it has raised its dividend every year for more than 25 years in a row. In MCD's case, it's 43 years. That's a key criterion for my Elite Dividend Payers buy list at Growth Investor.Sitting at a 2.3% dividend and growth of 18% last year, this is one of the best long-term growth stories in the industry. Wendy's (WEN)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Wendy's Inc (NASDAQ:WEN) is tiny compared to MCD, which has a market capitalization of $162.4 billion. Meanwhile, Wendy's market cap is $5.2 billion.However, WEN is a competitor all the same. In the old days, when it was looking where it wanted to place restaurants, it didn't want to spend the massive money that McDonald's did on market research. So, it would look to see where a McDonald's went in, and then find a spot as close to it as possible.That kind of pragmatism is how it has done so well over the years, and managed to keep its loyal base as well as expand that base.Furthermore, it will soon launch its own breakfast service. It tried this years back and it didn't work well. But, they're going back in and there's some good buzz about it.The point is, WEN is always looking to keep up with the trends. And it can do that a bit more easily than MCD because it's smaller and has remained nimble.  * Why 5G Health Concerns Are 'Fake News' Overall, the stock is up 33% in the past year and delivers a solid 2% dividend. And it seems like a great option for investors looking to add restaurant stocks to their portfolio. Aramark (AMRK)Source: Shutterstock Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) is a bit of an oddity in this collection of restaurant stocks, since it's a broader, integrated food service company.It doesn't do restaurant per se. But it offers institutional food services to industry, governments, universities, correctional facilities, state parks, sports arenas and others.But, it also does supply food to restaurants -- and has large uniform and clothing business as well. With that, this is a much more diversified company and operates on a different scale than most of the food service firms here.However, it's an interesting choice because it is the backbone of the food service industry. And it is also starting to build out properties and lease them to restaurants. This is just another avenue into the restaurant business through the back door, and helps build the &quot;moat&quot; around its business that's a hallmark of my Growth Investor recommendations.The point is, ARMK has been around since 1959, has global operations and continues to find new opportunities that fit within its focus. The stock is up 30% in the past year and offers a 1% dividend.That said, it flies a bit under the radar. But it knows that if it can help keep the front doors open for customers, it will always have growing deliveries to the back doors. And I've Got More Where That Came FromGreat restaurant stocks like the ones we discussed just now are rare. It can be a tough business in terms of profit margins. On the other hand, the scalability of a strong technology business is an excellent source of growth investments.In that vein, the 5G wireless infrastructure buildout is an incredible opportunity for investors right now.Within two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it an &quot;A&quot;-rated &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my new investment report, The Netflix of 5G, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-02-27,"(Bloomberg) -- UiPath, a software maker valued last year at $7 billion, is getting closer to an initial public offering after helping some of the biggest companies in the U.S. automate routine processes.Armed with last year’s $568 million funding round that gave the New York-based company its multi-billion dollar valuation, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Dines sees more growth on the cards. The bourse entry may take place as soon as early next year, depending on market conditions and strategic decisions.“We just started our growth journey in 2016 and if you look at the average age of a company to do an IPO it’s probably 7 years, so there’s” no reason to hurry, Dines said in an interview from New York. “You have to become a public company at some point to allow your employees to get more liquidity, give them stock options. We’re almost there.”Founded in Romania in 2005 as DeskOver and renamed in 2015, UiPath’s client base includes the CIA, the U.S. Navy, McDonald’s Corp, Duracell and Swiss Re. The company had $360 million in annual recurring revenue last year and it attracted funding from investors such as Sequoia, CapitalG, Wellington Management, Sands Capital and others.“Even though UiPath technically can do an IPO, I think they don’t have to do that. They already got a huge amount -- $1 billion -- in venture funding and don’t have to get their hands tied up in the capital market.”&#92;--Kathy Gao, a BloombergNEF analyst focused on the digital industryUiPath’s software performs low-skilled and repetitive tasks once outsourced to humans in cheaper-wage countries, via “robotic process automation,” or RPA. Examples include the processing of applications for jobs, pensions or handling student data at universities.UiPath, which became Romania’s first unicorn in 2018, competes with other software vendors such as Blue Prism Group Plc, Kofax, and Automation Anywhere Inc. Dines, who ruled out acquisitions in the near future, didn’t give financial details on UiPath’s potential IPO.Blue Prism has already had an IPO, in which it raised about 21 million pounds ($27 million) in 2016. Blue Prism’s shares skyrocketed after its IPO while still unprofitable, and in 2019 it raised an additional 100 million pounds to fund its expansion. The U.K.-based company said last month that its investments widened its 2019 loss but would be showing returns this year, while its customer base was growing.Virus Backlog“We’ve seen increased competition, even Microsoft said they will come with an RPA solution,” UiPath’s Dines said. “This is a great validation for the industry.”One key area to watch is the use of UiPath to help hospitals fighting the coronavirus to avoid backlogs and speed up diagnosis, according to Dines.“RPA has become a really big and established sector and many companies have plans to implement it,” he said.(Adds background on Blue Prism IPO in 8th paragraph.

2020-03-06,"Since late January, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) has been under some selling pressure. Keep in mind that the shares have gone from $120 to $99.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com But of course, since the company went public in May 2019, this kind of volatility has been the norm.  To get a sense of things, the initial offering price was $25 and the high was $239 on Beyond Meat stock, less than a year into trading.Yes it's typical to see wide swings with a hyper-growth IPO. And yet, Beyond Meat has been able to maintain its staggering ramp. During the latest quarter, the company reported revenues of $298 million, up 239% on a year-over-year basis. The company's plant-based meat offerings are available in more than 77,000 retail restaurants and foodservice outlets in over 65 countries. Just some of their marquee customers include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Mcdonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Dunkin Brands Group (NASDAQ:DNKN).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Stocks to Buy If People Get Stuck at Home But despite all this, I actually think there are some things that investors need to be worried about. Why so? Well, let's take a look at three bearish factors for Beyond Meat stock: How Big Is The Opportunity…Really?According to research from UBS, the market for plant-based meat alternatives is forecasted to go from $4.6 billion in 2018 to a staggering $85 billion by 2030. And this estimate is not an outlier. Various other reports show strong growth.But investors should still take this with a grain of salt. After all, these forecasts are generally for the next five to ten years. So yes, that much can happen during such a short period of time.There are also some signs that adoption may not be as widespread. For example, a survey from Piper Sandler of 3,500 adults showed that 62% were not interested in plant-based meats.Something else:  The health benefits may not be as strong as believed. Note that Beyond Meat is a processed food, with high levels of sodium and saturated fats.True, there are other reasons people eat plant-based meats, such as for animal welfare and even helping deal with climate change. But if the health benefits are not as great, then this could certainly mute some of the demand. CompetitionWhile Beyond Meat is the pioneer in its category and has developed its own intellectual property, these advantages may represent a weak moat. The fact is that there are numerous other companies also focused on the opportunity.For example, there are startup operations like Impossible Foods Inc. that have raised substantial amounts of venture capital.  Traditional food companies are also developing their own alternatives, such as Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), Cargill and Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN). Such companies have strong distribution footprints and savvy marketing capabilities.In fact, there are already signs of pricing pressures, which could weigh on margins for Beyond Meat. To this end, Impossible Foods recently discounted its wholesale products by 15%. Valuation On Beyond Meat StockThe valuation on Beyond Meat stock is certainly far from cheap. Note that the shares currently trade at about 13.5 times sales.  This is something you typically see with a red-hot software startup, not a food manufacturer.Wall Street analysts are also skeptical.

But still, it does seem like much of the good news is already baked in.

The best available benchmark would be evaluating the level of declines seen in 2008 and 2009 versus 2007. While current uncertainty could result in a more severe near-term impact, it may prove to be shorter in duration.Using an average 500 basis point full-year- same-store sales deceleration versus prior baseline 2020 estimates, a series of assumptions can be made. Franchised fast-food names who show an average 500 basis point deceleration will see a &quot;relatively modest&quot; 5% to 10% decline in EBITDA.Chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) and Shake Shack Inc (NYSE: SHAK) who also outperform a 500 basis point deceleration could see an EBITDA decline of 10% to 15%.But restaurant chains with a higher fixed cost structure that are also more cyclical could see an EBITDA decline of 15% to 30%.Investors looking for restaurants with the &quot;most protection&quot; in the current environment may want to consider Domino's given its strengths in delivery and McDonald's which was the most defensive play in the last downturn.Price Action Shares of Domino's Pizza are down 2.08% at $336.17, while shares of McDonald's were lower by 6.48% at $186.97.Related Links:What's Better Than A Big Mac?

2020-03-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- (This is the first in a two-part series.)As global supply chains break, airlines slash flights, borders rise within nation-states, stock exchanges convulse with fear, and recession looms over economies, from China to Germany, Australia to the United States, we can no longer doubt that we are living through extraordinary times.What remains in question, however, is our ability to comprehend them while using a vocabulary derived from decades when globalization seemed a fact of nature, like air and wind. For the coronavirus signals a radical transformation, of the kind that occurs once in a century, shattering previous assumptions.In fact, the last such churning occurred almost exactly a century ago, and it altered the world so dramatically that a revolution in the arts, sciences and philosophy, not to mention the discipline of economics, was needed even to make sense of it. The opening years of the 20th century, too, were defined by a free global market for goods, capital and labor. This was when, as John Maynard Keynes famously reminisced, “the inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.”This maker as well as consumer of global capitalism could invest “his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world.” He could also “secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality.”Such an economically enmeshed world seemed to many the perfect insurance against war — a contemporary version of such optimism was Thomas Friedman’s “Golden Arches” Theory, according to which no two countries with McDonald’s restaurants would go to war.The First World War not only brought the period of friction-free globalization to a gruesome end. It also cruelly exposed an intelligentsia which had believed in irreversible progress and now was forced to acknowledge that, as an embittered Henry James wrote to a friend in August 1914, “the tide that bore us along was then all the while moving to this grand Niagara.”As with our own crisis, the seminal crashes of the 20th century — the First World War followed by the Great Depression — were harder to grasp because their principal causes were set in motion decades before, and largely neglected by mainstream politicians and commentators. Democracy, whether as an emotive ideal of equality or as representative institutions based on a widening adult male suffrage, had steadily become the central principle of the modern world, especially as industrial growth generated new inequalities.Repeatedly frustrated, the aspiration for democracy helped fuel the rise of both left and far-right political movements, pitting them against established ruling elites.The firebrands found their most committed supporters in the exploited populations of then-rapidly growing cities. Filled mostly with people freshly uprooted from the countryside, sundered from traditional livelihoods, and forced to live in urban squalor, the world’s great cities had started to become hotbeds of discontent in the late 19th century.The problems of how to accommodate rising aspirations for equality through inequality-generating economies were particularly acute for nation-states such as Germany, Italy and Japan, that were trying to catch up with economically advanced Western countries.Once the series of economic shocks that began in the late 19th century climaxed in the Great Depression, the elevation of the far-right to power, and intensified conflicts between states, was all but guaranteed.In our own conjuncture, all ingredients of the previous calamity are present, if ominously on an unparalleled scale.For decades now, de-industrialization, the outsourcing of jobs, and then automation, have deprived many working people of their security and dignity, making the aggrieved in even advanced Western countries vulnerable to demagoguery. At the same time, stalled economic modernization or a botched process of urbanization in “catch-up” powers like India and Russia, has created, in almost textbook fashion, the political base for far-right figures and movements. The financial crisis of 2008, which has caused deeper and longer damage than the Great Depression, may have discredited the globalizing elite that promised prosperity to all, creating broad scope for opportunistic demagogues like Donald Trump. Yet few lessons were learnt from the collapse of global markets as the tide moved faster to Niagara. This is why the crisis of our time is as much intellectual as it is political, economic and environmental.One sign of analytic deficiency is that the prescriptions for multiple malaises have remained the same in much mainstream politics and journalism: more economic “reforms,” largely in the direction of global free markets, reheated Cold War slogans about the superiority of “liberal democracy” over “authoritarianism,” and aspirations for a return to “decency” and “global leadership.”These hopes for a return to the pre-2008 political and ideological status quo are often leavened with a heightened, if ineffectual, concern about climate change. Their inadequacy will become clearer in the months to come when afflicted nations as much as individuals are tempted to self-isolate, sacrificing many holy cows to the existential urgency of survival. The coronavirus, devastating in itself, may prove to be only the first of many shocks that lie ahead.To contact the author of this story: Pankaj Mishra at pmishra24@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Gibney at jgibney5@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Pankaj Mishra is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-03-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Private equity firms, sitting on a record $388 billion of dry powder in Asia, may be about to get their reward for patience. Cash is king as corporate finances are stretched by the coronavirus outbreak. Having sat on their hands for much of the past year in protest at unappealing valuations, the virus-induced stock market meltdown is creating a potential parade of bargains. Blackstone Group Inc.’s reported plans to acquire Hong Kong-listed property company Soho China Ltd. may be just the start.High valuations are the number one complaint of private equity firms devoted to the Asia-Pacific region, according to a Bain & Co. report last week. Prices hadn’t budged significantly before the outbreak even as economic growth slowed in China, the region’s top destination for such investments. That’s because owners and entrepreneurs have been spoiled for choice: More than 3,000 private equity firms are jostling to find opportunities in Asia.Deal prices eased only slightly last year, to a median ratio of 12.9 times enterprise value to Ebitda, from 13.3 times in 2018. Valuations remain above levels before 2017, according to Bain.The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index has slumped 23% this year, opening up potential buyout targets in the public markets and dragging valuations of unlisted companies down in its wake. While tightening dollar liquidity threatens the financing that private equity firms need to make deals work, shrinking availability of credit may also weaken the reluctance of startup founders to yield control, which has been a hindrance to transactions, particularly in Southeast Asia.Another positive from the market shakeout is a possible easing in the pace of activity by Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp. That would come as welcome relief to fund executives who see the conglomerate’s $99 billion Vision Fund as pumping up private valuations and crowding out other investors. With SoftBank shares having fallen more than 40% in Tokyo from its February high, Son’s focus has switched to shoring up his own company’s valuation via a $4.8 billion share buyback announced last week. SoftBank is also grappling with challenges at portfolio companies such as WeWork and Indian startup Oyo, as my colleague Tim Culpan has noted.Not all private equity firms are positioned to profit from the rout. The biggest are in the strongest position. New York-based Warburg Pincus, for instance, raised $4.25 billion for a China-Southeast Asia fund in five months last year, exceeding its target. By contrast, smaller and newer funds spent an average of 22 months on the road and raised only 60% of their goals, according to data from Bain and Preqin.Baring Private Equity Asia and TPG Capital are examples of other firms with well-known names and track records that have successfully raised multibillion-dollar funds. Blackstone closed a $7.1 billion real estate fund last year that was the biggest ever in that sector. And few would bet against KKR & Co. being able to complete a $12.5 billion fundraising that it started for its fourth Asian buyout fund in November. Meanwhile, sovereign wealth and pension funds started playing safe with their private equity investments a couple of years ago, leaving them with plenty of firepower. The divergence between strong and weak will widen. Less financially robust private equity firms may struggle to rescue cash-strapped portfolio companies as credit tightens. Even bigger players are likely to reassess previously hot industries or regions. Money has poured into Vietnam and Southeast Asian neighbors on bets that they would benefit as the trade war forced a supply-chain shift out of China. The pandemic has put that thesis in doubt. “People are questioning the whole Southeast Asia-China nexus as a theme,” said Winston Ma, a former executive sovereign wealth fund at China Investment Corp. who’s now an adjunct professor at New York University.Chinese consumer companies, a magnet for private equity money in the past couple of years, are also likely to suffer a loss of favor. Efforts to curb the coronavirus prompted restaurant chains from McDonald’s Corp. and Yum China Holdings Inc.’s KFC to shut outlets. While giants such as Citic Capital Holdings Ltd. and Carlyle Group LP, which bought most of McDonald’s China business in 2018, can ride out closures, other restaurants may not be so lucky.Cash alone won’t guarantee success. As long as the pandemic lasts, it will be difficult for private-equity executives to visit potential investments, putting a damper on due diligence and limiting dealmaking. For every great deal made by a cash-rich private equity firm during a financial crisis, there are others that came a cropper. Finding the genuine bargains amid the rubble will be key. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

Analysts had anticipated a 4% growth in same-store sales for the quarter ending March, as the restaurant chain was expected to benefit from the launch of a breakfast menu earlier this month.

Unfortunately, restaurants are one industry particularly exposed to this disruption. And in particular, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) stock is one that moves fast -- even under normal conditions.Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com Now, with elevated volatility, SHAK stock is falling 70% from its highs fast.From here I believe Shake Shack is a buy. This may sound like a perma-bull comment, but today I bring an unbiased analysis of the company's fundamentals and technicals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut with a trailing price-earnings ratio above 70, SHAK stock isn't a value play. But with a history of solid growth, it's important to gauge the company's worth through its sales, not its profitability.And from that perspective it's cheap, because it only sells at 2.5 times revenues. This is in line with restaurant peer Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and one-third that of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). Clearly, value is in the eye of the beholder. Don't Bet Against SHAK StockFast-moving momentum stocks are not appropriate for all investors, but this doesn't mean you should bet against them. Those that bet against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost a lot of money.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem SHAK stock has favorable long-term fundamentals. Once we get of lockdown, businesses will start to recover, including Shake Shack. Today, the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on the biggest financial relief package of all time -- $2 trillion is a lot of money to bet against.The coronavirus from China is still spreading, but the panic will ease quickly once experts develop an effective vaccine. But there's an even better reason to bet on SHAK stock here -- its technicals. It is comforting to know that Shake Shack has fallen into a well-consolidated support zone that dates back to its public debut. Start Nibbling on Shake Shack StockSource: Chart by TradingView SHAK stock is a bargain anywhere near $38 per share. As equities try to establish a bottom, it is not too late to start building positions. But because we still have elevated levels of volatility, it is important to be cautious.On the way up, Shake Shack will encounter resistance through $52 per share. The onus is on the bulls to overcome every level that served as a ledge on the way down. The biggest target for bulls is $72. While this would be extremely tough, it reflects 40% of upside from the current share price.There is no one-size-fits-all setup for investors, but the homework is always the same. Avoid making the obvious mistake of chasing shares blindly. That's why I reviewed Shake Shack's fundamentals and technicals, and now I can conclude that going long here is not an obvious mistake. Macroeconomic Help Through These Tough TimesIt is also important to mention that the broader economy will influence SHAK stock. Yesterday we learned that approximately 3.3 million Americans filed for jobless claims last week. And this number -- and other economic reports -- are likely to get uglier.Wall Street has priced in a lot of this ugliness, but investors could panic once again. My thesis is that we have seen the worst of this correct. The S&P 500 could dip a little deeper, but not by much.Moreover, we have political reasons to be optimistic for the stock market. We are heading into an election season, and I am confident the White House will do everything it can to prop up the economy. The proposed $2 trillion stimulus is big enough to create market-carrying momentum that could take us back to all-time highs.Yes, there will be hiccups along the way, but investors will be able to buy the dips in an ascending trend. After a couple of quarters of negative GDP, the recession could quickly end.I cannot end this note without extending my sincerest sympathies to those suffering from the virus.

2020-03-30,"Some of the roughly 200,000 workers at U.S. online grocery delivery company Instacart said they were striking on Monday as labor unrest grows globally over safety and wages for people working through the coronavirus crisis. Workers at an Amazon.com Inc warehouse in Staten Island, New York also plan to walk off the job on Monday. It was not immediately clear how many Instacart workers were participating in the strike, organized by a group called the Gig Workers Collective, or what impact it might have on operations.",Instacart workers strike as labor unrest grows during coronavirus crisis
2020-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc., Instacart Inc. and other companies providing food, medicine and other essentials are about to find out whether the pandemic can accomplish what organized labor has struggled to do: give employees and contractors the leverage to extract better working conditions.Some employees at Amazon’s Staten Island, New York, warehouse walked off the job on Monday, calling for the company to shut the facility for extended cleaning after they say a number of their colleagues were diagnosed with Covid-19. Instacart workers called for a nationwide strike on Monday over safety and pay concerns. And, if a petition circulating online gets traction, workers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market plan to call in sick en masse on Tuesday.As coronavirus cases pop up at warehouses and supermarkets, workers -- cheered on by politicians and labor activists -- have begun demanding better pay, sick leave and on-the-job protections from the deadly respiratory virus. Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the U.S., has long been the target of efforts to organize its workforce. They have generally failed.“These things do sometimes take on a life of their own, and I wonder if we’re in one of those moments where workers are starting to stand up in greater and greater numbers because of the magnitude of the threat they’re facing,” said Brishen Rogers, an associate law professor at Temple University.Organizers face long odds should they pursue formal unionization. Forming unions in the U.S. is difficult, and the coronavirus has both flooded the market with potential new hires and made large labor rallies impractical. Organizers of the Staten Island walkout say more than 60 employees participated; video from a protest appeared to show a sparser crowd.“You could come out of this seeing much greater levels of worker organization within Whole Foods and Amazon that could in the future grow into formal unions,” Rogers said. In the meantime, “I think they’ll respond by changing policies, in part to avoid unionization.”In an emailed statement, Amazon said 15 people out of a workforce of 5,000 participated in the Staten Island demonstration, and called their critiques “completely unfounded.”“Our employees are heroes fighting for their communities and helping people get critical items they need in this crisis,” the company said. “Like all businesses grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we are working hard to keep employees safe while serving communities and the most vulnerable.” Amazon says it has stepped up cleaning inside its facilities, and that it is supporting employees diagnosed with Covid-19.Instacart said it has seen “absolutely no impact” from the strike and that workers’ earnings are up on average. The company added about 50,000 new workers as so-called Instacart shoppers in the last week, and there were 40% more people working on Monday compared with the same day last year, the company said. “Our goal is to offer a safe and flexible earnings opportunity to shoppers, while also proactively taking the appropriate measures to operate safely,” a spokeswoman for Instacart wrote in an email.A Whole Foods spokeswoman said the grocer is “committed to prioritizing our team members’ well-being, while recognizing their extraordinary dedication.” Despite the walkout and threatened sick-out at Whole Foods, Amazon shares climbed 3.4% Monday, closing at $1,963.95, alongside market-wide gains in the U.S.Worker protests over coronavirus workplace conditions have also recently hit companies like Perdue Farms, McDonald’s Corp. and General Electric Co., where employees at a Massachusetts site Monday protested -- standing six feet apart -- to demand the company deploy workers to manufacture ventilators in-house.Amazon boosted its $15 an hour starting pay in the U.S. by $2 an hour through the end of April, and raised overtime pay. Workers at an Amazon warehouse in northern Italy, the epicenter of Europe’s coronavirus outbreak, on Friday said they’d reached an agreement that guaranteed workers an additional five minute break to help practice personal hygiene, and made permanent temporary enhanced cleaning protocols rolled out during the pandemic.It remains to be seen whether Amazon will be pushed into broader concessions for the workers who pack and ship packages to customers. The U.S. labor market is teeming with millions of newly unemployed workers as large portions of the economy shut down to prevent the spread of the virus. Amazon has said it hopes to hire an additional 100,000 workers to deal with a surge in online shopping by people asked to stay home. Wholesale closings of large chunks of Amazon’s logistics network seem unlikely, say people who follow the company.Amazon’s responses to worker agita have been rolled out in piecemeal fashion over the last two weeks. When the first coronavirus cases appeared in European warehouses, the company began doing things like removing chairs from break rooms and turning off the metal detectors employees were previously asked to go through on their way out of buildings. Over the weekend, Amazon said it would begin screening some employees in the Seattle and New York areas for fevers, a program Amazon plans to roll out at sites nationwide.In the U.S., Amazon has also reoriented some work to spread out employees and closed locker rooms. Still several employees who work at facilities across the country have expressed alarm at the decision to keep some facilities with confirmed coronavirus cases open. The only Amazon warehouse known to have closed for an extended period -- a warehouse in Shepherdsville, Kentucky -- was set to reopen last week before the state governor intervened.Amazon says it follows public health recommendations for cleaning its sites, and that it reviews video footage to determine who sick employees came into extended contact with. Those workers are asked to go home and into a 14-day quarantine.Amazon has promised two weeks of sick pay to all employees diagnosed with Covid-19 or ordered into a quarantine; some workers, and a group of U.S. senators, say that’s insufficient.Emboldened workers can expect consumers to back them if they don’t think companies are protecting their health, said Nelson Lichtenstein, a history professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara. “Here’s a crisis,” he said, “which makes it absolutely clear how important they are.”(Updates with Instacart reporting in the ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Workers Cite Health Concern in Demands for Better Pay

2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Industries that missed out on the largest stimulus bill in U.S. history are already lobbying to ensure they get a piece of the next one.Restaurant owners are asking Congress for a new insurance program to cover pandemic-related losses. Hotel operators are pleading for larger loans. Renewable power developers want money to keep solar installers on the job. And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pitching its initiative to rebuild roads and bridges.It’s a lobbying frenzy stoked by the $2 trillion spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on Friday to blunt economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic.Lawmakers have made it clear further help is likely.“What we’ve done now is emergency relief,” Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said on Bloomberg Television. “If the crisis continues for substantially longer I have no doubt that the Congress will have to act yet again.”White House officials have compiled lists of requests from government agencies totaling roughly $600 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposals include more state aid as well as financial assistance for mortgage markets and the travel industries.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday she did not expect agreement on another bill before April 20 and vowed that a future package would do more to protect workers and help states.“We are not coming back for a few weeks but I do think we can do our committee work in the meantime,” Pelosi told reporters on a conference call.Here are some of the industries that will be in line when the legislation comes together:Restaurants want insurance to cover shuttered eateriesRestaurateurs are looking to Congress to fill the gap for businesses that had business interruption insurance policies but haven’t been able to use them to cover Covid-19 claims. Many of those policies require a property to have suffered physical damage and some contain explicit exclusions for losses tied to viruses.Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs of the National Restaurant Association, said the group may intensify calls for the federal government to create a federally-backed business interruption insurance program. The group supports creating a $100 billion initiative, akin to safeguards established for the airlines after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, that could be used to pay for coronavirus and other future pandemic-related claims.Restaurants rely on business interruption insurance to weather “acts of God -- force majeure,” said Kennedy, whose group which represents thousands of restaurant owners and chains including McDonald’s Corp. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. “If this pandemic isn’t a force majeure with the federal government, with state governments ordering that we’d be closed, I don’t know what is.”Calls to raise the gas tax for Gateway, other projectsThe next stimulus bill should be heavy on infrastructure spending with the construction season approaching, and it should include raising the federal gas tax to pay for it, said Ray LaHood, a Republican and former transportation secretary under President Barack Obama who promotes infrastructure funding through the Building America’s Future coalition.“It’s got to be big, it’s got to be bold,” LaHood said.States have major projects underway or ready, and federal funds could finish them with state dollars used for other work, LaHood said. The bill should specifically provide money for the Gateway commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan that has been embroiled in a dispute with the Trump administration over funding, LaHood added.The chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Democrat Peter DeFazio of Oregon, has already promised to “double down on an infrastructure package that repairs the breach left by years of neglect -- that rebuilds failing bridges, restores damaged highways and puts people to work on projects with jobs that cannot be exported.”Trump joined in on Tuesday, saying in a tweet that with interest rates close to zero, the time is right to enact a “very big and bold” $2 trillion infrastructure bill.Avoiding the ‘shovel-ready’ trapStimulus packages during the 2008-2009 recession sought to finance “shovel-ready” projects, only to have Obama later concede that “there’s no such thing as shovel-ready projects” because of the long lead times needed for major work.The best way to get projects done is to increase federal dollars for existing programs and funding streams, said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.“When you’ve got programs that you know already work, let’s utilize those to get the money out on the street as quickly as possible,” Tymon said.Doctors and hospitals say they need more money fasterHospital and doctors’ groups say they’re pushing on two fronts: getting the emergency funds to providers right now and persuading lawmakers to provide more money.Health organizations are asking the Department of Health and Human Services to start dispensing the emergency funds included in the rescue package signed into law Friday as soon as possible to help keep afloat hospitals, health centers, and doctors’ offices.“More will need to be done to deal with the unprecedented challenge of this virus,” the head of the American Hospital Association, Rick Pollock, said in a statement.Hospitals and surgery practices in particular have been warning they’re short of cash needed to pay staff partly due to the halt on most elective surgeries, which are more lucrative than emergency services typically related to treatment for Covid-19.Hotel groups want loans of up to 400% of costsThe American Hotel & Lodging Association is pushing lawmakers to lift a cap on small business loans that was set at 250% of monthly payroll last week. The trade group wants the threshold raised to 400% of operating costs -- a sum it says is needed so that owners can both pay employees and pay off their debts as travel business slowly returns.Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy for the U.S. Travel Association, said expanding the loan amount would “help folks retain employees.”“We view the bill that just passed as a relief package and in all likelihood we’re really going to have to probably seek replenishment and extension.”While the package passed last week set aside more than $70 billion to airlines and airports, some portions of the aviation industry weren’t included and may be asking for money in future legislation. For example, there are 256 towers at smaller U.S. airports operated by private companies that could seek federal assistance.Clean energy backers tie aid to oil purchaseA Trump administration plan to spend $3 billion buying as much as 77 million barrels of crude oil for the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve was cut from last week’s legislation, after Democrats made clear they would demand clean energy investments in exchange.That same trade could arise in another round, and lobbyists for electric vehicles, power storage companies and renewable electricity developers are already preparing.Wind and solar developers are asking for more time to get projects in service and still collect the full value of renewable energy tax credits that are set to begin phasing down next year.Direct payments sought for renewablesSome renewable advocates are asking Congress to allow companies to take direct payments from the Treasury in lieu of the existing tax credits, an approach that was used after the financial crisis a decade ago. They say the flexibility is needed as tax equity markets dry up, blunting the effectiveness of existing credits used to finance wind farms and solar arrays.“Companies are in dire need of emergency relief,” said Bill Parsons, chief operating officer for the American Council on Renewable Energy.Other clean energy advocates are looking for Congress to heighten spending on weatherization, efficiency and research and development programs.The nuclear power industry is seeking a 30% tax credit for some expenditures converted into grants among other aid, citing “severe financial strain” being experienced among utilities and reactor operators, according to the Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute.Auto-parts makers want tariff reliefThe trade association representing auto parts manufacturers intends to ask lawmakers to provide relief from tariffs on steel and aluminum products as well as imports from China, said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association.At a minimum, lawmakers should extend current exemptions to those tariffs for one year so that companies that have obtained waivers already don’t have to re-apply, the association’s president, Bill Long, said in a March 18 letter.MEMA and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents nearly every major automobile manufacturer, had asked lawmakers to provide loans and loan guarantees as vehicle production comes to a standstill.While the stimulus plan put “very important credit facilities and other programs in place” to help dealers, automotive suppliers and manufacturers, “we’re going to keep looking at the situation and we’ll have to see what more might be required,” said John Bozzella, president of the alliance.Broadcasters, newspapers want help with ad ‘carnage’Local broadcasters slammed by an abrupt slowdown in advertising say they, too, will seek relief in coming legislation.“The carnage in the local ad business is the worst in decades, if not ever,” said Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters. “Some radio and TV stations are not going to survive without additional steps.”Two newspaper trade groups also appealed for help “to sustain our local news ecosystem.”“The rapid contraction of advertising markets is dealing a brutal blow,” the News Media Alliance and America’s Newspapers said in a letter to Trump and congressional leaders. “While many publishers have seen increases in online traffic and digital subscriptions, the additional revenue has in no way made up for the sharp losses in ad revenue.”More help for governors to buy equipmentStates as well will be lining up for aid.Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who serves as the head of the National Governors Association, said Monday he has requested that “half of the next stimulus package go to states.”“No one in the country has enough gear,” Hogan said at a press conference Monday. “Every governor in America is concerned about that.”House Democrats -- including Pelosi -- already indicated that they would be receptive.(Updates with Trump tweet on infrastructure in 18th paragraph and section on hospital aid.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Left-Behind Industries Clamor for Billions in Next Stimulus Bill
2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Some workers at Whole Foods Market stores across the U.S. called in sick on Tuesday, part of a coordinated action to demand more sick pay and protections for grocery store employees working through the coronavirus pandemic.It’s unclear how many people participated. An organizer said they didn’t have an estimate, and a Whole Foods spokeswoman didn't provide a tally, but said the strike hadn't disrupted operations.Bloomberg News interviewed workers in five states, from Illinois and Texas to the Eastern Seaboard, who say they joined colleagues calling in sick. They cite as reasons for participating fear of contracting or spreading the coronavirus to family members and disputes with managers about appropriate measure to protect themselves, among other things. The sickout strike is the latest in a string of efforts by employees of businesses that remain open during the pandemic to extract protections and better working conditions from their employers. Workers at Perdue Farms Inc., McDonald’s Corp., and General Electric Co. have protested. Walmart Inc. said this week it was experiencing higher than normal absenteeism among its workforce, but that it was &quot;manageable.&quot; On Monday, some employees at Amazon.com Inc.’s Staten Island, New York, warehouse walked off the job to protest the company’s handling of coronavirus cases in the facility.Organizers of the Whole Foods action have circulated a petition signed by more than 10,500 people asking for paid leave for all workers who choose to isolate themselves, health care coverage for part-time employees and funds to cover testing and treatment of sick team members. Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, in January stopped providing health care benefits for part-time employees who work less than 30 hours a week. The upscale grocer has rolled out temporary raises of $2 an hour through April, increased overtime compensation, and says employees placed in quarantine or diagnosed with Covid-19 are eligible for two weeks of paid sick leave, policies in place throughout Amazon’s workforce. Rachel Malish, a Whole Foods spokeswoman, on Tuesday pointed to those actions and others the company says it’s taking to safeguard employees. “So far today we have seen no changes to overall absenteeism and we continue to operate all of our stores without interruption,” she said in an emailed statement. “There is no higher priority for us than taking care of our Team Members.” Malish said the critiques from “a small but vocal group” don’t accurately reflect the collective view of the grocer’s 95,000 employees. One Whole Foods worker in the Chicago area who joined the strike on Tuesday said working at the grocer felt like a public service a few weeks ago, when aisles were full of shoppers panic buying. But as business slowed to a more normal level—and the virus spread to communities across the country—the employee no longer thinks coming to work is worth the risk. “It’s really hard for people to stay safe,” the employee said. “Workers are being forced to choose between their safety and the safety of their loved ones and being able to pay their bills.”The worker spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from her employer. Some Whole Foods workers said Amazon’s firing on Monday of Chris Smalls, an organizer of the Amazon walkout in Staten Island, made them reluctant to speak publicly. Amazon says he was dismissed for violating the terms of an company-ordered quarantine after he was sent home with pay for coming into contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19. Smalls disputes that. Strike organizers also called for Whole Foods to shut down any store where a worker tests positive for Covid-19, a demand grocery workers share with some of their colleagues employed in Amazon’s logistics network. Amazon, which says it’s doing enhanced cleaning of its facilities, has opted to keep warehouses where employees tested positive open, over the objection of some employees scared to return. The strike was called for by Whole Worker, a coalition of current and former employees that has been working to organize workers  since 2018, initially with aid from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. An RWDSU spokeswoman said the New York based union isn’t involved in Tuesday’s action. Whole Foods, whose chief executive John Mackey once said was “beyond unions,” has resisted prior efforts by workers to organize, a similar stance to its corporate parent.(Updates with comments from Whole Foods spokeswoman)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Whole Foods Workers Launch Sickout Protest.

2020-04-03,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our daily lives and the U.S. economy, investors are wondering if they should buy into shares of restaurant stocks in the second quarter. Year-to-date McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock is down about 18.2%.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com That decline compares to a 25% drop in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEArca:XLY), which includes MCD as its third-largest holding at 7.39% of the portfolio, behind Amazon (NSADAQ:AMZN) at a whopping 24.1% and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) at 12% of the exchange-traded fund's assets.Despite the recent rapid decline, I expect the short-term volatility in MCD stock to continue. However, those investors with a two-to-three-year horizon may consider further dips as opportunity to buy into the shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips How the Pandemic is Affecting the Golden Arches GloballyMcDonald has more than 38,000 restaurants in over 100 countries. Its largest segment is the U.S.Next is its International Lead Markets segment, i.e., established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. And then comes its High Growth Markets, including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain and Switzerland.In recent weeks, the group has closed all play areas and many of its dine-in sections in the U.S. It has also simplified its menu offerings.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Might Not Survive Management is also likely to offer some franchisees rent deferrals. About 90% of the restaurants are currently franchised. As these franchisees carry the operating costs and business risks, McDonald's does not have to worry about the expenses of running those operations.Even more importantly, the group collects rent from the franchisees as the company owns most of the properties where the restaurants operate. It leases those out to the franchisees, often at significant markups. It may not be wrong to say that the company is in real estate business as much as food services. Therefore rent deferrals would likely affect McDonald's earnings.At present much of Europe is under a lockdown. And many businesses have either been ordered to shut down or have themselves decided to cease operations for now.For example, as of March 23, all McDonald's stores in the U.K. and Republic of Ireland have been closed indefinitely. Similar closures are also continuing in France, Italy and Spain. And in late January management had closed hundreds of stores in China, where the novel coronavirus had initially started. What to Expect from Q1 EarningsThe company is likely to announce Q1 results in late April.Its Q4 earnings, released in January, topped analysts' estimates. Quarterly revenue $5.3 billion fueled earnings per share of $1.97. Earnings got a boost from price hikes.U.S. same-store sales climbed 5.1% during Q4, despite traffic to restaurants falling by 1.9% in 2019. The company also reported global same-store sales growth of 5.9%.Overall, the results showed that the group is a consistent performer. It is also a profitable business with strong cash flows.But then came March when we started seeing the novel coronavirus become a global pandemic. And on March 17, MCD management said that it would not yet be able to fully assess the impact of the viral outbreak. McDonald's operates in the fragmented food service industry, which includes competitors like Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM).And shares of McDonald's as well as its peers have been suffering in recent weeks. In March alone, both MCD and SBUX were down 15% while QSR and YUM shares were down about 28% and 23%, respectively.Given the uncertainty not just in the U.S., but also in other countries, many investors are understandably quite anxious to analyze MCD stock's quarterly results in several weeks. Recent Price Action of MCD StockOn Aug. 9, 2019, MCD stock price saw an all-time high of $221.93. And on March 18, 2020 came the 52-week low of $124.23. The shares are now hovering around $162.Over the past year, the shares are down about 12%. If you're an investor who also pays attention to technical charts, you may be interested to know that the recent price action means that it'll likely take time for McDonald's stock price to settle. It'd need to build a base before a new sustained up move could start.In the coming weeks, I expect it to trade mostly between $150 and $175. The price may become even choppier around the earnings release date.If you currently hold MCD stock, depending on your risk/return profile, you may want to ride out the short-term volatility.  * 30 Stocks on a Deathwatch Alternatively, if you're experienced with options, you may want to initiate a covered call position. For example, a May 15-expiry ATM call would provide some protection in case McDonald's stock falls further. It's also enable you to participate in a potential up move between now and mid-May.Recent research by Sandip Dutta and Vignesh Prabhu of Clemson University on company stock prices in times of recession and recovery highlights that a &quot;franchised company like MCD shows … resilience and holds the stock price steady even in the average market meltdown.&quot;If history is any guide, McDonald's shares should be able to weather a prolonged downturn in the economy better than many other stocks. Investor Takeaway on MCD StockIt'd be no exaggeration to say that we're living in unprecedented times. And in recent weeks, share prices of most stocks, including the usual investor darlings like McDonald's, have been falling hard and fast.Your guess may indeed be as good as any other as to when most stocks will likely hit the bottom in 2020. Nonetheless, if you liked a company for solid fundamental reasons before its price went down double digits, then you should possibly like it even more now.Although there might still be some more short-term pain in MCD stock, long-term investors may consider buying the dip in McDonald's shares. I find the stock price attractive as it falls toward $150.

2020-04-03,"The shutdown of non-essential businesses across the United States has created an unexpected and sudden deterioration in the economy. Yet, given what we know about the severity of the novel coronavirus, the world must do anything to stop its spread. And the service industry is getting decimated, along with the tourism and hospitality industry. Restaurant stocks are trading at steep discounts as a result.Companies that support teleworking may continue working. But industries that require a face-to-face interaction will see a drop in business for now.The U.S. government approved a monstrously large stimulus package, partly to help consumers pay the rent and buy necessities. The government increased spending while the Federal Reserve eased rates to increase liquidity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut Laura Gonzalez, an associate professor of finance at California State University's Long Beach campus, said that &quot;the production of processed food may not be sustained within months, and the United States could see a disruption in the market of perishable food. That would alter income in other industries because the price of some essentials may increase at a time of lack of liquidity.&quot;  * 7 Telecom Stocks That Are Worth a Close Look Investors could look at stocks like Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) or Kellogg (NYSE:K) for exposure to the processed and packaged goods market. Conversely, the restaurant sector has stocks trading at steep discounts in light of the shutdown.When this is lifted, be it in a few or several weeks, investors have seven restaurant stocks to consider buying. Restaurant Stocks: Restaurant Brands International (QSR)Source: Shutterstock Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) has traded in the $40-$60 range since 2017. The breakout to around $76 last summer proved very short-lived. The company owns Burger King, a global business that performed well last year. In its last quarter, the company said that it watched the lockdown unfolding in China carefully. But since Burger King accounted for roughly 2% of sales, the company did not expect any material downturn in its business.Burger King added $23 billion in sales for QSR, growing 9% from the year before. Popeyes also enjoyed a strong year. Sales grew an impressive 18% in the year. This is due to the launch of the Chicken Sandwich.In effect, QSR noticed the strong demand for this product that Chick-fil-A enjoyed. Management said that &quot;for the vast majority of our guests purchasing the sandwich, we saw that they actually spent more on other products than on the sandwich itself, resulting in very healthy check levels and incredibly valuable awareness and trial.&quot;This year stands in stark contrast to last year's strong results. Tim Hortons, a popular chain in Canada, will most certainly report a strong drop in sales after many provinces in the nation imposed a lockdown.At 17 times earnings and the majority of analysts rating the stock a &quot;buy,&quot; QSR stock is due for a rebound. Stock Rover thinks the fair value is $62.41. McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) fell as low as $124.23 recently only to bounce back sharply. The fast-food chain will likely report a strong drop in revenues for the current quarter.Still, the company adapted to the tougher market conditions by temporarily taking out some items from its menu. This simplifies operations and helps lower the workload for its kitchen staff and crew. The burger giant also closed all of its locations in Ireland and the United Kingdom.McDonald's will experience a surge in drive-thru volumes. This will not offset the lost business, but will keep its customers getting the service they demand. Financially speaking, McDonald's has a healthy balance sheet. Its operating income greatly exceeds its capital expenditures, interest expenses and administrative costs.  * 7 Dividend Stocks at Risk of Slashing Payouts To be on the safe side, the company filed a $1 billion borrowing with banks. This will give it a strong cash position and financial flexibility, in case uncertainties worsen due to the pandemic. Yum! Brands (YUM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) held the $100-$110 level until the coronavirus outbreak halted the economy. The stock, which pays a dividend yielding 2.8%, sees the light at the end of the tunnel. In its filing, the company wrote that &quot;we have seen early signs of sales recovery in markets that were first impacted by COVID-19, although there can be no assurance of continued improvement.&quot;At the time of filing, Yum forecast same-store sales will fall in the mid to high single digits. Beyond the quarter ended March 31, the company is not positioned to give investors a forecast.To preserve its cash, Yum suspended its stock buyback program. Instead, it will invest in the company. It will also spend on things that maximize the health and well-being of its staff while they serve customers.At a price-earnings of around 17 times, YUM stock is a good turnaround play for patient investors. On average, analysts have a $97.13 price target on Yum! Brands.Conversely, readers may assume a 7% discount rate and a modest 2% perpetuity growth rate in a 5-year discounted cash flow growth exit model. In that scenario, YUM stock is worth $84.25. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com Shares of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are down sharply because of the pandemic affecting its business. Yet as China sets to end its lockdown in its Hubei province in early April, Starbucks may start to see business bouncing back in the region.The return of customers is hardly assured. But loyal customers will likely come back when businesses return to normal and people begin commuting to work.SBUX stock held up well during the massive selloff in restaurant stocks because the market expects the business to snap back. The market's optimism is undermined if the lockdown plays out longer. This delays the assumption on a return to normal life in China or in other countries.For now, investors should brace for a sharp drop in earnings, assuming at least 50% of the stores are closed. The drive-thru or delivery-only locations will soften the overall drop. In the months following a re-opening, independent coffee shops are not likely to survive. This will give Starbucks a chance to grow its market share.  * 7 Strong Stocks to Buy to Survive the Coronavirus Crisis Analysts have an average price of $81.45 on SBUX stock. Conversely, investors may assume a 5.3% compounded annual growth rate in revenue. This implies SBUX stock is worth $74. Domino's Pizza (DPZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) is hiring around 1,000 more staff across more than 100 stores in Chicago. This signals that the company has a strong understanding of the neighborhood it serves. By positioning itself as a favorite restaurant option, Domino's has the opportunity to grow its market share.DPZ stock trades at a high P/E of 35 times, which is justified given the expected growth ahead.Before the global slowdown, the company grew U.S. same-store sales by 3.4% from the previous year. Its international business grew by 1.7%. Chances are good that as a delivery and carry-out business, the order rates will only grow in this tough economic period. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) shares lost almost half their value before rebounding sharply last week. Valuations for this popular restaurant are still unfavorable on a price-earnings basis. The company signed a deal with Uber Eats to provide delivery service for its customers. The company said that this will expand delivery and increase access to &quot;real&quot; food.Now that the new normal requires many to stay at home, Chipotle will deliver food to the customer's doorstep. Chris Brandt, its chief marketing officer, said that &quot;We're excited to expand our delivery footprint through a partnership with Uber Eats, which will make it even easier for fans to get the food they love without leaving the house.&quot;  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem The 24 analysts who cover CMG stock have an $858.62 price target. Conversely, compared with its peers, the stock does not have much upside on a multiples valuation model. Either way, Chipotle is a popular restaurant destination. This addition on my list of restaurant stocks to buy will thrive regardless of market conditions. Shake Shack (SHAK)Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) withdrew its financial guidance and shifted to a &quot;to-go&quot; model. Customers may order in the restaurant, online at its website or use the Shack App for pickup. Investors should notice that the stock fell into a prolonged downtrend over the last year. Valuations are unfavorable and the current headwind will slow its growth.In the last year, Shack system-wide sales grew 30% year-over-year to $895.3 million. Revenue grew 29% to $594.5 million while same-store sales grew 1.3%. Adjusted EBITDA improved by 11% YOY to $81.8 million. For 2020, the revenue growth momentum will end. But the business should rebound quickly.Investors cannot predict when the economy will return to normal. Even so, strong brand awareness in its many markets in the U.S. will help Shake Shack's business snap back. For now, its integrated delivery strategy with Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) will add more value and generate more business leads.Chris Lau is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is stable and responding to treatment at a London hospital.U.S. Democrats are seeking at least $500 billion in the next stimulus bill, and Hong Kong announced a fresh package valued at about $18 billion.

The state has lost more than 1,500 to the virus over the past two days, for a total of almost 6,300. Still, Governor Andrew Cuomo said hospitalizations are falling, showing social distancing is working.“Nobody is saying we peaked,” Cuomo said. “We’ve flattened the curve for this point of time.”New Jersey reported a record 275 deaths.

That’s down from 10,000 new cases-per-day.Officials said this means social distancing orders, including a shelter-in-place order that led to hundreds of thousands losing their jobs, is helping to slow the virus’s spread and keeping the health-care system from being overwhelmed.“Don’t stop doing what you’re doing, that’s what these models are showing,” Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton said during a Wednesday press conference in Columbus. “You have squashed this and you have stretched this.”N.J.

The day’s figures indicate a slight increase in the rate of growth.Some 14,682 tests were conducted in the country on April 7, more than the 14,006 conducted the day before. The U.K. aims to conduct 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, seeking to replicate the mass screening seen in countries such as South Korea and Germany.EU Plans to Prolong External-Border Closure Until May 15 (11:45 a.m. NY)The European Commission proposed prolonging until May 15 a ban on most travel into the European Union. Maintaining the restriction on non-essential travel into the bloc for another 30 days is necessary to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the commission said in a recommendation that needs the approval of member-country governments.Trump’s Plans to Reopen Economy Depend on Testing (11:30 a.m. NY)The White House is developing plans to get the U.S. economy back in action that depend on testing far more Americans for the coronavirus than has been possible to date, according to people familiar with the matter.The effort would likely begin in smaller cities and towns in states that haven’t yet been heavily hit by the virus. Cities such as New York, Detroit, New Orleans and other places the president has described as “hot spots” would remain shuttered. The planning is in its early stages.Read more hereEU Braces for Arrival of 8,000 Cruise-Ship Passengers (11:00 a.m. NY)Eleven cruise ships carrying around 8,000 passengers in total will arrive at European Unions ports between April 8 and 11, the European Commission said.The EU laid out guidelines for member nations on handling the travelers, saying ships with passengers known to be infected with the coronavirus should be directed to ports close to hospitals with adequate capacity.The commission also urged a coordinated EU effort to designate several ports for “fast-track” crew changes, citing the “essential role” of maritime transport in the bloc’s international goods trade.De Blasio Says Distancing Eases Ventilator Demand (10:55 a.m. NY)New York City’s social-distancing strategy appears to be working, and one result is less demand for ventilators than had been projected, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.The city had estimated that it would need as many as 300 more of the life-saving machines this week to treat coronavirus patients but has needed to add only 100, de Blasio said Wednesday at his daily virus briefing. It has 5,500 in all.Statewide, the infection rate has begun flattening, even as the death count rises.EU Working for Coordinated Ends to Members’ Lockdowns (10:40 a.m. NY)The European Commission is trying to coordinate how member states end lockdowns following criticism that the bloc’s initial response to the pandemic was chaotic. An internal draft of a memo seen by Bloomberg sets out conditions for easing to begin as well as other steps that be needed, such as expanding testing capacities and using apps to gather data.“Any level of (gradual) relaxation of the confinement will unavoidably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases,” according to the memo. Gradual exits and a phased-in restart to economic activity may be best, according to the memo. “Not all population should go back to the workplace at the same time.”The adoption of the plan has been pushed back, according to commission spokesman Eric Mamer, who told journalists in Brussels that timing is a “tricky issue” since countries are at different stages of the outbreak.McDonald’s Reports Sales Decline, Withdraws Forecast (9:06 a.m. NY)The company said comparable sales fell 3.4% in the first quarter, and it expects to cut capital expenditures by about $1 billion for 2020.Oktoberfest in Doubt as Germany Sees Lasting Impact (8:59 a.m. NY)Bavaria’s state premier cast doubt over the annual Oktoberfest, offering an idea of how long German authorities expect the pandemic to upend social life. Markus Soeder, a political ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, told the Bild newspaper that a decision will be taken in June, but that widespread travel and border openings by then are “very unlikely.” The traditional beer festival, which draws millions to the Bavarian capital of Munich, is scheduled to start Sept. 19 and last two weeks. If it takes place at all, “it will be under completely different conditions,” Soeder told Bild.Local French Curfew Blocked in Legal Rebuke of Lockdowns (8:51 a.m. NY)A French court blocked a curfew in a municipality north of Paris, in what is probably the first legal rebuke in the country of measures designed to halt the spread of the coronavirus.The court said the mayor of Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine had failed to justify the curfew, which went from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. The judge said that the regional government had already taken steps to prevent gatherings, including shutting liquor stores after 9 p.m.Dutch Cases Top 20,000 (8:31 a.m. NY)Confirmed cases in the Netherlands rose 5% to 20,549, below the average daily increase in the past week. Reported deaths rose 7% to 2,248. New hospital intakes climbed 4% to a total of 7,735, according to the RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.India’s Most Populous State Seals 15 Districts (8:23 a.m. NY)India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, has sealed off 15 of its districts worst affected by infections.“Since the numbers have risen sharply, this move is essential to stop community spread,” R. K. Tiwari, chief secretary of the state, said in a television interview on Wednesday. The state has so far recorded 326 infections and three deaths.India has had total infections of 5,360 and 164 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. A 21-day national lockdown ends April 14.Boris Johnson is Stable, Responding to Treatment (7:54 a.m. NY)U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in a stable condition in intensive care and is “responding to treatment” for a severe coronavirus infection, his spokesman said. Johnson was taken into St Thomas’ hospital in London on Sunday and moved to the critical care unit on Monday after struggling to shake off the symptoms, including a cough and a fever.Vaccine Hopes, Tests Boost Oxford Biomedica, Novacyt (7:50 a.m. NY)Oxford Biomedica shares rose as much as 24%, the most since Sept. 2013, after the firm joined a consortium working on a Covid-19 vaccine. The consortium, led by the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, has fast-tracked clinical trials of a vaccine candidate to start this month. Oxford Biomedica will be the manufacturing partner for the drug should the trials prove successful.Earlier, Novacyt SA shares extended their year-to-date surge to more than 1,600% after the company’s Covid-19 test was listed as eligible for procurement by the World Health Organization. The stock jumped as much as 22% in Paris as Novacyt said its diagnostics kit would be available for a year following an emergency process by WHO.U.K. Employers Cheating Furlough Plan Face Prosecution (7:37 a.m. NY)“Some employees have already been reporting that some employers have asked them to work during the furlough period,” Jim Harra, chief executive officer of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, told a panel of lawmakers by video conference on Wednesday. “If it amounted to trying to defraud us, we could take criminal action.”Under the job-retention program announced last month, the government will pay 80% of employee wages so long as they remain tied to their jobs during the economic lockdown designed to slow the spread of the disease. A condition of the payments is that no work is done for employers, although training is permitted.Democrats Seek At Least $500 Billion in Next Stimulus Bill (7:36 a.m. NY)Democrats want $250 billion in small business aid, with $125 billion channeled through community-based financial institutions that serve farmers, family, women, minority and veteran-owned cos, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement.French Scientific Committee Sees Confinement Until ICUs Relieved (7:18 a.m. UK)France will be able to look into ending its confinement only when intensive-care units won’t be saturated and other control measures are operational, the scientific committee that advises the government said in a note, cited by Agence France-Presse. Experts say the population’s immunity is probably under 15%.Hong Kong Unveils Virus Relief Package (6:33 a.m. NY)Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced a fresh government stimulus package worth about HK$137.5 billion ($17.7 billion) to support the city’s deteriorating economy. The spending package will include an HK$80 billion job security program to subsidize 50% of wages for affected workers for six months.WHO Says Lifting Lockdowns May Be Premature (6 a.m. NY)“To think we’re close to an endpoint would be dangerous,” Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, said at a briefing. Sweden is showing a fresh surge in cases, while the WHO is concerned about a dramatic increase in Turkey, he said. Countries should not lower their guard, he said.“We have got to ensure that the public understands we’re moving to a new phase,” said Bruce Aylward, one of the WHO’s top officials who recently led a mission to Spain. Countries need to make sure they’re hunting the disease down, because the key to eradication is testing patients, isolating them and tracing their close contacts. Some restrictions may need to continue for some time while others are gradually loosened, he said. “It’s not lifting lockdowns and going back to normal. It’s a new normal.”Spain’s success in slowing the spread proves that lockdowns and measures such as testing and contact tracing can work, Aylward said. While the country had a 20-fold increase in cases in the week through March 14, the rate later slowed to doubling every eight days.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Global Cases Surpass 1.5 Million; N.Y.

2020-04-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On March 24, as Congress struggled to authorize a massive federal rescue of an economy sinking beneath the weight of the coronavirus pandemic, four legislators sent a letter to the senators in charge, Mitch McConnell and Charles Schumer.The letter asked that the bill significantly increase taxpayer funds available to struggling franchise operators — the folks who run McDonald’s outlets and other fast-food eateries, for example. The legislation already envisioned spending hundreds of billions to help small businesses cover about two and a half months of payroll and other operating expenses. But the letter-writers requested four months of such coverage for franchisees.“There are more than 733,000 franchise establishments, operating in 300 different industries, which support nearly 7.6 million jobs and $674 billion of economic output for the U.S. economy. Many of them are struggling to retain their valued employees and may only have weeks to survive given the economic effects of this pandemic,” the letter noted. “We urge you to increase the loan size to four times the monthly operating expenses, up to $10 million for franchisees, and increase appropriations for the program to $500 billion to provide parity with the Treasury Department program for larger businesses.”When the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act passed three days letter, $350 billion of the $2.2 trillion bill was earmarked for small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. And in a few paragraphs buried inside its 335 pages, the bill tossed an unusual lifeline to franchisees. It wasn’t all the letter-writers had hoped for, but the CARES Act mandated that all franchisees, regardless of how many stores or restaurants they operated or how many people they employed in those outlets, would be eligible for federal small business aid.In other words, if you’re somebody like Greg Flynn, one of the country’s most savvy and successful franchise operators who ran, pre-coronavirus, a $2 billion network of 1,245 Arby’s, Panera Bread, Taco Bell and Applebee’s franchises employing 48,000 people, you’re eligible. And if you’re somebody like Representative Kevin Hern, who won a House seat in 2018 on the strength of his success running a chain of McDonald’s franchises in his home state of Oklahoma, you’re in, too.Hern was also one of the four legislators who wrote the March 24th letter to McConnell and Schumer. (Hern is a Republican. The three other authors — a Republican and two Democrats — don’t own businesses and have largely had careers in politics and public service.) Hern once owned as many as 18 McDonald’s franchises in the Tulsa area that employed more than 1,000 people. An Oklahoma non-profit news organization, The Frontier, nicknamed him “the McCongressman.” More recently, Hern has reported owning 10 franchises that employ more than 400 people. Financial disclosures he filed in 2018 said his burger joints contributed $25 million to $50 million of value to an overall portfolio of personal holdings worth between $38.7 million and $92.9 million at the time. His portfolio appears to have shrunk of late.“While he no longer manages the day-to-day aspects of the business, which includes 5 McDonald’s Restaurants and 216 employees, his family is running it in his stead and are handling all decisions,” Hern’s communications director, Miranda Dabney, wrote in an email responding to questions I asked about the CARES Act and Hern’s business holdings. “They have not laid off anyone since the start of the coronavirus shutdowns and are making every effort to protect their employees.”Protecting employees and businesses from being permanently fractured by the coronavirus is a paramount goal of the CARES Act. But Hern’s intersection with the bill highlights the degree to which subjectivity, imprecision and possible self-dealing have shaped the historic stimulus package — and just how ham-handed its rollout has been for one of its key beneficiaries, the small business community.The White House launched the program last Friday before finalizing its outline or clarifying with the banks acting as conduits some basic financial terms, such as interest rates on loans to entrepreneurs (even though waves of billion-dollar defaults are likely). Business owners initially weren’t sure how to apply for aid, and many worried that the largest among them would get preferential treatment. Entrepreneurs and lawmakers immediately complained that banks weren’t moving swiftly enough, and computer glitches further fouled the chaotic application process earlier this week. Soon enough, the Federal Reserve had to step in and promise it would help backstop the loans, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that he already wants Congress to allocate $250 billion more for the program.Schumer pointed out after the CARES Act passed that Congress made sure President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of Congress, heads of federal agencies, and all of their children, spouses and other relatives are banned from getting any money through the program — for businesses big or small. But it looks as if Hern worked out a nifty loophole for franchises.He and his office declined to comment when I asked whether his franchises planned to apply for federal aid — and whether doing so would be a financial conflict of interest that would undermine the general prohibition against government insiders getting a piece of the bailout. They also declined to comment on any discussions Hern may have had about the CARES Act with McDonald’s Corp., the fast-food giant that doles out franchises to guys like Hern. Nor did they respond when asked whether Hern would advocate for franchises in the second tranche of small business funding that Mnuchin is now trying to arrange.Asked whether he thinks the CARES Act should distinguish among franchise-owners based on size (by annual revenue or number of employees pre-coronavirus, for example), Hern, who is 58, emailed this response:“I was a business owner for 35 years. Since the start of this crisis, I've been approached by business owners across the country and across all industries, and I've made myself available to anyone seeking out guidance. I’ve done a lot of work to help my colleagues in Congress — many of whom have little to no experience as a small business owner or a job creator — to understand the challenges facing our local businesses today. We all support social distancing and other measures to defeat the coronavirus, but it’s important to remember that without government assistance, the economic consequences could be life-altering for millions of workers and small business owners alike. Franchises with locations under 500 employees are small businesses and should be treated as such — that way more workers remain on payroll and more businesses stay afloat. We should be working to minimize the losses and put our small businesses and their employees in a position to rebound when the economy reopens.”Hern continues to own his McDonald’s franchises while serving in Congress because federal ethics and conflicts-of-interest guidelines allow him to. While the guidelines limit how much outside income legislators can earn while serving in Congress, they permit exceptions for performing some kinds of outside work — including practicing medicine or advising a family-owned businesses. “Congressman Hern’s company is family-owned,” Dabney, Hern’s spokeswoman, pointed out in her email. Hern, according to one of his biographies posted online, also has “part ownership in a manufacturing facility in Muskogee, real estate ventures, and three technology companies,” and is “the co-founder of a community bank where he served for 17 years on the executive board.”To be sure, it makes sense for a struggling business owner of any size to seek relief — even private mega-franchisers like Flynn, who recently told the Public Broadcasting System he would seek aid because his revenue has plunged 60% and he’s had to furlough 30,000 employees. Flynn doesn’t have Hern’s catbird seat in Congress, and should be far too large for the CARES Act’s small business aid. But the act’s franchise carve-out gives him a way in. On the other hand, Flynn isn’t operating a Fortune 500 company, either, and would likely be outmuscled by big corporations seeking some of the $500 billion the CARES Act has designated for them. He runs a company that is betwixt and between, so he’s likely to maneuver wherever he can.The CARES Act has allowed for roomy interpretations of eligibility for small business aid, including for individual franchises that are tied to one another or to large corporations. Some restaurants and hotels that aren’t franchise operations but are part of chains have argued that size shouldn’t matter for those seeking aid. That’s rankled critics who apparently see the chains as playing unfairly. “There are other opportunities for those companies above 500 employees,” one of those critics, Representative Kevin Hern, observed Monday in the Wall Street Journal.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

2020-04-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. Postal Service has had a foot in the grave for years, with fatalists regularly urging it to accept the inevitable. “The Post Office Is Dying Because We Don’t Need It Anymore,” a tech- savvy writer advised in 2011. “The U.S. Postal Service Is Dying. Let It,” a libertarian blogger suggested in 2017. “Why Do We Have U.S. Mail And How Much Longer Will We Have It?” a self-described “customer experience futurist” asked in Forbes last year.Mother Nature recently decided to weigh in, too. The coronavirus pandemic has delivered a potentially fatal blow to the postal service, a 228-year-old mainstay of American life that traces its roots to the Constitution and whose services and ubiquity are made real by carriers visiting mailboxes and post offices that remain neighborhood fixtures.Postmaster General Megan Brennan told Congress recently that unless the Postal Service gets $50 billion in grants and aid, a $25 billion unrestricted credit line from the Treasury Department and $14 billion to pay off debts — $89 billion overall — it will run out of money by the end of the year. Brennan said that mail delivery volumes have plunged so drastically that the Postal Service is likely to have a $13 billion revenue shortfall this fiscal year.“The Postal Service is holding on for dear life, and unless Congress and the White House provide meaningful relief in the next stimulus bill, the Postal Service could cease to exist,” Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who is chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, observed during Brennan’s testimony.Our romantic attachment to letters from far away, birthday cards and exotic stamps aside, why not just use the coronavirus-crisis to finally put the Postal Service out of its misery and rely on email and private carriers instead? Why do we keep subsidizing a losing enterprise long since eclipsed by technological innovation?After all, the Postal Service has been struggling for a long time. Unlike private companies, it can’t pick and choose its customers. The law requires it to operate everywhere in the country, and it does. It has nearly 500,000 employees and the nation's largest domestic retail network — bigger than McDonald’s Corp., Starbucks Corp. and Walmart Inc. combined. It operates 34,000 facilities and 232,000 vehicles. That’s expensive; the Postal Service’s payroll alone is about $157 million a day.Before the coronavirus outbreak, the Postal Service was processing and delivering about 182 million pieces of first-class mail each day at the bargain rate of 55 cents a letter. But a federal agency, not the Postal Service, decides whether or not postage rates can rise — which hamstrings the service’s ability to fund itself more robustly. (Contrary to popular belief, the Postal Service hasn’t traditionally received taxpayer funding for its operating expenses and pays its way by selling postage and other products and services.) Federal overseers also dictate how many days a week the mail has to be delivered and how many post offices have to remain open.In a press briefing last week, President Donald Trump offered a diagnosis of what ails the Postal Service. Its demise is due to “these Internet companies that give their stuff to the Postal Service — packages.” Yeah, but no. The president’s critique stems from his long-running vendetta against Amazon.com Inc., a large customer of the Postal Service. Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post, whose coverage the president resents and, well, you get it. This may weirdly wind up informing how much support the federal government provides the Postal Service as it lies on its deathbed, but singling out package delivery as the force dragging the service down is wildly ill-informed.Mail delivery, in fact, remains the lifeblood of the Postal Service, and  it has been withering for years:  142.6 billion pieces of mail were delivered in 2019, compared with 216 billion pieces in 2006, which turned out to be a peak year. While e-commerce has given a handsome revenue boost to the Postal Service because of a jump in package deliveries, that hasn’t been nearly enough money to right the ship — packages still remain a relatively small part of what mail carriers deliver.In its semiannual report to Congress last fall, long before the coronavirus emerged, the Postal Service described its financial situation as dire. It recorded a net loss of $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018, following net losses of $18.9 billion for the fiscal years 2014 through 2017. A big chunk of those losses are due to a mandate from Congress that the service prefunds future retiree health benefits for its employees — a requirement that many other public and private entities don’t have to live with.For most of its history, the Postal Service believed that demand for its mail services would grow alongside the country’s population boom. And demand followed that script. Until it didn’t. Email and other services created an end-run that nobody anticipated when the Postal Service’s business model was invented. Time and crises have since undermined it even further.But simply pulling the plug on the Postal Service isn’t the answer. It still provides a vital lifeline to often unwired rural communities around the country, and older Americans depend upon it more than millennials and other younger correspondents. Those lithe private competitors – FedEx Corp., United Parcel Service Inc. and Amazon – still rely on the Postal Service to ship packages to the unprofitable “last mile” destinations their own services don’t reach. Households that operate small businesses often depend on the Postal Service’s package delivery as well.The Postal Service’s reach and its broad network of experienced, committed employees are assets, not liabilities. The network just needs to be reconfigured and repurposed, in some wrenching ways given how the coronavirus may permanently alter how consumers transact. The service should get more control over how much it charges for its services, how many people it employs and how easily it can innovate. Many post offices may have to be closed, but others could be reconfigured to also provide banking and licensing services if and when the world normalizes.Reimagine the Postal Service.

2020-04-14,"Mcdonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) is on the receiving end of a class-action lawsuit alleging widespread sexual harassment across corporate-owned stores in Florida, according to Reuters. Lawsuit Alleges 'Pervasive' Sexual Harassment, McDonald's Says It Will Investigate The plaintiffs allege in a lawsuit filed Friday in a Chicago federal court that McDonald's fostered a climate of &quot;severe or pervasive sexual harassment and a hostile work environment, including groping, physical assaults, and sexually-charged verbal comments,&quot; according to the report. The lawsuit seeks $500 million in damages. Jamelia Fairley, a current McDonald's employee, and former employee Ashley Reddick are representing a class of female employees across Florida's portfolio of more than 100 corporate-owned and non-franchised locations.Fairley and Reddick said McDonald's is also guilty of failing to provide necessary training to prevent sexual harassment.The burger chain also moved serial harassers from one location to another with no punitive action taken, according to the lawsuit. McDonald's said in a statement obtained by Reuters that past allegations of harassment and wrongdoings were &quot;investigated as soon as they were brought to our attention.&quot;Similarly, the company said it vows to &quot;investigate the new allegations&quot; that are raised in the new complaint.The allegations against McDonald's are not the first of their kind, according to Reuters.Sexual harassment allegations by Golden Arches employees reportedly date back to at least 2016, when the company first faced complaints that were filed with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.MCD Price Action McDonald's shares were trading 1.88% higher at $183.50 at the time of publication Tuesday.

2020-04-17,"On Apr. 8, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) provided a Covid-19 update along with its comparable store sales data for the first quarter. The fact that it was able to eke out a 0.1% increase in   U.S. same-store sales in the first three months of the year is pretty remarkable. Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnfortunately, the company's business in the U.S. and elsewhere is going to get worse before it gets better. This reality, combined with the fact the economy is set to crater in Q2, means its stock price is likely to fall further in the weeks ahead. Despite the fact that the Golden Arches is struggling like most restaurant chains, large and small, McDonald's remains the gold standard of restaurant stocks. Here's why. Cash Flow and Balance SheetInvestors have watched as company after company has drawn down their revolving credit facilities to ensure their businesses are able to restart once the country gets back to work. In McDonald's case, to conserve cash, it has suspended all share repurchases and raised $6.5 billion of debt in Q1 to tide it over. In addition, it will scale back on store openings and capital expenditures in 2020.  * 9 Asian Stocks to Buy for a Post-Coronavirus Recovery At the end of December, McDonald's had $899 million in cash on its balance sheet. It also had all of its $3.5 billion line of credit available if needed. That, along with the $6.5 billion it raised from debt markets in the first quarter, gives it $10.9 billion in cash.Lastly, the company's total debt obligations at the end of 2019 were $34.2 billion, with an average interest rate of 3.2%. That works out to $1.1 billion in interest annually. McDonald's has built itself a nice fortress to hold off the economic hit its business will take as a result of the coronavirus. It's Not All Bad NewsApproximately 75% of McDonald's restaurants around the world, including 99% in the U.S., are generating sales from drive-thru, delivery and take-away orders. Further, in January and February, McDonald's same-store sales grew 8% year-over-year in the U.S. and 7% overseas. Once everything gets back to normal  many months from now,  I have no doubt McDonald's business will be ready to continue its strong showing in the quick-service restaurant market. Unfortunately, in strong growth markets such as France and the UK, its restaurants are shut entirely, unable to generate sales. That's going to show up in the company's first- and second-quarter results. And even though many of its restaurants were able to function, the mass closures really took its toll on March's results. The company's U.S. same-store sales declined by 13.4% YOY in March, while its international stores delivered a 34.7% decline. Overall, same-store sales tumbled 22% in March. I wouldn't be surprised if April's results are even worse. At the end of the day, while drive-thru, delivery and take-away services can reduce the hit to the company's business, not even McDonald's can escape the significant damage the coronavirus is doing to the economy. As I've said, McDonald's is doing all it can to deal with this situation, including getting as much aid to its franchisees as is possible. &quot;The Company is working with franchisees around the world to support financial liquidity during this period of uncertainty. The Company has granted the deferral of cash collection for certain rent and royalties earned from franchisees in substantially all markets. The extent of the deferrals may differ in length by market,&quot; McDonald's stated in its Apr. 8 press release. While I'm sure franchisees need more, it's a start. And McDonald's wouldn't have been able to do that much if it didn't have a fortress-like balance sheet. The Bottom Line on McDonald's StockThe S&P 500 is currently trading at 2,772.56 as I write this. Market strategist Cam Hui published an article in MarketWatch on Apr. 14 that suggests the index could go as low as 1,275 before a bull market can emerge. That means investors have plenty of time to buy McDonald's stock.  The shares have fallen 8% this year, but the worst of the devastation from coronavirus has yet to be felt. In March, the shares were trading below $140. I would recommend waiting for the stock to return to that level before buying it. However, the Golden Arches is the restaurant stock to own over the long haul. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

2020-04-27,"For traders that like earnings reports, this is a mammoth week with nearly 680 companies slated to report quarterly results and to say some marquee companies are reporting is an understatement.On Tuesday alone, four members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average deliver earnings updates followed by seven more over the duration of the week, including all four of the largest U.S. companies by market value: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG).That quartet represents just a sampling of the earnings-driven events traders will be treated to this week. With some sectors likely to disappoint and others offering the potential for pleasant surprises, the following exchange traded funds could be worth considering over the next five days.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY)Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) gets the ball rolling on Tuesday for consumer cyclical earnings reports this week, but the reality is Thursday could be the day that makes or breaks the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR's (NYSE: XLY) near-term fortunes.On that day, Dow component McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) reports before the bell followed by Amazon after the close. With its restaurants down to just takeout and delivery because of the coronavirus, it's widely expected McDonald's won't be an earnings winner.View more earnings on MSFTThat shifts the burden to Amazon to carry the day for XLY, which is relevant because the stock commands almost 26% of the ETF's roster. Amazon hasn't prevented the largest consumer discretionary ETF from sinking 10.5% this year, but that's still 158 basis points better than the S&P 500.Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI)Due in large part to weakness in Boeing (NYSE: BA), the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI) is off more than 24% year-to-date. That stock's dramatic decline means it accounts for just 4% of XLI's roster.However, add of the earnings reports from this ETF's top 10 components this week - including Boeing on Wednesday - and the percentage is close to 19%. Dow components 3M (NYSE: MMM) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) along with UPS (NYSE: UPS) get the XLI earnings party started on Tuesday.That said, XLI could be taken for a spin on Monday following reports that Boeing is scrapping its $4.2 billion takeover of Brazil's Embraer.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) With Microsoft and Apple combining for 41.56% of the Technology Select Sector SPDR's (NYSE: XLK) weight, it's safe to say the largest tech ETF faces an important two-day stretch on Wednesday and Thursday.However, there may not be much in the way of surprises because both companies already pulled 2020 guidance because of the coronavirus. What could move XLK over the coming days would be commentary on 5G iPhones from Apple and any positive updates from Microsoft, if available, on the Azure cloud business and its efforts to unseat more nimble competitors in the virtual meeting arena.Visa (NYSE: V), another XLK top 10 holding, joins Apple in reporting after the bell Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * 3 E-Commerce ETFs For The Online Shopping Boom  * Geared Consumer Discretionary ETFs For An Altered Retail Landscape  * 3 ETFs To Short The Dow(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-30,"McDonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) reported a 3.4% decline in same-store sales in its first-quarter earnings, but it's difficult to model any progress as different countries are at different stages in their coronavirus response.McDonald's reported quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share, which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $1.57. This is a 17.4% decrease over earnings of $1.78 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $4.714 billion, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $4.650 billion.Inconsistent Recovery Worldwide It's difficult to model how McDonald's is recovering as a whole across the world given mixed trends and different consumer profiles, CEO Chris Kempczinski said on CNBC's &quot;Squawk on the Street.&quot; For example, trends in the U.S. started to improve in late April while the company is only now opening stores after completing pausing operation in Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom.Nearly 100% of all stores in China are open but consumers are still hesitant to return, the CEO said. A &quot;slow recovery&quot; is expected after all locations are completely closed.&quot;It's really tough to generalize -- lots of different scenarios playing out,&quot; he said.Breakfast Weakness McDonald's saw weakness during breakfast hours and Kempczinski this is a function of a disruption in a typical morning routine where consumers pick up breakfast on their way to work. Breakfast is a category likely to be the slowest to rebound, at least based on trends observed when thousands of stores were temporarily closed for renovations and upgrades.Nevertheless, breakfast remains a very important category for McDonald's and Kempczinski said he's confident future sales will return to pre-pandemic levels in terms of percentage of overall sales.Beef Shortages McDonald's has yet to see a single component of its supply chain breakdown at any of its restaurants, including food, packaging and materials. However, potential disruptions in the food supply is &quot;concerning&quot; and management is monitoring the situation &quot;hour-by-hour.&quot;View more earnings on MCD&quot;Our expectation is that [our suppliers] will make sure they do everything they can to guarantee our supply,&quot; Kempczinski said.Era Of COVID-19 Consumer wants and needs will shift in a post coronavirus world and McDonald's is fortunate to already have a compelling drive-through system, he said. Moving forward it's likely delivery orders, mobile pay options, curbside options will grow in size as consumers change how they go about in their daily lives.Dine-in will still remain an &quot;important part&quot; of McDonald's but &quot;time will tell&quot; just how significant it will be to sales.The stock traded around $185 per share at time of publication.Related Links:McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway Part Of China's Central Digital Currency Pilot: ReportMorgan Stanley Recommends Domino's, McDonald's As Restaurant Plays Amid Coronavirus ScareSee more from Benzinga  * Beyond Meat's Share Price Fails To Reflect Risk, Analyst Says In Downgrade  * McDonald's Accused Of Widespread Workplace Sexual Harassment In 0M Lawsuit  * Wendy's Charts Could Hint At McDonald's Future, Technician Says(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-30,"There are still some big earnings reports left for Thursday evening and Friday morning, as investors look for clarity heading into the weekend. With that in mind, here's a look at a few top stock trades now. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Amazon (AMZN)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been trading very bullishly over the past few weeks. The company continues to realize positive developments, and that hasn't slipped past investors.Shares hit new all-time highs this month and trade near them just ahead of earnings -- not unlike Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The question is, will it follow Netflix's path and trade lower after it reports on Thursday after the close?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn order for the good times to last, AMZN must clear $2,450 and close above this mark. More impressive would be a move north of $2,500 though.  * 7 Stocks That Still Need Greater Government Stimulus On the downside, a break of uptrend support (blue line) would be discouraging. However, losing the $2,300 mark would be a more bearish development. As long as Amazon stays above its 20-day moving average though, it's hard to get too bearish. Below puts the ~$2,200 breakout level on watch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Tesla (TSLA)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported much better-than-expected earnings results, and shares scorched higher as a result. However, bulls couldn't hold onto those gains.Shares opened north of $850 -- up almost 7% -- before trading up to $870 and reversing lower. Ultimately, Tesla turned negative in the session.The price action isn't the end of the world for bulls, but it's certainly a punch to the gut. From here, they can risk a bit more downside before things potentially get ugly. First, let's see if the 10-day moving average provides a lift. This level has been acting as support this month and so far, the stock remains above it.Below that puts $700 and the 20-day moving average in play. While this area should be decent support, a drop below risks an even further move lower. Remember, Tesla stock can be a big mover -- in both directions. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Gold ETF (GLD)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGold has looked good at various times this month, but stalls out every time it seems to get going. Above is a look at the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD).In February and March, the GLD found resistance in the $158 to $160 zone. After breaking out over this level in April, it has been acting as support. With Thursday's action though, this level is looking suspect.For now it has given the GLD a bounce, but it's falling below uptrend support (blue line) and the 20-day moving average. A move back over $160 would help the bulls tremendously right now, as would a rebound up to $164, the current high.  * 3 Video Game Stocks to Buy A move below current support puts $156 followed by the 50-day moving average in play. There are lot of gold bugs in this one, so if it begins to break down, it could lead to more selling as longs bail. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: McDonald's (MCD)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) opened lower but is rallying off the morning lows after reporting earnings. The stock was forming a tightening wedge coming into the report (blue lines).It was inevitable that MCD was either going to break out -- likely sending it to its 200-day moving average -- or break down. For now it's the latter, although buyers have been stepping in. They did so near $180, where McDonald's has its 20-day and 50-day moving averages.A move back below these marks puts $170 in play. If shares can reclaim the April high at $190.41, a move up to the 200-day moving average is possible.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-04-30,"McDonald's Corp. shares  rose 1.1% in premarket trade Thursday before falling back about 1%, after the fast-food giant missed on profit but beat revenue estimates for the first quarter, even after many of its restaurants were forced to close during the coronavirus pandemic. McDonald's said it had net income of $1.107 billion, or $1.47 a share, in the quarter, down from $1.328 billion, or $1.72 a share, in the year-earlier period.

In fact, BYND stock is up over 20% year to date, while the S&P 500 is down over 10%.Although it wasn't able to completely evade virus-related challenges, it has been on a mostly upward trajectory since the start of April. Many investors are hyped about the meatless meat company, which debuted on the Nasdaq just a year ago.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are certainly plenty of reasons to justify the hype.For example, the company recently announced that its products would debut in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shops in China, with rapid expansion expected. This is yet another big step for Beyond Meat, which has enjoyed product sales in fast food joints like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and YUM! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) KFC, along with many sit-in restaurants.Add to that the fact that real meat producers like Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) are dealing with supply chain issues, and it's likely that many will pick up faux meat products amid the shortage. This should help bolster grocery store sales for Beyond Meat.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy Of course, this will likely be a temporary boost. It's unlikely to endure at the same rate after meat supply-chain struggles diminish. Carnivores and omnivores will undoubtedly return to the real thing when it's available. This isn't the same kind of story with companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), where once you go cordless, you never go back.This is food we're talking about -- both taste and cost matter a whole lot. New Questions Leach Long-Term OptimismEven with these positive happenings, there's still reason to question the long-term case behind BYND stock.Some of these reasons include the following:  * The hype behind its debut in China might not lead to the significant success many expect. At least not as quickly as they think, since &quot;Beyond Meat will likely have to compete on the basis of price alone.&quot; It lacks the same brand-name recognition it enjoys in the U.S. and soy products are less &quot;taboo&quot; in China.  * Although the company will benefit from an expected meat shortage, it's not the only player in the game. Key competitor &quot;Impossible Foods … announced recently that its namesake burgers will be available at hundreds of new grocers.&quot; This will likely take a bit of shine out of its grocery store gains in the months ahead.  * More than half of Beyond Meat's revenue in 2019 came from restaurant sales. With the impact of social distancing on the restaurant business still to be determined, the strength of this revenue stream in 2020 is much less certain.  * As Motely Fool writer Brian Stoffel points out, the company hasn't demonstrated that it has a moat to secure its long-term position as a leader in the alternative meats industry. As it stands, other than brand recognition, Beyond doesn't have many distinguishing factors that its competition can't replicate. Until then, it is much less of a sure thing despite the advent of the meatless meat movement.There are more potential headwinds to consider; however, these ones stick out the most and counter the recent bullish narratives. But there's another issue that keeps coming to mind whenever I mull over whether it's a good stock to buy. As I alluded to earlier, both taste and cost are very important when it comes to food, and I believe at least one of these will become a bigger issue for Beyond Meat in these trying times. Beyond Meat Is Still a LuxuryBy now, I probably come off as some sort of meatless meat hater. After all, I am known to eat a 40-ounce steak on occasion (just ask my coworkers), and meat is still a part of my diet (although my consumption of it has been gradually declining over the past year). But my skepticism towards BYND stock here is not based in personal tastes. Rather it's based on some basic math and nutritional objectives.Yesterday, I was in Harris Teeter, looking in the meat aisle, which much like before, was relatively barren. And that's when I stumbled upon a pair of Beyond Meat Sausages. This time, I was much more tempted to try the company's product (I actually like faux meat in this format), but I went to a different aisle loaded with legumes, and bought a few packs of lentils instead.According to the store's website, four of the sausages sell for $6.99, and the packs of legumes I bought were $2.99 each (though sometimes they go on sale for much less, and this organic product is more expensive than standard lentils). While the sausages yield four servings, the two packs of lentils (for an equivalent price) yield 18 servings. Each has the same caloric profile -- 190 calories -- and the protein is a little higher in the sausages, while the lentils have much more fiber.Oh, and the lentils have much less fat too.The point is, I can get more than four times as many meals out of the organic lentils for the same price than I can with a pack of the faux meat sausages, all of which are still plant-based.The irony of the recent meat supply chain scare is that it still manages to illuminate a point I've made before: &quot;Beyond Meat is a luxury.&quot;Even when you throw real meat out of the picture, when you compare it to other plant-based sources of protein, its offerings are still very expensive. That's something a lot of bulls are overlooking when they see the massive spike in alternative meat purchases. People aren't exactly thinking things through right now (and they're going to the next &quot;logical&quot; conclusion, a fake meat alternative), but when they see their wallets start to empty and have hope of real meat back on the shelves in higher frequency, I'd expect the hype to falter.Right now, I'd see this as a chance for Beyond Meat to mitigate the losses from its lack of restaurant sales, but the extent of that mitigation is currently speculative at best, as is the extent of the damage to its revenue from the coronavirus. We'll find out more when the company reports earnings on May 5. The Bottom Line on BYND StockFor me, that's what Beyond Meat will probably always be. A luxury. I'll probably end up buying its sausages on occasion now that I've spotted them in my go-to grocery store. But I'll likely never see them as a staple in my diet.Despite the rapid rise in meatless meat sales, I don't think many other people will see it as a staple either. If there were a strong indication that the adoption of vegetarianism/veganism -- diets that expel meat completely -- were actually on a significant rise, I might think otherwise. But that isn't the case.I have no doubt that many more people will start buying faux meat from Beyond and other providers, but I doubt that it'll reach the same dietary inclusion as whole foods that have stood the test of time. At least, if it does, it won't be any time soon.But that's often how many of the bullish arguments for BYND stock are framed, as though meatless meat is going to become a widespread staple within a few years. Even if it did become more commonplace, who's to say that Beyond will still be a leader at that time? This is particularly questionable given Stoffel's in-depth analysis, which exposes its lack of a moat to secure itself.And yes, I do think the placement of its products in Starbucks is a big deal -- I think it will have an even greater appeal there than some fast food joints. But I don't think it's enough to escape the reality of high prices in tough times.I sound harsh here, but whatever your stance is, I'd like to echo InvestorPlace Contributor Will Ashworth's sentiment on the stock (he's been much more bullish on it in the past then I have):&quot;The last time I wrote about Beyond Meat was in March. At the time, I recommended that investors wait until the full ramifications of the coronavirus were felt before betting on its stock. I still feel that way as I don't think the first-quarter results will be as bad as some analysts believe. That said, I think you'll be able to buy it for $75 within the next few months.&quot;It's certainly possible that Beyond will surprise us with more positive news when it reports earnings in a few days, but even so, it's probably best to stay on the sidelines a little longer. Although there are good reasons to think the company will be at the forefront of the meatless alternatives movement, which could certainly accelerate in a post-coronavirus world, things are far too uncertain to take a gamble on right now.Robert Waldo has been a web editor for InvestorPlace since 2016.

2020-05-01,"For quite some time, I've expressed skepticism toward plant-based meat producer Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND). Primarily, I can summarize the enthusiasm in one word: fad. Most recently, we saw the dramatic rise and subsequent fall of National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ), which attempted to capitalize on the ephemeral sparkling water craze. But the difference is that unlike BYND stock, FIZZ never encountered an economically devastating pandemic during its glory days. So, will the novel coronavirus change the narrative for fake meat?Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com On the surface, it seems as if Beyond Meat received a much-needed lifeline. Recently, traditional meat-processing companies raised the alarm, suggesting that the pandemic's disruption to critical supply chains will translate to animal-protein-based food shortages. As we saw with toilet paper when the initial panic struck, just hearing about shortages for any core product will drive folks into a frenzy.If that were to happen with meat, only the early-bird shoppers will be satisfied. Everyone else will be left with no alternatives, except for one glaring option: plant-based meat. Based on this implication, BYND stock enjoyed a tremendously positive month of April.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, Beyond Meat isn't what you would call an alien concept. The company has made an aggressive push toward inking deals with high-profile fast-food chains, such as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Dunkin Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). It has also made substantial overtures to grocery chains.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy Some people swear by the product. Certainly, momentum at fast-food chains suggest that consumers are at least willing to give fake meat a shot. For those that the company hasn't reached, the pandemic -- along with the meat shortage -- represent a perfect opportunity.Nevertheless, I still wouldn't put BYND stock in your portfolio. BYND Stock Is in the Same Boat as Its RivalsFirst, let me address a somewhat overlooked factor: alternative meat is not universally loved. If anything, it's an acquired taste. Plus, the chemicals involved to give plant-based materials its meaty texture may not suit everyone's digestive system.Second, President Trump recently declared meat-processing plants &quot;critical infrastructure.&quot; While this announcement may not resolve all issues surrounding the meat-based food supply chains, it demonstrates that the federal government will do everything it can to prevent catastrophic shortages.But one of the biggest reasons why I'm skeptical about BYND stock is that its supporters are pretending that the headwinds that impact traditional meat will exempt the alternative meat industry. In reality, they're both sitting in the same boat.While the supply chain disruption has many components, a key driver to the meat shortages is demand. Shortly after Covid-19 raged across the nation, most states elected to impose stay-at-home orders. That one move immediately crippled the restaurant industry. Although many states allowed restaurants to switch to a food-delivery model, that failed to significantly mitigate the pain.Additionally, with nothing to do, most consumers have elected to do their own shopping. Obviously, it's cheaper -- especially during a time of economic turmoil -- and it helps kill the time.Unfortunately, this hard transition cut meat demand from restaurants, helping to cause the meat shortage we're suffering now. But the hit to restaurants is also a hit to BYND stock. In their most recent earnings report, management disclosed that restaurants and food service outlets represented 59% of Beyond Meat's quarterly revenue.In other words, whatever lookie-loo demand they get from grocery shoppers will not make up for the losses they're seeing from the headwinds supposedly creating their opportunity. A Classic Bull TrapThis is another reason why I call BYND stock a fad investment: Beyond bulls are only thinking one-dimensionally. If anything, the coronavirus is a bigger disruption to alternative meat companies as opposed to their traditional counterparts.That's because real meat producers don't need to justify their existence. Humans have been eating animal protein since their inception. More than likely, we'll continue to do so for another millennia. What does need justification is the concept of eating chemicals that resemble the look, taste and feel of the real thing.Yes, you can make the argument that Beyond has been successful in communicating that message. However, that communication was not cheap. In order to reap the rewards from that marketing risk, BYND desperately needed a normal market environment. Unfortunately, they don't have it.Instead, what they're left with right now are counterfeit products at premium prices. Ironically, because the plant-based supply chain isn't fully fleshed out, Beyond Meat products are priced much higher than their real counterparts.Put another way, Beyond lacks the scale to compete effectively. Once supply chains normalize for all food products, BYND stock has a chance. But by then, the traditional meat producers will presumably be back to full capacity.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

He pointedly targeted just one coastal county, saying beaches elsewhere hadn’t seen the same numbers of people blatantly violating social distancing.The move comes as many Californians grow impatient with the state’s virus lockdown, now well into its second month. Although polls have shown a majority of California residents support the restrictions, they are eager to see them end. And yet, the number of coronavirus cases confirmed in the state experienced its biggest one-day jump so far on Wednesday, with 2,417 new cases reported. The virus also killed 95 people in California Wednesday, bringing the total death toll to 1,982.DOJ Looking into PPP Relief Fraud (5:10 p.m. NY)The Justice Department has begun a preliminary inquiry into how taxpayer money was lent out under the Paycheck Protection Program and has already found possible fraud among businesses seeking relief, a top official said.Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, who runs the department’s criminal division, said prosecutors have contacted 15 to 20 of the largest loan processors and the Small Business Administration, which oversees one relief program, as part of an effort to police the trillions of dollars in federal aid being pushed out hastily to blunt the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The review has already turned up several red flags in the data prosecutors have examined over the past week, Benczkowski said Thursday in a telephone interview.“Whenever there’s a trillion dollars out on the street that quickly, the fraudsters are going to come out of the woodwork in an attempt to get access to that money,” Benczkowski said.Texas Reports Most Deaths in a Single Day (5 p.m. NY)Texas reported its deadliest Covid-19 day of the pandemic, less than 24 hours before Governor Greg Abbott’s reopening of the state’s economy was set to begin.The Lone Star state recorded 50 deaths from the virus, a 6.8% increase that pushed the death toll to 782, according to state health department figures. The surge in fatalities came as new cases jumped more than 1,000 for the biggest one-day increase in the raw number of detections since the peak on April 10.“Decisions will continue to be driven by data and doctors to provide the safest strategies to restore the livelihoods of Texans,” Abbott said in a tweet on Thursday. “Based upon this data, we can continue to open Texas businesses in ways that contain the spread of Covid-19.”Gilead Says Virus Clouds Outlook (4:30 p.m. NY)Gilead Sciences Inc. posted stronger-than-forecast results, but the drugmaker said there is significant uncertainty about how Covid-19 will affect its business even though its experimental treatment for the disease appears headed toward a swift U.S. authorization.There is ample enthusiasm for remdesivir, Gilead Sciences’ experimental medicine for Covid-19 that the Food and Drug Administration is rushing toward allowing on to the U.S. market after early clinical trials. But more broadly, Covid-19 could cause fewer patients to access treatments for conditions such as HIV, the company said.Amgen to Test Otezla for Covid Treatment (4:15 p.m. NY)Amgen Inc. will investigate the psoriasis drug Otezla as a potential therapy to treat Covid-19, the company announced during its first-quarter earnings.Otezla is a medication used to treat certain types of psoriasis as well as psoriatic arthritis. It’s being investigated to treat other immune system-related inflammatory diseases. In those Covid-19 patients that experience extreme symptoms, it’s believed that an overactive immune system may be at least partially to blame. Many critically ill patients experience hyper-inflammation, what’s known as a cytokine storm. It’s exploring if drugs that help temper the immune response may help to curb the severity of the illness.Amgen picked up the psoriasis drug Otezla in November from Celgene Corp. ahead of the company’s sale to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Amgen plans to begin clinical trials of the drug as a potential treatment for adults with Covid-19 within weeks.Otezla works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme found in inflammatory cells in the human body. It is thought to modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, which may prove helpful in inhibiting the inflammatory response associated Covid-19.U.S. Cases Rise at Slowest Pace This Month (4 p.m. NY)Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 1.2% from the day before to 1.04 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.

The federal health programs will also cover certain antibody tests to determine whether people have had past exposure to the virus, and approved at-home tests that let people collect samples themselves.With the changes, Medicare beneficiaries should be able to get tested at doctors’ offices or hospitals, at their homes, at pharmacies or drive-through testing sites, the agency said. Medicare covers about 60 million older or disabled Americans.Portugal to Reopen Small Shops (3:15 p.m. NY)Portugal will allow small stores to reopen from Monday, while shops in malls and the largest stores will have to wait until June 1, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said in a presentation of the plan to gradually ease confinement measures during the next month. The government will continue to assess data on the outbreak and if needed “take a step back” in its plan to ease restrictions every two weeks, he said.Gates: Vaccine Possible in 9 Months (3:15 p.m. NY)Bill Gates doesn’t think life will return to normal until there’s a viable vaccine that can stop its spread, and said such work could be completed within nine months.Gates, whose foundation is focusing its efforts on fighting the virus, said in a blog post that he agreed with predictions by infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci that developing a virus could take about 18 months. “It could be as little as nine months or as long as two years,” Gates said.Even at 18 months, that would still be the fastest that scientists have created a new vaccine, Gates said, adding that he’s thinks eight to 10 of the 115 current Covid-19 vaccine candidates look promising.Georgia Seniors Ordered to Stay Home (3 p.m. NY)Georgia Governor Brian Kemp extended his state health emergency through mid-June and urged residents to stay home whenever possible, even as a his shelter-in-place order expires Thursday.Kemp, in a statement, also said he will sign an order requiring “medically fragile and elderly Georgians” to continue to stay at home through June 12.

Plea (11:50 a.m. NY)President Donald Trump stopped short of committing to help New Jersey after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy went to the White House Thursday to press for federal aid.Murphy said the state has been crushed by the outbreak and told Trump he would appreciate “consideration” of further aid to states in the next round of coronavirus-related stimulus. Trump complimented Murphy’s leadership but didn’t explicitly commit to providing aid.Pelosi Expects $1 Trillion for Governments (12:10 p.m. NY)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the next aid package should provide $1 trillion just for states and cities. State governments have so far sought $500 billion, while local governments have a similar figure, Pelosi said. The funding could cover up to four years of expenses, the speaker said, adding that states and localities should be reimbursed both for virus expenses and revenue losses.Pelosi expects the House to return to Washington the week of May 11.Unemployment Strains State Accounts (11:05 a.m. NY)The record number of Americans drawing unemployment benefits during the pandemic is rapidly draining cash set aide by the biggest U.S. states, leaving them poised to borrow from the federal government.In April’s first two weeks, New York drew $1 billion from its account, or more than 40% of the total, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. California’s balance dropped by more than $2 billion since March 16, according to state officials. Texas, which had about $1.3 billion left in mid-April, has submitted a loan request to the Labor Department, as have Illinois, Connecticut and Massachusetts.When accounts run dry, states have to request an advance from the U.S. Labor Department. They have as long as 34 months to repay before the U.S. raises taxes on employers to recoup the money.Florida Cases Rise 1.5% (11 a.m. NY)Florida reported 33,690 cases on Thursday, up 1.5% from a day earlier.

Perdue anticipates the production shortfall, which he said is about 20% to 30%, to narrow to “10% to 15% within a week to 10 days.”In a telephone interview, Perdue said he expects slaughterhouse workers to immediately begin receiving protective gear and be tested.Macy’s Sets Reopening Schedule (9:55 a.m. NY)Macy’s said it plans to resume operations Monday at 68 locations in Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Oklahoma, where lockdowns are easing.The retailer, which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, has added barriers at cash registers, shut most fitting rooms and adopted a no-touch policy in the beauty department. A second set of stores will open May 11, Macy’s confirmed on Thursday, with the intent to reopen all stores by mid-June.FDA Moving at ‘Lightning Speed’ on Gilead Drug: Hahn (9:26 a.m. NY)“We’re working with the company to emphasize the necessity of speed while at the same time to understand the data,” the FDA commissioner said in an interview. “There will be a lot of factors that go into all the regulatory decisions. We want to look at the totality of data to make sure that remdesivir is targeted to the right patients.”Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease expert, said on NBC’s Today Show that he expected an FDA decision relatively soon. A vaccine could be available by January, he said separately.Reliance’s Profit Plummets on Oil Rout (9:23 a.m. NY)Reliance Industries Ltd.’s profit plunged nearly 40% from a year earlier, as lockdowns across the planet slammed demand for fuels, hitting its mainstay refining business.U.K. Bankruptcies Set to Rise After Lockdown Ends (9:16 a.m. NY)Bankruptcy experts say that the number of U.K. insolvencies is likely to rise sharply as further evidence emerged of the damage being inflicted by the lockdown.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters on Thursday that 4.1 billion pounds ($5.1 billion) of government-backed lending has now been issued under the U.K.’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.Two-thirds of U.K. firms have now applied for funds under the government program that pays 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, according to the Office for National Statistics.Portugal Has Most New Cases in Five Days (9 a.m. NY)Portugal reported the biggest increase in cases in five days, and the number of patients in intensive-care units rose after dropping for 11 days. There were 540 new confirmed infections, taking the total to 25,045, the government said. The number of deaths rose by 16 to 989.Later on Thursday, Portugal is set to announce which businesses can reopen from May 4, with confinement measures to be eased gradually every 15 days. The government hasn’t shut down the economy entirely, with industrial, construction and transport activities allowed to continue.Euro-Area Economy Could Shrink as Much as 12%: Lagarde (8:36 a.m. NY)The economy could shrink from 5% to 12% this year, Lagarde said during the opening statement of the ECB’s virtual monetary policy press conference in Frankfurt.The ECB unveiled a further facility to inject liquidity into the economy after data showed the worst three-month contraction in a quarter of a century of data. It delivered a new lending salvo that includes a so-called “PELTRO” measure to further assist growth, and will keep asset purchases and interest rates unchanged.The bank said the lowest interest rate on a program that gives banks incentives to lend to companies and households will fall to 50 basis points below the deposit rate, currently at -0.5%. Interest on the new, non-targeted facility will be 0.25% below the main refinancing rate that currently is zero.Singapore Cases Must Ease Before Economy Restarts (7:41 a.m. NY)Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cautioned that things won’t ever get back to the way they were before. He warned “significant structural changes” to the economy are likely even after the virus abates, with some industries disrupted permanently, companies having to change their business models to survive and some jobs simply disappearing. Many workers will have to accept pay cuts so their companies can survive, he said.When Singapore does reopen, it won’t happen all at once, Lee said. Rather, it will reopen step by step, with critical industries and those connected to global supply chains going first. Places that draw crowds, such as entertainment outlets and large-scale sporting events, will have to wait.Germany Sets Out Terms For Lufthansa Aid (7:35 a.m. NY)Deutsche Lufthansa AG is expected to accept a significant government stake and state veto rights in exchange for a multibillion-euro package of assistance, according to people familiar with the matter.While details are still being negotiated, the economy and finance ministries have ironed out disagreements that dragged on for weeks. The plan foresees Germany taking a least a 25% stake in the airline and receiving at least one seat on the firm’s supervisory board, the people said. The assistance could run to 10 billion euros ($11 billion).Children May Be Just as Infectious as Adults (7:30 a.m. NY)Children with the new coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, according to a study from Germany that recommends caution against an unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens.While children have a lower risk of developing severe illness from Covid-19, they may be no less capable of spreading it. Levels of virus in the respiratory tract -- the main route via which the pathogen is transmitted -- don’t appear significantly different across age groups, Christian Drosten, director of the Institute of Virology at Berlin’s Charite hospital, and colleagues found.The WHO says more research is needed on the topic. For now, household transmission studies indicate that children are less likely to transmit Covid-19 to adults than the reverse, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday.Conoco Deepens Production Cuts (7:21 a.m. NY)ConocoPhillips estimates that it will voluntarily curtail production by 420,000 net barrels per day. Cuts for May are estimated to be 230,000 barrels per day. Future decisions to curtail will be made on a month-to-month basis.Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, earlier cut its dividend for the first time since at least the Second World War and signaled demand may not fully recover once the pandemic is over.McDonald’s Flags ‘Dramatic’ Changes in Behavior (7:10 a.m. NY)The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted business, the company said. “The resulting operational impact brought on by several related factors, including restaurant closures, limited operations and dramatic changes in consumer behavior, led to a marked decline in sales during the second half of March and significantly affected the company’s first quarter results.”Nissan Sunderland Production Won’t Start Until June (7 a.m. NY)Vehicle Production at Nissan’s U.K. Sunderland plant will continue throughout May, and the company is currently planning a phased resumption of production in early June. Output has been suspended since March 17. The majority of employees at the plant will remain furloughed.That comes as manufacturers from Volkswagen AG to Renault SA and Daimler AG are restarting factories in Europe with little visibility about how much actual demand there will be once customers emerge from restrictions. Aston Martin said last week it intends to reopen its St. Athan factory in Wales on May 5, while operations at its main site in Gaydon, England, “are planned to resume later.”Japan’s Abe Signals Plans to Extend Emergency (6:45 a.m. NY)Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signaled that he plans to extend a national state of emergency, saying that current conditions make it difficult to stick to the current end date of May 6. Abe told reporters in Tokyo it would be difficult to return to the previous way of life on May 7. The country’s parliament passed a $240 billion extra budget for this fiscal year, securing part of the funding for a record stimulus package and clearing a major hurdle for aid getting to small businesses.Separately, Fuji News Network reported that Japan will call for creating a joint fund to combat the pandemic at a teleconference later in the day by Group of Seven finance chiefs. The fund’s main role would be helping make medicines and vaccines against the illness widely available in the world.Continental Shelves Unit Spinoff (6:36 a.m. NY)Continental AG said it’s postponing the planned spinoff of its Vitesco powertrain division due to market disruptions sparked by the coronavirus crisis. Continental won’t put the transaction up for a vote at its July 14 shareholder meeting, but still plans to pursue the spinoff at a later stage. Vitesco makes engine components, electronics and sensors.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","U.S. Cases Increase 1.2%, Slowest Pace This Month: Virus Update"

2020-05-01,"As our country wrestles with the economic damage caused by the novel coronavirus in the first quarter, many investors are understandably charting their longer-term strategies. But according to Hiroyuki Ito, professor of Economics in Portland State's College of Urban and Public Affairs, the second quarter's trajectory depends on &quot;how much the world succeeds in curbing the spread of the virus.&quot; Given the uncertainties, bullish contrarians may want to go with a tried-and-true approach: purchasing high-quality Dow Jones stocks.Major blue chips have always enjoyed relevance regardless of the market cycle. Known for their stability and technical predictability, Dow Jones stocks can help mitigate any unexpected downfalls as you gear your portfolio for higher growth during bull markets. But in a downturn, these steady names are even more valuable.Typically, blue chips pay dividends, which allow you to accrue passive income while you wait out a storm. Additionally, Dow Jones stocks are levered to critical businesses. Therefore, they are likely to keep the red ink manageable as opposed to speculative growth companies, which can quickly raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels. You may even see an uptick in momentum, depending on the circumstances.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 of the Best Food Stocks to Buy Right Now Further, the corporations that make up the Dow 30 usually dominate their industries. Thus, any consolidation effect that could occur during a bearish phase could end up benefiting Dow Jones stocks. Specifically, I'm targeting these ten names:  * 3M (NYSE:MMM)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * IBM (NYSE:IBM)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * Disney (NYSE:DIS)As with any other investment that has been deeply impacted by the coronavirus, caution is still the name of the game. Even with Dow Jones stocks, you don't want to get too comfortable. Take a modest position now, but make sure to have some ammo remaining for any dip-diving opportunities. 3M (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com Although industrial giant 3M had obvious positive implications from the coronavirus -- as you know, they make the highly demanded N95 facemasks -- the first three months of 2020 weren't particularly pleasant for MMM stock. Along with the fact that neither consumers nor healthcare professionals could get reasonable access to 3M's personal protective equipment, the company faced accusations of selling their vital products to foreign entities.Some handwringing and President Trump's invoking of the Defense Protection Act appeared to have calmed tensions. Quickly, MMM stock responded with a robust performance so far in April. While these hiccups were not ideal from a PR perspective, the drama can't detract from the obvious.Previously, 3M was a lumbering, irrelevant organization. Now, they're one of the most critical. In fact, MMM stock has inserted itself into a national debate of restarting our core infrastructure. If so, that would be a big win for American industry, which is why you should keep 3M on your list of Dow Jones stocks to buy. Home Depot (HD)Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com Understandably, when the coronavirus panic first hit the U.S., many investors speculated on grocery firms like Kroger (NYSE:KR). Of course, it was a brilliant move as KR has enjoyed strong upside. But among Dow Jones stocks, Home Depot will probably benefit from a similar sentiment over the next few months.Just like Kroger shares, an investment in HD stock gives you exposure to an essential service. Obviously, most people are concerned about having enough food and water. But once that anxiety subsides, we quickly come to a stark realization: life's mishaps don't pause just because human societies are suffering from a pandemic.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy I'll give you a silly but pertinent example. When I thought I had my basics covered, that's when the bathroom lightbulb went out. I had spares, but I realized that for many people, incidents like these have caught them out. Therefore, even in a prolonged recession, I expect consistent demand to bolster HD stock. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com For most investments, including several Dow Jones stocks, the Covid-19 pandemic is just about the worst news that could happen. And I'm not suggesting that Johnson & Johnson was hoping for such an outbreak to occur. Nevertheless, I can't help but look at JNJ stock with some sense of cynicism. Without the coronavirus, we may be looking at Johnson & Johnson from a different lens.Obviously, the ongoing asbestos controversy has cast a dark cloud on JNJ stock. Last year in October, shares took it in the chin when Johnson & Johnson announced a voluntary recall of its baby powder product due to asbestos contamination. Also, shares have reacted wildly to the company's involvement in the drug addiction crisis.Today? When JNJ stock flashes across your screen, you're probably not thinking about any of these devastating controversies. Instead, you're thinking about the healthcare giant's many positives, including their over-the-counter medication portfolio that has allowed people with mild Covid-19 symptoms to recover. Walmart (WMT)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com As our own Tim Biggam argued, Walmart shares right now look &quot;tired and toppy,&quot; to use his language. Admittedly, I find it difficult to argue against that assessment. Plus, the fact that WMT stock is acting like this ahead of Walmart's earnings report doesn't inspire much confidence. But should shares tumble, you may want to consider adding the big-box retailer to your list of Dow Jones stocks to buy.As I mentioned near the top, Walmart may benefit from a consolidation effect. Again, as a big-box retailer, Walmart offers consumers everything. Therefore, in a prolonged recession, I would have concerns about specialty retailers. After all, why would you shop at multiple locations when you can get both your necessities and your discretionary items in one place?  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus Weakness That said, you want to exercise some caution with WMT stock relative to other Dow Jones stocks. Although I like the coronavirus lift, holiday sales were soft in 2019 for brick-and-mortar retailers. Thus, it's one warning sign to watch, especially if we enter a nasty recession. McDonald's (MCD)Source: CHALERMPHON SRISANG / Shutterstock.com Out of the Dow Jones stocks to consider for recession-proofing your portfolio, McDonald's is one of the more perplexing names. Especially with a pandemic-fueled recession, you wouldn't expect MCD stock to do well. For starters, customers must worry about how their food is handled, especially by low-income workers who feel they must work instead of calling in sick. Then there's the simple fact that it's much cheaper to cook your own food.At the same time, even in economic downturns, people need a respite from their day-to-day struggles. For some, that may mean downsizing their dining out budget to fast-food eateries. In that case, purchasing MCD stock on any dips may be a shrewd acquisition.Better yet, strong evidence exists for this approach. During the Great Recession, several fast-food restaurants saw an increase in sales. Therefore, it's reasonable that to believe that MCD could move higher, if only for the reason that humans are predictable. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com If you're thinking about literal consumption-based Dow Jones stocks to buy, you may want to check out Coca-Cola. Just like McDonald's, KO stock doesn't immediately grab you as the best investment to avoid a coronavirus-fueled recession. Plain old water is much cheaper. Plus, drinking too much soda is very bad for your health. Not to belabor the point, but excessive consumption can also cause the underlying health conditions for which Covid-19 is especially deadly.On the flipside, KO stock represents cheap escapism. During bull markets, people may have more expensive tastes for their celebratory occasions. Today, with money being much tighter, consumers will naturally cut back their expenses. But it's unlikely that they'll give up all frivolous pleasures in life.  * The 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Years Another point to consider about KO stock is that its underlying products are cheap pick-me-ups. As caffeinated drinks, Coca-Cola beverages offer a far less expensive alternative to iced coffee from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), for example. Thus, you don't want to ignore this icon if you're focusing exclusively on Dow Jones stocks. IBM (IBM)Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com Considering the damage that was inflicted on Dow Jones stocks by the Covid-19 pandemic, IBM produced solid results for its first-quarter 2020 earnings report. Against an earnings-per-share target of $1.80, Big Blue delivered $1.84. It also rang up $17.57 billion in revenue, which was a bit short of the $17.62 billion that analysts forecasted. However, the coronavirus impacted its growth opportunities.But that's not the reason why I'm bullish on IBM stock. As we put this ugly chapter behind us, there will be plenty of non-impacted earnings reports to dissect. Rather, the technology giant saw tremendous growth in certain segments even with the virus disrupting everything.According to an email sent to me by Tim Davidson from IBM Corporate Communications, &quot;despite the massive impact of COVID-19 in Italy, IBM's business grew there by 5 percent -- a remarkable performance that shows how clients turn to IBM in crucial situations for advanced technology and trusted data management and analysis.&quot;In times of trouble, people trust the technologies and innovations from respected brands. I couldn't think of a better reason to bet on IBM stock. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Historically, Dow Jones stocks have been levered to big, industrial names. But over the last few years, the index has incorporated much more relevant companies like Microsoft. What I like about MSFT stock is that while this security probably won't make you rich, it provides steady returns. Also, I love how the management team reinvigorated a software firm that was going stale.Despite this coronavirus pandemic, I think Microsoft's strengths shine through. For example, because of the nature of my profession, I would be dead in the water without the company's Software as a Solution platform. Yes, other business suites exist but whether you like it or not, the world runs on Microsoft. That's one viable reason to consider MSFT stock.  * 9 of the Best Food Stocks to Buy Right Now Another is that the leadership team emphasizes constant innovation and competitiveness. As a prime example, they're making huge waves in the cloud computing space, giving Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fits. Also, the company offers Microsoft Teams as an intuitive teleconferencing alternative to Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM). Nike (NKE)Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com Right now, I'm not a big fan of consumer retail names. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the retail segment suffered the worst hit in March. Within this category, the clothing and accessories segment was absolutely obliterated. Thus, you wouldn't expect much from Nike and NKE stock.But if you're a daring individual, you may just want to consider putting it in your prospective list of Dow Jones stocks. As Matt McCall recently pointed out, Nike has tremendous customer loyalty that is unparalleled within the athletic apparel industry. A great example is the Colin Kaepernick controversy. Typically, companies avoid scandalous players like Kaepernick because it's bad for branding. But Nike knew their audience and ran an advertisement featuring the polarizing figure.Initially, some conservatives pushed back against the apparel behemoth. However, NKE stock won out in the end, driven by strong customer response. I imagine if Nike can get away with a Kaepernick ad, the coronavirus may not be that much of a challenge. Disney (DIS)Source: chrisdorney.Shutterstock.com Fundamentally, when you stack up Disney against other Dow Jones stocks, it's hard to imagine a more embattled organization. Actually, the oil companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are much worse. But DIS stock is taking it on the chin in its underlying pivotal businesses.With movie theaters shut down due to Covid-19, it has unfairly lost hundreds of millions of dollars in box office revenue. Further, with stay-at-home orders, Disney's resort business is non-existent. Then, you have the fact that there are no professional sports. If Disney-owned ESPN wasn't already pointless, the coronavirus proved it in cruel fashion.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy Yet I don't expect this pandemic to be with us forever. When we finally reopen and the fear subsides, DIS stock could be a huge beneficiary of pent-up demand. It will take time, though, so be careful with this one.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-05-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Lockdowns have devastated retailers and restaurants on both sides of the Atlantic. An easing of restrictions won’t be the magic wand that waves their worries away.Even when it’s possible for consumers to walk freely into their favorite shops and bars, they may be nervous about doing so. That puts the onus on retailers to make their locations as reassuring as possible. There’s a range of things they can do, from installing stations dispensing hand sanitizer with a wave, establishing distance markers to keep shoppers safely away from each other and even altering store layouts to keep patrons from crossing paths. Dressing rooms are likely to remain closed for the foreseeable future.As for casual dining outlets, it will mean eliminating some tables to put more space between them, and in pubs, finding ways to maintain a festive atmosphere with fewer revelers.There’s a cost associated with making all of these changes, while also protecting employees with masks and screens, and rethinking kitchens and break rooms. Some venues may need more employees to clean more often, disinfect merchandise and, where necessary, station someone at the door to let one shopper in as one exits. In restaurants, it could mean new apps to allow people to place orders from their phones, or even taking a cue from China and investing in robots to serve up the food. With little money coming in to businesses that had to shut their doors, more outlay to refit facilities is an unfortunate drain on cash.For some, it’s a big question whether the investment is worth it, especially if there will be fewer customers as people adjust to a new reality living with the coronavirus. There may be some pent-up demand — just look at the frenzy of luxury shopping in China, the French lining up at McDonald’s drive-thru windows and Britons queuing to get into Kingfisher Plc’s B&Q outlets to stock up on plants and paint when the home-improvement chain reopened. But that might prove short lived.Even if customers do want to return to strip malls and main streets — and that’s not clear right now — restrictions on the number of shoppers allowed into locations at any one time will mean there are fewer sales per day. Casual dining restaurants could be operating at just 30%-50% of their usual capacity where strict social distancing rules are in place. Yet when stores and eateries reopen, they will still have to pay their rent and other bills.In retail, initially, that risk is most severe for value chains, such as Gap Inc.’s Old Navy, Associated British Food Plc’s Primark and the dollar stores, because they rely on a large number of purchases at lower prices. But as the economic hardship from the pandemic hits home, consumers are likely to trade down to more affordable chains, offsetting this pressure.Whatever their target market, all retailers look set to suffer from lower sales. For example, Macy’s Inc. plans to begin opening some of its department stores on Monday, and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette told Dow Jones that he expects the locations that come back first to do less than a fifth of their normal sales volume initially. Even if lockdowns last four months, their effect on retail sales may last the equivalent of six months, because of fewer transactions as a result of social distancing, nervous consumers, and the inevitable strain on shoppers’ finances that will follow the pandemic, according to research firm Forrester.As for pubs and bars, crowded Friday and Saturday nights are the profit drivers. That may change with limits on the number of people who can enter. Who wants to go to an empty pub anyway?The fear factor and hassle that restricted access to stores brings — shopping for even the simplest items can become extremely time consuming — means that consumers will probably choose to shop online if they can. Internet purchases in the U.K. will account for 41% of all retail sales excluding food over the next 18 months or so, up from 29% at the end of 2019, according to independent retail analyst Richard Hyman.No wonder retailers and restaurants will do everything they can to compete in that space. No-contact click-and-collect services, used by B&Q during the lockdown, will likely expand to other retail sectors. Restaurants may remain focused on takeaway for the time being, and options such as the make-at-home kits already on offer in the U.S. at the Denny’s Market restaurant chain.Business won’t open all their sites in one go. Tackling social distancing is likely trickiest in big cities, such as London and New York. U.K. clothing retailer Next Plc will concentrate on large stores out of town first, as they tend to be roomier with longer opening hours and spacious parking lots that can accommodate queuing customers. It will monitor how this works before moving to smaller stores in more urban areas. As one of the strongest names, Next can afford to wait and see.But elsewhere, it is likely some locations will never resume trading, given that the economics of doing business will deteriorate. Even healthy chains may never open 20% of their stores again, estimates Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors.There is one consolation for business that do pull up the shutters once more. They’ll face a competitive landscape that is significantly diminished. But that may count for little given the strain from the lockdowns and the meager recovery that is set to follow.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-05-01,"Beyond Meat NASDAQ:BYND) is off to a solid start in 2020. BYND stock is up over 30% in 2020. Revenue has grown from $33 million in 2017 to $298 million last year. And gross margins of 34% in the fourth quarter were significantly higher than regular beef sellers.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com Beyond Meat continues to pursue partnerships with large restaurant chains, the most recent of which is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). And very importantly, the company has a new line of credit in place. This is important because there was some question about whether Beyond Meat would be able to meet the production demand.But that has never been my concern about Beyond Meat. The company is making the right moves. However, the company has never had a moat. And if the recent coronavirus outbreak is reminding us about anything, it's that the audience for its products is finite.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Coronavirus and BYND StockIf a manufacturer is facing increased competition for its customers, a logical strategy would be to make efforts to expand its customer base. Beyond Meat is clearly making an effort to expand its customer base.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades It is seeding its product in familiar locations like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks. And those partnerships are showing mixed results.In that regard, the coronavirus is creating a lost opportunity because customers are spending more time eating at home. But that also creates an opportunity for Beyond Meat. The Plant-Based Market is RealIn December of last year, the New York Times referenced a Nielsen study about plant-based foods. In the survey, 40% of respondents said they were making an effort to eat more plant-based foods.Now, the marketer in me can quibble with the words &quot;make an effort,&quot; but let's take that number at face value. After all, some analysts are forecasting that the market for plant-based food could reach $8.1 billion by 2026.With that kind of forecast, it shouldn't surprise you to know that many of the large meat processors are entering the field. Shortly after Beyond Meat went public, companies such as Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), Perdue (NASDAQ:SAFM), and Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) introduced plant-based meat alternatives.On the one hand, this would bring attention to Beyond Meat products. On the other hand, it remains to be seen if those companies will steal shelf space from Beyond Meat. Consumers Don't Seem to Be Opting for Something NewInvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto broke down last year's sales and found that each Beyond Meat customer bought an average of $12.49 of the company's products. With that in mind, I was curious to see if the coronavirus would create an opportunity for Beyond Meat to introduce its products to a wider customer base.I've noticed that depending on when you go to the store, fresh beef may be hard to find. This was a premise for investors driving up BYND stock over 50% in the last month. But as my InvestorPlace colleague Robert Waldo points out, the panic run on the grocery stores has, at least in one case, shown that Beyond Meat may be a luxury that some consumers will decline to purchase. If Not Now, When for BYND Stock?So I'll come back to the question I asked to start the article. If the Covid-19 pandemic is not a catalyst for growing the market for Beyond Meat products, when will there ever be a catalyst?I've written on Beyond Meat quite a bit since its initial public offering (IPO) last year. From the beginning, I've been bearish on BYND stock. And fundamentally I still am.This has nothing to do with the viability of plant-based diets. I know several people who follow a plant-based diet in one form or another. Some do it to assist with an underlying medical condition. Others do it because they believe in the health benefits of a plant-based diet.The problem I've always had with Beyond Meat is they are working with a relatively finite consumer base. And they aren't unique (enough) to prevent competitors from taking away market share.Tim Biggam observed that investors sold BYND stock after each of its last three earnings reports. Given the fact that BYND stock is up nearly 50% in the last month, it is likely that the same dynamics are in place.This isn't a case of a company being mismanaged. It's simply a question of numbers and time. And neither of those work in favor of Beyond Meat as a long-term play.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-05-06,Investors appear to be looking past near-term woes and to the reopening of the U.S. economy. Shares were up Wednesday morning.,Wendy’s Earnings Were Disappointing. Why Its Stock  Is Jumping.
2020-05-06,"Shares of plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) popped in early May after the company reported strong first quarter numbers that broadly underscored that the global consumption pivot towards alternative meat remains robust, even amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. The company also scored a surprise profit in the quarter, which pleased investors.Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com In sum, Beyond Meat's earnings were good enough to send BYND stock up 20% to its highest levels since February. Year to date, the stock is now up nearly 60%. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is down more than 10% in 2020.Is it time to fade the rally? Or will Beyond Meat keep outperforming?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI think it's the latter. And my thoughts are backed by four big reasons:* Beyond Meat's strong earnings emphasize that the plant-based meat growth narrative is only gaining momentum, and that the company is extending its leadership position in the market.* Gross margins are improving rapidly and dramatically, paving the path for huge profit potential at scale.* Certain catalysts, such as aggressive expansion in China and a rebound in the foodservice channel, could spark supercharged growth in the second-half of 2020.* The fundamentals imply that BYND stock can and will run above $300 within the decade (and maybe even higher). Beyond Meat's Strong EarningsBeyond Meat's first quarter earnings report was strong, and broadly underscored the long-term bull thesis underpinning BYND stock.In short, that long-term bull thesis is that an increasing number of socially and environmentally conscious consumers are increasingly choosing socially and environmentally positive products and services. Think electric cars and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Or clean energy and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). Or, yes, plant-based meat and Beyond Meat.By aligning itself with this massive consumption pivot, Beyond Meat has guaranteed itself rising demand for the foreseeable future. More than that, Beyond Meat is the &quot;Tesla of plant-based meat&quot; in that the company is the undisputed leader and face of the market.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now Beyond Meat's earnings underscored that all of this rings true today.Even amid a global economic shutdown, Beyond Meat's retail revenues rose 185% year-over-year, paced by 150% domestic growth and 100% international growth. Foodservice revenues rose 100%, too, despite many restaurants across the world closing their doors in March.In other words, Beyond Meat sustained red-hot growth, even at a time when consumer spending fell off a cliff. Further, Beyond Meat's market share in U.S. retail rose 770 basis points in the quarter, with Beyond accounting for the top four best-selling SKUs in the whole plant-based meat category and the company outpacing its closest competitor in terms of sales growth by a factor of roughly six-times.Zooming out, the long-term bull thesis remains intact. The plant-based meat growth narrative remains robust. Beyond Meat continues to dominate that market. So long as those two things remain true, BYND stock has a bright future. Improving MarginsArguably just as notable as Beyond Meat's sustained robust demand trends in the first quarter were Beyond Meat's soaring profit margins.Specifically, gross profit margins in the first quarter rose 12 points year-over-year and 5 points sequentially to nearly 39%. On a trailing twelve month basis, gross margins are now at 36%, up more than 200 basis points from where they were just three months ago.A 35%-plus gross margin for Beyond Meat is a big number. Most meat companies -- like Tyson (NYSE:TSN) -- operate around 11% to 12% gross margins, with around a 5% operating expense rate, for operating profit margins in the 5% range.Beyond Meat's gross margins are above 35%. It appears they are on track to hit 40% in the long run. If so, and if Beyond can leverage scale to drive its expense rate down to more normal near-10% levels, then you're talking about a company that could potentially operate at 25%-plus operating margins at scale -- or about five-fold that of Tyson.Big picture: thanks to huge and rising gross margins, Beyond Meat has huge profit production potential in the long run, more-so than has ever been seen before out of a meat company. Catalysts on the HorizonBeyond Meat has two huge catalysts on the horizon which could spark a growth surge in the back-half of 2020.First, the relatively depressed foodservice channel could rebound.McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are among a handful of restaurants which have hinted that retail food traffic trends have started to improve over the past few weeks, after a disastrous drop-off in March. Traffic trends will continue to improve in May and throughout the summer, as economies across the globe gradually re-open and consumers regain confidence. As that happens, Beyond Meat's foodservice business will rebound in the second quarter, and once again turn into a growth engine by the second-half of 2020.Second, Beyond Meat could start to see explosive growth in China.The company is going to launch Beyond Beef items at Starbucks locations in China soon. Beyond Meat has also finalized a distribution agreement with a leading local distributor in China, Sinodis, which should &quot;unlock a network of distribution opportunities across retail and foodservice,&quot; according to management. To assist those expansion efforts, Beyond has created branded Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) and WeChat accounts in order to engage with the Chinese consumer through the all-important digital media channel.Big picture: Beyond Meat is putting all the pieces in place today, for explosive Chinese market growth tomorrow. Big Upside for BYND StockMy numbers continue to suggest that BYND stock has big upside potential in the long run.Given that Beyond Meat is weathering the coronavirus storm with impressive resiliency and that plant-based meat demand trends remain robust, I haven't made any adjustments to my long-term revenue model for Beyond Meat. That model continues to assume $7.5 billion in sales for the company by 2030, based on a $1.5 trillion global meats market, a $150 billion plant-based meat market (10% penetration) and 5% market share for Beyond.I have, however, made upward adjustments to my margin estimates. I previously believed Beyond Meat to be a 35% gross margin player at scale. Those estimates now seem antiquated, with gross margins already above 35% on less than $100 million in sales. Increased scale and sustained demand will drive gross margins higher over time. I now estimate that gross margins will settle around 40% by 2030.Assuming so, my 2030 earnings-per-share estimate for Beyond Meat has been raised to $16.50, from $15 prior. Based on a consumer staples sector-average 20-times forward multiple, that implies a new long-term price target for BYND stock of $330. The Bottom Line on Beyond MeatBeyond Meat's earnings were good, and broadly underscore that this company is a long-term winner. In the stock market, the key with long-term winners is to own them when the price is right.Today, the price on BYND stock is right. If you discount back the 2030 $300 price target back by 10% per year, you arrive at a 2020 price target for BYND stock of $140. Thus, I say stick with the 2020 rally in BYND stock up to $140, implying another 20% or so upside from current levels.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-05-07,"Consumer stocks have been a mixed bag for investors in this bear market.On the one hand, consumer staples, which provide life's necessities, have held up far better than the broader market as Americans stock up for what could be weeks spent indoors. But consumer discretionary stocks - companies selling clothes, burgers and cars - have been every bit as bad as the S&P; 500, if not worse.But there are several consumer stocks to buy on both sides of the aisle now: staples that should continue to perform well as long as the outbreak keeps a grip on the country, as well as discretionary plays that have been knocked down into value status and have higher yields - and higher upside potential when the economy rebounds - as a result.Here are eight large-cap consumer stocks to buy for income and growth. These companies boast varied mixes of dividend and upside potential. Some of them are bounce-back plays, while others are steady Eddies that investors can hold to protect against additional market declines. However, all of them have seen their dividend yields become at least a little richer over the past few weeks.

2020-05-08,"Some think of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) as a recession play. That is, when money is tight and people need something to eat -- either for substance or for comfort -- the Golden Arches is there. However, McDonald's stock hasn't acted in that way.Source: Nixx Photography / Shutterstock.com While some stocks continue to surge to new all-time highs, McDonald's isn't one of them. The stock is still down more than 18% from its 2020 high.However, that doesn't make it one for investors to pass on. Instead, they should be looking at McDonald's stock as a buying opportunity. The question they need to ask themselves is, &quot;at what price?&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sizing Up McDonald's StockRestaurants, fast-casual diners and fast-food operators are forecast to struggle this year. That ranges from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), Wendy's (NYSE:WEN) and yes, McDonald's stock.Analysts forecast earnings to fall 27% this year to $5.69 per share. That's alongside a 14.4% decline in revenue. That's really not that bad, particularly when compared to some of its peers.  * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months However, 2021 is forecast to be a rebound year. Consensus expectations call for earnings growth of roughly 40%, along with revenue growth of 15.5%. Like anything, there are positives and negatives with these estimates -- and unknowns.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from GeekWire; Gravity Payments For starters, we don't know if the novel coronavirus is done wreaking havoc on the economy. If it continues, 2021 estimates will likely need to come down.It's good to see earnings estimates for 2021 surpass that of 2019 ($7.92 per share vs. $7.84 per share). While it's always possible that McDonald's doesn't achieve this figure next year, it's a step in the right direction; it's a positive. The negative is revenue growth.Unlike something like 5G -- where investment spend will happen regardless of whether it's delayed -- when burger sales dip because restaurants are closed, those sales are gone. No one is buying two Big Macs at their first Mickey D's stop in May because they were deprived in April.McDonald's stock trades at about 30 times this year's earnings estimate, which is a bit pricey. But it trades at just 22 times 2019 earnings and 2021 estimates once we return to some normalcy. That's really not a bad price to pay for a high-quality company that yields about 2.8% -- particularly when 10-year Treasury yields are at just 0.63%. Buy the Dip  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMcDonald's stock will still be standing when Covid-19 blows over, but that doesn't mean investors should pay any price for it. It's not a bad price now, but it doesn't have the momentum that other stocks do.For instance, one of our favorites in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) just hit new all-time highs. The same can be said for Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP). But McDonald's is under pressure.Shares couldn't reclaim the $185 to $190 area. So far, it's being rejected by this zone, leaving investors to wonder if it can eventually power through or if a larger pullback could be brewing.Check out the $165 area on the chart above. Technically, this has been a significant level over the past few years. Plus, the rising 200-week moving average comes into play near $161.In this area, McDonald's stock will sport a dividend yield north of 3% and trade closer to 20 times 2021 earnings estimates (and 20 times 2019 earnings). It will also give investors a better risk/reward setup with a lower cost basis.Remember, the stock has not only paid, but raised its dividend for more than four decades. That has been the case since it first started paying its dividend in 1976.McDonald's stock isn't one of the most exciting names out there, let's be honest. But it's a high quality, consistent company with a great global business. Management has done a great job pivoting the business back toward growth and investors should consider it an excellent long-term anchor in their portfolio.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-05-08,"Stocks rallied to finish the week, vaulting despite an April jobs report that felt ripped straight from the Great Depression.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 advanced 1.69%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.91%  * The Nasdaq Composite tacked on 1.58%  * Broadly speaking, cyclical names were in style as Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) was the leader of the blue-chip index Friday, shooting higher by about 4%.Unfortunately, the Depression comparison I used above isn't hyperbole. Data from the Labor Department indicate employers slashed a staggering 20.5 million jobs last month, bringing the U.S. jobless rate to 14.79%. While that's better than expected, it's still the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe April jobs report underscores two points, neither of which is good. First, essentially all of the jobs gains of the past decade are gone. Second, it could take years for those jobs to return.  * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months To put things delicately, those are concerning numbers, but somehow, someway, 29 of 30 Dow stocks were higher in late trading, with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) being the lone offender. Try Figuring This OutIt's not exactly a quadratic equation, but it's nonetheless vexing. Follow along for a minute. On a day when employment data was terrible, energy numbers confirmed a sector pullback on drilling activity and more news stories were published about some companies extending work from home through the end of year, oil closed higher.In fact, that's the second straight week in which crude posted a weekly gain. That was enough to place Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) among the top Dow stocks today, with Exxon actually ranking number two behind Dow Chemical. Shanghai Surprise?I've been talking about Disney (NYSE:DIS) quite a bit this week, but today it's good news. Disney stock advanced on a pair of theme park-related catalysts. Investors can decide which is more important, but it's undoubtedly good news that Disney Springs, an entertainment venue adjacent to Disney World in Orlando, is looking toward a May 20 phased reopening.In China, Shanghai Disneyland is reopening on May 11, with tickets selling out in a matter of minutes. Just speculating, but the Shanghai  reopening could serve as a template for getting Disneyland and Disney World open again, and which would likely provide a near-term boost for Disney stock. Sympathy PlayOn a day unusually conducive for embracing riskier names, Procter and Gamble (NYSE:PG) -- typically the opposite of risky -- was among the Dow's leaders. P&G's Friday move may be attributable to news that rivals Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Lysol maker Reckitt Benckiser will have difficulty catching up with unexpected demand for disinfecting wipes this year. More Reopening NewsApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) extended its recent bullishness, closing higher on news that the company will commence reopening retail stores in some states next week.That's meaningful because all Apple stores outside of China have been shuttered since mid-March. The iPhone maker has 271 U.S. stores; some  in Alabama, Idaho and South Carolina are slated to reopen next week.

Encouraging ForecastChevron (NYSE:CVX) was one of the Dow leaders today amid encouraging news about crude demand, the pivotal catalyst for this and other energy equities.Just a couple of months ago, this seemed like an impossibility, but today, some oil market observers believe it's possible that demand will outstrip supply later this year.

2020-05-21,"On May 18, President Trump met with several leaders and executives from the restaurant industry. By now, we're all familiar with how a wide range of businesses have suffered as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak and ensuing lockdown. And so, in the recent meeting with President Trump, restaurant executives have asked for more federal assistance. They highlighted that their sector is a depressed segment of the economy and businesses will need extra capital to stay afloat until customers come back.Amid the generally grim outlook for many specfiic sectors, the past two months have seen broader market indexes rallying. Now investors are wondering if the market has flown too close to the sun.In the short run, it isn't easy to predict what the market or any given stock mighty do. But if you are a long-term investor with a 2 to 3 year time horizon, then I believe the market offers plenty of opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar As part of our economy opens up, here are three restaurant stocks that may be able to bring healthy returns for shareholders:  * Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)On May 18, all three of these stocks saw strong bounces alongside the rest of the market. The next day, there was some profit-taking in all three names, potentially offering better entry points for long-term investors. I expect daily volatility to continue in the short run.All three companies have recently reported earnings that showed some rough fundamental metrics. And there may still be some choppy waters ahead.Moreover, these restaurant chains will have to follow different state or even national rules depending on the state or country where a restaurant is located. But they are all large and organized enough to be able to adapt to different operating procedures rather efficiently. Denny's (DENN)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The restaurant chain bills itself as ""America's Diner"" and many of its regular patrons would likely agree. As of late March, the group had a combined 1,695 franchised, licensed and company restaurants. 147 of those are outside of the continental U.S.On May 14, DENN released results for its first quarter ended March 25, 2020, and provided a business update on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 17 cents was better than analysts' estimates, and despite the 36% YoY quarterly fall in revenue, the restaurant managed to post profits of $9 million. CEO John Miller said:""As restaurant operations were being limited to off-premise sales channels, we implemented streamlined menus, 'Dine-Thru' curbside service programs, and shareable family meal packs in a matter of days… [w]e have fortified our balance sheet, made disciplined cost savings decisions, and worked aggressively on multiple fronts to secure various forms of financial relief for our franchisees.Denny's has also made amendments in 400 stores and begun selling grocery items. Finally, the company has been ""bolstering [its] sanitation protocols to transitioning to free contactless delivery and pick up services."" Following the results, the shares popped higher.Year-to-date (YTD), DENN stock is down over 50%. On March 19, it hit a multi-year low at $4.50. Now it is hovering around $9.5.Its current trailing P/E of 5.4 and P/S ratio of 1.3 makes the casual-dining restaurant a long-term play for me, especially if the price falls toward $9 or even below. McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com The group has more than 38,000 restaurants in over 100 countries, though its largest segment is the U.S. And on April 30, McDonald's reported first quarter 2020 results.CEO Chris Kempczinski commented that ""McDonald's has seen a lot over our 65 years and I'm confident that the actions we're taking will enable us to emerge from this crisis in a position of competitive strength. But in Q1, global comparable sales declined 3.4%. Similarly, consolidated revenues decreased 6% (5% in constant currencies).""Approximately 75% of McDonald's restaurants remain open globally. Nonetheless earlier in April, management had already withdrawn its 2020 outlook.Over 90% of McDonald's restaurants are currently franchised. This gives it a significant competitive edge, as the initial franchise fees and continuous royalties mean high margins. It also collects rent from franchisees, as the company in fact owns most of these properties. Then it leases them out to the franchisees, often at significant markups.  Put another way, the company is in the real estate business as much as food services.So far in 2020, MCD stock is down 9%. That decline is compared to a 4.8% drop in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLY), which includes MCD as its third-largest holding at 6.55% of the portfolio, behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at a whopping 23.9% and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) at 12.9% of the exchange-traded fund's assets.In Aug. 2019, MCD stock hit an all-time high of $221.93. The current price of about $179 means a trailing P/E ratio of 23.5 and P/S ratio of 6.6. On a fundamental basis, I'd be more comfortable with lower values in both metrics.The Golden Arches may not yet be able to go over $200 in the second half of 2020, but if you are a buy-and-hold investor, then you may consider investing in the shares, especially if there is a dip in price toward the $170 level or below.  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar If you're looking for passive income, the burger chain's current dividend yield stands at 2.9%. Sshares are expected to go ex-dividend on May 29. However for now, McDonald's has paused its share buyback program. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com On April 28, the coffee chain released Q2 Fiscal 2020 results that said its quarterly global same-store sales fell 10%. Americas and U.S. comparable store sales declined 3%.On the other hand in the quarter, China comparable store sales were down 50%. Regular InvestorPlace may remember that novel coronavirus-related concerns had started rather earlier in the year for Starbucks as the virus had begun affecting operations in China.For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share came at 32 cents. Revenue was $6 billion, a decline of 5% from the prior year due to lost sales related to the viral pandemic.Management also warned that third-quarter results would take a larger hit from the COVID-19 outbreak, even though sales in China were recovering. In early April, the group had already withdrawn guidance for fiscal 2020.Starbucks opened 255 net new stores in the quarter, which means a 6% YoY unit growth. At the end of the period, it had 32,050 stores globally, of which 51% and 49% were company-operated and licensed, respectively.YTD, SBUX stock is down about 13%. In July 2019, SBUX stock hit an all-time high of $99.72. But on March 18, 2020, the shares saw a 52-week low of $50.02. They are currently around $76.Its trailing P/E ratio is 26.9 and P/S ratio is 3.4. Like McDonald's, I'd ideally like to see lower values in both metrics. Long-term investors may consider buying dips on SBUX stock, especially if it goes toward $70 or lower.Tezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

2020-05-22,"It has been a difficult year for restaurant stocks to say the least. Thanks to the novel coronavirus, the sector has been absolutely walloped. Even with the market generally recovering strongly, most of the restaurant names remain down in the dumps. Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) stock, however, is one exception.Source: JStone / Shutterstock.com Shares fell from $75 to $38 during the crash, but are back up to $65 now. And with good reason: Dunkin' should get back to its old highs as investors realize it is one of the best-positioned restaurants in this new economic environment. Why would that be? First, let me tell you a story.Because my youngest son was born in New York and spent the first eight years of his life there, he ""grew up"" with Dunkin' Donuts. Soon, he became one of the restaurant chain's biggest fans. Almost every weekend, we'd drive to the local Dunkin' shop to pick up a dozen doughnuts, along with a box of doughnut holes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut then we moved to California and left the East Coast Dunkin' behind. My son never really got over it. Every time I traveled to the East Coast for business, he'd ask me to bring back a doughnut or two, if I could. And if I couldn't, he'd ask me to at least take a photo of a Dunkin' Donuts shop and send it to him.  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy With Fortress-Like Balance Sheets That's a powerful example of ""brand value,"" and that's one of the traits that will enable Dunkin' Brands to thrive in the post-Covid-19 world. And that tradition will continue well into the next generation and beyond. Plenty of Room for Brand GrowthWhile many East Coasters, like my son, are huge fans of Dunkin' Donuts, much of the country isn't so familiar with Dunkin' yet. The company launched its initial public offering in 2011 in part to raise funds and enhance its public stature as part of a big expansion push across the United States. That is well under way now, as the company has found new franchisees outside of its core East Coast market.There's also a large overseas opportunity for Dunkin' Donuts. International revenues account for just 17% of the company's total sales at this point. However, this could grow a ton. As of year-end 2019, Dunkin' Donuts had more than 13,000 locations. Nearly 10,000 of those are in the United States, and the other 3,500 are international. Three thousand five hundred is an impressive number and shows the potential for the company to become a coffee and fast-food leader around the world, following in the footsteps of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Dunkin' Is a Natural Social-Distancing WinnerThe Canton, Massachusetts-based company's other main winning trait is a business model that relies heavily on ""takeaway"" purchases and mobile deliveries.Takeout orders represented 90% of the company's business even before the quarantines started. Unlike Starbucks, few people go to Dunkin' to hang out and enjoy the ambiance. Dunkin' has never marketed itself as a public space to linger with friends or get work done. So it loses little from switching to all takeout and delivery for the time being.On top of that, Dunkin' is actively finding new clients through delivery services. The company has added delivery alliances with GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), UberEats (NYSE:UBER), DoorDash and Postmates. Put it all together, and the company has doubled its pre-coronavirus delivery capacity. The Verdict on DNKN StockDunkin' has a fantastic brand. And, unlike a McDonald's or Starbucks, it's not fully saturated yet. There are plenty of markets, both in the United States and overseas, for Dunkin' to tap in to.On top of that, Dunkin' has a unique advantage right now: Its brand is based around its products, but not its in-store experience. People like Dunkin's doughnuts and drinks (and the ice cream at Baskin-Robbins), not the look of its restaurants. Thus, Dunkin' can seamlessly switch to delivery and takeout only for some time, while many competitors lose much of their appeal without dine-in eating.So, I expect Dunkin' Brands to snap back quickly and thrive in the post-coronavirus world. Dunkin' was set to earn more than $3 per share before the virus hit. And the company has historically grown earnings at more than 10% a year thanks to its new-store growth and large share buyback.For a fast-growing franchisee restaurant chain, the market normally would pay at least 25x earnings, which would support a stock price up toward $80. As investors figure out that sales should be steady, and perhaps even increase as the new delivery options kick in, expect shares to continue moving higher.Eric Fry is an award-winning stock picker with numerous ""10-bagger"" calls -- in good markets AND bad.

The lawsuit isn’t seeking money, but wants to force McDonalds to supply adequate safety gear, such as face masks, as workers return to work.  The employees claim that McDonald’s created unsafe workplace, posing a threat to community health.  Workplace safety is typically under the jurisdiction of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration – or OSHA.  But by focusing the lawsuit on the threat to the public, the employees are hoping to take their case outside of OSHA and into the courts.  This comes as McDonald’s workers around the country have protested, demanding they be given safety gear at work.  In Chicago, workers filed at least four complaints with OSHA, but - according to the lawsuit - the agency declined to inspect work sites. OSHA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",COVID-19 lawsuit takes on McDonald's like it was a rowdy bar

2020-05-30,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed fury at Twitter Inc. this week for fact-checking him and putting a warning label on a message that seemed to invoke violence. But that anger has been channeled through his favorite medium -- Twitter itself -- which is likely to be good for the company’s business, despite Trump’s harangue.“Look at how much he uses Twitter,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at Lightshed Partners. “Advertisers want to be where eyeballs are, and people are turning to Twitter for this news.”For years the San Francisco-based company has been under pressure to enforce its content rules against Trump. This week, for the first time, the social network took action in two separate instances. First, it appended a fact-check label to two Trump posts that said mail-in voting would lead to fraud. Then, on Friday, Twitter added a warning filter to other tweets for violating its rules against promoting violence. The actions prompted retaliation from Trump, including more angry tweets and an executive order calling for social media regulations to change.Attention is Twitter’s most valuable asset. Though the company may be facing serious questions about its approach to troublesome content, its revenue comes from the ads it can slot between users’ posts -- the more posts, the more slots Twitter can make money from. During busier news cycles, such as elections and sports events, and even the coronavirus pandemic, new users tend to sign up and spend more time on their feeds. Trump has made Twitter more essential, since much of what the president says shows up on Twitter first.Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey’s job was threatened earlier this year -- not by Trump, but by Elliott Management, an activist investor that called for changes including boosting usage of the product, which is a fraction of Facebook’s size. The company in March reached an agreement with Elliott that set ambitious targets for daily active users, accelerated revenue growth and greater market share in digital advertising. Those goals seemed even tougher in late March, when Twitter slashed its quarterly sales forecast and warned of a loss because marketers were spending less during the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.The summer Olympics and professional sports leagues may not be giving users a reason to tune in to Twitter right now, but Trump’s tussle with the company is its own kind of must-watch contest.“My guess is that the controversy spurs engagement, or at least doesn’t reduce engagement,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.What’s more, advertisers may appreciate Twitter taking a stronger position on misinformation and harmful content, even if the violator is the president. Advertisers don’t want their content to run alongside anything that could hurt the perception of their products -- a value known as “brand safety.”“Advertisers care about brand safety and truth, and from what I’ve seen, most brands support the actions that Twitter is taking,” said Pete Stein, CEO of Huge, an agency that represents brands including McDonald’s Corp. and Vanguard.That’s also set up a clearer contrast between the company and its social-media peers, most of which have been under fire for lax enforcement against offensive or inappropriate content. Twitter is the first to take action on Trump’s posts. On Facebook Inc.’s main app and Instagram, where Trump made the same posts, the messages remain online with no additional context from the company. Facebook has similar content policies, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided his company should be especially hesitant to weigh in or take action on posts from political leaders.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Donald Trump Is Angry at Twitter, on Twitter.

2020-06-04,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate cleared changes to the popular Paycheck Protection Program on Wednesday that will allow small businesses more flexibility in using the rescue loan funds. The bill, which passed the House last week on a 471-1 vote, now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.Senators gave unanimous consent for the legislation hours after Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, had raised objections.The coronavirus program provides forgivable loans to help small businesses make their payrolls during the Covid-19 crisis. The bill would extend an eight-week period -- when proceeds must be spent for loans to be forgiven -- to 24 weeks or until the end of the year, whichever comes first.Businesses would also have as long as five years, instead of two, to repay any money owed on a loan, and they could use a greater percentage of proceeds on rent and other approved non-payroll expenses.Timing is urgent because the eight-week spending period began expiring last Friday for the first loan recipients after the Small Business Administration program opened April 3. Businesses -- especially in the restaurant and hospitality industry, which are only recently getting the green light to reopen -- say they need more time to distribute pay.Utah Senator Mike Lee had also objected to language that he and Johnson said would lengthen the application deadline. Maine Senator Susan Collins didn’t oppose the bill but said she was concerned about the way the House drafted a provision reducing the current requirement that 75% of a loan be used on payroll.Lee’s office said that the senator agreed to passage of the bill after securing a letter signed by the chairmen and ranking members of the Small Business Committee clarifying that the application deadline remains June 30.Besides extending the loan-forgiveness period, small businesses have said they want flexibility to spend more on overhead expenses, especially in high-rent areas. The bill, H.R. 7010, would instead require that 60% of a loan be used on payroll.The House bill creates a “cliff,” Collins said in a statement. The current PPP program allows partial loan forgiveness if a company uses less than 75% of a loan for payroll, but the House bill appears to state that none of the loan would be forgiven if the 60% threshold isn’t met.“Instead, the employer is saddled with a debt for the entire amount, and no portion of the loan is forgiven or converted to a grant,” Collins said.Senate Small Business Chairman Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, last week sought guidance from the Treasury Department on whether that issue can be addressed through regulation.The Treasury and the SBA haven’t responded to requests for comment.Funds RemainingAs of Wednesday night, SBA reported that 4.5 million firms had received approvals for loans totaling $510.6 billion. About $130 billion remains from the second round of $320 billion that Congress approved for PPP. The initial round of $349 billion was tapped in just 13 days.Small business advocates hailed passage of the bill as providing needed flexibility to firms still struggling to emerge from Covid-related closings, even as lenders and other groups are still seeking other program changes they hope Congress can make in the coming weeks.Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association representing thousands of owners and chains including McDonald’s Corp., said in a statement the passage is “a win for restaurants and small businesses across the country.”The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said a new survey it released Wednesday with MetLife showed that while eight of 10 small businesses are in the process of re-opening, 55% think it will take more than six months to be fully operational – up from 50% in an April poll and 46% in March.“Congress deserves credit for removing barriers that could slow recovery further,” the chamber said in a statement. “We urge the president to sign the legislation quickly and for SBA and Treasury to immediately provide guidance to small businesses on how they qualify for loan forgiveness under the new law.”A National Federation of Independent Business survey of its members last week showed that a majority have their loan-forgiveness period ending in the next couple of weeks. The group said in a statement it is pleased the Senate passed “much-needed flexibility for small business owners” and “we look forward to continuing to work with members in the chamber on improving” the program.Lenders are seeking to simplify the process of applying to have loans forgiven by allowing borrowers with loans of a certain amount to simply certify they followed the rules, rather than having to make complicated calculations with rules that keep changing.“Much more needs to be done on this bill,” said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America. “This is largely a Senate punt on fixing the issues with the PPP program.”There was broad support during a Senate Small Business Committee hearing Wednesday for extending the eight-week loan forgiveness period and changing the rule that 75% of proceeds must be spent on payroll.Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa highlighted a sportswear business in her state that kept 27 workers employed with a PPP loan despite a 96% decline in revenue. But with ballparks and other venues where the apparel is sold still closed -- and the firm’s eight-week period expiring this week – the workers will be furloughed, she said.Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, called the 75% payroll rule -- set by SBA and Treasury -- “a mistake” because it limits the program’s ability to help companies such as those in high-rent cities that need to spend more money on expenses.“A business that cannot pay its rent also cannot continue paying its workers,” Strain told the committee.(Updates with reaction from sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Senate Passes Changes to Small Business PPP Loan Program

2020-06-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For Uber Technologies Inc., the logic of gobbling up food-delivery rival Grubhub Inc. seemed pretty straightforward: reduce the number of competitors, making it easier to charge higher prices to diners and earn more commission from restaurants. The rationale isn’t so clear cut for Dutch deliverer Just Eat Takeaway.com NV, which leapfrogged Uber to announce on Wednesday that it was acquiring Grubhub in a $7.3 billion all-share deal.Unlike Uber, Just Eat Takeaway isn’t present in the U.S., where the main rivals are Grubhub, Uber Eats and DoorDash Inc., with the startup Postmates Inc. a distant fourth. That highly competitive landscape won’t change with an overseas purchase of Grubhub, which may explain why investors initially found the idea of such a deal unpalatable. Just Eat Takeaway shares fell as much 19% after news of the potential tie-up was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. That’s equivalent to some 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of value.But the lack of value creation discerned by the buyer’s shareholders is also the same reason that regulators may look upon a deal more favorably than they would an Uber-Grubhub combination. What is bad for investors is good for customers, who will benefit from any price war. This is doubly bad news for Uber: If an existing American rival were the acquirer, at least it would reduce the number of competitors.The deal is a gamble on the operational nous of Jitse Groen, chief executive officer of the acquirer. He has an impressive track record, expanding a Netherlands-focused operation with revenue of 23 million euros in 2013 into a pan-European giant with sales topping 1.2 billion euros last year.But he has also only just wrapped up the 6 billion-pound ($7.7 billion) acquisition of Britain’s Just Eat Plc. Like the Grubhub deal, it was an all-share transaction sold to investors on the basis of Groen’s operational acumen. By giving Just Eat shareholders a stake in the new venture, ran the argument, they’d benefit from the value that he and his team would generate once they got their teeth into the U.K. company.That will be a harder case to make to U.S. investors, where fierce price wars have made market consolidation look like the only way for food delivery providers to improve profit. Uber Eats has lost $2.2 billion on an adjusted Ebitda basis, a measure of profit, in the past two years. Grubhub has seen its Ebitda margin fall from a 2014 peak of 28% of revenue to 0.2% in the three months through March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That declining profitability is largely because of Grubhub’s changing business model. Historically, it operated purely as a marketplace — connecting diners with restaurants, which delivered the food. That differed from the approach favored by Uber Eats, DoorDash and Postmates, who operated their own fleets of deliverers. The marketplace approach, with its lower costs, was much more profitable, but it made it harder to attract chains such as McDonald’s Corp., who were wary about taking on the significant expense of operating a delivery network. So Grubhub is adding its own deliverers — perhaps 30% of revenue now comes from its own delivery network. This will probably increase to 45% by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh.Groen is an unashamed proponent of the marketplace model. Don’t be surprised if he pedals back Grubhub’s delivery ambitions. But he faces a daunting task of integrating two acquisitions, where both targets are larger than the original Takeaway.com, in two of the most competitive food delivery markets in the world. He might be about to bite off more than he can chew.(This column was updated to show that Just Eat Takeaway’s deal for Grubhub was announced.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-06-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Boris Johnson was elected as Britain’s prime minister because he’s a ruthless optimist, yet he has presided over one of the gloomiest periods in the country’s postwar history. If he wants to cheer people up again, he needs a credible plan for reopening the U.K.’s schools. Release from lockdown is painfully slow here, and the economic recovery is stuttering because many parents can’t work when their kids are at home. Johnson has already abandoned his ambition to get most primary pupils in England back in the classroom for the summer — the latest evidence of a shambolic Covid-19 strategy. If he fails to reopen schools by September, when the new term begins, the political damage will be incalculable. The reopening has to happen not just for the economy’s sake, but for the sake of a generation of children too.Last week the prime minister’s old employer (and regular cheerleader), the ultra-Conservative Daily Telegraph, published an article by the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, demanding “a national plan to restart classes.” ConservativeHome, the website for the Tory grassroots, is tearing more hair out over this subject than even Johnson’s blond mop could replenish.McDonald’s is serving customers, shops are busy, and zoos, theme parks and even pub gardens will soon be open to children. But not schools. Let them eat and ride, but not learn in the classroom.Johnson is a proven vote winner and he retains a comfortable, if narrowing, lead over Starmer in the polls. But his allies miss his can-do spirit and the intelligent opportunism that often turns a crisis into an opportunity. They fear he’s not getting the big political calls right. Possibly, it’s the lagging effects of his debilitating bout of Covid-19. Whatever the stresses, a focus on the major decisions is essential.Supporters in Parliament are trying to goad the prime minister into action. Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and Brexit ally, and John Redwood, a Sahara-dry economist, are begging him to relax the two-meter social distancing rule that prevents many classrooms from reopening and many factories from operating. “The number one and single most important priority to unlock the economy is getting the distance down to one meter,” says Duncan Smith.But scientists in SAGE, the body that advises the government, say two-meter distancing must stay because the rate of virus transmission is still too high and the dangers of a second outbreak are too great. Ironically, Johnson and his fellow Brexiters scorned expert opinion during the referendum. Now he’s open to the charge of being too deferential to it.At the beginning of the crisis, the prime minister sheltered behind scientific opinion when he wanted to defend his delay in locking down Britain. Now he’s finding out that there’s no consensus around “the science” — it’s not a monolithic entity and its practitioners are fallible because they work with limited, flawed data. Most will therefore err on the side of caution. Many prominent British scientists are challenging the views of SAGE at every turn.Given the dire prognosis for the U.K. economy, and the 20% drop in gross domestic product in April, Johnson’s cabinet colleagues are more minded now to listen to economic experts. Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer, said at the weekend that the government was launching a “comprehensive review” of the two-meter rule because of the enormous impact on the economy. It was at Sunak’s prompting that Johnson agreed four weeks ago to reopen primary schools this summer, before abruptly dropping the target this week. Secondary schools have remained closed throughout, other than to the children of key workers and vulnerable groups.The danger is that delay creates more delay. The main teachers’ body, the National Education Union, has been hostile to an early return to work. Twenty local authorities have forbidden schools to reopen, and many parents are too scared to send children back because no one at the top is speaking with clarity and confidence about the minimal risk of doing so. If the government fails to sort out the mess by September, the odds will increase on a generation of children losing a year’s worth of education.Social divisions are widened by the lockdown, and education is the prime indicator. Private fee-paying schools zealously provide Zoom lessons for their pupils, sometimes four or five times a day; middle class parents give their children personal computers for online classes. Many other people don’t have that luxury. In deprived areas, teachers suspect that most of their pupils are doing far less than two hours work a day. As many as one in five teenagers are receiving no school work at all. Johnson came to power pledging to “level up” the life chances of poor children. More of this education lockdown will give them a mountain to climb.If you don’t like the advice from your lawyer, the saying goes, hire another one. Unfortunately for Johnson, having invested so much political capital in listening to the scientists, he doesn’t have that recourse. But he must balance their advice against the warnings of economists and sociologists and learn from the best practices abroad. The World Health Organization endorses social distancing of one meter. Denmark, the Netherlands, France and even Belgium — which has a higher per capita death rate from the virus than the U.K. — opened schools weeks ago.Johnson set out three priorities at the start of the crisis: the National Health Service, the economy and education. The NHS is essential to saving lives, so it was easy to create a political consensus around the slogan “Save Our NHS.” There has been no popular campaign to Save Our Schools. The prime minister urgently needs one.Yes, it’s a risk to open up classrooms. But the bulk of scientific evidence points to very low fatality rates among children from Covid-19. The mortal danger to primary school kids is lower than death by lightning strike. Stay one meter away at school and two meters away from grandparents is nuanced advice we could grasp easily.The English school system won’t reopen if left to its own devices. Endless arguments will grind on over health and safety. But sending children back is the correct thing to do. While it involves jeopardy for Johnson, it’s also a decision that his party will applaud.(This column was updated with details about a review of the two-meter distancing rules.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Martin Ivens was editor of the Sunday Times from 2013 to 2020 and was formerly its chief political commentator.

2020-06-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There was great anticipation about what shopping would be like when non-essential stores finally reopened their doors in England on Monday. It quickly became clear that we won’t get back to pre-pandemic retail therapy until all the fixtures of the high street are up and running again, from nail bars to cafes and restaurants.A steady stream of consumers filled the main thoroughfare in Canterbury, an affluent town in Kent. That reflected the broader trend of a 42% increase from a week earlier in visits to all retail destinations in England by noon on Monday, according to data provider Springboard.At the Fenwicks department store, one couple said they had come out for “a bit of normal.” But normality was in short supply. For a start, not all of the stores were open. Next Plc wasn’t due to open its doors to shoppers until today. Others, such as the large Debenhams department store, are now permanently closed. But the most notable omission was the atmosphere that’s come to characterize British malls and main streets, provided by bustling coffee shops, food outlets and the like. Over the past five to 10 years, the functional aspect of shopping has migrated to the click of a mouse or tap of a smartphone. Going out to the mall or strolling the high street has become a leisure pursuit, especially as cafes and restaurant chains expanded to fill empty retail space.With the U.K.’s gradual approach to easing lockdown, on-site dining is still prohibited. While some fast-food outlets, such as Five Guys, McDonald’s and Nando’s were open for takeaway, eating on the go is hardly conducive to a leisurely lunch out followed by window shopping and browsing the day away.It’s too early to say whether that experience will return. After over-expanding five years ago, casual-dining joints hit a hard patch. When Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, consumers turned more cautious, sparking a wave of closures at the likes of Prezzo, Jamie’s Italian and Byron Hamburgers. It’s not clear how many restaurants will be able to survive a three-month shutdown followed by strict  social-distancing measures. Sticking to the two-meter rule could see many operating at 30-50% of their usual capacity, squeezing profits.Other footfall drivers at shopping destinations include beauty outlets with trends such as false-eyelash bars growing in popularity alongside nail and hair salons. In Canterbury yesterday, these all remained closed. There were no bustling beauty counters with consultants spraying perfume or dispensing samples in the local Fenwicks and Boots. While digital tools could make up for some of what’s missing, there’s no substitute for actually putting a lipstick on your own skin to tell if you like the shade. If there’s little reason for visiting a physical beauty store, more sales will migrate online, making life even harder for the department stores.All in all, with discounts of as much as 50% on handbags and 70% on fashion picks, walking through some stores felt like a ghostly Black Friday.It could just be a question of time. As the U.S. reopened, shopping also felt lifeless at first until leisure outlets reopened bringing out more people with them.  In England, in the meantime, retailers will have to rely on the strength of their product offerings. Although queues at Primark were modest in Canterbury, many people were carrying bulging bags from the discount fashion retailer, which doesn’t offer online shopping. And more expensive fashion chains may have to rely more on the social aspects of shopping.Just how hard they may have to work became apparent on my return to Whitstable in the late afternoon. The only queue was outside the fish-and-chip shop even though many of the vibrant independent shops had reopened their doors.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In August 2018, according to the seasonally adjusted reckonings of the Census Bureau, sales at the nation’s restaurants, bars and other food-and-drink establishments outpaced sales at food and beverage stores for the very first time. This happened eight more times in 2019. In January and February of this year, it looked as if dining and drinking out had surpassed buying food and drink to eat at home once and for all.Then came the coronavirus, temporary and permanent restaurant closures and a lot of supermarket, superstore and online binge-buying. Since March, Americans have spent twice as much money at food and beverage stores as at food service and drinking places, and that underrepresents the disparity because lots of food and drink purchases made at Costco, Walmart and online are reported under other categories.The gap did begin to close in May, as is apparent in the above chart, but I imagine it will be a while before spending on dining out again surpasses spending on dining in. I also imagine though, that the former will eventually surpass the latter again, and that the gap will then grow and grow in the decades to come. One of the main sources of my belief is this chart:Clearly, dining out supplanting eating at home is a trend that has been in place for a really long time. This time the food and drink purchased for off-premises consumption does include all those online and Costco purchases. The dining-out spending includes accommodations, which was about 16% of the total as of 2018 — I use the combined number in the chart because the food-and-drink-only data isn’t available yet for 2019. A U.S. Department of Agriculture series that includes spending by governments and businesses as well as households shows spending on food and alcohol away from home to have surpassed spending on food and alcohol consumed at home in 2013, and been about 2% higher in 2019.Something big seems to have shifted about how we get our food and where we eat it. Part of the change is, to be sure, about prices: Food consumed at home has gotten cheaper, relatively speaking, than food consumed away from home.Still, Americans have in fact been buying more food from restaurants, not just paying more for it. The food-away-from-home share of total average daily energy intake rose from 17% in 1977-78 to 34% in 2011-12, according to USDA surveys. Fast-food restaurants were responsible for most of this rise, indicating that convenience is a big driver in the shift toward food away from home. But in recent years there’s also been a boom in high-end dining as affluent consumers look to buy experiences rather than things.Fast-food sales are already bouncing back from the coronavirus, with McDonald’s announcing this week that U.S. same-store sales were down just 5.1% in May compared with May 2019, after a 19% decline in April. Full-service restaurants, on the other hand, will continue to struggle until either we defeat the virus or it defeats us (in the sense that efforts to control it are abandoned, not that it kills us all). At the high end, this was a risky, low-margin business even in the best of times. Many restaurants have already closed permanently in the wake of virus-induced shutdowns, and restocking their ranks could take years. Much about the business may need to be reimagined and reinvented in the process.Demand for what restaurants offer, though, is surely not going away. Yes, if working from home becomes more prevalent, as seems likely post-pandemic, the lunch business could take a permanent hit. And if working from home encourages lots more people to work from places less expensive than New York and San Francisco, that could cut demand for restaurant dining in such cities. But those who work remotely have a tendency to settle not in the middle of nowhere but in smaller cities with attractive physical surroundings and lots of restaurants and bars and brewpubs. Bloomberg Businessweek deputy editor Howard Chua-Eoan has a lovely reminiscence in this week’s edition about what he misses about restaurants and how he has coped in their absence. It’s clear that he will be back at these “sanctuaries of joy,” as he calls them, as soon as he is allowed. Millions of other people will be too.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-06-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As many states ease the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19, shoppers are beginning to trickle back to malls, restaurants and hair salons. But even as they venture away from their living rooms for those activities, many who hold office jobs are still working from home. This abrupt, widespread adoption of telecommuting has roiled the restaurant industry, and could continue to do so if large swaths of workers end up settling into this model on a more routine basis — particularly when it comes to certain niches. Breakfast is a prime example. U.S. restaurant traffic in the morning hours suffered from a steeper initial drop during March and early April than was seen at lunch or dinner. Even now, breakfast is recovering more slowly than those other mealtimes. This almost certainly reflects the fact that commutes have disappeared for legions of workers. After all, it doesn’t make sense to take your regular spin through the McDonald’s drive-thru lane when you’re not already in the car en route to your cubicle.  And a ritual pop-in to the Starbucks near your subway stop is no longer convenient. The dent in this business is an unfortunate development for the restaurant industry. The morning hours had been a relative bright spot for years, making up for declines or tepid growth later in the day. Breakfast also tends to be an especially profitable category for fast-food restaurants because the ingredients are relatively cheap. We’ve gotten some early hints as to how this dynamic is affecting major restaurant chains. Executives at Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. said on the company’s latest earnings call that they had seen a drop in business in the crucial 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. time frame, even as things had picked up between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Jack In The Box Inc. said in May it wasn’t putting much advertising behind breakfast menu items because with fewer commuters on the road, it doesn’t make sense to do so. McDonald’s Corp. has said breakfast “will be the most challenged” eating occasion to recover as states start to reopen, and Starbucks Corp. said last week that it expects the pandemic to deal a blow of up $3.2 billion to its sales in the current quarter, a financial wound that reflects a number of Covid-19-related challenges, including the shortage of worker bees stopping by their cafes as if on autopilot. Meanwhile, Wendy’s Co. has said its launch of a breakfast menu in early March “performed extremely well out of the gate,” but the disruption of diners’ morning routines certainly won’t make it easy for the chain to keep up momentum. It’s a tough break for a company that had been counting on early birds as a cornerstone of its growth strategy.  While independent and chain restaurants alike are looking to delivery to make up for some of the business they’ve lost in their dining rooms and carry-out windows, I wouldn’t count on that model to be much of a savior at breakfast time. Breakfast orders tend to have low average checks, so consumers might balk at paying delivery fees and tipping a driver for such a small purchase. It’s unlikely that working from home will be quite as ubiquitous a year or two from now as it has been in these early months of the pandemic. But a portion of the nation’s workforce is discovering they can do their desk-jockey jobs just fine without sitting in traffic or enduring a shoulder-to-shoulder train ride each morning. If given the choice by their employers, as a number of companies are doing, they won’t go back to that daily slog. This change will necessarily guide how restaurants think about everything from where they locate their outposts to how they allocate labor throughout the day. It also should hasten existing efforts from Dunkin’ and Starbucks to offer menu items and promotions to make them more of an all-day dining destination. Of course, the embrace of working from home is nowhere near the largest challenge restaurants face due to the Covid-19 crisis. A deep recession has the potential to decimate demand, causing diners to make fewer trips to restaurants overall and to rely on discounts and promotions when they do. Pandemic-related changes loom as even more existential risks. Social-distancing rules and norms will keep dining rooms operating at far lower capacities than they were designed for, threatening the so-called four-wall economics of a restaurant. Health concerns may keep some diners from feeling safe enough to hit up these eateries in the first place. Still, the smaller but significant work-from-home effect on dining is a clear illustration of the breadth and complexity of problems the entire restaurant industry is confronting, and the extent to which every corner of the economy is encountering weird domino effects that threaten businesses — from dollars to doughnuts.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-07-02,"Seven months ago, Sysco (NYSE:SYY) was a solid investment. SYY stock had posted a decade of sustained growth, and last December closed at $85.80, an all-time record high. The company was also a dividends champ. Then, the novel coronavirus pandemic derailed Sysco, as it did most stocks. However, the stock has been slower to recover than many. Currently trading around the $54 level, it's still down 37% from its December 2019 levels.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com So does that makes Sysco's stock a buy? I think it's pretty risky, and I'll explain why in a moment. SYY stock currently has a C-Rating in my Portfolio Grader, although it does maintain its A-Rating in my Dividend Grader. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Pandemic Decimated the Restaurant SectorSysco's business is focused on the food service industry. The company sells and distributes food and food preparation equipment to restaurants, as well as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, military bases and hotels. If you happen to be up at the crack of dawn and walking through an urban center, you'll see the Sysco trucks rumbling from restaurant to restaurant.At least you did prior to the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic.With the coronavirus lockdown, restaurants were forced to shut their dining rooms. Those that could pivoted to takeout, but that volume couldn't match their normal level of business. That meant orders for food and equipment from Sysco took a hit.In its third-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings report (released on May 5) Sysco showed the damage to its business. Sales of $13.7 billion for the quarter were down 6.5% year-over-year. Analysts had been looking for earnings per share of 84 cents, but instead the company reported EPS of 45 cents. Not just a miss, but down significantly from the 79 cents per share posted a year ago.  * 7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring Dividends How bad has the pandemic been? Sysco included this introduction in its earnings press release: &quot;Over the last 50 years, Sysco has weathered its share of exogenous shocks and economic crises, and each time Sysco has remained a resolute foodservice industry leader. The extent of the COVID-19 crisis is more substantial than any other throughout the company's history.&quot;So it was good news for Sysco that states have begun reopening restaurants. Or is it? Restaurants are Re-ClosingThe reopening of restaurants across the U.S. has not gone well. Covid-19 cases are on the rise, there are battles over wearing masks, and many restaurants that had reopened in recent weeks are now closing again.Patio dining is a lifeline to some -- offering an opportunity for social distancing and fresh air -- but that only works during good weather. And what happens in the winter? A Coronavirus Vaccine Is KeyThere are many industries that are desperately waiting for the arrival of a coronavirus vaccine. Airlines, hotels and cruise lines are in big trouble until people can safely travel once again. The biotech industry is all hands on deck, racing to develop a vaccine.The restaurant industry is also hurting and in a position where business won't return to any semblance of normalcy until a vaccine is available. While fast food chains are faring better thanks to their focus on takeout, the industry has been devastated. As of the end of March, an estimated 30,000 U.S. restaurants had closed permanently. That number is projected to soon pass 110,000, according to the National Restaurant Association. The coronavirus pandemic has hammered restaurant stocks, even the fast food giants that are less impacted by the closure of dining rooms. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is still down 7.3% for 2020. Pizza Hut and Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) is down nearly 14%. Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE), which was built around casual in-restaurant dining, has seen its shares lose over 43% of their value so far this year.SYY stock has reflected the doom and gloom surrounding its key customer base, shedding 34% of its value since the start of the year. Bottom Line on SYY StockSysco is a gamble at this point. On the plus side, you have a company that dominates its industry. It has seen its shares steadily gain in value over the past decade, and it's a solid performer on the dividend front.Even during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, it still had customers like hospitals and military bases that require restocking. Its fast-food customers have been more resilient than others. And Sysco has operations in other countries that are in more advanced stages of pandemic recovery.However, there is a real risk that the U.S. restaurant industry -- Sysco's core business -- is going to be hit even worse than it has been. The U.S. is setting daily coronavirus infection records, and some restaurants that had reopened have been closing down again. Many of these may never reopen again, even if a vaccine is found. That gloomy prognosis makes me wary of SYY stock at this point. It may yet recover, but I think even in a best case scenario the path back to its 2019 levels is going to be a long one.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-07-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s almost always an advantage to have a seat at the table.In March, as Congress wrestled with the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic and debated the contours of what would soon become the largest economic bailout in U.S. history, four legislators pushed hard to make sure that franchise operators received special treatment.They wrote a letter to the two senators steering the legislation toward the finish line, Mitch McConnell and Charles Schumer, asking them to increase the amount of taxpayer funding franchises could receive. While the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act didn’t ultimately provide extra money for franchises, it arguably provided something far more valuable: It mandated that franchises — regardless of how many stores or restaurants they operated or how many people they employed in those outlets — would be eligible for federal small business aid.Given that Paycheck Protection Program funds were initially supposed to go only to companies with 500 or fewer employees, this was a significant concession. It meant that large national operators, some of which employed thousands of people, could snare PPP funding by applying store by store. You know what happened after that. Big operators such as Shake Shack Inc. and Ruth’s Hospitality Group Inc. received big loans; authentically small businesses were left out; and a healthy round of public criticism of the PPP program ensued. (Shake Shack and Ruth’s Hospitality decided to return their loans.)One of the four legislators who pushed for special bailout treatment for franchises in March was Representative Kevin Hern, a Republican from Oklahoma. Hern campaigned for his House seat in 2018 as a can-do businessman who has successfully operated a chain of McDonald’s franchises in his home state. I wrote a column in April asking whether Hern had positioned his own businesses for a rescue on the taxpayers’ dime.Hern and his office declined to comment when I asked in April whether his franchises would apply for federal aid — and whether doing so would be a financial conflict of interest. They also declined to comment on any discussions Hern may have had about the CARES Act with McDonald’s Corp., the fast-food giant that doles out franchises to entrepreneurs like Hern. On Monday, the Small Business Administration finally answered one of those questions. It released the names of some of the biggest recipients of PPP funds and, as it turns out, a Tulsa enterprise controlled by Hern, KTAK Corporation I, received $1 million to $2 million.KTAK operates fast-food franchises the Hern family owns. I contacted Hern’s office again on Monday and asked for information about any role he played in getting PPP funding for KTAK. I also asked whether his family’s McDonald's franchises received PPP funding directly and, if so, how much they received. I also asked Hern’s office to disclose any other businesses in which he has a financial or management interest that received PPP funding. Hern and his representatives didn’t respond to any of those questions.In a press release, Hern’s chief of staff, Cameron Foster, said that his boss “has been open and transparent with members of the community about his family business’ need of a Paycheck Protection Program Loan during the Covid-19 crisis.” Foster also said that Hern was “happy to share that the family business was able to keep all employees either at their current level of employment or move part-time employees to full time.”If all of Hern’s employees did, in fact, stay on his companies’ payrolls, that’s a good thing. But securing PPP funding also presumably meant that Hern and his family could keep their businesses operating — a direct financial benefit for the congressman himself. And Hern got that funding ahead of somebody else, possibly much smaller businesses that lacked his resources and connections.Concerns that insiders would benefit from the PPP program have shadowed the bailout from the moment it was enacted in March. Schumer personally promised that no bailout money would go to businesses controlled by President Donald Trump or his family members. Language was added to the CARES Act to try to ensure that didn’t happen. But Congress then exempted PPP — one of the most heavily funded bailout programs — from those provisions.So far, it doesn’t appear as if the Trumps have received public funds directly. But the Washington Post reported on Monday that dozens of businesses that operate in Trump-owned or Trump-controlled buildings obtained PPP funds. Bloomberg News reported that a business partner of the Trumps in Hawaii received a PPP loan. Corporate entities tied to the family of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also pulled in some PPP funds.The law firm founded by one of Trump’s longstanding personal attorneys, Marc Kasowitz, received PPP funds of $5 million to $10 million. Companies linked to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also received PPP loans, as did a company linked to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Bloomberg News reported. Two Democrats, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Susie Lee, as well as two Republicans, Vicky Hartzler and Roger Williams, are also linked to businesses that have snared PPP funds.The SBA and the Treasury Department have been the primary administrators of the PPP program, and they’ve been unusually lax about properly overseeing and administering the hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money that they’ve handed over to small businesses thus far. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin resisted disclosing the identities of PPP borrowers for months until public hearings forced his hand. The SBA even waived conflict-of-interest and ethics guidelines that have traditionally prevented legislators from gaining access to the agency’s loans.So when public officials like Hern are the beneficiaries of taxpayer-funded programs like PPP, it winds up not being illegal or unethical simply because the federal government says it isn’t.Hern once owned as many as 18 McDonald’s franchises in the Tulsa area that employed more than 1,000 people, though that has shrunk to just five franchises more recently. He continues to own his McDonald’s franchises while serving in Congress because federal ethics and conflicts-of-interest guidelines allow him to. While the guidelines limit how much outside income legislators can earn while serving in Congress, they permit exceptions for performing some kinds of outside work — including practicing medicine or advising a family-owned business.Financial disclosures that Hern filed in 2018 said his restaurants contributed $25 million to $50 million of value to an overall portfolio of personal holdings worth between $38.7 million and $92.9 million at the time. An Oklahoma nonprofit news organization, The Frontier, nicknamed Hern “the McCongressman.”Hern seemed committed to altering that perception when he ran for Congress in 2018. “Kevin will use his experience and knowledge to focus on leading Congress by example, and put an end to the typical behaviors of career politicians,” his campaign pledged at the time.Maybe all that PPP money changed his mind.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

In recent weeks, though, it’s risen to even higher numbers than in previous years, a worrying sign for the coronavirus situation, said Professor Elisabeth Puchhammer-Stoeckl of the Medical University of Vienna.Starting today, face masks are mandatory again in Austrian supermarkets, banks and postal offices.

The dogs need only a week’s training and could be deployed to detect infections at places such as airports, border crossings and sporting events, according to the Stiftung Tieraerztliche Hochschule Hannover.Eight dogs from Germany’s armed forces took part in the study and had a success rate of 94%, the foundation said.Johnson Warns of ‘Tough Times’ (6:10 a.m. NY)Boris Johnson warned the U.K. will still be dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in mid-2021 and said his government is preparing for a second wave of infections over the winter months.“We will have tough times ahead in keeping this virus under control, and we have tough times ahead in coming through economically,” the prime minister said Friday in a Sky News interview. “I think that by the middle of next year that we will be well on our way past it.”Ministers outlined plans to widen the normal winter flu vaccination program, doubling those eligible for free injections, as it seeks to minimize pressure on hospitals if coronavirus and flu outbreaks occur at the same time. In televised comments to nurses on Friday, Johnson said he regards those who oppose vaccinations as “nuts.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Cases Up 1.9%; California Posts Death Record: Virus Update
2020-07-24,"Since mid-April, all's been quiet for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), at least in the equity market. SBUX stock saw a brief rally in early June, but that aside has stalled out.Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com I expect that will change soon -- and possibly next week. Starbucks reports fiscal third-quarter earnings on Tuesday afternoon. And that release should be a catalyst for Starbucks stock.To be sure, the numbers in the U.S. are going to be soft. But as economies worldwide reopen, Starbucks should see improvement. That's particularly true in China, a key market for the company and one with a suddenly wounded competitor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is not a quarter that, fundamentally, will look impressive. But I expect there will be enough to remind investors that Starbucks is one of the world's great companies. With SBUX stock down about 17% year-to-date, that should be more than enough. Business Should ImproveAgain, consolidated third quarter numbers are not going to look impressive. In fact, they'll likely be downright ugly. Wall Street expects revenue to decline a stunning 40% year-over-year.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever Of course, that's not a surprise. Starbucks stores were closed for several weeks in the quarter. Even after reopening, locations are operating at reduced hours. Like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), another restaurant stock with long-term upside, Starbucks simply is playing the hand it was dealt amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.And like McDonald's did with its Q1 report in April, Starbucks should give some detail on sales figures. I expect that detail will show a steady improvement in June, in particular, as Western economies started to recover.After all, consumers need their coffee, whether they're working from home or in an office. They're not going to stay away forever, or even for long.Given Starbucks' dominance of the market, improvement should be enough to drive some optimism. For Starbucks stock to rally, investors need to get back to focusing on the long-term case, and earnings should give investors a reason to do so. Focus on ChinaOf course, Starbucks isn't just a U.S. company. Overseas markets accounted for about 30% of revenue in fiscal 2019, according to the company's Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.And one of the key growth markets -- maybe the key growth market -- is China. There, the news likely will be better.After all, China dealt with the coronavirus first, and is recovering first. Meanwhile, rival Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY) is dealing with a massive accounting scandal that led to the departure of multiple executives.Starbucks has a big opportunity to cement its lead in China. That alone can be a game-changer for the stock. If Starbucks numbers show progress on that front, and suggest market share gains from Luckin, SBUX stock is going to rally after earnings. The Case for Starbucks StockAll told, Tuesday's report won't be one where a &quot;beat&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; relative to Street expectations is going to drive Starbucks stock. Rather, it's the context, and the commentary, that are going to matter.Again, all Starbucks needs to do is remind investors of why SBUX has been an unbelievable investment over time (+22,000% since its 1992 initial public offering). It needs to give the market reason to look beyond the soft Q3 to what should be improving results going forward.Starbucks is facing the same short-term headwinds as companies like Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN). Yet its long-term performance has been just as good, if not better. That in turn suggests that SBUX stock has more upside.I think there's a good chance that next week's earnings report proves a catalyst to narrow the gap between SBUX and other restaurant operators. But even if that's not the case, the long-term case is solid. Normalcy will return, and Starbucks will benefit. That gives Starbucks stock a path to get back to or even beyond its past highs.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

Even where Starbucks locations are welcoming customers, patrons need to socially distance. And once you get up from your table, you need to put your mask on, which makes it really hard to sip your coffee.All in all, the hassle just isn't worth the experience any longer. And you'll see that when the company reports earnings for its fiscal third quarter. SBUX Stock Earnings PreviewStarbucks is expected to report quarterly revenue of $4.13 billion, which would be down 39.5% from a year ago. Losses per share are expected to come in at 60 cents, which according to Zacks Equity Research, would be down 177% from the same quarter a year ago.For the year, Starbucks stock is down 14.3%, which is worse than the performance you'll find from competitors McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which is even for the year, and Dunkin Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN), which is down 8%.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever After closing many of its stores in China during earlier this year, Starbucks was forced to shut down its U.S. stores beginning in mid-March. That forced net revenues down by nearly 5% on a year-over-year basis, with operating income falling by 43% and net earnings down more than 50%.For the fiscal third quarter, investors can expect a rebound from the company's operations in China, but U.S. store sales will likely take a beating.The company kept as much of its business open as possible in the U.S. in the second quarter, offering drive-through and delivery service while slowly opening to takeout and dine-in in some locations.But considering that the quarter covered the period in which mandatory shutdowns and stay-at-home orders were in effect for much of the country, investors can have little hope that Starbucks will be able to put up some impressive numbers when it reports earnings. There's Some Light AheadThe biggest takeaway for me in the Starbucks earnings report will be the company's forecast for its fiscal fourth quarter and the rest of 2020. And there's some reason for hope in that regard.Starbucks says its same-store sales for the last week of May were down only 28% on a year-over-year basis, which indicates that the company is beginning a slow rebound.Nearly all of the company's stores have reopened, although there are fears in some states that the resurgence of Covid-19 infections will force some restaurants to close again.And Starbucks is adjusting to cope with how to run a customer-centric business in a Covid-19 environment. Starbucks' digital app takes advantage of the trend of customers who just want to drive through or pop into a Starbucks long enough to grab their coffee drink and go.CEO Kevin Johnson says 80% of the company's business before the coronavirus was grab-and-go, so I'm expecting those numbers to continue to rise. Anything that Johnson says about Starbucks app downloads and usage in the fiscal third quarter will be key to analysts' projections of future performance.Brown Advisory recently published its second-quarter investor letter that highlights SBUX stock as one it expects to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position. Analysts at Polen Capital Management are also bullish on Starbucks in its investor letter. The Bottom Line on SBUX StockBrace yourself for an inevitable loss this quarter. But it's reasonable to believe that improved sales in China, coupled with a slowly rebounding U.S. business will help Starbucks exceed analysts' low expectations.The key takeaway from this earnings report will be how many people are using the Starbucks mobile app on a regular basis, and the company's projections for the fiscal fourth quarter despite the possibility of continued Covid-19 shutdowns.All in all, Starbucks remains a solid company with a depressed stock price. For long-term investors, this is likely a good opportunity to pick up shares of Starbucks, but short-term investors likely need to sit this one out.Patrick Sanders is a freelance writer and editor in Maryland, and from 2015 to 2019 was head of the investment advice section at U.S. News & World Report.

2020-07-24,"[Editor's note: &quot;8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now&quot; was previously published in June 2020. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]After the big shock in March, many investors are still looking for defensive stocks to buy now. Of course, in the most extreme example, you can elect to go all into cash. However, history has proven that to be the worst thing to do. Instead, this is a good time to consider dividend aristocrats.First, market uncertainty incentivizes stable dividend stocks to buy now. How so? Passive-income generating companies typically perform better than high-flying growth names during bearish phases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor one thing, investors can still collect their payouts even if their portfolio isn't doing too well. Moreover, organizations that have a history of consistent payouts tend to be levered toward secular or otherwise steady industries.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever And there's no better paragon of stability than dividend aristocrats. For those who are unfamiliar with the term, dividend aristocrats have three main requirements: they must be equities traded in the S&P 500, have 25 years-plus of dividend increases and meet size/liquidity benchmarks.However, a word of caution. Just because you put dividend aristocrats in your list of stocks to buy now doesn't guarantee a smooth ride. If the markets turn volatile, you can expect virtually all names to incur red ink.But the major selling point is magnitude. With dividend aristocrats, you're limiting your potential losses due to the robustness of the target company. Better yet, the volatility provides a rare discount for these stalwarts of industry.So with that in mind, here are eight stocks to buy now with a long track record of payouts: Stocks to Buy: McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.53%I'm going to start my list of stocks to buy now with a name I was wrong about: McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). One of the reasons why I didn't like MCD stock was that the Golden Arches apparently wasn't winning over millennials. But recently, I started eating out at McDonald's, and I discovered that the real fundamentals don't match the &quot;paper&quot; data.For instance, the McDonald's app is incredibly convenient. You order what you want on your phone and go up to the counter or the drive-thru. Very quickly, their employees deliver your selected items. And let's talk about the drive-thru: it's lightning-quick, even with rows of waiting cars. That's a major plus for MCD stock.Finally, McDonald's is a proud member of the dividend aristocrats. It has increased its payout consistently over a 43-year period. If a downturn were to impact the markets, MCD stock is a name you'll want to own. Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.37%When you're on the hunt for stable stocks to buy now, you don't want to get too cute. Instead, you'll want to go with a proven name like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL).The investment thesis for CL stock is straightforward and simple.Even in times of recession, people still need to brush their teeth. Thus, I expect a steady revenue stream no matter what happens in the coming months and years.  * These 7 Robinhood Stocks Have the Legs for Future Gains I believe CL stock will give you excellent protection over the coming months. Keep in mind that Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividends for 55 years. That's an impressive feat, even compared to other dividend aristocrats.Further, it's a status that management won't give up without a fight. Cardinal Health (CAH)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.44%In recent years, the healthcare sector has suffered a black eye from a public relations standpoint. Thus, it's no surprise that many companies in this segment have faltered.However, I'd consider putting Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) on your list of stocks to buy now. Unlike other players in this broad category, CAH stock is strongly levered to secular demand.In other words, Cardinal Health has a wide range of professional medical products. They run the gamut from anesthesia-related equipment to laboratory products down to something as mundane as gloves.While medical technology is always improving, some things will always remain the same. For these everyday concerns in the medical field, Cardinal Health has folks covered. Ultimately, that's a great catalyst for CAH stock.Another factor is that the company very much belongs on the list of dividend aristocrats. While the exact number of dividend increases causes some disagreement, CAH is included in the Proshares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (BATS:NOBL). And whatever the case, it has reliably raised dividends for at least the last 14 years. Aflac (AFL)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.03%Simply put, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) is a great company with an incredibly relevant service. As you no doubt have learned through their quirky commercials, Aflac specializes in supplemental insurance.Essentially, its range of products protects you financially from incidents that &quot;regular&quot; insurance doesn't cover or cover adequately. Plus, their solutions represent an incremental cost for much peace of mind, bolstering the case for AFL stock.And while most millennials probably think they're invincible, many will encounter situations that give them a reality check.  * 7 Micro-Cap Stocks You May Want to Take a Chance On Additionally, they may hear horror stories about how coverage gaps financially ruined one of their peers. Whatever the case, Aflac, and by logical deduction, AFL stock, has opportunities to rise through word of mouth.Finally, Aflac is one of the most stable stocks to buy now among dividend aristocrats. Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.91%I don't always prepare for recessions. But when I do, I take a long look at Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB).If you're concerned about a prolonged downturn in the U.S. or global economy, you'll also want to consider KMB stock. As with Colgate-Palmolive, the bullish argument here is very simple: even in recessions, people need to use the bathroom.And without getting graphic, people also need to take care of themselves after a lengthy session with the porcelain throne. Kimberly-Clark offers some of the best products for this endeavor, and I speak from personal experience. Moreover, the company has other family-care products. If you think about it, KMB stock is truly a cradle-to-grave investment.Kimberly-Clark has traded among dividend aristocrats for 46 years. That makes its shares one of the stocks to buy now in my book. Chevron (CVX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.67%With the U.S. and China trading barbs and sanctions, it's no surprise that oil companies like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) fell.On surface level, CVX stock currently faces two major headwinds. First, global volatility means lower demand overall for energy. Second, the push for clean and renewable energies makes CVX stock appear antiquated, and perhaps soon approaching irrelevancy.Admittedly, the first point is going to be a major distraction for Chevron. However, even in the middle of a recession, people still require transportation. Thus, I don't see demand falling completely off the cliff.  * The 7 Best Cheap Stocks Under $10 Right Now On the second point, I believe green energy is more a gimmick than a practical reality. Our infrastructure is simply not ready to accommodate innovations like electric vehicles on a mass scale.Granted, CVX stock is a risky play among this list of stocks to buy now. That said, the trade war dynamic should drive shares to an attractive discount. At that point, I think Chevron becomes a bargain because the world still needs fossil-fuel-based energy. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 6.96%With AT&T (NYSE:T), we're really getting into the riskier side of the dividend stocks to buy now. I say this for a couple of reasons.One, with a yield of 6.38%, sustainability becomes a concern. Second, and a perfect segue, the dividend payout ratio for T stock is on-paper astronomical. Therefore, many bears anticipate that AT&T will lose its status as one of the key dividend aristocrats.However, it's important to point out that telecoms usually have extremely large depreciation and amortization costs. That artificially depresses earnings, which makes the high payout ratio somewhat deceptive.Still, I concede the point that T stock is saddled with an unprecedented debt level. Its big-moat, slow-growth narrative is distracting, especially when we may be headed toward a recession.That said, this criticism focuses on the headline print. In reality, AT&T is one of very few companies that have the resources and know-how to roll out the 5G network. And because we're in a tech cold war with international adversaries, I see the government supporting T stock big time. 3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.69%Last on my list of stocks to buy now is applied-sciences firm 3M (NYSE:MMM). After providing largely steady gains over the last several decades, MMM stock is in trouble.Hitting a peak around February of 2018, shares have formed an ugly bearish trend channel. Efforts to time the bottom have badly bruised speculators, especially after the 2019 April peak that preceded a massive nosedive.Surely, I'm not alone when I say that I dislike the phrase &quot;this time, it's different.&quot; It's almost bad karma to use those words when discussing an investment thesis. However, I genuinely believe that with MMM stock, this is a valid descriptor.One of the toughest challenges for MMM stock is that the underlying company didn't have a relevant product. That calculus has changed with their latest &quot;Flex & Seal Shipping Roll.&quot; Essentially, this is a customizable shipping package that doesn't require tape or other cumbersome equipment.Looking at the video demonstration of Flex & Seal, I think it's a game-changer for retail. By logical deduction, then, it's a game-changer for MMM stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long T stock.

2020-07-24,"The flagship McDonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) burger can be used for more than a consistent lunch on the go. It can also be used to measure currency values and give insight to whether one currency is &quot;overvalued&quot; or &quot;undervalued&quot; to another currency.What's The Big Mac Index? The index is a non-official way developed by The Economist in 1986 as a way to compare currency values.Although it's a witty way to compare currencies, many economic textbooks and academic papers have used this index. The Economist even updates the values monthly and tracks data on over 15 different currencies.The index centers around an idea economists refer to as price purchasing parity.What's Price Purchasing Parity? It's used to compare prices that differ between different countries for the same good. Economists often use the example of looking at what a basket of goods costs in another country.Economic factors such as inflation and exchange rates that differ from country to country change the cost of items that are alike.The Big Mac Index is used in place of this &quot;basket&quot; of goods because the Big Mac can be found almost anywhere in the world and most people know what it is. Price purchasing parity is often used when comparing GDP among countries.A Bite At An Example: A Big Mac costs $5.71 stateside, per The Economist data as of July 23. This same burger costs 390 yen in Japan.Therefore, the implied exchange rate is 68.30, or 390 divided by 5.71. Yet the difference between the implied exchange rate and the actual exchange rate is 107.2. This index, therefore, tells us that the Japanese yen is undervalued by 36.3%, or 107.2-68.30.This index can be used to compare currencies and used by investors to track economic differences in a country. Different situations in different countries could change the cost of a Big Mac.Next time you have a burger, just remember that you're taking a bite out of the world's economy.Photo courtesy of McDonald's.See more from Benzinga  * Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Subscription Feature Would Have 'Really High Bar'  * How Walmart's Thanksgiving Schedule Changes The Holiday Shopping Season  * What Missed Rent Payments, Pandemic Could Mean For REITs, Housing Market(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Technology has loomed large as a transformative force in the restaurant industry, with the rise of digital ordering and delivery promising to upend the economics of running a major chain restaurant. The pandemic has served as something of a fast-forward button to this future, as customers steered clear of restaurant dining rooms because of safety concerns, local regulations, or both. The recent earnings results of McDonald’s Corp. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. – two restaurant chains widely perceived as digitally savvy – have made it clear that embracing tech to win over customers can and should mean different things, depending on whether Big Macs or burritos are on the menu.In its Tuesday earnings conference call, McDonald’s said that 90% of its U.S. sales in the quarter ended June 30 were drive-through. That format has long been a cornerstone of the business and was able to remain open even when many of its dining rooms were shuttered, so this is not necessarily surprising. But it is revealing. McDonald’s executives said delivery grew “significantly” in the quarter, but it was clear that the drive-through lane was the hero. And no wonder: Paying a delivery fee on an order where your meal might cost only $5 doesn’t seem to make much sense, and I don’t think McDonald’s food travels particularly well.  That delivery didn’t soar to a higher proportion of sales even in this unusual environment makes me skeptical it will ever be a significant part of McDonald’s business. That’s not to say McDonald’s shouldn’t keep competing aggressively in the digital realm; it’s a business that will certainly keep growing and that can bring in incremental business. But these latest results suggest that McDonald’s other, less-sexy technology investments might actually be more focal to its future. In particular, it underscores the importance of its 2019 acquisition of Dynamic Yield, a company whose technology is allowing McDonald’s to work on real-time change-ups of its drive-through ordering menu board based on factors such as weather.  The situation in the quarter was much different at Chipotle, where digital pickup and delivery orders accounted for 61% of its sales.  At the same time, though, the company’s restaurant-level operating margin sank to 12%, sharply lower than the 21% it recorded in the second quarter last year. This reflects several factors, including doling out bonuses to workers amid the crisis. But much of it came down to the impact of its online business: Delivery expenses soared amid the explosion in orders.   Chipotle would have to rethink many aspects of its business if that 12% operating margin were to become a new normal. But I don’t think investors should expect that – and not just because every restaurant chain is bound to see in-restaurant dining make a bit of a comeback as more states allow it. Much of Chipotle’s digital sales growth is coming from pickup orders, rather than delivery. The company said that compared to pre-pandemic levels, its digital pickup business is up 140% percent, greater than the 125% increase it has seen in the delivery segment. It is a good sign that it is seeing greater growth in the more profitable type of transaction. Chipotle also has tools to cushion the profitability blow. The restaurant chain had offered free delivery for much of the quarter to encourage customers to try out the service but is tightening the spigot now. Sure, it’s possible customers it loses those customers altogether when delivery is no longer free. But, notably, the company said it has observed that trying Chipotle’s app for delivery has been a gateway for customers to place pickup orders, once they realize the latter format has no fees and often shorter wait times. If enacting a delivery fee simply pushes more customers to embrace pickup, that is a win. Chipotle is also experimenting with higher menu prices for delivery orders to help with profitability. I expect that move will do little to dampen sales in this format, given that the chain has implemented in-store price hikes in the past with little pushback from its relatively affluent customers. Plus, as a major national chain with strong brand recognition, it can flex muscle with third-party delivery companies to secure favorable commission rates. There is no doubt that digital ordering and other innovations will continue to rattle the restaurant industry and play a role in determining its winners and losers. McDonald’s and Chipotle show that just as important as it is to invest in tech is knowing how to use it. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday that GOP leaders who brought a roughly $1 billion aid proposal to the table are &quot;not really ready to have a serious negotiation.&quot; Democrats are eager to maintain the existing $600 weekly supplement, while the Republican plan would reduce it to a $200 add-on through September. The supplemental jobless benefits are due to expire at the end of the month. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve is set to conclude a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that's unlikely to result in much action, but is expected to see Chairman Jerome Powell underline a willingness to take further measures to support the economy and maintain easy financial conditions. In corporate news, Pfizer Inc. shares  were up 3.9% after beating earnings and revenue expectations and raising its full-year outlook, while shares of McDonald's Corp.  were off 2.5% after the fast-food chain reported earnings that fell short of Wall Street forecasts.",Dow ends 205 points lower as tensions around coronavirus aid package grow ahead of Fed policy update

2020-07-28,"Right now, McDonald's Inc. (NYSE: MCD) share price is at $196.56, after a 2.34% decrease. Over the past month, the stock went up by 6.55%, but over the past year, it actually fell by 6.72%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 58.22%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Restaurants stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on MCDMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 176.23 in the Restaurants industry, McDonald's Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 26.38. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.There are many limitations to P/E ratio.

2020-07-28,"Over the past three months, shares of McDonald's Inc. (NYSE: MCD) moved higher by 10.18%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt McDonald's has.McDonald's's Debt According to the McDonald's's most recent balance sheet as reported on May 7, 2020, total debt is at $39.46 billion, with $38.05 billion in long-term debt and $1.41 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $5.38 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $34.08 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. McDonald's has $50.57 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.78. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 28, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The international business also saw pressure in the quarter, but started showing signs of recovery in June, he said.

2020-07-29,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD) said global same-store sales dropped almost 24% in the second quarter, while profit missed analysts’ estimates as the coronavirus-induced lockdowns led to shutdowns of its fast-food dineiin restaurants.Shares depreciated 2.5% to $196.24 at the close on Tuesday. The fast-food chain reported that global same-store sales declined 23.9% in the second quarter year-on-year, which is slightly below the 23.24% expected by analysts. Same-restaurant sales in the US, one of its largest markets, fell 8.7%, while most of its drive-through, takeout and delivery operations remained open.Total revenue in the quarter ended June 30 slumped 30% to $3.76 billion year-on-year beating analysts’ estimates of $3.68 billion. Net income tanked 68% to $483.8 million during the same comparative period. On an adjusted basis, McDonald’s earned 66 cents per share, which is 8 cents below consensus.“Our strong drive-thru presence and the investments we've made in delivery and digital over the past few years have served us well through these uncertain times”, said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski. “We saw continued improvement in our results throughout the second quarter as markets reopened around the world.”In addition, the fast-food chain announced that it will permanently shut 200 of its lower-volume restaurants, with more than half of the planned closures located in Walmart (WMT) centers.Shares in McDonalds have been hit hard earlier this year but have now recouped almost all of their losses and are currently trading down less than 1% year-to-date.Following the Q2 results, five-star analyst Brian Bittner at Oppenheimer maintained a Hold rating on the stock, saying that he continues to search for catalysts for stock outperformance.Same-store sales in the “US have turned positive in July as drive-thru assets continue to prove invaluable,” Bittner wrote in a note to investors. “While the business is on a better path than we originally modeled, we'd look for more compelling catalysts for outperformance before we take a bullish stance on upside.”Looking ahead, Bittner expects results likely to be choppy for several quarters due to COVID-19, adding that he believes that MCD's cash flow and strong balance sheet will allow it to weather this period of uncertainty.Meanwhile, the rest of the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus breaks down into 20 Buy ratings versus 4 Hold ratings. The $209.20 average price target implies 6.6% upside potential in the shares over the coming 12 months.

2020-07-31,"Here's a fun fact: Of all the restaurant stocks in the world, relatively obscure Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) stock has been the best performer on Wall Street.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com By a mile.Over the past five years, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock has risen 32%. Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) stock has risen 50%. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) stock has also risen 50%. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock has risen 100%. Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) stock has soared 240%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose are great returns. Especially the 240% pop in DPZ stock.But, all of those returns pale in comparison to what WING stock has done over the past five years.During that stretch, WING stock has surged 300% higher, making it not just the best performing restaurant stock out there, but also one of the best performing stocks in the whole market.This red-hot run in WING stock isn't over. Far from it. Instead, I think that in the long run, Wingstop has a real opportunity to become the next McDonald's. Buying WING stock today could be like buying MCD stock back in the late 1960s.To that end, I think WING stock is perhaps the best restaurant stock to buy for long-term investors.Here's why. Wingstop Can Be the Next McDonald'sFrom where I sit, Wingstop looks like the next McDonald's.McDonald's went from six locations in 1954 to nearly 40,000 restaurants today by doing four simple things.Selling the right product, at the right price, in the right format, and through the right channel.That is, McDonald's sold hamburgers in the 1960s, at a time when burger popularity was soaring nationally because it was seen as a patriotic American symbol amid the Cold War, and because Americans had started to adopt the idea of barbecues in their backyards.McDonald's sold those burgers for 15 cents, in a menu that was straightforward.  * 10 Gaming Stocks That Will Power Through the New Normal And the company sold them mostly through drive-thru locations, on the heels of the 1956 Federal Highway Act, which paved the way for America to become highly motorized.Today, Wingstop is following almost identically -- and successfully -- in McDonald's footsteps.That is, the company is selling the right product, at the right price, in the right format, and through the right channel.Wingstop sells chicken wings, at a time when health-conscious consumers are pivoting from red meat consumption to higher-protein, less-fatty chicken consumption. Over the past decade, U.S. beef consumption per capita has dropped 5%, while chicken consumption per capita has risen 16%.Wingstop sell those wings at industry-low prices, and the menu is exceedingly simple.Most importantly, Wingstop sells its wings mostly through digital orders. Even before the novel coronavirus, more than 40% of the company's sales were digital. Now, it's on the heels of a global pandemic that has permanently accelerated consumer adoption of all things digital. WING Stock Has Tons of Growth PotentialBroadly, Wingstop has all the ingredients to be the next McDonald's.That's exciting news for WING stock, because Wingstop today is essentially where McDonald's was in the late 1960s.Wingstop operates just 1,436 restaurants today. McDonald's had that many restaurants back in the late 1960s.Wingstop has been growing its store base by 10%-plus per year over the past several years. Management thinks they can sustain 10%-plus unit growth for a lot longer, growing to over 6,000 stores globally at scale.Sure, that's a far cry from McDonald's near 40,000 locations today. But it still represents 4x growth from today's current base.Plus, Wingstop's average unit volumes are just $1.1 million today. That number is rapidly climbing -- up 15% last quarter -- but is still a far cry from average unit volumes at McDonald's ($2.8 million) and peer chicken restaurants like Chick-fil-A ($4.2 million) and El Pollo Loco ($1.8 million).In other words, Wingstop has a visible opportunity to simultaneously rapidly grow its store base and AUVs over the next 10-plus years. That's the sort of growth profile which could turn Wingstop into a top 10 restaurant brand globally one day -- and power WING stock to huge long-term gains. Momentum Is BuildingImpressively -- and importantly -- management is executing flawlessly against the restaurant chain's long-term opportunity, and momentum today is building, not slowing.Just look at last quarter's numbers.Same-store sales rose 32% year-over-year. Revenues rose 36%. System-wide sales rose 37%. Restaurant count rose 10%. Gross margins expanded 300 basis points. Operating margins expanded 840 basis points. Earnings per share more than doubled year-over-year.And that's all on top of double-digit comparable sales, revenue growth and unit growth in the same quarter one year ago.In other words, Wingstop is sustaining robust growth at scale.This is nothing new for the company.Wingstop has reported 16 consecutive years of positive comparable sales growth … including six years of 10%-plus comparable sales growth. This growth has led to average unit volumes essentially doubling over the past decade. And Wingstop has glided to industry-high 26% operating margins (versus 19% at McDonald's).What's the key to this success?You have an innovative management team that is relentlessly working to improve the customer experience, smartly expand the footprint and keep costs down.Specifically, this is a management team which leans heavily into purchase data analytics, digital marketing, and next-generation developments (like voice-activated ordering and carryout lockers) to sustain consistently robust comparable sales growth. It's also a management team that is hyper-focused on cost mitigation through striking long-term chicken pricing contracts and running a slim labor model thanks to the simple menu.So long as management continues to do everything right to capitalize on Wingstop's huge long-term growth opportunity, then WING stock will inevitably power higher. Wingstop Stock Has Big Upside PotentialAt the current WING stock price, Wingstop's market capitalization is $4.7 billion.In the long run, I see this as a $20 billion company.Here's the math.McDonald's has a $150 billion market cap. With 38,695 locations globally. In a mostly franchised model. Imputing a valuation in that mostly franchised model of nearly $4 million per store.Wingstop operates in a similar franchised model. At scale, if you look at peer chicken QSR AUVs, Wingstop stores should do more in sales than McDonald's stores. Plus, Wingstop stores have higher unit margins.Thus, your average Wingstop store, at scale, should be worth more than your average McDonald's store.Let's call it a per-store valuation of $4 million flat. On 6,000-plus locations globally, you're talking about a $24 billion company.That's more than 5x the current valuation.Needless to say, then, WING stock has huge long-term upside potential. Bottom Line on WING StockWING stock is the best restaurant stock to buy for patient, long-term investors. Valuation and technical friction may cause choppiness in WING stock here and now.Such friction won't last. Long term, WING stock is a winner, with multi-bagger return potential.So, if you're looking for a restaurant stock to buy and hold for the next five to 10 years, WING stock is your best option.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-08-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- HSBC Holdings Plc can’t seem to get a break. Even the financial-market boom that buoyed profits at some banks wasn’t enough to save Europe’s biggest lender from missing estimates. Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn said HSBC is looking at accelerating restructuring plans that are expected to lead to the loss of 35,000 jobs. He may need to think even more radically.The bank reported second-quarter adjusted pretax profit fell 57% from a year earlier to $2.59 billion, versus an estimate of $2.94 billion. HSBC lifted its projection for loan losses to between $8 billion and $13 billion for this year, as it contends with the economic impact of the Covid pandemic. The shares fell as much as 4.7% in Hong Kong trading, reaching their lowest since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009.Shrinking its workforce can’t fix the geopolitical headwinds the bank is facing. Headquartered in London but focused on Asia, HSBC is trapped between the demands of the U.K. and U.S. on one side and China on the other. With relations deteriorating and little prospect of an improvement, it may be time for the bank to consider separating its Asian business from the rest.HSBC appears to have few allies in government. British lawmakers criticized the bank for showing support for China’s national security legislation in Hong Kong, while U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo attacked what he called “corporate kowtows.” At the same time, toeing China’s line appears to have won HSBC scant reward in Beijing. The Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper published an opinion piece last week saying the bank was an accomplice of the U.S. in the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou and fabricated evidence against the company. HSBC has denied the allegations. The attacks have helped to drive the slump in HSBC’s Hong Kong-traded shares this year. They have lost 45%, far exceeding the 13% decline in the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index.HSBC’S London and Hong Kong listings serve largely different investor bases. That alone might argue for some form of separation. As Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jonathan Tyce says, the bank could look into withdrawing from one of the markets. “We suspect that, as with many U.S. global tech companies, HSBC may choose to wait and see if a change in the U.S. presidency in November will ease this threat, but longer term, dual-listing will probably be reassessed,” he said. A more fundamental shift would be to spin off the non-Asian business, creating two companies with separate management teams and perhaps listings. That might give HSBC a better chance of satisfying government and legal expectations in different parts of the world. At present, the bank faces being caught between conflicting demands of the national security law and potential U.S. sanctions against Chinese officials involved in imposing the legislation on Hong Kong.There is a precedent. In early 2017, McDonald’s Corp. sold most of its Hong Kong and China business to a tie-up between state-owned Citic Ltd. and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group LP. Yum! Brands Inc., meanwhile, owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands, spun off Yum China for a separate listing in November 2016.These changes appear to have insulated the companies against anti-American sentiment fueled by worsening trade tensions between China and the U.S. Yum China has outperformed its former parent since the spinoff. The prospect of Microsoft Corp. buying TikTok’s U.S. operations shows how the world is growing accustomed to the idea of sensitive businesses being carved into separate spheres of influence with different owners.A side-benefit of splitting the Asian business might be to shift its domicile back to Hong Kong. That would enable the more-profitable regional unit to resume dividend payments, which HSBC was forced to cancel earlier this year at the behest of U.K. regulators. That decision angered HSBC’s legion of small shareholders in Hong Kong and has contributed to the stock’s underperformance this year.Such a restructuring might face considerable regulatory hurdles. Quinn called the last few months the most challenging in living memory. Without radical change, HSBC may remain stuck between a rock and a hard place. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2020-08-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When Louis DeJoy became postmaster general in May, he was the first person in more than 20 years to run the U.S. Postal Service who had never worked there. His predecessor, Megan Brennan, had spent her entire career with the service, originally as a mail carrier.On the other hand, DeJoy, an accountant, founded and sold a company, New Breed Logistics, that worked for decades with the Postal Service and other public and private enterprises wrestling with supply and transportation challenges. DeJoy’s Postal Service work while running New Breed reportedly focused on the basics: repairing postal equipment, mail bags and hampers.In theory, what DeJoy lacked in familiarity and expertise would be more than offset by a fresh, outside perspective and an ability to help modernize the Postal Service, which employs almost 500,000 people, operates a massive domestic retail network (bigger than McDonald’s Corp., Starbucks Corp. and Walmart Inc. combined), and, until Covid-19 arrived, was delivering 182 million pieces of first-class mail daily.I would think DeJoy also came to the attention of the Postal Service’s board of governors because he is a generous political donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Since 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records, DeJoy has donated more than $2 million to Trump’s campaign and other Republican groups. As recently as February, he gave $210,600 to a political action committee, Trump Victory. The Republican National Committee and the McConnell Senate Committee have also received money from DeJoy. In 2017, he hosted a joint fundraiser for Trump and the RNC at his North Carolina home.DeJoy’s wife, Aldona Wos, is vice chairwoman of the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships and was nominated by Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to Canada. DeJoy and Wos have disclosed financial assets worth $30.1 million to $75.3 million, the bulk of which is tied up in the company that bought New Breed from them. But they also have small stakes in Postal Service competitors, such as United Parcel Service Inc.All of this has weighed heavily on DeJoy’s brief tenure. When he arrived at the Postal Service, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was leading a White House effort to leverage federal bailout funding to get the struggling agency to agree to greater presidential control. Trump himself was exercising his animus toward Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc. and owner of the Washington Post, threatening to tie up the $10 billion Congress had earmarked for the Postal Service until it raised prices for package deliveries Amazon relies on.That mud wrestling prompted the resignation of a veteran member of the Postal Service’s board of governors. Another veteran left the 11-member board after DeJoy’s appointment. In short order, the postal workers’ union and Democrats in Congress voiced concerns that the Postal Service had become politicized and that DeJoy was a stalking horse for Trump’s resentments — and for the possibility that the beleaguered president would use the service to undermine mail-in voting for the November election.In mid-July, DeJoy made a number of operational changes, including shorter post office hours and eliminating overtime for postal workers, that promised to slow down mail delivery and could throw a wrench into mail-in voting. DeJoy said it was all about cost-cutting and efficiency. Senior Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wondered otherwise and on July 20 asked DeJoy to respond to requests for more information about those changes. They also wanted to know why he was running the Postal Service like a “private company” rather than “the constitutionally mandated public service that it is.”As I wrote in April, there’s no question that the Postal Service needs improvement, and if that means adopting some private-sector practices, so be it. But there’s no reason to believe that’s why Trump has taken such a close interest in it. The president has tried to bend federal agencies to his whims or self-interest rather than refashion them as engines of enhanced public service. The Postal Service is no exception.Trump and Attorney General William Barr also have repeatedly, and falsely, slagged mail-in voting as riddled with fraud, despite the fact that both of them and 14 other senior Trump administration officials have voted by mail. Why wouldn’t they take the next logical step and disrupt the Postal Service’s machinery with federal fraud investigations draped in the cloak of “good government” — particularly when Trump is deeply underwater in most presidential polls and has been saber-rattling about postponing Election Day?That possibility isn’t lost on casual observers, including former presidents. During his eulogy last week for Representative John Lewis, Barack Obama warned that an attack on voting rights is already being conducted “with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don’t get sick.”Most states allow some form of mail-in voting. Although Republicans fear it favors Democrats, studies have indicated that it hasn’t provided an advantage historically for either party. Still, anything that makes voting easier increases turnout, and increased turnout has always been a boon to Democrats. And this election year is unlike any other in the modern era because of the Covid-19 pandemic, economic upheaval, social protests and the partisan passions sparked by Trump. Americans are likely to be highly motivated to vote while also being deeply worried about doing so safely at public polling booths.Voters also favor voting early, using mail-in ballots. The number of voters who have done so on Election Day more than doubled to 57.2 million in 2016, from 24.9 million in 2004 — an increase from about 20% to 40% of all ballots cast. The 2020 election promises to bring an even greater spike. States, which actually run elections despite White House views to the contrary, will need fiscal and logistical support to manage what is likely to be a massive upswing in mail-in voting.Prompt delivery of mail-in ballots will be key to this functioning well. A majority of states won’t accept mail-in ballots unless they arrive by Election Day, even if they’re postmarked prior to Election Day.I’m sure the postmaster general wouldn’t want to see tens of millions of ballots arrive after Election Day, depriving Americans of a fundamental right. But to make sure, Congress will need to do more than write DeJoy threatening letters — it will need to keep the public and voters focused on how he’s running the Postal Service and hold him, the Justice Department and the White House accountable.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

2020-08-05,"McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved down to $198.56 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $200.00  * Volume: 1020  * Open Interest: 35103 Signs of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Contracts that have been traded, but not closed by a counter-party, are called open interest. A purchased contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for the option.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Price Over Earnings Overview: McDonald's  * Recap: McDonald's Q2 Earnings  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-10,"McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is suing former CEO Steve Easterbrook to recover severance payments following an internal probe that found that Easterbrook had sexual relationships with three employees, the company said in a Monday SEC filing. McDonald's is suing Easterbrook for the amount of his exit package -- around $40 million -- in Delaware's Court of Chancery. What Hapened: In October 2019, McDonald's had learned of an allegation that Easterbrook engaged in an inappropriate personal relationship with a McDonald's employee, the company said.  The board commissioned an investigation of the allegation.The investigation confirmed that the alleged relationship had occurred and revealed that it had been a non-physical, consensual relationship involving texting and video calls, according to McDonald's. Easterbrook told internal investigators the relationship was the only one of an intimate nature he had ever had with a McDonald's employee, the company said, Easterbrook said he never engaged in a physical sexual relationship with any McDonald's employee, the company said. On Nov. 1, the McDonald's board fired  Easterbrook.Why It's Imortant: The board concluded that Easterbrook violated company policy by engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate, but also that his conduct demonstrated poor judgment that disqualified him from continued service as the CEO.MCD Price Action: McDonald's shares were trading down 0.67% at $203.25 at last check Monday.

2020-08-17,"Global fast food giant Mcdonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) needs to make changes to its board of directors in reaction to how it handled the ousting of its former CEO Steve Easterbrook, according to Dieter Waizenegger of CtW Investment Group.A Failure In Board Oversight? The McDonald's board offered Easterbrook an extremely generous exit package to depart amid allegations of an improper relationship with a female employee, CtW's executive chairman said. CtW and other shareholders raised their concerns at the time, he said, adding that a payout sets a &quot;toxic tone at the top&quot; of the company, Waizenegger said, speaking Friday on CNBC's &quot;Squawk on the Street.&quot;The board failed to act, even after media outlets reported on Easterbrook's improper relationships and a broader party culture among the C-suite, he said.&quot;It is amazing to us you wouldn't look at all the corners in the closet to make sure you don't find the skeletons that could come back to haunt you.&quot; Investor Singles Out Board Members: Waizenegger singled out McDonald's Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. and Richard Lenny, who is head of the compensation committee, as the two most senior board members that he said are responsible for the situation. The two board members failed to conduct a proper investigation ahead of Easterbrook's official termination and now the company could be stuck with a very expensive and drawn-out litigation process, Waizenegger said.The outcome of the litigation is unclear, and there is a chance McDonald's might not even get the money back, he said. &quot;We want to see consequences for the board as well.&quot; 'Enormous' Embarrassment: McDonald's faces &quot;enormous&quot; embarrassment, as there is reason to believe the company oversaw a &quot;poor and inadequate&quot; investigation of Easterbrook, Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said Monday in a Fox Business interview.McDonald's included a stipulation in Easterbrook's package that his compensation will be null and void if the former CEO is found guilty of lying to the board, Napolitano said. Yet the deal also includes a stipulation that McDonald's will pay for Easterbrook's legal fees in any lawsuit, he said. McDonald's Has Witnesses: McDonald's is believed to be cooperating with women who had sexual relationships with Easterbrook and will testify in court, Napolitano said.The likely outcome will be a settlement between the two sides in which Easterbrook will give &quot;some&quot; of the compensation back to avoid further embarrassment in the form of a public trial, he said.

Below are two Dividend Aristocrats that are safe income-producing investments that can be pillars for your portfolio for many years.",2 Dividend Aristocrats That Can Anchor Your Portfolio Even During the Coronavirus Pandemic
2020-08-21,"Since the equity markets hit a bottom in March, the bull run has been the strongest since the Great Depression, according to the Wall Street Journal. But sustaining this will not be easy. If anything, it's probably a good idea to consider safe stocks to buy for your portfolio.One of the risks for the markets is the upcoming election. With the novel coronavirus, there will be a much larger portion of the population that will vote by mail -- and this could easily delay the results. The uncertainty could mean a spike in volatility. In fact, this happened during the election in 2000.Next, there are signs of frothiness. Many tech stocks and IPOs have seen parabolic moves on the upside. Perhaps the most notable example of the exuberance is when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock jumped because of an announcement of a stock split. Keep in mind that this kind of market action was common during the later stages of the dot-com boom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd finally, there are signs that the economic recovery has stalled out. The lack of a stimulus agreement will also likely weigh on growth.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now OK then, in light of all this, what are some of the safe stocks to buy now? Well, here's a look at seven:  * Visa (NYSE:V)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Safe Stocks to Buy: Visa (V)Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Founded in 1958, Visa's future still looks bright. It certainly helps that the company has built a powerful platform with significant barriers to entry and network effects.It's true that the pandemic has weighed on the company. In the latest quarter, earnings dropped by 23% and payments volume was off by 10%. A big reason for this was the steep fall in travel activity. But keep in mind that Visa has been able to offset some of this through improvements in other parts of the business.For example, the volume of activity for card-not-present transactions -- such as for those online -- jumped by 25% each week since the start of April. This is a doubling of the growth rate compared to before the pandemic. For the first half of this year, Visa issued over than 80 million contactless cards in the U.S.In the meantime, the company has been paring back its expenses. This has been largely due to lower spending on advertising and marketing.Visa has also been investing aggressively in fintech technologies. Earlier in the year, the company shelled out $5.3 billion for Plaid, which is a top integration platform for connecting to third-party financial systems. And with V stock fetching a valuation of $450 billion and a hefty cash balance, there is plenty of resources to continue the deal-making. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com When it comes to safe stocks to buy, Coca-Cola has the essential factors. The company's moat includes over 500 strong brands and thousands of different products. There is also a massive distribution footprint in over 200 countries. Consider that Coca-Cola provides over 1.9 billion servings a day of its beverages.Although, the company has definitely not been immune from the impact of the pandemic. Of course, there has been a fall-off in business from restaurants, theaters and stadiums.But for the latest quarter, Coca-Cola's management did indicate that it appeared that the worst was over. There was also talk to accelerate the transformation efforts of the company, such as with increased investments in digital technology and even artificial intelligence.Another advantage of KO stock is the dividend. There has been an increase for 58 straight years. Safe Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com The healthcare industry definitely has many safe stocks to buy. The industry continues to grow and there are long-term secular trends like the aging of populations across the globe.One of the safest healthcare stocks is Johnson & Johnson, which has been around since 1886. The company's platform is massive and covers the main categories of healthcare:  * Consumer: These are personal, beauty, oral care and wound products. Some of the brands include Aveeno, Sudafed, Nicorette, Neutrogena, Listerine and Pepcid.  * Pharmaceuticals: They cover areas like immunology, infectious diseases, oncology and pulmonary hypertension.  * Medical Devices: The products are for surgery, eye health and orthopaedic procedures.Last month, JNJ started its first human clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine and the plan is to have a large Phase 3 trial in September. The company has invested in its infrastructure to be able to manufacture as much as 1 billion doses for next year.Something else: With relatively stable cash flows, JNJ stock has been a solid dividend payer, with the current yield at 2.7%. The company has increased its dividend payout for 57 consecutive years. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The tech sector has plenty of safe stocks to buy. But there's a problem: The valuations have gotten a bit excessive.Yet there are still some interesting value plays, such as Cisco Systems. The stock recent took a hit because of the delays in sales due to the pandemic.  But the result is that the valuation is much more reasonable, with the price-earnings ratio at 16x. The dividend on CSCO stock is also at 3.3%, which is one of the highest for the tech industry.Note that the company is taking swift action to reduce its cost structure. The goal is to realize savings of $1 billion. But Cisco is also looking at ways to increase its growth.To this end, the company expects to ramp up its research and development on cloud computing as well as security solutions. CSCO is also seeing a spike in interest in Webex, which is a leading video conferencing platform. According to Cisco CEO Charles Robbins: &quot;We expect this momentum to continue, as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions.&quot; Safe Stocks to Buy: Nike (NKE)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com In January, Nike appointed John Donahoe as CEO. Prior to this, he was the CEO of tech companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).Nike's move was another indication of why the company has been so successful -- that is, it is always looking for ways to innovate and be creative. And by selecting Donahoe, there was a clear sign that digital transformation would be critical for the future.And yes, Nike has already benefited from this expertise. When the coronavirus hit, Donahoe acted swiftly to bolster the company's e-commerce platform. The result has been that -- during the latest quarter -- there was a 75% spike in the business.True, there was still an overall drop in the sales. But the e-commerce sales did soften the blow. Besides, another key advantage for NKE stock is its highly valuable brand. Its icon swoosh is recognized across the globe and commands premium pricing. As Donahoe said on the latest earnings call: &quot;Nike's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers, amid a global shift toward health and wellness.&quot; McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com When Ray Kroc came on board McDonald's in 1954, he had big plans. He set out to transform the restaurant industry and be the leader in the emerging fast-food category. And it did not take him long to do this.Fast forward to today: McDonald's has over 36,000 locations across more than 100 countries.Building this empire has included a variety of innovative strategies, such as with creating an efficient process for cooking food, coming up with creative menu items and keeping costs low. But the company has also been smart with its business model, such as by relying on franchises.While the pandemic has depressed sales -- which has been the case throughout the restaurant industry -- MCD has been finding ways to deal with the challenges. The company has been able to quickly make operational changes to its chain of locations, say with safety measures, new menus and contactless systems. There has also been material improvements to the speed of service for the drive-thru business. During this period, customer satisfaction has actually increased.Then again, McDonald's has the benefit of a trusted brand as well as a rock-solid balance sheet. There is also an attractive dividend. Note that the yield on MCD stock is roughly 2.4%. Safe Stocks to Buy: Verizon (VZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Verizon is the No. 1 mobile carrier in the United States, with 119.9 million subscribers. And even with the pandemic, the company has continued to grow its base. In the latest quarter, VZ added roughly 173,000 postpaid phone connections. Then again, for millions of people, their smartphone has become a necessity.But in the next few years, VZ should benefit from the megatrend of 5G. This technology will supercharge the speeds of mobile networks -- spurring the creation of innovative apps for consumers and businesses. Technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality and the internet of things will become more pervasive.To capitalize on this, VZ has recently acquired Blue Jeans Network, which operates a videoconferencing platform. Of course, this market has seen a surge in growth because of the pandemic. But 5G will be another important catalyst.VZ stock is currently trading at attractive levels as the price-earnings ratio is at 12.7x and the dividend is at 4%. The company also has a reasonable debt load and continues to crank out strong cash flows, which have come to nearly $16 billion for the past year.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

What Happened: McDonald's is suing its former CEO, alleging that Easterbrook wasn't fully truthful with the board when the two sides negotiated an exit package.In the latest developments, former McDonald's managers told WSJ they believe human resource leaders ignored complaints about the conduct of other executives and co-workers.Some of the sources said they feared retaliation for informing McDonald's human resources of potential misconduct.Why It's Important: Easterbrook personally appointed David Fairhust as McDonald's global chief people officer within months of his appointment as CEO, according to WSJ.Fairhust was reportedly quick to introduce changes, including allowing less employee feedback about concerns.Fairhust himself is also alleged to have made inappropriate physical contact with employees during a holiday party where workers were excessively drinking, sources told WSJ.Former managers and employees also told the newspaper hat those who decided not to partake in after-hours social circles were overlooked for advancement opportunities in human resources and other departments.What's Next: McDonald's fired Fairhust with cause after Easterbrook's dismissal. His replacement, Heidi Capozzi, is reviewing policies that Easterbrook and Fairhust put into place, including how McDonald's evaluates employee concerns.&quot;Our board and CEO are committed to leading with integrity,&quot; McDonald's told WSJ in a statement. &quot;We will continue to make changes, where necessary, to support all parts of our organization.&quot;MCD Price Action: McDonald's shares were trading 0.24% higher at $213.16 at last check Wednesday.

2020-08-28,"Up nearly 150% this year, Square (NYSE:SQ) could be due for a pullback at some point soon. Investors should hope that scenario comes to pass because SQ stock is set up for long-term gains.  Click to EnlargeSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com The novel coronavirus pandemic is cementing Square's status as one of the must-own fintech names. That's impressive because, at least in theory, the pandemic could have been on a serious drag on this name. Square's famous smartphone-based card reader and point of sale systems are widely used by small and medium-sized businesses - the types of entities being crimped by the pandemic.The concern is that those business are being battered by the pandemic and that many won't recover rapidly enough to bolster the Square bottom line. Still, the company was able to report a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss. In reality, Covid-19 is creating momentum for Square and these tailwinds will prove durable even after the virus is defeated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to RunSome analysts are concerned that investors are focusing too much on growth in the digital wallet space, where Square is a leader via Cash App and that that growth isn't enough to augment the struggles of the company's small and medium-sized sellers. However, price is truth in financial markets. A sell-side analyst voiced those concerns in early July when SQ was trading around $115. Now it's over $155. Talking Tailwinds for SQ StockAnother cautionary Cash App tale bandied about by analysts is that much of the recent growth in that segments stems from users opting to receive government stimulus benefits in their Cash App accounts. Analysts argue that catalyst will eventually disappear because Covid-19 will become a thing of the past and Uncle Sam will cease sending cash to Americans.That's true, but the sentiment also ignores new growth frontiers Square is forging into. For example, Square Capital is becoming a force in processing payroll protection program (PPP) loans, carving out a niche for itself among smaller loans that big banks often ignore.As of late June, Square Capital facilitated approximately $820 million worth of PPP loans at an average size of $11,000, nearly half of which went to businesses in areas where the average annual household income is less than $50,000. Not only is Square Capital lending to businesses that are underserved or not served at all by traditional banks, it's doing so in more efficient fashion. In the span of six weeks, Square originated the amount of loans it would take a standard bank more than four months to put into motion.Another avenue for growth for Square, though it's still in its nascent stages, is a friendlier version of old-school payday loans - something the company is currently testing in select regions. There are more payday loan outlets in the U.S. than there are McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) restaurants, indicating this unsavory business is big business.Using simple math, a borrower at a traditional payday loan store would repay $230, assuming the loan is paid on time, to borrow $200. Square can knock that down to $210.The company is testing the idea in regions where Cash App is popular, owing to large swaths of users that are &quot;unbanked&quot; - a demographic predatory lenders often prey upon with onerous interest rates. Just Scratching the SurfaceThe aforementioned factors don't include two of the most durable post-pandemic trends relating to Square: the shift to cashless payments and the rise of e-commerce.Remembering that it was just a few years ago that cash was usurped by other forms of payment for the first time, there's a long runway for growth for Cash App and Square's bread and butter point of sale systems.Square is tethered to the rise of online retail because it offers sellers comprehensive solutions, including online stores and virtual terminals, confirming the fintech company has deep reach into the e-commerce ecosystem. That's relevant at a time when online retailers are taking ever larger percentages of business away from brick-and-mortar rivals.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-08-30,"NEW YORK, Aug. 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of McDonald’s Corporation (“McDonald’s” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MCD).   Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at newaction@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.

The fast food chain said in a court filing that the ex-CEO &quot;breached his fiduciary duties of candor and loyalty and fraudulently obtained a termination 'without cause.'&quot;The statement came in a response to a motion by Easterbrook to dismiss the lawsuit McDonald's filed against him. Easterbrook Files To Dismiss: Easterbrook's legal team is arguing that McDonald's could have uncovered evidence of his deceit during its investigation and prior to reaching a settlement. McDonald's acknowledged in early August that it found &quot;indisputable evidence&quot; that Easterbrook was engaged in improper sexual relationships with multiple employees by storing nude and sexually explicit photos.But the company is countering this is no reason to dismiss a lawsuit, even if the photos were located on McDonald's servers.&quot;After discovery, on a full factual record, Easterbrook can attempt to argue that McDonald's should have investigated differently and uncovered his deceit sooner,&quot; the filing said.

2020-09-02,"Fast food joints and restaurant chains feature among the most impacted victims of the pandemic and have seen thousands of job losses. The National Restaurant Association estimates that the restaurant and foodservice industry lost about $120 billion in sales during the first three months of the pandemic.Even as the economies are reopening across the world, dining is still restricted and the demand for home delivery and drive-thru pick-up has increased. Several eateries have now cut their menus to ensure faster delivery.Using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will place Starbucks and McDonald’s alongside each other to see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.Starbucks (SBUX)Coffee giant Starbucks expects business to improve with its stores reopening in the US and elsewhere. As of the end of July, about 97% of company-operated stores and 87% of licensed stores reopened. The company’s fiscal third-quarter (ended June 28) loss was the steepest in over a decade, reflecting the enormous impact of the pandemic.Meanwhile, Starbucks continued to expand even in a highly uncertain environment. It opened 130 net new stores in the fiscal third quarter, ending the period with 32,180 stores, of which 51% were company-operated and the rest were licensed.The fiscal 2020 third-quarter revenue fell 38.1% Y/Y to $4.22 billion. Global comparable sales fell 40% with Americas comps down 41% and international comps down 37%. The company slipped to an adjusted loss per share of $0.46 from an adjusted EPS of $0.78 in fiscal 2019’s third quarter as expenses deleveraged on weak sales.For the fourth quarter, Starbucks expects adjusted EPS in the range of $0.18 to $0.33 compared to the prior guidance of $0.15 to $0.40. Global comps are predicted to decline in the range of 12% to 17% with Americas comps predicted to fall 12% to 17% and International comps anticipated to plunge 10% to 15%.Looking ahead, the company intends to open 300 net new stores in America and at least 500 net new stores in China (Starbucks’ second-largest market) in fiscal 2020. It sees huge prospects for its Starbucks Pickup stores and intends to open over 50 of these over the next one to one and a half years in the domestic market.Meanwhile, options like mobile order & pay, drive-thru, curbside and entryway pick-up are helping in driving improved sales. Almost 90% of third-quarter sales volumes were via drive-thru and mobile order-and-pay.To cater to evolving consumer choices, Starbucks is also adding plant-based choices to its menu through partnerships with Beyond Meat, Impossible and Oatly.On August 25, Stifel analyst Christopher O'Cull upgraded Starbucks to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $90 from $78. The analyst is bullish about comps in the near-term despite headwinds like travel and breakfast declines and is upbeat about initiatives like curbside pickup and new store formats.The analyst stated, &quot;Our upgrade reflects our view the company is taking quick, aggressive steps to navigate these headwinds,&quot; and believes that the initiatives will lead to steady sales recovery in the US and China. (See SBUX stock analysis on TipRanks)A Moderate Buy consensus for Starbucks is based on 10 Buys and 12 Holds. The stock has declined 2.1% so far in 2020 and the 12-month average analyst price target of $84.11 reflects a further downside of 2.3%.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald’s saw its business recover to some extent in the US in the second quarter but international sales were hurt by continued restrictions or lockdowns in several key markets. The leading foodservice retailer operates over 39,000 locations in 119 countries.By the end of the second quarter, almost all of McDonald US restaurants were operating with drive-thru, delivery, and/or take-away options with a limited menu and limited hours. Also, about 2,000 dining rooms reopened with reduced seating capacity by June end. However, rising COVID cases impacted further reopening in June.McDonald’s feels that the second-quarter performance was a trough and the company is adjusting its operations to the new normal.  The second-quarter revenue plummeted 30% Y/Y to $3.76 billion. Same-store sales were down 23.9%, including an 8.7% decline in US comparable sales and a 41.4% decline in International Operated Markets. Adjusted EPS fell 68% to $0.66.However, monthly same-store sales indicated improvement as June comparable sales fell 12.3% compared to a 20.9% decline in May and 39% in April. Breakfast sales continue to be hurt due to disruptions to commuting.Looking ahead, McDonald’s plans to open 400 restaurants this year in China, including 150 added through June. Overall, the company plans to open about 950 gross (350 net new restaurants) this year. It is accelerating store closures in the US, with the plan to shut down 200 locations, half of which are low volume restaurants in Walmart stores.Meanwhile, McDonald's intends to invest an incremental $200 million in marketing across its domestic and International Operated Markets in the second half of 2020 to accelerate recovery. It will continue to focus on what it calls 3Ds – drive-thru, delivery and digital. The company has observed that markets with a higher percentage of drive-thrus are showing quicker recovery. Drive-thrus are present in 95% of McDonald’s locations and accounted for about 90% of the second-quarter sales. (See MCD stock analysis on TipRanks)On August 18, KeyBanc analyst Eric Gonzalez increased the price target for McDonald's stock to $225 from $215 and maintained a Buy rating. The analyst’s Key First Look Data supports accelerating sales trends in the US in recent weeks and he is bullish about McDonald’s innovation pipeline and advertising &quot;war chest.&quot;The Street’s Strong Buy consensus breaks down into 18 Buys and 5 Holds. McDonald’s stock has risen over 7% year-to-date, though an average analyst price target of $215.40 indicates only a modest upside of 1.3% over the next 12 months.Bottom lineAs economies around the world reopen, both McDonald’s and Starbucks are likely to deliver improved numbers. Currently, McDonald’s looks more poised to recover faster. It experienced slightly positive US comparable sales in July. Moreover, McDonald’s is a dividend aristocrat with a dividend yield of 2.3%, which is higher than Starbucks’ yield of 1.9%.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-09-02,"Fast-food giant Mcdonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) faces a new legal battle as more than 50 former Black franchisees allege racial discrimination prevented them from achieving financial success.The Lawsuit Against McDonald's: Fifty-two Black plaintiffs who operated more than 200 McDonald's restaurants allege in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that the company violated federal anti-discrimination laws, according to CNBC. The lawsuit seeks $1 billion in damages. The group alleges that McDonald's pushed Black franchisees toward operating in lower-income neighborhoods that generate lower-than-average sales but have higher security and insurance costs.The franchisees said in the lawsuit that they were given misleading information by McDonald's that persuaded them to accept less desirable locations.In contrast, white operators were treated differently and given access to better markets, according to the lawsuit. Number Of Black McDonald's Franchisees Falls: Black franchise owners were given &quot;little to no say&quot; in deciding where they wanted to open a new store, plaintiffs' attorney Jim Ferraro said on CNBC's &quot;Power Lunch.&quot;McDonald's history of unfair treatment toward Black people dates back to its creation, he said, but it wasn't until 1998 the fast-food chain &quot;acknowledged these problems&quot; publicly.Since 1998, the total number of Black franchise owners fell from 377 to 186 today, Ferraro said. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said this year that McDonald's has likely helped to make more Black people millionaires than any other corporation on the planet. Ferraro said this is a &quot;false statement.&quot;Throughout the company's history, it's had around 600 Black franchisees, and to say it made more millionaires is &quot;patently false,&quot; he said. &quot;Even the Dallas Cowboys alone with the NFL made more Black millionaires than McDonald's.&quot; McDonald's Denies Allegations: McDonald's categorically denies allegations that discrimination prevented franchise owners from succeeding, the company told The Washington Post in a statement. The facts are on McDonald's side, according to the company, which said it will &quot;show how committed we are to diversity and equal opportunity.&quot;The fast food company said it does not have a say in the locations a franchise owner purchases.McDonald's said it doesn't treat Black franchisees any different from other franchisees.&quot;Based upon our review, we disagree with the claims in this lawsuit and we intend to strongly defend against it,&quot; Kempczinski said in a video sent to employees and suppliers.&quot;But I think it's important in moments like this to remind ourselves what we do stand for. And as CEO, that's a tone I intend to continuously set from the top. McDonald's stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. I'm proud of the work we've done as a company to foster entrepreneurship, economic growth and mobility.&quot;MCD Price Action: McDonald's shares were up 1.31% at $215.48 at last check Wednesday.

2020-09-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts’ estimates and projected rising sales, in a sign of greater demand for its cloud-computing services while businesses are working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic.Fiscal first-quarter sales rose 1.6% to $9.37 billion, the Redwood City, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $9.19 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oracle’s revenue had declined 6% year-over-year in the previous three-month period.Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz projected revenue in the current quarter will climb 1% to 3% from a year earlier. Analysts anticipated no sales growth.Catz and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison have tried to revamp Oracle’s business model for a new era of computing, in which software is delivered through the internet rather than shipped in boxes on discs. Thursday’s results show that Oracle’s cloud-based business applications lead the way on modernizing the business, even as demand withers for the company’s older technology.The pair’s latest bet is to try to acquire the U.S. assets of video-sharing platform TikTok, owned by China’s Bytedance Ltd. While the two companies occupy very different parts of the technology market, the deal could give the world’s second-biggest software maker another anchor tenant for its public cloud services that rival Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as provide a huge amount of consumer data Oracle could sell to advertisers for its ad-targeting business, Oracle Data Cloud. Catz declined to comment on the company’s bid during the call.After years of largely going it alone, Oracle has signed more partnerships with other software makers in an effort to make its cloud services more appealing and useful to corporate customers. While it has lost a bid to supply cloud services to the U.S. Defense Department, the company’s partnership with Microsoft, which is also in the running to buy TikTok, means that it could one day supply cloud software to the Pentagon. The 43-year-old software maker has also made its cloud technology work inside of customers’ own server farms, for firms that are unwilling or unable to outsource computing needs. Catz described the company’s results as “fantastic.”“I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past Covid-19,” she said in the statement.Profit, excluding some expenses, will be 98 cents to $1.02 a share in the quarter that ends in November, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 94 cents. The company recorded a profit of 93 cents a share in the quarter that concluded Aug. 31, while analysts were looking for 86 cents.Shares gained more than 3% in extended trading after the results. Earlier, the stock closed at $57.33 in New York, and has jumped 8.2% this year.Revenue from cloud services and license support climbed 2% to $6.95 billion. That metric includes sales from hosting customers’ data in the cloud, but a large portion is generated by maintenance fees for traditional software housed on clients’ corporate servers. Oracle said that McDonald’s Corp. has brought all of its North American financial systems to reside in Oracle’s cloud.Cloud license and on-premise license sales increased 9% to $886 million, suggesting the company is signing more new software deals. Revenue from the company’s accounting and financial-planning application for large businesses climbed 33% last quarter, while sales of NetSuite, which caters more to small- and mid-sized businesses, rose 23%.(Updates with the company’s guidance starting in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Returns to Sales Growth on Greater Cloud Demand

2020-09-12,"In 1997, Ashley Grace suffered a severe accident. Two plates would be inserted into his head and he walked away lucky to be alive.To cope with the pain, Grace relied on opioids -- a dangerous option considering the drugs are riddled with side effects. Also, they're not &quot;abuse-proof,&quot; and often leave patients vulnerable to addiction, overdose and a lower life expectancy. Another option was needed.Grace began using CBD. What began as a way to manage pain ended up having a positive impact on his career. He would join the founding team at Charlotte's Web, build a seven-figure business at Caliper Foods and co-found multiple hemp and CBD-based businesses.Previously, Grace worked on notable campaigns such as &quot;I'm Loving It&quot; for McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD) and &quot;You're Not Yourself When You're Hungry&quot; for Snickers. Now, he uses his expertise to revolutionize the cannabis industry. Benzinga spoke with the marketing pro about how the industry is evolving, what advice he has for lawmakers and the next business he plans to launch:BZ: The &quot;I'm Loving It&quot; and &quot;You're Not Yourself When You're Hungry&quot; campaigns resonate with so many Americans. What will it take for a cannabis brand to achieve that same level of mainstream marketing?A.G.: It's ironic, isn't it? Cannabis, one of the healthiest substances on the planet with no reported overdose fatalities despite widespread use, remains federally illegal and considered evil. On the other hand, diabetes, heart disease and other health issues caused in part by highly processed fast food and snacks, contribute to the deaths of more Americans than just about anything else.Given this situation, no cannabis brand is likely to ever truly achieve the same level of mainstream marketing success as McDonald's and Snickers, simply because of the legal restrictions that will remain associated with cannabis advertising even after hypothetical federal legalization.However, to make strides toward achieving maximum mainstream brand success, there must be a combination of federal legalization, consumer education and time. Within that mix, only the consumer education variable is truly controllable by the industry and should be a key focus area for cannabis brands.Education starts by understanding who your specific target customer is and using that persona to demystify and destigmatize cannabis. With an educational tone and approach, cannabis brands can establish the integrity of trust necessary to form a strong brand foundation.What lessons did you learn from your previous career that you took with you to cannabis?The most important lesson is to have an unwavering focus on the consumer and her emotions. Both the McDonald's and Snickers examples were entirely centered on each brand's target consumer and formed an emotional connection with them.It's so easy for brand marketers to fall into a mode of brand communication that is feature-driven because those are typically placed front and center by the product team. For example, &quot;double strength,&quot; &quot;fast-acting,&quot; &quot;whiter teeth,&quot; &quot;organically grown.&quot; However, consumers don't care about these features--what they care about is how these features make them feel.We in the cannabis industry must invest the time and energy required to know our target customers fully, and only then can we decide how we want to make them feel.What trends do you expect to see unfold in the winter months? How about 2021?There is a fascinating study being conducted by ValidCare and sponsored by Charlotte's Web and several other CBD brands that hopes to dispel U.S. Food and Drug Administration concerns surrounding the idea that CBD causes liver damage. These results could be ready for release in early 2021 and will be quite impactful.Once the ValidCare study is complete and hopefully positively addresses FDA safety concerns, the FDA will have more data making the case that CBD should be authorized as a dietary supplement. From this, we will hopefully see market demand pick back up to where it was in mid-2019.There is also an emerging trend of &quot;fast-acting&quot; cannabis edibles that I believe will continue. Edibles are a key driver of new cannabis category growth. Most seasoned industry veterans are familiar with edibles' challenges--the high takes too long to begin and a consumer might take too many. In response, many in the industry are working on new edible product forms to have a more rapid onset than the typical one hour or more waiting period.What advice do you have for lawmakers in states where CBD is not yet legal? What should they takeaway from your journey and recovery?It's an interesting question, and the best anecdote I can share with lawmakers would be to describe a common encounter that often happens in my life. I'll be somewhere in a casual, nonwork situation talking to someone for the first time, and eventually, the question &quot;what do you do for work?&quot; is presented. If I decide to engage with this person, I'll reply with something like:Did you know that your body makes cannabinoids as part of your Endocannabinoid System (ECS), regulating your immune system, cardiovascular system, central nervous system, etcetera? The ECS, discovered in the 1990s, is also found in many other mammals. In 2003 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services even patented &quot;Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants&quot;. When your body becomes deficient in cannabinoids--which causes different issues for different people--you can add plant-based cannabinoids like THC and CBD to your diet, and good things are likely to happen.Next, they'll ask me how I got into the cannabis industry. I'll reply with a description of my own life, which was dramatically improved after an accident left me with two plates and several screws in my head, and a lifetime of migraines and nerve pain. CBD's benefits are real, and each of us is only one or two degrees of separation from someone who can really benefit from it or even have their life changed by it.What's next for you?I have recently been working on an exciting consulting project here in Colorado, working in a senior executive role to launch a connoisseur cannabis brand and dispensary focused on luxury consumers. We should be open within two weeks, and I can share more then. We also recently acquired a very successful lifestyle-focused cannabis brand that we plan to scale by growing both in Colorado and outside of Colorado via licenses and franchises. An announcement on this acquisition is also imminent. All that to say, I'm very excited about the immediate and long-term future.Courtesy imageSee more from Benzinga  * Amyris Denies 'Patent Infringement' Allegations On Heels Of 1M Lavvan Lawsuit  * Benzinga Cannabis Hour Recap: What You Need To Know About ETFs  * 4Front CEO Discusses Cannabis Market Trends, What's On Deck For 2021(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q2, McDonald's posted an ROCE of -0.1%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on MCDROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows McDonald's is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For McDonald's, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Recap McDonald's reported Q2 earnings per share at $0.66/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $0.74/share.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The growth was driven by “strong average check growth from larger group orders as well as strong performance at the dinner daypart,” the company said in a statement on Thursday.However, comps at International Operated Markets fell 4.4% in 3Q, due to a decline in France, Spain, Germany and the UK, offset by positive comps in Australia.

2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- How easy is it to steal federal funds meant for jobless Americans struggling to survive the Covid-19 economy? It’s this easy: “Using huge databases of stolen personal information, cybercriminals based everywhere from Nigeria to London have pocketed an estimated $8 billion meant for people forced out of work due to the coronavirus so far,” Katy Murphy and Rebecca Rainey wrote in Politico on Monday.That’s probably just the tip of the iceberg. In an August report, the Labor Department’s inspector general said that at least $26 billion of the $260 billion in extra federal support Congress steered toward unemployed workers since last spring will get scooped up by scammers.A major reason worker aid is getting stolen, according to Murphy and Rainey’s reporting, is that state employment agencies charged with distributing the funds locally are running outdated systems that aren’t very good at vetting aid applications. Congress also permitted federal aid applicants to get funds without having to fully verify their identities. Fraudsters around the globe have found it easy to gin up names of phony employers, apply for funding, and make off with their loot before anyone is the wiser. While state agencies have caught some of these criminals, the unprecedented volume of scams has allowed for lots of successful pickpocketing.The Labor Department’s inspector general also pointed out another reason that Congress is at fault: In its well-intentioned rush last spring to provide Covid-19 relief — the most massive federal rescue program of the post-World War II era — federal legislators failed to give states adequate guidance about how to anticipate and combat fraud.As lawmakers and the White House still struggle to get their arms around the scope and scale of another round of much-needed federal relief for workers and their families, plugging holes in the system should be front of mind. A new agreement among Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seems a long way off, but haphazard oversight of huge amounts of federal funding has scarred the effort ever since it was launched.Remember all that Paycheck Protection Program funding that was meant to help small businesses but somehow found its way into the hands of publicly traded companies such as Shake Shack Inc., large operators such as McDonald’s franchisees, sports behemoths such as the Los Angeles Lakers, and insiders in the federal government? How did that happen? Well, the federal apparatus that Mnuchin runs and which doles out the funds hasn’t been minding the store. It’s not much more complicated than that.According to a recent Washington Post analysis of $4 trillion of CARES Act funding — a sum that exceeds the cost of the 18-year-old war in Afghanistan — workers received only about $884 billion, or roughly one-fifth the total amount. Huge piles of money went to affluent Americans or companies that laid off the very workers the federal aid was meant to protect. A full accounting of how $670 billion in PPP funding was allocated hasn’t been completed, but as the Post noted, companies were not “compelled to use it to protect paychecks — and many didn’t.”A Bloomberg News analysis in July noted that the applications for some 4.9 million PPP loans that had been distributed at that point were riddled with perplexing, nonstandardized responses that made it difficult to track how the money was allocated. Jobs numbers associated with at least 20% of the PPP loans were dubious.It’s still not clear to me why the Treasury Department didn’t make direct PPP payments to workers rather than involve business owners, the Small Business Administration and banks as intermediaries. Every extra conduit in the process adds to its complexity and therefore to the possibility of errors or fraud.For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the biggest banks involved in distributing PPP funds to qualified recipients, recently disclosed that it’s investigating whether some of its own employees may have illegally abetted schemes involving the misuse of the funds. In an internal memo, the bank said it has seen “instances of customers misusing Paycheck Protection Program loans, unemployment benefits and other government programs” and that some “employees have fallen short, too.”Clearly, the process for distributing aid needs to be more transparent and have more sophisticated oversight than it’s had so far.At the very least, states need technology upgrades and federal resources to combat fraud. In an August report, the Labor Department’s inspector general recommended that one of the agency’s divisions, the Employment and Training Administration, take four other steps: partner more closely with employers to monitor applicants’ qualifications, provide better oversight, get more accurate estimates of the scale of improper payments, and require states to help detect fraud by providing access to unemployment claims data.These common-sense recommendations will continue to be important if another big round of Covid-19 relief passes. States and the federal government have a responsibility to make sure that expensive Covid-relief programs — funded by taxpayers — are protected.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

2020-10-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This is one of a series of interviews by Bloomberg Opinion columnists on how to solve today’s most pressing policy challenges. This conversation has been edited and condensed. Sarah Green Carmichael: Over the past 40 years, incomes for the top 0.01% have soared and everyone else has really only gotten a modest raise, or none at all. Over that same time, industries have also gotten more concentrated, with a handful of firms now capturing the majority of profits. Your new book is called “When More Is Not Better: Overcoming America’s Obsession with Economic Efficiency.” As someone who majored in economics at Harvard, got an MBA from Harvard Business School, served as a professor of strategy and also was the dean at the Rotman School of Management, what do you see happening here?Roger Martin: In economics, you learn that one of the fundamentals of a developed economy is a big, prosperous middle class. It has the most people and it’s the heart of the economy. And in business, you learn that there’s a whole bunch of competitors, and they all are duking it out in something called an industry. There are some going out of business, because they’re doing badly, and there are some that are doing better than others. And so we’re surprised when we see that the rich are getting richer, richer, richer, richer and richer, like they’ve never gotten before. And those middle-class people are stagnating. And then in industries, we might see the winner take all while other companies are either just hanging on, or are in the process of going out of business. The economy has accidentally produced these very Pareto outcomes rather than having outcomes that are more distributed.SGC: In your book, you say that companies and policy makers have become consumed with the idea that the economy can be “made ever more perfect by pursuing increasing levels of efficiency” —  things like shorter customer call times, fewer retail employees per square foot, the cheapest possible procurement costs, or mergers and corporate consolidation. If an efficient machine is the wrong metaphor for the system that we want, what is a better metaphor for understanding how the system really does work?RM: I think the best metaphor is a complex adaptive system. We’ve set up the economy for Amazon, and we should set it up for the Amazon. Amazon is a big machine, the Amazon is a complex adaptive system.First, it’s a system, so the pieces of the puzzle connect and influence one another. It’s complex in that it’s really hard to tell in advance what exactly affects what. And lastly, and maybe most importantly, it’s adaptive. So whatever state it’s in, it optimizes to that state. Think about the jungle — if there’s a little tree growing behind a big tree, it’s going to grow sideways to get out from the out from the shadow of the big tree. Or if there are predators in this part of the rain forest, you will go scurrying over to that part.So what does that mean? It means that if you’re if you’re a Nobel economist, you can say, “Well, if we increased money supply by 2.8%, we’ll get this much GDP growth.” Chances are, you’re just going to be wrong. Because you don’t actually know what’s going to happen. The other implication is that adaptivity has got every chance of overwhelming whatever you tried. People will say, “Ah, I know how to exploit that. And I’m going to start behaving differently.”So we have all these machinists pulling levers and hoping that things will happen the way they want, but it doesn’t happen the way they want. People just adapt to it and game the system for their own purposes, and that has all contributed to having outcomes that that almost nobody wants.SGC: You express concern for the future of democratic capitalism in the book. At the same time, the middle-class people that you spoke with as part of the research said they were completely politically disengaged. How does someone go from total disengagement to then wielding a pitchfork?RM: Yeah, well, you don’t need many people wielding pitchforks to make a revolution. You just need acquiescence. Or even people just saying, “Well, maybe this is worth a try.” I started this project in 2013, before Bernie Sanders was a national figure. He was a senator, but not really a national figure. And that was before you had 40% of under-25-year-olds thinking socialism would be pretty good.SGC: You argue that we do need to strive to make our system more resilient, “so that over time it can adjust to its changing context in ways that allow it to continue functioning and delivering its desired benefits.” But to get there, I’ve noticed that you don’t prefer a grand solution. You prefer many small solutions instead. Why take that approach?RM: Well, it’s not so much a preference. It’s that I don’t believe that any grand solution would work. And that’s again because it’s a complex system. I think anybody thinking that they have the answer is delusional. And if you take small steps, you can avoid taking a step that’s accidentally horrible.Isn’t that how you live your daily life? You don’t say, “I’m feeling tired, why don’t I sleep for five days?” You say, “I’m gonna go to bed an hour earlier and see if I wake up feeling better.” Because we are a complex adaptive system.SGC:  For a business, this is a very difficult time to resist cost-cutting or become less efficient. The pressures on managers to be more efficient are very real. And it seems like it would be very difficult to resist those pressures.RM: First, I don't say that efficiency is bad. I say the obsessive pursuit of it, with no attention to resilience, is going to kill you. Just keep that in mind that there's a certain amount of resilience that that you need. And if your top line has dropped by half, right, it’s not actually pursuit of efficiency to lay off half your staff. You're no more efficient than you were when your business was 2x, right? That's not increased efficiency. That's just being non-stupid.SGC: What about the public sector? Given all that Congress seems to not be able to get done, how realistic is reform?RM: Politics is an industry, just like any other. It happens to be a duopoly in the U.S. And right now, I would say it is managing for efficiency and not resilience. It’s managing its own business —  the business of politics, not the country. “How can we gerrymander to make sure that we have no elections that matter?” And they’re getting lower and lower ratings from the electorate. They’re asking, “What makes my life efficient?” Not, “What makes this institution resilient for the long run?”If they were worried about [resilience], they’d say there’s certain amount of friction we should put in it. We should not gerrymander, we should actually have real elections so we actually have to compete for votes. It is conceivable to me that it has to kind of crash and burn as an institution before we get to the other side.SGC: When you think about a more resilient, less efficient economy, what does it look like? What does success look like?RM: So it’s not less efficient — I’m just asking for balance. There’s a difference between efficiency and the pursuit of efficiency. Aristotle said that if a person sets out in life to be happy, they’re unlikely to end up happy. But if a person sets out to live a good life — by which he meant a life of servitude to their society and their fellow citizens —  they’re likely to end up happy.I would say the same about shareholder value. Pursuing shareholder value does not increase the probability that you will increase shareholder value. In fact, it makes the job harder. It makes customers say, “Oh, so we don’t matter?” It makes employees say, “So that’s what I roll out of bed every morning to do?” So I would say, the pursuit of efficiency without resilience ends up being kind of self-defeating, and ends up being very short term. You get a burst of what feels like efficiency that becomes inefficient.SGC: Can you give an example?RM: If you’re McDonald’s, you spend a decade or more making your Big Macs a little smaller and a little smaller until “Big Mac” is misleading advertising. But you’re getting more efficient all the way. And then you notice this broader thing happening, which is people not showing up in your restaurants.On the other hand, Costco is grotesquely inefficient. If you think about it in a really narrow sense, they pay everybody more than they would have to pay. The quality of their meats is more than would be necessary to compete with the Kroger’s across the street. But their sales per square foot are five times the competitor across the street. And when’s the last time you’ve seen a Costco ad on TV? Never. Because people are desperate to go to Costco and buy more stuff than they ever thought they were going to.SGC: What’s the bottom line? What are the hallmarks of an economy that would be more resilient, rather than this sort of fragile, ostensibly efficient economy we have now?RM: A resilient one would be able to handle shocks, and would be able to adjust in a more continuous way. A resilient economy would have people saying, “This isn’t really working the way we thought, and it hasn’t blown up yet. But since it’s not working the way we thought, we should tweak it.” That’s what a resilient one would look like — just constantly, continuously tweaking and managing it.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Green Carmichael is an editor with Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-10-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc., parent company of coffee-and-donuts chain Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins, said it’s in talks to be acquired by private equity-backed Inspire Brands.The New York Times reported the talks earlier, saying Inspire will take Dunkin’ private at $106.50 a share, citing two people with knowledge of the negotiations who weren’t identified. The deal -- valued at $8.8 billion -- could be announced as soon as Monday, the newspaper added. The price is a 20% premium over Friday’s closing price, when the company had a market capitalization of $7.3 billion.“Dunkin’ Brands confirms that it has held preliminary discussions to be acquired by Inspire Brands,” Karen Raskopf, a Dunkin’ spokeswoman, said in a statement, declining to offer further details and cautioned that there’s is no certainty an agreement will be reached.Shares of Dunkin’ Brands have more than doubled since March on investor optimism that its mobile ordering app and loyalty program boosted sales during the pandemic. The Canton, Massachusetts-based company dropped the word “Donuts” from its name in 2018, signaling its broadened focus on beverages. The stock traded at 34 times earnings, lower than the median multiple of 37 for the industry, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. The number of coffee shops in the U.S. is shrinking for the first time in nine years as sales plunge and Covid-19 forces the industry to rethink its business. While that’s helped Dunkin’ and other coffee-serving chains such as Starbucks Corp. and even McDonald’s Corp. gain ground at the expense of independent outlets, it’s not enough keep all its stores operating.Say Goodbye to Your Local Coffee Shop in America’s Cafe ShakeupThe U.S. will have 25,307 outlets specializing in coffee or tea at the end of 2020, down 7.3% from a year earlier in the first decline since 2011, according to estimates by research firm Euromonitor International. Annual sales are expected to plunge 12% to $24.7 billion.Dunkin’ said in July it expects to close about 800 U.S. locations permanently this year as part of a “real estate portfolio rationalization.” Comparable-store sales have been improving in July, Dunkin’ said, but they remain in the “low-single digits” for stores of both key brands at the time.Inspire Brands, the owner of Buffalo Wild Wings and Jimmy John’s, is backed by the Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital. In April, Roark made a $200 million investment in Cheesecake Factory Inc.In 2005, Dunkin’ Brands was sold by Pernod Ricard to a group of buyers including Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Thomas H.

2020-11-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Even with its biggest weekly setback since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in March, a small group of technology-related stocks remain well up for the year, as evidenced by the 70% gain in the NYSE FANG+ Index. This select group of 10 companies consists of such household names as Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and the parent of Google (hence “FANG”).  The broader market isn’t doing as well, with the S&P 500 Index up only around 1% for the year and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index down some 11%.Sure, there are plenty of reasons for the explosion in these stocks. The companies are forecast to have huge earnings in future years, which when discounted back to the present at today’s low interest rates results in large numbers that many believe justify the lofty stock prices. The risk-free 10-year Treasury note yields about 0.85%, and with that as the discounting rate, $1 in earnings 10 years out is worth 92 cents today, almost 50% more than the 61 cents if that discounting rate were 5%. The same concept is imbedded in substituting earnings yields, which is the inverse of sky-high price-to-earnings ratios. For the S&P 500 Index as a whole, the 3.8 earnings yield looks much cheaper in relation to Treasury security yields rates than its 26 P/E ratio.FANG mavens also note that these businesses are relatively independent of the basic economy, which looks to drop well into 2021 as the pandemic intensifies and spreads. In fact, these companies benefit as people work from home, order goods online, play computer games and watch movies. Then there is the TINA argument -- There Is No Alternative – with bond yields so low. I’ve never understood why investors buy stocks for appreciation but assume there is none in bonds. But as Treasury 30-year bond yields dropped from 14.6% in 1981 to a recent 1.64%, the resulting price appreciation was the key reason that total return for Treasury bonds have beaten the S&P 500’s total return by 5.5 times since the early 1980s.If I’m correct in forecasting a prolonged, deep recession with escalating global deflationary pressures, the 30-year Treasury yield could easily return to the 0.98% low on March 9, representing a 19% total return over one year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 could drop 30% to 40% as disappointing earnings combine with plummeting P/E ratios.Read More: Deflationary Trends Are Growing More PowerfulMost important, investors’ focus on a small group of tech companies implies trouble ahead for all equities. That clearly was the case with the Nifty Fifty stocks that riveted investors’ attention in the 1960s and early 1970s. These equities represented rapidly-growing companies, some based on solid long-term growth prospects, while others were simply fads. Overconfidence became so extreme they were labeled “one decision” stocks. They had so much promise that investors only needed to make one decision—to buy them—since they would never need to be sold.Nevertheless, disappointments began to multiply and the favored few shrank to motor homes (Winnebago), hamburger chains (McDonald’s), amusement parks (Disney) and gimmick cameras (Polaroid). They represented the limbs and outward flourishes of the economy, not the basic guts. By shunning the rest, investors should have anticipated big trouble. The 1973-1975 recession resulted in what was then the deepest since the 1930s, and what was left of the Nifty Fifty collapsed. Panicked investors lopped a zero off of Polaroid’s stock price, as it fell from $140 to $14.Then there was the dot-com equity dominance that preceded the tech collapse in 2000, the bank stock bonanza that peaked in 2006 and energy stocks that plunged along with crude oil prices after leaping to a new high share of the S&P 500 in 2008.Read more: Stock Traders Are In Need of a History LessonAnother sign of equity investor discrimination in favor of tech stocks is their rejection of steady dividend payers, even though low interest rates should make attractive these 65 companies that have at least 25-year records of paying and increasing dividends. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index yield of 2.7% tops the S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.7% and is more than triple the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Nevertheless, investors have yanked more than $40 billion from dividend-focused mutual funds this year following their $3 billion withdrawal in the same period of 2019. That index is down 4.47% year-to-date.As the many examples of earlier speculations show, investors’ flights of fancy ultimately collapse, leaving many poorer investors gnashing their teeth. Nevertheless, speculative periods often last for longer and go much further than rational analysis suggests. That’s because they have left the realm of reality for the land of zeal, hope and imagination that has no logical limits.Speculations require a continual influx of true believers that move stock prices from the basis of reality to the stratosphere of hope. They end when the pool of new entrants is exhausted, often due to a shock of reality. Washington’s zeal to curb the power of certain tech companies may be that shock.

Revenue of $5.418 billion beat consensus estimates of $5.345 billion, while EPS of $2.22 compared favorably to the Street's estimate of $1.92.McDonald's noted during its conference call that U.S. comps for October were higher by a mid-single-digit and represent a ""notable slowdown"" from September's low-double-digit growth, Rutherford said.This was expected, and investors may see further ""choppiness"" in results going forward amid growing COVID-19 infection rates and restrictions worldwide.Related Link: McDonald's CEO Talks Plant-Based BurgerRaymond James On New McDonald's Growth Strategy In conjunction with McDonald's third-quarter report, the fast food company laid out a new growth strategy dubbed ""Accelerating the Arches,"" Vaccaro said in a note.The main takeaways are:  * Evolving and maximizing a marketing strategy.  * Improving core menu items like chicken sandwiches and McNugget flavor extensions.  * A new ""MyMcDonald's"" digital experience that includes a loyalty program and increased personalization.  * Testing new strategies to speed up the drive-thru and digital orders.Cowen's 3 Key Takeaways On McDonald's McDonald's served investors a ""compelling"" playbook to support U.S. comp growth in 2021 and beyond, Charles said in a note. There is reason to believe that sustained U.S. sales growth can offset increases in capital expenditures and G&A expenses, the analyst said. He named three takeaways from the strategy:  * Celebrity tie-ins to attract Gen Z customers will continue, with a new partnership expected to launch by the end of 2020 and another in early 2021.  * McDonald's 2019 acquisition of artificial intelligence speech recognition company Apprente will play a role in 2021. Specifically, the use of an AI drive-thru ordering system could help with faster throughput and potentially drive higher sales through selling opportunities.  * McDonald's is looking at its global business to see where it can improve the U.S. business. For example, burger enhancement learnings from Canada and Australia or chicken sandwich launches in the Netherlands and Germany can be applied to future U.S. menu changes.KeyBanc: Investing For Long-Term Gains While McDonald's initiatives will likely limit any free cash flow growth in the near-term, it will sustain a longer-term competitive advantage, Gonzalez said in a note.McDonald's likely recognizes that a constant level of investment is required to stay ahead of the competition, the analyst said. McDonald's is expected to leverage the popularity of its ""Famous Orders"" marketing campaign with new initiatives, he said.The next celebrity collaboration is likely to come before the end of 2020 and may focus on a family bundle, Gonzalez said. A new Crispy Chicken Sandwich should come out toward the end of the first quarter of 2021 or in the early second quarter, the analyst said.

2020-11-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors took a bite out of Beyond Meat Inc.’s share price on Tuesday after a wild ride the day before amid confusion over its involvement with McDonald’s Corp.’s plans to develop a ""McPlant"" meatless burger. Those fuzzy plans weren't the only thing weighing on shares, though. On Monday evening, Beyond Meat reported sales growth that was well below analysts’ expectations, a shift it blamed in part on the oddities of Covid-19-era consumer behavior. In particular, executives said America’s freezers were full, making it harder for its lineup of plant-based meat alternatives to get on the shopping list. The stock plunged 15%. The early days of the pandemic prompted a highly unusual wave of panic-buying; since then, investors have focused on how the consumer staples industry is recovering from and grappling with stockpiling. Less discussed is the companion behavior, destocking, in which consumers work through their stashes. The situation at Beyond Meat suggests this aftermath of pantry-loading also has the potential to create meaningful volatility and disruption for these companies, adding to their already-long list of challenges.Beyond Meat said third-quarter sales at its retail division were up 39% from a year earlier, a far slower pace of growth than the 192% increase it recorded in this segment in the quarter ended in June. Sales growth was held back by aggressive promotions aimed at getting more shoppers to try their product, and intense competition likely also played a role. Meanwhile, revenue from its food-services unit slumped as restaurants remained challenged. But executives also emphasized that a major component of the slowdown was the secondary effect of the initial wave of pantry-loading.Other consumer staples companies have noted such a pattern. Back in July, Colgate-Palmolive Co. said it saw softness in many categories in its European business because of this behavior. J.M. Smucker Co. said that pantry destocking affected its latest quarterly sales of dog food. That makes sense. After all, it’s not like dogs went out to restaurants before the pandemic, so it stands to reason people wouldn’t be working through those stashes especially quickly. It’s a similar story in the feminine-care aisle. After a major spike in sales in this category in the beginning of the pandemic, data show sales cooled dramatically for a while, as women presumably used up the products they grabbed in a panic in March.  Beyond Meat’s downside surprise – and the reasons behind it – may be a foretaste of how choppy things could be for all sorts of consumer staples makers in the coming months. Just as the pendulum swung from stockpiling in the spring to destocking in certain categories in the latest quarter, it may soon swing right back again to stockpiling.The U.S. is recording a fresh increase in Covid-19 cases, raising the specter of another period of stay-at-home orders. More generalized fears about the pandemic potentially worsening in the winter – and colliding with flu season – could also spur people to prepare to be more strictly hunkered down. That has led to chatter about a potential second wave of stockpiling. Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart Inc., said in October that his company was starting to see “stock-up behavior” again in certain local markets as Covid-19 cases rise. Kroger Co. is putting limits on how many packages of toilet paper customers can buy per trip, an effort that appears aimed at avoiding empty shelves should the stockpiling mind-set take hold again.Shoppers’ unpredictable behavior will make it extremely difficult for newcomers like Beyond Meat as well as stalwart retailers and packaged food giants to deliver steady sales results in the near future.  Beyond Meat’s wild ride may just be the beginning.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-11-10,"Plant-based food maker Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ: BYND) reported third-quarter earnings that notably fell short of expectations and sparked a debate among analysts.The Analysts: CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram maintains a Sell rating on Beyond Meat's stock with a price target lowered from $100 to $80.Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery upgraded Beyond Meat from Neutral to Overweight with a price target lowered from $178 to $144.BofA Securities analyst Bryan Spillane maintains an Underperform rating on Beyond Meat with an $81 price target.A Quarter To Forget: Beyond Meat reported one of those quarters the company ""will want to forget"" as an EPS loss of 31 cents fell ""well short"" of the consensus estimate of five cents and sales missed estimates by 29%, Sundaram wrote in a note.The poor results were a result of retail demand moderating while foodservice and sales to restaurants have yet to recover. Expectations for the fourth quarter could be a repeat of the third quarter as COVID-19 cases continue to rise and competition is ""fiercer.""View more earnings on BYNDRelated Link: McDonald's CEO Talks Plant-Based Burger'Attractive' Opportunity: Beyond Meat's stock sell-off creates an ""attractive"" opportunity for an early leader in a market estimated to grow to $6 billion to $8 billion by 2025, Lavery wrote in the note. Most notably, Beyond Meat faces a big opportunity as a co-creator of McDonald's Corp's (NYSE: MCD) new plant-based lineup.Beyond will benefit financially even if McDonald's chooses not to include the company in any future branding, the analyst wrote. Specifically, Beyond faces a $100 million opportunity in the U.S. and at least $150 million in global markets.Beyond's third-quarter report was impacted by the timing of retail shipment and continued pressure in the restaurant and foodservice category. However, investors should be buyers of the dip as it creates a more favorable risk to reward profile.Unfavorable Positioning: Beyond Meat is ""planting seeds"" to support long-term growth although new initiatives and partnerships in the foodservice and restaurant category remain uncertain, Spillane wrote in a note. Some of the areas of focus include promotions in the retail and foodservice channels, new product launches like Beyond Meat 3.0 and financial gains from the McPlant product with McDonald's.Despite a longer-term opportunity, Beyond's near-term exposure to the foodservice sector (51% of 2019 sales) and a premium valuation at 12 times 2021 EV/Sales suggests the stock will underperform other food and beverage peers.BYND Price Action: Shares of Beyond Meat were trading lower by around 20% at $120.76.Latest Ratings for BYND  DateFirmActionFromTo  Nov 2020CFRAMaintainsSell  Nov 2020Canaccord GenuityMaintainsHold  Nov 2020Piper SandlerUpgradesNeutralOverweight    View More Analyst Ratings for BYND   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Pizza Hut First National Chain To Offer Plant-Based Topping  * Beyond Meat Rebounds Sharply After Saying It's Working With McDonald's(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-10,"(Bloomberg) -- A deal with McDonald’s Corp. was supposed to be the crowning achievement for fake-meat makers. But one day after Beyond Meat Inc. confirmed it has worked with the world’s largest restaurant chain on its new McPlant line, investors aren’t happy.The maker of plant-based burgers plunged the most in five months after a confusing announcement that was light on details. McDonald’s initial reveal on Monday didn’t mention Beyond Meat’s participation at all, leading observers to believe that McDonald’s was developing its own substitute meat product. This sent Beyond Meat shares tumbling. Beyond Meat later confirmed its involvement and shares recovered -- at least until its earnings report.Beyond Meat investors had hoped to get more clarity on the relationship during the faux-meat maker’s earning call Monday afternoon. But Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown was stingy with additional details, only saying that Beyond Meat’s role in the McDonald’s development was probably left out of the fast-food chain’s investor day since it was trying to stay on message.“It’s really up to them to say the extent of that, where it’s going to be, how it’s going to be there,” Brown said. “But everything that I’ve been doing and our research team has been doing is marching toward a particular outcome with them and I feel good about that.”Beyond Meat didn’t immediately provide more details. McDonald’s has declined to comment further on the McPlant line or its suppliers.By declining to disclose financial details -- or any specifics at all about the collaboration -- Beyond Meat’s investors have been left to wonder whether the McDonald’s deal will lead to a lucrative ongoing revenue stream, or if Beyond had just helped the fast-food chain create a direct competitor to its signature product.Jefferies analyst Rob Dickerson said the lack of detail around the McPlant announcement, paired with the quarterly miss, “raised a number of questions around BYND’s near-term revenue growth and profitability prospects into 2021.” Even though the potential tie-up offers upside potential, “we simply don’t know what the timing will be or the profitability of the product,” he wrote in a note.‘Coy Approach’Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus said investors may be confused, but ultimately it’s good news for Beyond Meat.“It seems the market is unsure why McDonald’s took a coy approach with naming their partner for the McPlant,” she said. “Regardless of the details, the big takeaway is that a broader MCD partnership is a good thing for Beyond Meat.”Compounding the challenges, Beyond Meat reported disappointing earnings after the close of trading Monday. Beyond Meat revealed a surprise loss for the third quarter and missed even the lowest analyst estimate for revenue.The mix of confusion and disappointment drove Beyond Meat’s shares down as much as 25% Tuesday in New York, the biggest intraday slide in about five months. The stock had nearly doubled in value this year through Monday.Secret RecipeInvestors don’t even know what’s in the burger. Beyond’s classic recipe is primarily pea protein, though McDonald’s hasn’t clarified whether it’s using the same ingredients or a different mix of protein and spices. McDonald’s International President Ian Borden said Monday the burger would be “crafted exclusively for McDonald’s by McDonald’s,” suggesting it won’t be the same exact Beyond Burger currently available in grocers.If it does use the same peas, or pulses, as Beyond Meat’s version, there’s at least one clear winner this week from the confusing announcement: the farmers who grow the crop.“We are obviously thrilled to have McDonald’s finally join the family of plant-based meat alternatives. They are certainly following a very strong trend,” Tim McGreevy, CEO of the USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council and the American Pulse Association, said in a phone interview Monday. Having a company with McDonald’s global reach means this is a “big day for all of the farmers who produce pulse crops.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Beyond’s New McDonald’s Deal Leaves More Questions Than Answers

2020-11-11,"McDonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) is a business where consumers walk into a location and exchange money for food or beverages. By every definition, this makes it a restaurant.But digging behind the numbers makes the case that McDonald's is more of a real estate company than a fast-food chain, according to the popular YouTube channel The Food Theorists.The History: McDonald's generates more money from royalty revenue and rent payments from franchisees than it does from actually selling food to customers, according to The Food Theorists. To explain this concept, the video reviews McDonald's early history.Ray Krock teamed up with the founders of McDonald's to expand the chain across the U.S. in the 1950s.While Krock was successful in expanding McDonald's presence, Harry Sonneborn is credited with convincing the McDonald's team to switch their strategy. This conversation was featured in the 2016 film ""The Founder.""Sonneborn argued that McDonald's shouldn't be in the burger business, and rather said it needs to be in the real estate business. It's difficult to build an empire by taking a 1.4% royalty fee on a 15-cent hamburger. Instead, the view was that McDonald's should own the land where each burger is cooked.The franchising model evolved to consist of a franchisee paying an upfront fee to McDonald's, but under one important condition: the franchisee must operate out of a building McDonald's owns on land it also owns -- and pay rent. This is in addition to regular royalty payments.See Also: Making Sense Of McDonald's Q3 ResultsFact-Checking McDonald's Q3 Results: McDonald's reported third-quarter results that provide an opportunity to put the numbers to the test in 2020.Approximately 7% of all McDonald's stores are company-owned and operated. This means that the remaining 93% of stores pay some form of rent and royalty to the corporate office.According to the third-quarter report, the revenue generated through food sales at company-operated restaurants was $2.2864 billion, while revenue from franchised restaurants were $3.0448 billion.So there we have it. McDonald's generates more revenue from sitting back and collecting rent checks and royalty payments than it does by selling food at its own corporate-owned locations.Photo by Bryan Hong via Wikimedia.

2020-11-12,"The ongoing economic recovery has been defined by a K-shape. During this unprecedented crisis, only a few industries have been hit harder and are seeing more uneven rebounds than the restaurant industry. Big fast-food service chains have fared well with many of these stocks trading at record highs. Meanwhile, local restaurants faced a brutal reality that forced many to close as COVID infections and government restrictions, weigh heavily on the industry.On Monday, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Beyond Meat (NYSE: BYND) third quarter earnings reports reflected diverging fortunes that are present across the restaurant landscape.Beyond Meat On Tuesday, shares of Beyond Meat plunged more than 16% after the company reported revenue grew just 2.7% compared to the same quarter last year. CEO Ethan Brown said these results reflected a full brunt and unpredictability of the pandemic. The biggest hit to Beyond Meat came from its restaurant customers. As for the U.S. segment, although the retail channel skyrocketed 40.5%, foodservice sales dropped 11.1% compared to last year.Internationally, foodservice revenues dropped 65% whereas sales at retail locations merely increased by 26.7%. Bars, pubs, local restaurants and smaller regional chains, movie theaters and many more businesses that were among the worst hit by the pandemic make up as much as two-thirds of Beyond's foodservice sales.Sales across the industry to these customers fell 37.5% in the quarter whereas Beyond's sales were down 34.7% in the third quarter. The paradox is that while these figures show that Beyond is gaining share, its main customer base is getting crushed by the pandemic.But, Beyond Meat knows its success depends on getting its product out there as much as possible. It has partnered with McDonald's on a McPlant burger venture, with some analysts already estimating the expansion of this partnership could bring in $300 million annually to Beyond. Also on Tuesday, Beyond Meat announced a new deal with Yum Brands-owned Pizza Hut (NYSE: YUM) which involves its Beyond Sausage toppings which will be offered both the U.S. and U.K.McDonald's Unlike Beyond, the fast-food giant's earnings topped estimates as they were fueled by U.S. sales recovery. McDonald's delivered fiscal third-quarter net income of $1.76 billion, or $2.35 per share. This an increase from last year's comparable quarter when net income amounted to $1.61 billion, or $2.11 per share. Revenue edged 2% down to $5.42 billion, yet beating expectations of $5.4 billion. Digital sales accounted for 20% of overall revenue.Although international comps fell 4.4% in the third quarter, they grew during each month of the quarter at McDonald's U.S. locations while recording low double-digit sales growth in September. CFO Kevin Ozan stated September was the best month for U.S. comps in almost a decade.  What a contrast compared to Beyond's international foodservice decline that expanded to 65% in the third quarter, after an already bad decline of 56.5% in the second quarter. Moreover, McDonalds will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 3% to $1.29 per share.Outlook Last week, the October jobs report showed employment at food and drinking service businesses is still more than 2 million jobs lower than back in February when all this mess began. Moreover, a deeper look within this segment shows the unequal impacts of the pandemic.Although analysts at JPMorgan found there was no meaningful data that explains why the third quarter was so weak for Beyond Meat, the truth is that many small businesses simply do not have the means to compete with global giants like McDonald's in a pandemic-shaped reality that is present across the globe. This week's example of McDonalds and Beyond Meat simply outlined how cruel reality can be if you are on the ""losing"" side.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-11-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. warehouse workers in Alabama filed a petition with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board to form a union, the latest sign of strife between the online retailer and its large blue-collar workforce.The federal agency posted a notice dated Friday for a hearing to determine if the petition meets the criteria to advance to the next step. With enough support, it’ll proceed to a vote among those working at the warehouse outside Birmingham on whether to unionize and be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The recently opened facility in Bessemer employs about 1,500 people.The Covid-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the plight of so-called essential workers, including those in Amazon’s logistics and delivery operations, whose labor helped many people reduce their exposure by having goods delivered to their homes.Some Amazon warehouse workers in Europe are union members, but most of the company’s U.S. workforce isn’t unionized. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $181.9 billion while many of Amazon’s workers earn so little that they receive government subsidies for food and health care, putting the online giant in the company of other big employers like Walmart Inc., McDonald’s Corp. and Waffle House Inc. Union members in the transportation and warehousing industry earned about 38% more than non-members in 2019, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.“Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our overall pay, benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union declined to comment. News of the union petition was reported earlier by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a frequent Amazon critic, tweeted support for the workers seeking a union.“All workers are entitled to decent wages and working conditions, which is why I stand with the Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama exercising their constitutional right to form a union,” Sanders said. “Mr. Bezos, the wealthiest person in America, must not interfere in this election.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Warehouse Workers in Alabama Petition to Form a Union

2020-11-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Having watched warily from the wings, McDonald’s Corp. is finally entering the modern meatless-market with a menu of herbivorous items. Top of the list is the plant-based burger, McPlant:“There are other plant-based burgers out there, but the McPlant delivers our iconic taste in a sink-your-teeth-in (and wipe-your-mouth) kind of sandwich. It’s made with a juicy, plant-based patty and served on a warm, sesame seed bun with all the classic toppings.”Although McPlant is a notable pivot for a company that grinds through a billion pounds of American beef each year, McDonald’s is being a soupçon coy: The “other plant-based burgers” to which they allude include Burger King’s Impossible Whopper, Wendy’s The Plantiful, White Castle’s Impossible Sliders, and Carl’s Jr. Beyond Burger — as well as groundbreaking consumer products from Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, and Kellogg’s Incogmeato.Because 89% of meatless-burger consumers are neither vegetarian nor vegan, and because the plant-based meat market may soon be worth $35.4 billion, faux-meat firms seem less keen on promoting plants than blurring the plant/meat divide. This explains their use of beet powder, annatto and heme to simulate the ooze of blood, and the carnivorous tone of their branding.It’s surely no accident that McPlant retains its corporate prefix, that Beyond Meat and Incogmeato deploy a muscular suffix and that Impossible Foods toys with a knowing oxymoron. These modern plant-based brands are a world away from the earnest worthiness of meatless 1.0 — Quorn, Linda McCartney’s, Turtle Island Foods — a trick they pull off with all the techniques of “dazzle.”*  *  *In 1917, in response to the increasing threat from German submarines, the British artist Norman Wilkinson pioneered a counterintuitive form of marine camouflage(1) that he called “dazzle painting.”Recognizing that, even before radar, massive ships could never be rendered invisible, Wilkinson proposed making them harder for U-boats to identify, size, track and target.“So-called invisibility against submarine attack [he wrote] is not only impossible, but dangerous, and consequently if a vessel can be seen at all, it does not matter how visible she is, providing her course remains a matter of question for the attacker.”Wilkinson fostered enemy uncertainty by painting crazy monochrome zigzags and stripes across every inch of hull, deck and funnel until some 4,000 British and American vessels resembled bizarre aquatic zebras.The tactical twist of Wilkinson’s dazzle was to ensure that what cannot be concealed should confuse:“The primary object of this scheme was not so much to cause the enemy to miss his shot when actually in firing position … but to mislead him, when the ship was first sighted, as to the correct position to take up.”Naturally, such ingenious misdirection is readily applicable to branding.*  *  *Some of the most conspicuous “dazzle” proliferates with “hedonic” brands — those where pleasure-seeking consumers must be persuaded that “bad” is “good”:That “good” is “bad”:Or that “bad” is “bad” — but, hey, what the hell:Modern meatless burgers operate in the intersection of all three dazzles: They are simultaneously meaty (“bad” but delicious), vegetarian (“good” but boring) and a fast-food treat (“naughty but nice”)(2). This dazzling triad also distracts from the complex question of whether meatless burgers are as good for one’s wallet, health or the environment as might be hoped.Inevitably, hedonistic dazzle is used by a range of adult brands, not least Las Vegas’s hugely successful “What happens here, stays here” campaign — which slyly encouraged the sins of Sin City, even as it elided the wages of sin.*  *  *Many brands, most notably in the auto sector, hide behind bait-and-switch safety disclaimers that dangle the rush of danger while evading its results. Given that 1.35 million people died on the roads in 2018 (including 36,835 Americans), the deployment of “dazzle tags” like “Professional driver on a closed course” and “Demonstration only, do not attempt” seems more akin to using Freddy Krueger to sell kitchen knives than offering a satisfactory deterrent to vehicular mayhem.Indeed, it’s probably no coincidence that health-related “dazzle tags” often achieve the opposite of their purported aim. In 2017, research by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that snack foods labelled as “vitamin-fortified” confused consumers into making “poor dietary decisions.” And in 2014, research from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health indicated that alcohol “responsibility messages” (“drink responsibly,” “enjoy in moderation”) were “overwhelmingly used to promote products rather than convey relevant public health information.”One of the oddest “danger dazzles” was that attempted by Death Cigarettes, a short-lived ’90s venture that trumped the “distraction dazzle” of Big Tobacco (cool camels, rugged cowboys, cut silk) with tombstone packs adorned with a skull and crossbones. While traditional cigarette brands attempt to subvert popular culture, Death Cigarettes set up shop where the unstoppable force of addiction meets the immovable object of death. This is not hiding in plain sight, so much as hiding in the spotlight — and as Rochefoucauld said, “neither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily.”(3)The impact of such blatant dazzle is similar to the optical effect of Anish Kapoor’s deeply pigmented “Void” sculptures, which draw in one’s gaze while defocusing one’s vision. Kapoor defined the illusion thus:“You can see it with your eyes. Then you can’t see it. Yet you know it. You know it with your body. Your imagination senses it.”*  *  *Just as dazzle painting helped warships to conceal their size, so dazzle branding helps underdogs bark above their bite. There are numerous examples of such shape-shifting strategies, including Volkswagen’s 1959 “Think small” slogan, which neatly mocked the muscle car, and Apple’s 1997 “Think different” campaign, which strove to mainstream the marginalized:“Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes … the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.”Such campaigns echo the actions of those animals that change their size and shape in order to deter predators and attract mates — two goals shared by brands of every dimension.One of advertising’s longest underdog dazzles was that deployed by Avis between 1962 and 2012. Unable to conceal its ranking, Avis sought instead to confuse the idea that “biggest is best”:Significantly, Avis was not defending its second place status but attacking the market leader for being number one and, by extension, for complacence and slapdashery. So effective was this insurgency that the alpha-brand Hertz felt compelled to respond — the advertising equivalent of forcing a U-boat to surface.An elegant variation on the underdog dazzle was successfully launched in 2000 by the British Teacher Training Agency. Facing the challenge of luring high-caliber candidates into classrooms, they confronted the sneering cliché “Those who can, do; those who can’t, teach” with a splendidly contrarian campaign, “Those who can, teach.”One of Britain’s best-loved adverts arose from a similar desire to upend accepted wisdom. In 1983, unable to conceal that its telephone directory was used primarily for “the nasty things in life, like a blocked drain,” Yellow Pages ran an advert that was deeply human, sentimental and above all nice.Brands that strongly divide consumer sentiment occasionally use dazzle to negate opprobrium or laugh it off. Marmite’s response to 33% of Brits loathing its yeast-extract spread was not to hug the haters but double down on the hate. In so doing it created the instantly viral campaign, “Marmite: You either love it or hate it.”Similarly, certain fans of the British football club Millwall revel in their unpopularity with the defiant chant “No one likes us we don’t care” (sung to the tune of Rod Stewart’s “Sailing”) which, over time, has evolved into a sub-brand of its own:*  *  *For obvious reasons, dazzle is a finely honed tool of political communication — as the BBC’s Yes Minister elegantly satirized:Sir Humphrey: As long as we can head him off this Open Government nonsense.  Bernard: But I thought we were calling the White Paper “Open Government”?Sir Humphrey: Yes, well, always dispose of the difficult bit in the title. It does less harm there than in the text. Sir Arnold: It’s the law of inverse relevance. The less you intend to do about something, the more you have to keep talking about it.This chimes with the Fox News slogan “Fair and Balanced,” which was devised by Roger Ailes when he launched the network in 1996. As Gabriel Sherman wrote in 2017, when the slogan was retired:“In the annals of modern advertising, ‘Fair & Balanced’ will be considered a classic. The slogan was Ailes’s cynical genius at its most successful. While liberals mocked the tagline, it allowed Ailes to give viewers the appearance of both sides being heard, when in fact he made sure producers staged segments so that the conservative viewpoint always won.”Brands regularly turn to dazzle when they find themselves edging toward the wrong side of history.It is often claimed that Alfred Nobel established his eponymous prizes after reading his own damning obituary (“The merchant of death is dead”) which was erroneously published after his brother’s demise. Whether or not this legend is true, the legacy dazzle worked: How many more people associate the name Nobel with literature, science and peace than with the invention of dynamite?In 2004, Unilever hired Wolff Olins to transform its impersonal, industrial and Twin Towers-ish identity into something more sensitive, playful and environmentally beguiling:The result — with its casual script, dazzling sparkles and 24 cute icons — is more akin to a fossil agglomeration than the branding of a global behemoth that emits 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And this exculpatory effect was surely the point.Similarly, the “green rush” of airlines using carbon offsets to sell “net-zero carbon flights” may be less ecological, than a tactical response to “flygskam” — the Swedish “flight shaming” trend that has taken wing. The dazzle of consumer carbon offsetting was deftly skewered by Camilla Cavendish:“EasyJet, in pledging to offset the emissions from its flights for what will be less than £1 a ticket, is effectively offering a ‘get out of hell free’ card. Passengers can tick the ‘offset’ box and continue on their merry way, unaware that the offer prices carbon dioxide well below its trading value. … Carbon offsetting is shaping up to be the greatest mis-selling scandal since the Dominican friar Johann Tetzel sold pardons to redeem the dead.”In 2000, Landor helped British Petroleum transition from a “part of the problem” “big oil” giant to a “part of the solution” “leading energy company.” It did so by dumping the company’s 70-year-old shield for a “helios” sunburst, next to which the lower-case, superscript “bp” name is almost an afterthought.This (literally) dazzling redesign stumbled in 2010, when BP’s drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded, killing 11 and disgorging 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It’s likely nothing could have limited the damage to BP’s brand after such a disaster, but the chasm between the environmental ostentation of BP’s sunburst and the bleak reality of oil exploration added insult to injury, as evinced by the logo-redesign competition Greenpeace launched:(Greenpeace is itself arguably something of a dazzle brand. Although the organization espouses non-violence, given its advocacy of dramatic and sometimes damaging direct action, Greenpeace may be green but it is far from entirely pacific.)Of course, there are limits to what even dazzle can achieve. The story of Monsanto’s brand can be told in three logos:*  *  *It’s a pleasing coincidence that capitalism’s ultimate dazzle brand dazzles literally as well as metaphorically — so much so that almost everything consumers know and feel about diamonds was concocted by De Beers and its roster of advertising talent. As Edward Jay Epstein detailed in his legendary 1982 essay and book:“The diamond invention — the creation of the idea that diamonds are rare and valuable, and are essential signs of esteem — is a relatively recent development in the history of the diamond trade.”Although the disco-ball of diamond’s dazzle is multifaceted, a few examples from Epstein and others will suffice:The “salary rule” that an engagement ring should cost one month’s salary was devised in the 1930s to draw the middle-class into diamond ownership; in the 1980s the rate mysteriously rose to two month’s salary, or three in Japan.The image of men surprising women with a diamond was insinuated into Hollywood movies both to associate diamonds with romantic love, and because men spend more on jewels when shopping alone.The “eternity ring” was devised not as a celebration of everlasting love, but to create a new market for a vast cache of miniature Russian diamonds.In addition to emphasizing the emotional resonance of diamonds, the slogan “A diamond is forever” helped discourage women from selling their jewels and thereby discovering that diamonds may not be the appreciating investment they believed.*  *  *In February, Burger King trumpeted the removal of artificial additives from its sandwiches with an advertisement that depicted a Whopper slowly rotting over 34 time-lapsed days:This unsettling film (more Peter Greenaway than Bobby Flay) proved as contentious as Burger King’s global CMO Fernando Machado clearly intended:“I don’t have the media money to throw something at people that’s not going to stand out or get noticed. In this case specifically, we were expecting some controversy and debate.”Machado also alluded to the power of dazzle:“The essence of the idea is to show something that you know, in theory, is bad — mold — but it’s shown in such a beautiful, stunning way and you’re talking about it as a positive. … It almost messes with your mind. You know mold isn’t good, but it looks so beautiful!”Burger King’s spot was unarguably a hit, but what actually “messes with your mind” is the advert’s slight of brand.While eliminating unnecessary additives is admirable, it’s hardly the defining challenge of fast food compared, say, with its role in obesity, diabetes, addiction, academic performance, depression and social inequality.Like an arms dealer singing the praises of a gun’s silencer, the “moldy” Whopper’s real success may be diverting our gaze from the uncomfortable nutritional truth that even an Impossible Whopper with unsalted medium fries delivers 1,010 calories, 50 grams of fat, 13 grams of saturated fat, 1,440 milligrams of sodium and 13 grams of sugar.Kander and Ebb were right:Give ’em the old razzle dazzleRazzle Dazzle ’emGive ’em an act with lots of flash in itAnd the reaction will be passionateGive ’em the old hocus pocusBead and feather ’emHow can they see with sequins in their eyes?(1) Although Wilkinson was decisive in the military application of dazzle, the idea of disruptive camouflage owes much to the work of the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer and the Scottish zoologist John Graham Kerr — both of whom draw the origins of “dazzle” back to the animal kingdom.(2) “Naughty but nice” was a National Dairy Council campaign to promote fresh cream cakes (!) in the 1970s and ’80s; the slogan was devised by none other than Salman Rushdie.(3) Le soleil ni la mort ne se peuvent regarder fixement” in the original French.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Ben Schott is a Bloomberg Opinion visual columnist.

2020-12-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Wendy’s Co. has struck a deal with India’s Rebel Foods to open about 250 so-called cloud kitchens across the country, one of the most ambitious efforts yet to serve customers through delivery rather than the traditional fast-food stores as the industry adapts to the coronavirus pandemic.The U.S. company is experimenting with a new format as the Covid-19 outbreak makes many consumers unwilling or unable to visit traditional stores. Cloud kitchens, which derive their name from cloud computing, are remote facilities without seating or cashiers that prepare food exclusively for delivery.Wendy’s, with nine brick-and-mortar outlets in India, said it believes its cloud kitchen alliance is the largest yet in the industry. Rebel Foods, backed by Sequoia Capital and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is the world’s largest cloud-kitchen operator with more than 300 locations.“India is one of our high-growth, high-potential markets,” Abigail Pringle, Wendy’s chief development officer, speaking via video conference from the chain’s headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. “I don’t know of any other global brand that has announced this kind of significant multiyear, multi-unit commitment.”As lockdowns and social distancing disrupt their business models, fast-food chains are experimenting with a variety of ways to adapt. With deliveries surging, many recognize their existing stores aren’t the optimal way to meet demand and have turned to cloud kitchens, also known as ghost or dark kitchens. Chains like Chili’s, Applebee’s and Chipotle have already set up their own delivery-centric virtual locations.Wendy’s push in India appears to be the largest cloud-kitchen outsourcing deal announced yet, based on the number of locations. Leading startups such as CloudKitchens and Virtual Kitchen, which work with a range of brands in the U.S. and abroad, have fewer than 100 sites. One fast-food operator in Thailand said it plans to open 100 cloud kitchens within five years.Wendy’s, with 6,800 restaurants in 30 markets worldwide, followed rival burger chains like McDonald’s Corp. into India, opening its first restaurant in New Delhi in 2015. It plans about 150 physical stores over the next decade, in addition to the cloud kitchen push. Sierra Nevada Restaurants, the chain’s franchise partner, will help with both initiatives.“India is one of the most under-penetrated markets on earth” for quick-serve restaurants, said Jasper Reid, managing director of Sierra Nevada.Wendy’s, once known for its “Where’s the beef?” tagline, has particular challenges in India, where the majority of citizens worship cows as sacred. Its local menu items include chicken chili, masala fries and the best-selling 69-rupee ($0.93) bun tikki, a spicy potato cutlet served between two burger buns.Rebel Foods, co-founded by former McKinsey & Co. alum Jaydeep Barman and his INSEAD business school classmate Kallol Banerjee, helped pioneer the cloud kitchen concept. The duo operate their own restaurant brands and are expanding into outsourcing for chains like Wendy’s. With money from Uber Technologies Inc. co-founder Travis Kalanick, along with Sequoia and Goldman, the company has grown to hundreds of kitchens across countries including India, Indonesia and the U.K.Leveraging the fixed costs of tightly packed, centralized kitchens, it serves far-flung customers who have no idea where their food is prepared. With space-saving, stacked kitchens located in low-cost sites like industrial complexes or side alleys, its model helps side-step the costs of running traditional restaurants with seating and wait staff.The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of food delivery around the world. In the U.S., deliveries now account for more than 5.5% of Wendy’s overall business, while they’ve reached 11% in Canada.“For generations, brands building a national presence relied solely on a brick-and-mortar strategy and made significant investments over decades,” said Banerjee on a video conference call. Cloud kitchens are aimed at helping chains expand “at far lower levels of capital.”(Updates with partner comment in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Wendy’s to Open 250 Cloud Kitchens in India as Virus Hits

2020-12-04,"Whatever your approach to the markets, whether you adopt fundamental analysis, technical analysis or some other methodology, everyone who participates is always looking for an edge to determine which are the best stocks to buy for December. Historically, this has led to some unusual tactics. Among them, the Santa Claus rally is one of the strangest, yet it’s also discussed in the mainstream.
Recently, CNBC issued a report suggesting that the “large gains in November may steal from December’s rally.” And there’s a good reason for caution, with the S&P 500 up more than 11% at the time of the write-up’s publication. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, “If it’s up more than 10%, it will only be the third time since World War II that November has been up that much.”
Of course, nobody wants to hold the bag, even with names that are considered the best stocks to buy for December. Therefore, the Santa Claus rally may not be as robust this year. But what exactly is this phenomenon?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Generally speaking, the Santa Claus rally is the supposed tendency of equities to rise during the last week of the year up through the early sessions of the new year. For our purposes, I will take the traditional definition: the profit (or loss) of a particular index or security from the session after Christmas through the second trading day of the following year.
Utilizing this framework for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the phenomenon may have some valid basis. However, you may be surprised to learn that the Santa Claus rally has been more profitable in decades past. As the market entered the modern era, average returns have declined. Additionally, in the last decade, buying the Santa rally has resulted in slight losses. So, does this mean this methodology is ineffective for finding the best stocks to buy?

Here’s my take on it – I wouldn’t buy something just because of the Santa Claus rally. More importantly, individual stocks respond differently to this phenomenon than benchmark indices. Still, the rally is an intriguing concept. Here are some of the best stocks to buy for December on this fascinating holiday trend.

On a last note before we get into it, you’ll notice that all the names above have a market history that extends at least 20 years. That’s by design so that we’re working with large data sets. Also, I’m going to stick closely with the Santa rally trend. Before you dive into these best stocks to buy, make sure to understand the full context behind the issuing companies.

McDonald’s (MCD)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto
	
At first glance, McDonald’s doesn’t scream at you as one of the best stocks to buy for December 2020, not with the novel coronavirus pandemic raging uncontrollably. However, you would be surprised at how much people are addicted to fast food. Every time I swing past a Mickey D’s, I see lines of cars waiting in the drive-thru lanes. It’s remarkable and it’s great news for MCD stock longer term.
As for how it responds in the last week of the year, it’s somewhat of a mixed bag. Since the 1960s, MCD stock averages a return of 0.75% utilizing the Santa Claus rally method. That’s not bad considering that McDonald’s is a blue-chip mainstay. Plus, we’re only talking about a period that extends less than two weeks.
However, it’s also interesting that McDonald’s shares waver from one decade to the next: there are never any consecutive positive or negative decades under Santa’s framework. Therefore, since last decade was in the red, it implies – if the pattern holds – that this decade should see more upside than down.

Disney (DIS)

Another blue-chip stalwart that has negative implications because of the coronavirus pandemic, Disney could use some love. Unlike McDonald’s, though, the underlying business of DIS stock isn’t visibly encouraging. According to media reports, the Magic Kingdom will increase the number of planned layoffs to 32,000 employees. That’s a staggering figure that ordinarily wouldn’t make Disney one of the best stocks to buy.
However, what does Saint Nicholas have to say about DIS stock? Remarkably, Disney is one of the most consistently strong Santa rally plays among blue chips, averaging 1.4% since the 1960s. Actually, this trend may not be that remarkable. When you think about Christmas and the winter holidays, Disney represents a key brand. Thus, there might be some quantifiable logic to this phenomenon after all!


					7 Stocks to Sell for December				

To be fair, the last decade’s rally under the St. Nick methodology was limited, averaging only 0.58%. However, DIS has a tendency of bouncing strongly following a lackluster decade.

IBM (IBM)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto

	
Let’s face reality – IBM has seen better days. While one of the best stocks to buy in decades past, “Big Blue” encountered severe challenges as the nature of technology rapidly changed. However, you can’t keep a big alpha dog like IBM stock down forever. Forging ahead in a sector dominated by cloud computing and machine learning, this tech stalwart is surprisingly relevant.
Further, one of the legacies that it presently enjoys is that it remains one of the best stocks to buy for the Santa Claus rally. Since the 1960s, IBM stock averages 0.49% when you buy and sell around the last week of the year. That was still the case last decade, when it eked out an average of 0.42% despite it being a difficult one.
But what does the future hold for Big Blue moving forward? Personally, I think stakeholders can be encouraged as IBM dives into relevant businesses such as artificial intelligence and deep learning.

Merck & Co. (MRK)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto

	
Big pharmaceutical companies have encountered an interesting year in 2020. Take for example Merck & Co. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. MRK stock benefitted from its cancer treatment portfolio, backed by flagship drugs such as Keytruda. Then, the coronavirus made a rude interruption. Suddenly, very few people wanted to be in healthcare facilities anymore, hurting the narrative for Merck and its ilk.
However, when it comes to St. Nick’s rally, investors should be encouraged that Merck shares qualities similar to McDonald’s. Basically, decade-by-decade, MRK stock features an up-down motion. But on the upswing, the profits can be powerful. Over its lifetime, Merck averages 0.5% gains when deploying the target methodology.


					7 of the Best Cheap Stocks for December				

Interestingly, the last decade got stuffed with coal from the jolly old fat man. And because Santa has multiple preexisting conditions, I’m not entire sure if this year will feature a ramp-up for MRK stock. However, moving past the coronavirus disruption, Merck should turn out to be one of the best stocks to buy for the long haul.

Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto

	
Amazon needs no explanation. This is one of the best stocks to buy, period. It’s not just that AMZN stock is levered to the e-commerce revolution. Rather, the underlying company is the ultimate disrupter, changing the rules for whatever game it wants to play. Of course, this doesn’t endear the brand to small businesses. But like some Fox News pundits might say, it’s nothing personal, it’s just capitalism.
And oh, what a capitalist Amazon is! Even when you consider its role as a Santa Claus play, AMZN stock absolutely trounces the competition. In its relatively young lifetime, Amazon averages 2.3% utilizing this methodology. Still, you might notice that the trend by decade is declining sharply. Should current prospective buyers be worried?
As I mentioned earlier, you shouldn’t buy any company simply based on one metric. Certainly, you wouldn’t do it on a calendar phenomenon like this. However, AMZN could bounce back sharply this decade due to the surge in demand for contactless services.

Target (TGT)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto

	
If you want best stocks to buy with proven resilience, you may want to check out Target. As Amazon and other e-commerce platforms began encroaching on the very idea of physical retailers, Target’s business came under scrutiny. However, the company has responded with new business initiatives such as groceries and most importantly, ship-from-store deliveries.
Historically, then, TGT stock offers Santa Claus rally performances that are biased toward prior decades before e-commerce began spreading at scale. Over its lifetime, shares average 1.63%, backed by outstanding figures during the 1990s and 2000s decades. However, last decade, the St. Nick rally produced a measly 0.08% — not worth the time to even consider the methodology.


					7 Growth Stocks Flying Under the Radar				

Nevertheless, TGT stock has performed very well during the pandemic, up 36% year-to-date at time of writing. Once the pandemic fades, its one-stop-shop business should represent a strong catalyst. As well, I’ve personally found its ship-from-store business to be quick and reliable.

Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto

	
As you know, electric vehicles have been all the rage this year. Perhaps you’ve even made the transition yourself. Given the pandemic’s disruption to the global auto supply chain, EVs offer a sizable measure of insulation. But it’s hard to figure out which EV companies offer the best stocks to buy. Therefore, investors may want to check out Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile instead.
Because of its underlying lithium mining business, SQM stock offers plenty of potential. Thus, I wouldn’t get hung up on the declining trend of its Santa Claus rally. Yes, on average, shares have a lifetime performance gain of 2.17%, which actually makes it one of the best stocks to buy on this phenomenon alone. Last decade, however, the performance dipped to a paltry 0.36%.
But EVs have become mainstream and many more people are likely to make the transition. Further, electric infrastructure will improve, making the transition considerably easier. So, you can probably buy SQM stock with confidence.

Ford (F)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto

	
For me, Ford is one of the intriguing ideas for best stocks to buy based on the Santa Claus rally. During its heyday, the iconic American automotive giant was emblematic of our nation’s manufacturing prowess. However, foreign competition combined with internal missteps contributed to making F stock a shaky investment.
But if you were to buy shares based on St. Nick’s methodology, you’d generally leave with a smile on your face. Since the 1970s, F stock generated average returns of 0.81% on the rally – that’s really good considering its blue-chip nature. And I would also characterize last decade’s performance of 0.51% as solid.


					7 of the Best Warren Buffett Value Stocks				

Looking beyond the horizon, I’m bullish on Ford as the automaker makes its transition toward EVs. In my opinion, its Mustang Mach-E is gorgeous, taking design cues from contemporary luxury SUVs. More importantly, Ford offers the scale to present a true challenge to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Intel (INTC)
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto

	
Out of the best stocks to buy on this list, Intel is probably the most speculative. That’s because the chipmaker has suffered from a comedy of errors. Of course, this is no laughing matter if you’re a stakeholder of INTC stock. Further, it’s alarming the number of times management has led this premium brand down the wrong path.
On average, though, INTC stock doesn’t look terrible under the Santa Claus rally’s framework. Lifetime, shares are looking at an upside performance of 0.55%. However, this would ignore the fact that INTC dipped 1% in the previous decade. This includes five consecutive Santa rally failures between 2014 through 2018.
But is that the final word on Intel? While the mistakes have been horribly embarrassing, I believe Intel could have similar traits to IBM: you can’t keep down a dominant player for too long. If you don’t mind some turbulence, INTC may offer contrarian upside.
On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in F stock.

2020-12-08,"As 2020 comes to an end, there is finally hope 2021 will be a better year from a health and safety perspective. Tens of millions of Americans could receive a vaccine against the novel coronavirus soon, with hundreds of millions expected to follow suit over the coming months.Many are now cautiously optimistic that a successful vaccine rollout can usher in some sort of return to normal. This would mean that restaurants, one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, can safely operate indoor and outdoor dining with fewer restrictions.Investors looking to buy restaurant stocks tied to a potential economic reopening have several options. The following is a list of some of the restaurant stocks highlighted by three pros as benefiting from a very supportive environment over the coming months.Bloomin' Brands BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik recently upgraded Outback Steakhouse's parent company Bloomin' Brands Inc (NASDAQ: BLMN) from Market Perform to Outperform in mid-November, with a price target lifted from $17 to $22.According to the analyst's calculations, the Bloomin' portfolio of brands can generate margin upside even if domestic dine-in unit volume comes in 5% below 2019 levels.The company has a path to additional upside potential as small independent restaurants continue to shut their doors, leaving hungry customers with fewer restaurant options, the analyst said. What makes Bloomin' stock noteworthy is the firm's estimates actually implies the company falls short of management's own targets. Specifically, upside potential for the stock exists if operating margins come in at 6.4% versus management's own 7% internal target, according to BMO. McDonald's Iconic fast-food giant McDonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) may have been better positioned than rival quick service restaurants during the pandemic.The company was active in improving its drive-thru and delivery business before the start of 2020.But heading into 2021, McDonald's remains a restaurant stock to own, Pete Najarian said on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" Nov. 16. McDonald's is getting ""bigger and bigger and bigger"" in the digital universe and this will prove to be a winning strategy, he said. Investors should be open to the reality that a full return to ""normal"" may take years. Until then, consumers may still prioritize digital ordering, which is considered a much safer option.Starbucks Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) has certainly seen traffic fall in the morning, as many repeat customers are still working from home. But what makes the stock a standout ahead of the vaccine rollout is how it remained fresh in everyone's minds.Most notably, the coffee chain generated such a ""degree of urgency"" during its annual ""Red Cup Day"" on Nov. 6, according to data analytics company Placer.ai.In fact, the chain saw a ""massive"" boost in foot traffic to the point where it was its third-most trafficked day in recent memory, behind Black Friday 2019 and Dec. 26, 2019.The coffee chain may have not missed a step in adapting to consumers evolving wants and needs. There is plenty of reason to believe that as millions of people potentially return to their offices, their morning routine of picking up Starbucks will continue as before.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Gene Munster On What DoorDash, Airbnb IPOs Mean For FAANG Stocks  * Cramer On Cruise Stocks: 'The Robinhood People Were Right'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. job ads are everywhere. Plastered on city buses, displayed on career web sites, slotted between songs on classic rock stations. They promise a quick start, $15 an hour and health insurance. In recent weeks, America’s second-largest employer has rolled out videos featuring happy package handlers wearing masks, a pandemic-era twist on its annual holiday season hiring spree.Amazon’s object is to persuade potential recruits that there’s no better place to work.The reality is less rosy. Many Amazon warehouse employees struggle to pay the bills, and more than 4,000 employees are on food stamps in nine states studied by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Only Walmart, McDonald’s and two dollar-store chains have more workers requiring such assistance, according to the report, which said 70% of recipients work full-time. As Amazon opens U.S. warehouses at the rate of about one a day, it’s transforming the logistics industry from a career destination with the promise of middle-class wages into entry-level work that’s just a notch above being a burger flipper or convenience store cashier. Union workers who make comfortable livelihoods driving delivery trucks and packing boxes consider Amazon an existential threat. While labor tensions have simmered for years, the stakes have risen sharply amid the pandemic, which prompted Amazon to hire more than 250,000 people to keep up with surging demand from home-bound shoppers. Risking infection while toiling in a crowded warehouse for $15 an hour has many Amazon workers asking if they’re getting shortchanged.A Bloomberg analysis of government labor statistics reveals that in community after community where Amazon sets up shop, warehouse wages tend to fall.  In 68 counties where Amazon has opened one of its largest facilities, average industry compensation slips by more than 6% during the facility’s first two years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In many cases, Amazon quickly becomes the largest logistics player in these counties, so its size and lower pay likely pull down the average. Among economists, there’s a debate about whether the company is creating a kind of monopsony, where there’s only one buyer—or in this case one employer.While Amazon’s arrival coincides with rising pay in some southern and low-wage precincts, the opposite is true in wealthier parts of the country, including the northeast and Midwest. Six years ago, before the company opened a giant fulfillment center in Robbinsville, New Jersey, warehouse workers made $24 an hour on average, according to BLS data. Last year the average hourly wage slipped to $17.50.Wages often tick higher in subsequent years, but don’t reach their pre-Amazon level till five years after a new facility opens—meaning that industry workers, on average, find themselves no better off half a decade after Amazon’s arrival.“Bloomberg's conclusion is false—it violates over 50 years of economic thought, and suspends the law of supply and demand,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Hiring more, by paying less, simply does not work. Many of our employees join Amazon from other jobs in retail which tend to be predominantly part-time, reduced benefit jobs with substantially less than our $15 minimum wage. These employees see a big increase in pay per hour, total take-home pay, and overall benefits versus their previous jobs. What surprises us is that we are the focus of a story like this when some of the country’s largest employers, including the largest retailer, have yet to join us in raising the minimum wage to $15.”Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, whose wealth grew about 65% this year as his company posted record sales and profits, has so far managed to keep unions out of his U.S. operations. Now that’s being challenged. In November, representatives of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union quietly filed paperwork with the National Labor Relations Board, proposing to form a union on behalf of 1,500 workers at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, fulfillment center. On Wednesday, the NLRB gave workers the greenlight to put the proposal to a vote, which promises to be the biggest referendum to date on the retail giant’s fraught relationship with its frontline workers.“The concern isn’t so much ‘the robots are coming, and they’re going to put everybody out of work,’” says Ben Zipperer, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. “It’s more that the jobs being created by extremely profitable companies have either poor pay or poor working conditions, or are not the kind of jobs that you would expect an extremely rich country, and rich company, to be able to provide.”Breaking down pallets or hauling cartons of lettuce is hardly the stuff of American business mythology. Warehouses, featureless rectangles located in exurbs and commercial districts, are far from the plant-filled orbs and office perks of Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. But for many Americans, the logistics industry has long provided a path into the middle class, particularly for those who didn’t attend college.Warehouses have typically paid less than factories but more than retailers. These haven’t been highly skilled jobs, but do require a certain level of ability—whether managing inventory or driving a forklift without damaging goods and hurting anyone. As recently as the early aughts, municipal officials in southern California looking to replace vanishing aerospace manufacturing jobs settled on the logistics industry, believing it would give lower-skilled workers the opportunity to move up. Since then, industry wages have come under pressure amid a push to carry less inventory and to subcontract work to lower-cost middlemen. But logistics really started to change with the rapid acceleration of e-commerce. And no company has done more to reshape how products are warehoused, packed and shipped than Amazon, with its strong focus on customer service.Shipping orders directly to consumers from an inventory of millions of products required redesigning not just the physical buildings but the jobs of the people working inside. After 20 years of trial and error, Amazon has turned its fulfillment centers into finely tuned assembly lines, often grueling workplaces that have been the subject of frequent media reports over the years, including investigations probing injury rates and pay practices. Most of the labor in Amazon’s largest fulfillment centers is divided into simple, repetitive tasks: receiving goods arriving in trucks, placing items into mesh shelving, or retrieving and speeding them along a conveyor belt in yellow plastic bins to be boxed and shipped. Most jobs are marketed to high-school graduates—no resume required, start as soon as next week—who spend 10-hour shifts standing at a single station, cogs in a giant machine built for speed and efficiency. Workers receive about one day of training and are put on the line to see if they have what it takes.Matt Giannini, who spent five years at a warehouse in New Jersey, says Amazon’s genius lies in simplifying most tasks to the point but where anybody can do it. “They’ve gotten it to such a science,” he says. “Every single process is very simple.” But job satisfaction can be elusive when most workers are interchangeable cogs. Quality of life in the warehouse, Giannini says, often breaks along a very simple divide: people who spend their days standing by a computer terminal that tracks their every move, and those with less scrutiny and more freedom.Bloomberg interviewed 42 employees in 20 states. Some enjoy the work and say news reports of workplace travails can be overblown. Many joined to get health insurance, a rare perk for entry-level jobs, and came to Amazon from lower-wage employment in retail or logistics. But most say there’s little opportunity to move up in a highly automated environment where a handful of people per shift oversee an entire facility. One worker in the Midwest was hoping to rise quickly because he had previous management experience. “It’s the greatest company in the world right now,” he recalls thinking. “I’m going to be able to get in there and move up.” Three years later he’s still at the entry level, picking items.Amazon touts a training program for promising workers and says it issued more than 35,000 promotions in its logistics operation this year. Ron Delosreyes, who joined Amazon in 2018, says the first step up added responsibility and no raise. But today he’s a salaried supervisor at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse.  “I’d like to stay and keep advancing my career,” he says. “Up and up.”While 35,000 promotions sounds like a lot, it represents 3.5% of the more than 1 million people who worked in Amazon’s logistics group this year. That’s well below the 9% promotion rate for the industry, as calculated by the payroll processing firm ADP. Many Amazon workers quit or are fired for safety and productivity infractions within a year or two of starting—a high rate of turnover even in an industry where people change jobs frequently. Studies have shown worker churn rises when Amazon moves to town. And workers say the company does little to encourage long tenure.The relative few who do last more than a year or two often struggle economically.Courtenay Brown was hired at an Amazon grocery distribution hub in Avenel, New Jersey, three years ago. For several months after joining Amazon, she and her sister, who also works there, were homeless, bouncing from one motel to another while trying to save a deposit for an apartment. They found places they could afford, but landlords denied their applications because they didn't make enough, she says. With motel rooms eating up about $600 a week, the sisters missed meals and slurped down free coffee and cocoa at work. Eventually, a charity paid their first month’s rent and security to get them established in their current apartment. Brown, 30, was excited to have a washing machine to rid her clothes of the cigarette smell that often permeated the motels.About half of her take-home pay covers her share of the rent. The balance mostly covers food, utilities and the cost of commuting, which includes frequent $50 Uber rides when she has to work late and misses the final van shuttle home. Brown pays about $200 a month for the van shuttle. She usually arrives at work at 5:30 am and works until close to 6 pm. She spends her vacation time doing errands or resting at home in her pajamas because she can’t afford to go anywhere.Brown finally got the promotion she’d been hoping for in the fall and a $2 hourly raise, but it will last only through the holiday season while she helps train new workers and open facilities. She’ll find out in January if she goes back to her old job and previous pay rate of about $17 per hour or if Amazon has a permanent promotion for her.“Me and my sister, the last thing we want to do is lose our job because we’ll go back to being homeless and having nothing,” says Brown, who joined community groups advocating for Amazon workers despite colleagues’ warnings she could be fired for speaking out.  “We’re in a tough situation, and this is all we can find that's stable. Amazon comes to places when people are desperate.” Similar jobs at unionized logistics companies typically pay twice as much—enough for workers to pay the bills and save. Joey Alvarado, 42, makes almost $30 an hour moving boxes filled with pet food, shampoo, canned goods and other items sold by Stater Bros. Markets, a southern California supermarket chain. His wife stays home with their three children, and the family eats out twice a week, has a boat called Penny Lane and a travel trailer. They vacation on Lake Havasu and the Colorado River. They’re buying a 2,000-square-foot home on half an acre about 30 minutes from the San Bernardino warehouse where he works. Down the street is an Amazon warehouse where people earn far less. “I don't see how a big company like Amazon can be so greedy,” he says. “The CEO is already a billionaire. What does he want to be a trillionaire? It’s just greed.""Alvarado belongs to the Teamsters Local 63, which he sees as the difference between what he is paid and what Amazon workers are paid.  He has been on the job 19 years and plans to remain. He doesn’t pay any premiums for medical benefits for himself and his family members and has a pension. “This job, you bust your butt, but you get paid,” he says. “No one leaves. You’d be stupid to leave.”Jeff Fretz, 49, was working part time for United Parcel Service Inc. and attending community college to pursue a career in law enforcement. A full-time UPS truck driving job opened up, and he picked that over becoming a cop. Now he spends his days maneuvering trailers around a UPS warehouse in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania, and looks forward to retiring and moving south in seven or eight years with a Teamster’s pension. The job gave him a stable income and good life. He owns a home in Easton and took vacations with his wife and son in Cape May.Fretz gets disgusted hearing about working conditions at Amazon because UPS pays its workers so much more and is still a profitable company. “A human body is not a machine,” he says. “I can't do now what I did when I was 25. Working in a union shop protects you for a career.”Now the unions fear that Amazon will do to the delivery business what it did with warehousing. The number of Americans employed as delivery drivers and couriers, outside of U.S. Postal Service work, has surged by 22% in the last two years, driven partly by the expansion of Amazon’s nationwide network of contract delivery firms and partly by the advent of new grocery delivery services. Wages in the industry fell last year by half a percentage point, the biggest decline in more than 20 years, according to BLS data.Amazon, which has long sought to reduce its dependence on UPS, Federal Express and the U.S. Postal Service, now ships most of its own customer orders. Many of those deliveries are handled by Amazon’s network of delivery service partners, contract firms that work exclusively for Amazon and lease the trademark blue delivery vans. Driver salaries average $16 an hour, according to recruiting sites, a couple bucks an hour less than the national average for frontline delivery service workers, and roughly half the pay package of an experienced UPS driver.  Amazon also borrowed the gig-economy tactics pioneered by Uber with Flex, a service that relies on people making deliveries in their own vehicles. The idea was to boost delivery capacity without having to buy thousands of vehicles and hire people. Drivers download the Amazon Flex app and can accept assignments that typically pay about $50 for three hours. Once they factor in the cost of a vehicle and fuel, drivers say, the pay is closer to minimum wage.UPS started a similar service for seasonal work a year after Amazon. But the drivers are employees, get 57 cents per mile, a $5 daily smartphone stipend and belong to the Teamsters union. One driver says he can easily earn $1,800 a month working part time, about 80% more than he ever made doing Flex routes. He can also count on regular work rather than competing against other Flex drivers, who spend hours watching their phones in the hopes of getting work that sometimes never materializes. The seasonal UPS job is a step up for Amazon Flex drivers. UPS’s full-time drivers see it as a step down, depriving them of overtime and potentially undermining their wages.They have reason to be worried. Amazon’s growth in the logistics industry is undermining union clout. Union membership in transportation and warehousing dropped to 16.1% in 2019 from 21.3% a decade earlier, by far the biggest decline of any industry, according to BLS data. The slide was driven by the rapid growth of non-union jobs at places like Amazon, not a loss of union work.Now, the RWDSU, an activist unit of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, is campaigning to organize the Alabama facility, which opened in March. A website for the union drive says employees are seeking safer working conditions and protections from arbitrary dismissal, among other things. “I thought Amazon was more like a Google,” one employee says in a video posted to the site. “The bigger the company, the more benefits, the more loyalty to the worker. But nah, it didn’t go like that.”Now that the federal labor regulator has approved the union’s proposal, a vote is likely some time next year.  For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Has Turned a Middle-Class Warehouse Career Into a McJob

2020-12-18,"Who doesn’t like stocks with dividends? As investors, we love companies that generate consistent and above-average returns for us over the long term. When we’re talking about dividend stocks to own, aristocrats are some of the best businesses on earth. A dividend aristocrat is a stock described as raising its dividend for 25 consecutive years. 
Keep in mind, that’s not only paying the dividend for the last quarter century, but raising that payout each year during that period. Income-oriented investors are looking for two things: dependability and yield. 
While it’s nice to have an above-average yield, reliability of that yield is often more important for investors. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The best part about these types of dividend stocks is that the companies tend to be quite good as well. Any sort of investor can benefit from the long-term exposure to this group, simply because they are high-quality holdings. Income investors may consider over-allocating toward these types of stocks, while growth investors may consider diversifying with them. 


					7 Growth Stocks You Don't Want to Sleep On				

Let’s look at seven dividend stocks to own now: 


Walmart (NYSE:WMT)
Clorox (NYSE:CLX)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)
Realty Income (NYSE:O)
Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT)
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)


Dividend Stocks to Own: Walmart (WMT)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
	
I want to kick off this list of dividend stocks to own with Walmart. The retailer has proven a number of things to investors over the years and in 2020, least of which is its commitment to the dividend. 
Walmart has not only paid but has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years. However, it’s the strides that Walmart is taking outside of the dividend that have my attention. 
For instance, business continues to hum along whether the country or the world is in a recession. Whether that’s the great financial crisis in 2008 or a pandemic-induced recession. In the latter, it’s clear that regulators consider Walmart an essential operation, which is also important from an investment perspective. 
The efforts the company has made to increase its online and omni-channel presence also shouldn’t be ignored. Walmart is essentially solidifying its importance in retail for decades to come. 

Clorox (CLX)
Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com
	
The biggest issue with Clorox? Its growth and valuation. Obviously a pandemic is going to dial up demand for Clorox’s products. However, when that growth dies down, will the stock — which is up 32.5% in the past year — go down with it? 
To an extent, it already has. 
Clorox stock peaked near $239 on Aug. 5 and has struggled since, down 15.5%. Shares are about flat for the month of December, but should it finish lower, it will mark the stock’s fifth straight monthly decline. 
I’m not saying that to discourage investors. Instead, I’m highlighting the opportunity in Clorox. With its 2.2% dividend yield and more than four decades of rising dividends, this is a safe cash-flow entity.

In a recession or in an economic boom, there will be demand for Clorox. Further, even though there is a vaccine on the way for the coronavirus, companies and consumers alike will continue to keep things sanitary. That bodes well for Clorox, although it does have other brands. Some of them include: Kingsford charcoal, Glad garbage bags, Brita filters, Hidden Valley dressing, Fresh Step kitty litter and others. 

AT&T (T)

There is a lot of controversy surrounding AT&T because of its debt situation. However, this belongs on the list of dividend stocks to own. 
With a current yield of 6.7%, this company shouldn’t not be overlooked by income-oriented investors. While the debt load may give some investors pause, let’s consider its other financials for a moment. 
Over the past decade, AT&T has turned to M&A to fuel its growth. Some of those acquisitions, like DirecTV, came at the pivoting point of cutting the cord. Thus they have been a drain on the company’s financials and a poor use of leverage. 
However, other acquisitions, like TimeWarner, were perfectly timed. This has given AT&T a cash-flow heavy asset that is benefiting from a rise in digital entertainment and streaming video via its HBO property. 
Because of the enormous boost in free cash flow, AT&T has been able to lower its free cash flow payout ratio from more than 100% down to the 60% range. At the same time, management is looking to shed its underperforming assets to cut down debt and improve its financial footing. 

McDonald’s (MCD)
Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com
	
The dividend from the Golden Arches is as dependable as finding a McDonald’s on a road trip. 
In all seriousness though, McDonald’s continues to deliver with its consistency. Because of its dependable business for consumers — which is affordable, attainable food at virtually any hour of the day, all over the world — its business has become dependable for investors. 
While the company works on longer term ways to improve its margins, there remains growth in the short term. In 2021, analysts expect revenue to rebound 13.7% and for earnings to jump 34%. 
Admittedly, that comes after a slump in 2020, as increased costs and temporary store closures weighed McDonald’s down. 


					7 Electric Vehicle Stocks To Buy Making Big Moves Beyond Cars				

But with strong growth in the queue for 2021 and a 2.5% dividend yield, this consistent winner is one to consider. Like Walmart, McDonald’s has raised its dividend every year since its first payout in the 1970s. 

Realty Income (O)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Called The Monthly Dividend Company, Realty Income is an instant favorite among REIT buyers. 
Realty Income has done an incredible job of building a diversified portfolio of various tenants in various industries. It’s not overly levered to any one company or any one industry. 
In short, it has taken its time over the years building a formidable portfolio that any true real estate investor would envy. In an effort to also differentiate itself, the company opted for monthly dividends over quarterly dividends. So while the payments are smaller, it’s nice receiving that payout every month. 
Just like any premium stock though, the problem with Realty — if we can even call it a problem — is that the valuation comes at a premium too. With a premium valuation comes a lower yield. 
Because REITs are out of favor, investors can snag a solid yield with Realty Income. While up notably from the lows, shares are still down about 25% from the highs, yielding 4.7%. 

Federal Realty (FRT)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Everyone loves the last REIT we talked about, as it’s a stalwart in the dividend community. However, Federal Realty deserves plenty of attention in our list of dividend stocks to own. 
Federal Realty is considered a crown jewel in the REIT space, having raised its dividend for 53 consecutive years. Think about that … five consecutive decades! 
So what’s the only problem with Federal Realty? 
The low yield. When demand is high and a stock is bid up, the dividend yield is low. The opposite is true for high-yield stocks — demand is lower. In the case of FRT, the yield has generally been between 2% and 3% for the last decade. It was more like a bond than a stock, and that’s not what investors are looking for in REITs.


					7 Stocks to Sell for December				

Because of the coronavirus-related selloff though, Federal Realty’s yield has swelled toward 5% — and even cleared 6% at one point this year. Anytime FRT is near or above 5%, buyers will want a stake. 

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com
	
Last but not least is Johnson & Johnson, which absolutely deserves to be on our list of dividend stocks to own. 
In April 2020 — just weeks into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. — J&J went through with another dividend hike. The firm raised its quarterly payout by more than 6% to 95 cents per share. 
Wouldn’t it be nice to get that kind of raise each year? 
Here’s the best part: The dividend raise was Johnson & Johnson’s 58th consecutive annual increase. So much has happened in the last six decades, ranging from dot-com busts, financial crises and inflation surges. Through it all though, J&J has been there raising its payout year in and year out. 
That’s income you can depend on. Now paying out a 2.7% dividend yield, the company’s payout is about three times the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond. 
Combined with shares being just 2.5% below the all-time high, it’s clear we have a winning combination of yield and stock performance with J&J.

But looking for a bit of a twist on my stock selection process, I’ve decided that this list will be based on the first letter of all 12 months. That means my stock pick for January will have a corporate name beginning with J, then an F for February and so forth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips


					7 Undervalued Stocks That Could Soar in 2021				

All 12 will also have a market capitalization of $2 billion or more and positive free cash flow for the trailing 12 months. By this time next year, I’m confident that my picks, on the whole, won’t disappoint.
So, without further ado, here are my 12 best stocks for a brand new year:
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 
Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) 
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) 
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) 
MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) 
Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI)

Otis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)
Dollar General (NYSE:DG)

Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com
	
Johnson & Johnson represents the month of January on my list of best stocks to buy for 2021. Right now, it’s having a sideways kind of year in the markets. Its year-to-date (YTD) total return through Dec. 4 is just 2.6%. 
Based on a trailing 12-month free cash flow (FCF) of $18.3 billion and a current enterprise value (EV) of over $399 billion, JNJ’s FCF yield is a reasonable 4.7%. It might not be value territory — I consider anything above 8% to be cheap — but it’s pretty darn good. 
As InvestorPlace colleague Faisal Humayun recently stated, JNJ stock has an excellent product offering. 
“From a business perspective, the company provides diversified exposure to the segments of consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices,” Humayun wrote. “The company’s pharmaceutical segment growth for Q3 2020 was impressive with most therapeutic areas delivering strong numbers.”
Not to mention, JNJ is still very much in the Covid-19 vaccine race. That suggests that 2021 could be a breakout year for this Dividend Aristocrat.  

Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)

Next on my list of best stocks to buy is Fidelity National Information Services, representing the month of February. This payment processor is having an underwhelming year relative to the U.S. markets as a whole. It sits just a fraction lower than it did this time last year. 
Based on a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.57 billion and an enterprise value of $109.75 billion, though, Fidelity National’s FCF yield is very decent at 3.8%.
You won’t find a lot of commentary from InvestorPlace contributors on this stock, despite the fact it does have a part to play in the technology side of the financial services industry.

However, on Nov. 19, the Florida-based company announced that it earned the top spot for the sixth consecutive year in a ranking of 100 leading providers of risk and compliance technology. 
Additionally, while Covid-19 has slowed the rate at which FIS can process transactions, it still has managed to generate organic revenue growth during its third quarter of 1% to about $3.2 billion. The company also increased adjusted net income by 18% to $887 million.
So, this is not a glamorous stock but its services are certainly in demand. 

McDonald’s (MCD)
Source: CHALERMPHON SRISANG / Shutterstock.com
	
To represent March for the coming year, I’ve picked the golden arches of MCD stock. Like many of the names on this list, McDonald’s has an okay year going, up around 7% YTD. That’s better than many of its restaurant peers, but it’s trailing the U.S. markets as a whole.  
Thanks to Covid-19 shutdowns, McDonald’s trailing 12-month free cash flow isn’t nearly as strong as it usually is, now at $4.25 billion. Currently, the industry leader has an FCF yield of 2.7% based on an enterprise value of about $205 billion. 
Despite operating in one of the hardest-hit industries, McDonald’s has continued to look beyond the novel coronavirus, continually finding ways to transform its business without upsetting the core customer. 
For instance, the company recently gave Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) the cold shoulder by announcing it would be testing a line of meatless alternatives in 2021, including the McPlant burger. Interestingly — despite developing the plant-based burger with Beyond Meat’s input — the fast-food company decided to go its own way. 
The decision to go on its own was a result of two reasons. First, MCD didn’t want to alienate its meat-loving customers. Secondly, it’s not a fan of letting licensees and other brands into its house. Beyond Meat would have surely taken some shine off of the Golden Arches. 
McDonald’s has had a tough time, but it always bounces back. That makes it one of the best stocks to buy for the upcoming year.

Adobe (ADBE)
Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com
	
Adobe, the mastermind behind the PDF and so much more, is my pick for the month of April. It’s having an excellent year in the markets right now, with a YTD total return of over 47%. 
That’s considerably better than both its software peers and the U.S. markets as a whole, making it one of the best stocks to buy right now.  
Adobe’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $4.9 billion, while its enterprise value is nearly $232 billion for an FCF yield of 2.1%. Both its enterprise value and EV-EBITDA multiple have also risen dramatically in the past five years.

In 2016, the company had an enterprise value of $48 billion and an EV-EBITDA of 26.1. Presently, the stock has an EV-EBITDA multiple of 48.3.
In early February, I said ADBE stock was all but certain to hit $400 in 2020. It did and then some. Moving forward, I think it’s all but certain to hit perhaps $600 in 2021.  

MercadoLibre (MELI)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
	
MercadoLibre is sometimes referred to as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America, although it more closely resembles Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). For my list of best stocks to buy in 2021, it represents the month of May. 
Currently, MELI stock is having a fantastic year in the markets with a YTD total return of nearly 200%. Like Adobe, MercadoLibre is faring far better than both its internet retail peers and U.S. markets as a whole.  
This company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $810 million, while its enterprise value is almost $76 billion for an FCF yield of 1.1%. While that might seem low, MercadoLibre’s free cash flow has never been higher. Likewise, its revenues are on fire and growing like weeds. 
True to the Amazon comparison, this name will also probably see exponential growth in its free cash flow over the next few years. 
I’ve been a fan of the company since as far back as 2013, when it was trading around $120. At the time, I argued that it had a dominant position in Latin American e-commerce and its stock would benefit from that. 
As I write this, shares are priced around $1,700 and moving higher in 2021.

Johnson Controls (JCI)
Source: Shutterstock
	
There aren’t a lot of great companies with a J as the first letter in their name. There are even fewer with strong free cash flow. Nonetheless, Johnson Controls represents the month of June on my list of best stocks to buy.
Interestingly, while it’s only generally matching the YTD performance of the U.S. markets as a whole, JCI stock is doing better in 2020 than it has in some time. Over the past five years, it’s delivered an annualized total return for shareholders of about 9.1%, well below the markets. 
However, up almost 14% over the past three months, the company appears to be gathering speed heading into 2021. 
In early November, Johnson Controls also announced its fourth-quarter results, which were excellent despite the challenging business environment. In fiscal 2020, it had sales of $22.3 billion and net income of $1.69 billion, flat to a year earlier.


					7 Biotech Stocks To Buy Beyond Covid Vaccine Plays				

That’s not bad for a company that manufactures, installs and services products designed for offices, industrial properties and other types of commercial real estate — all of which were hurt by the pandemic. 
Johnson Controls’ trailing 12-month free cash flow is nearly $1.8 billion, while its enterprise value is about $39 billion for an FCF yield of 5.3%. 
I view JCI as a nice stock for risk-averse investors who also like a little dividend income — its dividend yield is 2.28% at the moment.  

Jeld-Wen Holding (JELD)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
	
By far the smallest of the 12 names on this list, JELD stock has a market cap of $2.42 billion. This maker of windows and doors represents the month of July on my best stocks to buy list. 
Back in late January of 2017, Jeld-Wen went public at $23 a share. 
Now, though — if you bought shares in its IPO and are still holding — you’ve made almost no money on your investment. Year-to-date, it’s got a total return well below the booming returns of its building products and equipment industry peer group. Those stocks have mostly benefited from Covid-19. 
The company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $250 million, while its enterprise value is $3.8 billion for an FCF yield of 11.3%.
However, on Nov. 3, the company reported third-quarter results that were better than analyst expectations. On the top-line, revenue was $1.11 billion, $2 million higher than the consensus estimate. On the bottom line, it had adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents, eight cents higher than analyst expectations. 
“Consumers’ focus on their homes, coupled with our strategy to deliver profitable market share with key customers, is driving increased demand for products in both residential new construction and repair and remodel channels,” said President and CEO Gary Michel.
As the focus remains on homes in 2021, I expect Jeld-Wen to snap out of its funk and do well.

Apple (AAPL)
Source: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com
	
For August, the famous maker of the iPhone is the next pick of this list. However, if there were a month beginning with the letter B, I’d recommend Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) because it’s a much better value play and happens to own almost 965 million shares of AAPL stock. 
Apple’s YTD total return is over 66%, which sounds rather ordinary, given its almost 30% annualized total return over the past 15 years. I’d take it every day of the week. 
As for free cash flow and enterprise value, they are almost $73.4 billion and $2.1 trillion, respectively. That’s an FCF yield of 3.5%, an excellent valuation for one of the world’s largest public companies. 
Put simply, Apple has become so much more than a maker of smartphones.

According to AppleInsider.com, Apple’s new “M1-equipped Mac mini” has jumped to the number one position in sales in the Japanese market for desktop computers — after only two weeks of availability. Further, Apple now has a 27% market share in Japan, up from roughly 13% a year earlier. 
So, I don’t think you can go wrong owning Apple over the long haul. Clearly, it’s one of the best stocks to buy for the coming year.

SVB Financial (SIVB)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Next, representing the month of September is my favorite U.S. bank. SVB Financial is the holding company that operates Silicon Valley Bank, the Santa Clara-based financial institution that focuses on entrepreneurs and innovators. 
Right now, it’s having an awesome year compared to peers in regional banking. While SIVB stock is up nearly 43% YTD, most of its peers are down. It’s also leaving the U.S. markets in the dust. That said, I won’t bother noting the free cash flow for this name because it’s not meaningful for banking institutions. Instead, the balance sheet matters most. 
SIVB reported Q3 2020 results that included earnings per share of $8.47, almost double the $4.42 per share it earned the year prior.
“We had an exceptional quarter driven by outstanding balance sheet growth, higher core fee income, strong investment banking revenue, solid credit resulting in a reduction of reserves, and outsized equity gains related to client IPO activity,” President and CEO Greg Becker, noted. “These results reflect the resilience of our markets and our ability to execute effectively.”
SIVB was on my 2013 list of the five best stocks to buy for the next 20 years, right up there with Amazon. I think you owe it to yourself to check it out in 2021.

Otis Worldwide (OTIS)

Back in early April, this elevator company spun off from United Technologies, which merged with Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) to become one of the world’s largest aerospace and defense companies.
While it won’t have a full 12-month track record until April, this representative for the month of October has risen 43.5% YTD, suggesting 2021 could deliver an excellent performance. 
In the trailing 12 months, Otis has a free cash flow of $1.47 billion and an enterprise value of about $33 billion. That makes for an FCF yield of 5.2%, so it’s reasonably priced. 
What’s more, the company’s third-quarter results demonstrate that it’s holding its own during the pandemic. Top-line organic sales fell 1.2% in Q3 2020 to $3.3 billion while its operating profit grew 7% on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Also, operating margins increased 120 basis points to 15.4%.

In November, Toronto-based portfolio manager Christine Poole made OTIS stock one of her three top picks on BNN Bloomberg’s Market Call, suggesting that its 17% global elevator market share makes it an excellent long-term investment with an excellent balance between sales and service, at 57% and 43% respectively.
That makes it worthy of this best stocks to buy list for 2021. Can you say recurring revenue?

NextEra Energy (NEE)

Recently, I recommended this Florida-based utility company because of its renewable energy business, NextEra Energy Resources, which generates almost 40% of overall earnings. I maintain that NEE stock is one of the best stocks to buy for 2021, representing the month of November on this list.
NEE stock is a thing of beauty if consistent returns are your thing. YTD, it’s up about 20%. Over the past three-, five- and 10-year periods, it has annualized total returns of 25.1%, 26.8% and 20.5%, respectively. Let’s say it’s crushing its peers over any of those periods.
NextEra’s free cash flow in the trailing 12-months is $2.1 billion, while its enterprise value is $190 billion, for an FCF yield of -3.2%. So, it’s certainly not cheap.   
But InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake made an interesting observation on Nov. 25 when he suggested that NextEra would buy another utility with its strong share price. As Hake would agree, that’s Capital Allocation 101. 
NextEra made overtures to Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Evergy (NYSE:EVRG). Both rejected the offers. However, I’m sure something will shake out soon enough. Like Hake said, a bid might come with more cash. 
What I do know for certain is that NextEra is one of North America’s best-run utilities. 

Dollar General (DG)

Representing the final month of the year is Dollar General, the dollar-store discount chain with 17,000 locations in 46 states. It’s having another strong year, up almost 37% YTD. Combine that with a 10-year annualized total return of 20.8%, and you’ve got one heck of a long-term investment. 
As for trailing 12-month free cash flow, it has $3.1 billion, along with an enterprise value of nearly $64 billion. Right now, its FCF yield is 5.9%.
On Nov. 14, the company announced the opening of its 17,000th store in Fountain, Colorado. As a nice gesture to the community, Dollar General donated $17,000 to one of the local schools. 
“Since our founding more than 80 years ago, we have remained focused on helping customers save time and money,”CEO Todd Vasos said in the company’s press release heralding the occasion.
In my book, helping customers save time and money are the hallmarks of any successful business.
Back in November, I also recommended Dollar General as one of three stocks of relative values compared to Nio (NYSE:NIO), the Chinese electric vehicle maker. And while I like Nio long-term, it isn’t a name to buy for the short-term at current prices. DG stock is much more down-to-earth.
As long as working folk need to save money, Dollar General’s business remains a solid bet. In turn, that makes it one of the best stocks to buy going into the uncertainty of 2021.

2020-12-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic delivered a core-shaking shock to the consumer-goods industry, abruptly reshaping what people were buying where they were buying, and how they were buying. For some companies, it has led to deep damage that is still fully revealing itself. For others, it has created opportunity.As 2020 comes to close, it’s worth reflecting on these changes and where they have left the sector heading into 2021. Here, 10 charts tell the tale:Toilet paper on a roll. As the reality of the pandemic came into focus for consumers in mid-March, the grocery business was gripped by a wave of pantry-loading that resulted in massive spikes in sales of certain products — and eventually, empty shelves. In a single week in March, sales of liquid hand soap soared 320% from a year earlier, while purchases of frozen meat climbed 132% and sales of toilet paper surged 236%. Hand sanitizer, meanwhile, was in such demand that year-over-year sales skyrocketed more than 1,000% in each week from early May to early July. Such extraordinary jolts of buying fever scrambled the consumer products industry, with brands taking steps such as bringing on third-party manufacturing partners and dropping less popular items to focus on the production of top sellers. Although demand has retreated from the frenzy of the early days of the pandemic, sales of consumer packaged goods have still held above last year’s levels. With widespread distribution of Covid-19 vaccines months away and many people still spending a large chunk of their time at home, strong sales in this category are likely to continue.Online grocery carts fill up. Before the pandemic, grocery was something of a final frontier in e-commerce, remaining mostly untouched by retail’s digital transformation. Even though supermarkets and big-box stores were able to stay open throughout spring lockdowns, masses of shoppers decided to try online grocery shopping — include curbside pickup — for the first time or began doing more of it as a safety precaution. Some consumers will go back to their old, store-centric routine after the crisis is over, but many will stick to their new shopping habits. Years from now, this will be remembered as a tipping point for adoption, and one that significantly altered the showdown between Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Kroger Co.Big tickets. As customers adhered to social-distancing guidelines, they packed their spending into a limited number of stock-up trips and skipped the in-between, fill-in stops. This behavior is perhaps most clearly illustrated in the results of Walmart’s U.S. business, where declines in transactions, a proxy for traffic, have been more than offset by a boom in ticket, or the average amount spent per order. Relatedly, this unusual year brought changes in conversion, or the rate at which shoppers go from browsing to buying. When consumers set foot in a store in this environment, their intent to buy something was quite strong. That’s why, for example, there was such a disparity in the decrease in foot traffic recorded over Black Friday weekend — down 42% from last year, according to RetailNext — and the drop in brick-and-mortar sales, which was only 24%.Stuff Rules. Millions of Americans lost their jobs or experienced economic hardship because of the pandemic, a dynamic that threatened to decimate retailers’ sales. That’s not how things played out, though. While some consumers have moved to the sidelines amid the economic gloom, others are redirecting the dollars they might once have spent on plane tickets, hotel stays or movie tickets toward retailers, perhaps to buy a new big-screen TV or home-gym equipment. The fact that consumers have had so few options for spending on experiences has made the retail industry’s recovery easier. The tables will likely turn when vaccines are distributed widely and pent-up demand for travel and other services is unleashed. Spending Shift. Social distancing and lockdowns rearranged our lifestyles and in doing so, rechanneled our demand. The result: sales for some products froze up and caught fire for others. It was a bleak year, of course, for purchases of dressy clothes and lipstick. But there was softness in less-obvious places, too: ConAgra Brands Inc. said demand for edible seeds declined when baseball seasons were canceled, while Mondelez International Inc. said chewing-gum sales fell as social outings dwindled. At the same time, the pandemic acted as rocket fuel for sales of a wide array of products, including frozen foods, massage appliances, Crocs, printers, mattresses, snowshoes, rice cookers, bicycles and hair masks. Among the most notable beneficiaries of stay-at-home living are the twin empires of the home-improvement business, Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos., which each pulled in more than a year’s worth of sales growth in the third quarter after having achieved similarly gangbusters growth in the previous three-month period. Commerce Department data show what a banner year it was for these types of stores as consumers created home offices or splurged on palatial patios.The Zoom phenomenon. Amid the aforementioned category-level shift in spending, some consumer brands emerged as breakout stars among investors much as Zoom Video Communications Inc. did with the surge in remote working. Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. boomed more than 436% this year as orders piled up for its connected stationary bikes and treadmills. Etsy Inc. was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index for part of this year as shoppers thronged the site in search of face masks. (Etsy ceded the top spot to Tesla Inc. when the electric-car maker joined the index this month. ) After sinking in late March, shares of Yeti Holdings Inc. have soared, now up more than 100% year to date, as investors realized its coolers and thermoses would be in high demand as people spent more time outside. It could be a challenge for these social-distance-friendly stocks to keep investors happy in 2021 as they lap the strong results delivered in 2020 and as more widely available vaccines may yet again change consumer spending patterns.Storefront shakeout. Lockdowns and capacity restrictions at physical stores created a sales convulsion from which many chains have struggled to recover. The situation hastened the journey of already-fragile retailers J. Crew Group, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney Co. into bankruptcy in the first half of the year. That was only the beginning: Others including Sur La Table and Stein Mart liquidated stores after filing for protection from creditors. Even chains not in bankruptcy court were forced to reassess, with Nordstrom Inc., for example, announcing 16 stores would be permanently shuttered after initial lockdowns. Bankruptcies and store closings reverberate throughout the industry in varied ways. They represent an opportunity for healthier competitors to pick up market share. But closings also sprinkle malls with empty storefronts that threaten to make those centers less viable over the long haul. CoStar Group estimates that more than 11,000 store closings were announced this year through Dec. 1.Rough run for workers. The arrival of the pandemic scrambled the retail industry’s large labor force. Workers at nonessential retailers were, in many cases, furloughed or out of a job, while others suddenly found themselves on the front lines of a dangerous public-health situation. Big chains offered hazard pay and bonuses in response to the circumstances, but in some cases, the measures felt insufficiently generous considering the explosive sales growth a given retailer was enjoying or the share buybacks it was undertaking. Dollar General Corp. expects to devote $2.5 billion to share repurchases this fiscal year, a figure that, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, is 14 times what it has pledged for pandemic-related compensation. Overall, despite big hiring sprees by the likes of Kroger and Walmart, retail employment has not returned to its pre-pandemic level.Dining devastation. The pandemic has taken a toll on the restaurant industry, with a staggering 110,000 restaurants closing amid capacity restrictions and increased dining at home, according to the National Restaurant Association. The pain has not been shared equally, though. Work-from-home arrangements have been hard on the likes of Starbucks Corp., whose cafes are prolific in dense urban areas that have been empty of office workers for much of the year. Casual eateries, which rely on packed dining rooms that are either disallowed by local regulation or are simply undesirable right now, remain in a deep sales hole. That contrasts with the relatively quick recovery made by the fast-food segment since the early days of the pandemic. McDonald’s Corp., for instance, returned to comparable sales growth in the U.S. by the third quarter, helped by its drive-through windows and well-established carryout options.Paying the price. This year presented retailers with unique conditions to wield pricing power. This showed up in a number of ways. For one, upscale clothing and accessories titans Ralph Lauren Corp., Capri Holdings Inc. and Tapestry Inc. were able to pad their gross margins by keeping the lid on promotions. But the clearest examples of price insensitivity were in the grocery business, where revenue exploded for reasons more complex than that people were eating more at home. In some cases, shoppers traded up to fancier labels, likely reflecting a desire to treat themselves in a lonely time. In others, stores and brands cut back on promotions and, in some cases, raised prices amid strong demand, contributing to a year of roaring sales growth. As retailers plan their businesses for 2021, their most difficult work will be figuring out which of these new patterns are likely to last beyond the pandemic. That is an exceedingly difficult task and will likely result in some instances of bloated inventory, mismatched manufacturing capacity and frustrated consumers. At least it won’t be 2020 anymore.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-12-30,"McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved down to $212.46 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $212.50  * Volume: 319  * Open Interest: 188Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Understanding Gap's Unusual Options Activity  * Analyzing Uber Technologies's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters.

2021-01-27,"Investors who have owned stocks since 2016 generally have experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 125.7%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. A Tough Path: One company that has struggled to keep pace since 2016 has been McDonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD). But despite struggles along the way, McDonald’s investors have gotten some decent overall returns. The company has faced some significant challenges in recent years, including souring public opinion on processed foods and a trend toward organic, healthy menu items. In 2015, former McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook jump-started the company and its stock via his Experience of the Future initiative, which included a $6 billion commitment to restaurant remodels and a focus on technological innovation, such as kiosk, as well as app ordering and delivery. Easterbrook also spearheaded a corporate restructuring, a large-scale refranchising and a shift toward higher-quality menu items. Unfortunately, Easterbrook was fired from the company in late 2019 after he had an inappropriate relationship with a coworker. At the beginning of 2016, McDonald's shares were trading at around $117. The stock hit its low point of the past five years in late 2016, dipping down to $110.33 before Easterbrook’s changes started showing up in McDonald’s sales numbers. From that point, the stock steadily churned higher over the next several years, reaching $150 in mid-2017 and $200 for the first time in mid-2019. Related Link: Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Intel Stock 5 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today McDonald's In 2021, Beyond: McDonald's peaked at $221.93 in 2019 prior to Easterbrook’s departure and the COVID-19 pandemic sell-off, which pushed the stock back down to as low as $124.23 in March. Fortunately for McDonald’s investors, fast-food restaurants weren’t hit nearly as hard as casual and fine dining restaurants, and McDonald’s investments in its app and delivery options really paid off in 2020. By late 2020, McDonald’s shares made new all-time highs at $231.91 before settling back down to around $213 today. McDonald's investors that bought and held on through a volatile five-year period turned a significant profit. In fact, $1,000 worth of McDonald's stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $2,037 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, analysts expect McDonald's to continue its push higher in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 32 analysts covering the stock is $240, suggesting 12.5% upside from current levels.

2021-01-28,"McDonald’s, the world’s leading global food service retailer, reported fourth quarter and year end 2020 revenues and earnings on Thursday that missed analysts’ estimates. McDonald’s (MCD) Q4 earnings came in at $1.70 compared to analysts’ expectations of $1.80, which represents a year-on-year decrease of 14%. Fourth quarter and full year revenues of $5.31 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, also fell short of analysts’ forecasts. McDonald’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski, said, “2020 will be remembered as one of McDonald’s most challenging, yet inspiring, moments in our long history. The resilience of the McDonald’s System was on display – making safety and service a priority, putting our customers and people first, and running great restaurants…we’re confident we can continue to capture market share and drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders.” McDonald’s noted that the resurgence of COVID-19 and government restrictions continue to limit dine-in capacity in most countries and expects disruptions in operations for as long as these conditions persist. (See MCD stock analysis on TipRanks) Keybanc analyst Eric Gonzalez reiterated his Buy rating on MCD last week and set his price target at $235. This implies upside potential of around 14% from current levels. Gonzalez noted the challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic but feels that McDonald’s “remains well-positioned as the category leader in the majority of its international markets, where it entered the pandemic with a strong track record of same-store sales growth.” Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 16 Buys and 6 Holds. The average price target of $238.55 suggests upside potential of around 15% over the next 12 months.

2021-01-28,"Shares of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) moved lower by 4.20% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt McDonald's has. McDonald's's Debt According to the McDonald's's most recent balance sheet as reported on November 9, 2020, total debt is at $38.17 billion, with $35.14 billion in long-term debt and $3.03 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $3.68 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $34.49 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. McDonald's has $50.70 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.75. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-01-28,By Geoffrey Smith,"War on Wall Street, GDP & Jobless Claims, Earnings Deluge - What's up in Markets"
2021-01-28,"(Bloomberg) -- McDonald’s Corp. reported fourth-quarter results that showed strength in its core U.S. market -- but also ongoing weakness in some international markets as Covid-19 continues to hamper the restaurant industry around the world.Global same-store sales, a key indicator of restaurant performance, fell 1.3% last quarter, the Chicago-based fast-food chain reported on Thursday. That’s slightly better than the 1.5% decline from analysts compiled by Consensus Metrix. In the U.S., where McDonald’s has around 14,000 locations and loads of socially-distant drive-thrus, comparable sales gained 5.5%, also slightly higher than the 5.2% estimate, representing an acceleration from the prior period.Revenue of $5.31 billion just trailed projections, however, as Covid-19 resurgences and lockdowns in markets such as France, Germany and Spain hampered results. Gains in some countries, such as the U.K. and Australia, were offset by losses in others, illustrating the back-and-forth nature of a pandemic that has stubbornly refused to subside over the last year.The year “2020 will be remembered as one of McDonald’s most challenging, yet inspiring, moments in our long history,” said McDonald’s President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski.Shares were little changed in pre-market trading, up less than 1%.The company said restrictions, such as limited capacity and reduced hours, have carried into 2021 in some countries and continue to affect performance. The restrictions “are impacting most of the company’s key markets outside of the U.S., particularly those with fewer drive-thru restaurant locations,” according to its earnings statement.The coronavirus has reinforced McDonald’s model of drive thrus and low prices, which has allowed it to gain market share in the U.S. despite the upheaval. McDonald’s is also pushing to expand into technology-enhanced ordering and delivery.Lately, McDonald’s has advertised discounts such as $1 fries through its mobile app while adding new bakery items and promoting its breakfast menu. The company is planning to introduce a loyalty program this year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",McDonald’s Quarterly Results Show Uneven Recovery From Pandemic

While chicken sandwiches are extremely popular, some experts say that McDonald's lacks the experience and equipment for producing them to today's standards.","McDonald's Comps Could Double Because of Chicken Sandwiches, ""Captive Audience,"" Analyst Says"

2021-02-03,"Former McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook failed in his attempt to get a lawsuit against him dismissed, which according to Reuters, alleges that he intentionally covered up his improper sexual conduct with employees. McDonald’s (MCD) is suing Easterbrook, hoping to recoup an estimated $41.8 million that was paid to him as part of his severance package. Reuters reports that the fast food chain knew about one, non-physical consensual relationship with an employee when it approved Easterbrook’s severance package, but later discovered through an anonymous tip that he had deleted dozens of sexually explicit photos of women, including three employees. Easterbrook argued that McDonald’s should have known about his other relationships with employees as the restaurant company had evidence on its computer systems, but Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights dismissed this notion saying, “This active concealment makes it at least reasonably conceivable the company had no way of knowing the full extent of Easterbrook’s misconduct,” according to Reuters. (See McDonald’s stock analysis on TipRanks) Citigroup analyst Sergio Matsumoto reiterated his Buy recommendation on MCD two days ago and maintained his price target at $230. This implies upside potential of around 10% from current levels. Matsumoto opened a “positive Catalyst Watch,” referring to McDonald’s chicken sandwich launch. He feels that the company’s high store density of 41 units per 1 million people creates a competitive advantage for McDonald’s as lockdowns and mobility restrictions continue amid the COVID pandemic. McDonald’s receives a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $239.86 suggests upside potential of around 14% over the next 12 months. McDonald’s gets an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score, which implies that the stock is expected to outperform analysts’ expectations.

What Happened: The non-carbonated Hi-C Orange, which is part of the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) portfolio, had been a staple at McDonald's since 1955, but was removed from the menu in May 2017 in favor of another Coca-Cola beverage, Sprite TropicBerry. Hi-C fans reacted angrily on social media to the loss of their favorite drink and began petition drives, but for years McDonald's was unmoved by the protests. ""We know fans of Hi-C Orange Lavaburst, AKA Hi-C Orange, have been craving the iconic beverage since it rolled off national menus in 2017,"" said McDonald's in a press release. ""To those who have passionately asked for us to bring it back over the years, we're excited to say we 'C' you."" What's Next: McDonald's did not offer an explanation on why it had an abrupt change of mind after a long stretch without making the drink available, but Hi-C fans are already high-fiving each other online for their victory. Hi-C Orange will be available at select McDonald's restaurants this month and is scheduled to resume its place as a soft drink option at all locations by June.

2021-02-18,"McDonald’s Corp (NYSE: MCD) has set a goal of expanding representation of women and people of color in its leadership ranks over the next four years. What Happened: In a corporate blog post titled, “Allyship Through Accountability,” the restaurant chain stated the mission to “increase representation of historically underrepresented groups in leadership roles (senior director and above)” to 35% by 2025; as of 2020, McDonald’s found these demographics accounted for 29% of leadership roles. The company also stated it would increase the representation of women in leadership roles globally to 45% within four years; as of 2020, women make up 37% of McDonald’s global leadership positions. The company also said it would begin using “quantitative human capital management-related metrics” to measure the annual incentive compensation for its executive vice presidents. Under these metrics, executives will be judged on “their ability to champion our core values, improve representation within leadership roles for both women and historically underrepresented groups, and create a strong culture of inclusion within the company.” The company’s senior leadership will also collaborate with Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer Reggie Miller and his office on initiatives to further encourage diversity in the upper ranks, including the use of an “Inclusion Index” for building a more inclusive workforce. Why It Matters: The new emphasis on diversity comes as McDonald’s is facing a public relations dilemma with a lawsuit by Herbert Washington, a former Oakland A’s player and McDonald’s franchisee who alleged the company restricted him to low-volume locations in predominantly Black neighborhoods, then forced him to downsize after grading his locations unfairly. McDonald's, in turn, told CNBC that Washington’s franchises were disrupted by “years of mismanagement” and generated high volumes of customer complaints. Washington’s lawsuit is the latest complaint of racial bias aimed at McDonald’s. Last September, 52 Black former McDonald’s franchisees sued the company for racial discrimination, claiming they were denied the same opportunities as White operators. In January 2020, two Black former executives sued McDonald’s over alleged racial discrimination in the workplace. McDonald’s had a Black president and CEO when Don Thompson ran the company from 2012 until 2015. Thompson stepped down and is now CEO of Cleveland Avenue, a venture capital firm focused on the food trade.

2021-02-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Google will start grading executives based on workforce diversity goals and increase human resources staffing, acknowledging fault in its acrimonious split with Timnit Gebru, a prominent former employee and one of the few Black women in the field of artificial intelligence.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer of parent company Alphabet Inc., described the changes in an email to employees, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information. The email included comments by Jeff Dean, the executive who leads the company’s artificial intelligence and research efforts, saying he was sorry for how he handled Gebru’s exit, according to a copy of the message reviewed by Bloomberg“I understand we could have and should have handled the situation with more sensitivity,” Dean wrote. “And for that, I am sorry.” Dean said Google’s behavior toward Gebru hurt some female and Black employees and led them to question whether they belonged at the company. He did not apologize directly to Gebru in the email to staff.Executives’ performance evaluations will now be partly tied to diversity, equity and inclusion goals, and Google will double the amount of human resources staff working on employee retention, according to the memo.A spokesman for Google declined to comment. The changes were reported earlier Friday by news website Axios.Several large companies have made diversity a factor in executive performance and compensation. They include McDonald’s Corp. and Microsoft Corp.At Google, the changes came after turmoil stemming from Gebru’s departure. She said she was fired in December after refusing to retract a research paper critical of a key Google technology or remove the Google authors from it. Google has said that Gebru, the former co-head of ethical AI, resigned. Still, former colleagues expressed outrage over the company’s handling of the matter.On Thursday, the company appointed Marian Croak as vice president of engineering, elevating an experienced Black woman to lead a new, centralized organization to develop AI responsibly. The further changes outlined Friday marked the conclusion of an internal investigation into the handling of Gebru’s departure.Dean also detailed a plan to clarify the process for approving research papers by Google authors for outside publication. The current process has too many intersecting parts, particularly for “sensitive” research, he said, and what’s considered sensitive isn’t always clear.“We’re building a more unified, start-to-finish process with clearer guidance along the way on what steps are needed, who is accountable at each step and Google’s research goals and priorities,” Dean wrote.Dean did not address the questions raised by the Gebru example as to whether Google’s AI ethics team will be allowed to critically examine the very technologies the search and advertising giant uses in its commercial products.(Updates with additional reporting starting in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Google AI Chief Apologizes for Researcher’s Acrimonious Exit

It also purchased Smartmockups in the Czech Republic, which allows e-commerce entrepreneurs and other users to quickly and easily create mockups for t-shirts, mugs and other items.“With everyone spending so much time on the internet, the need to communicate visually is becoming a critical skill for individuals but more importantly for businesses,” Cliff Obrecht, co-founder and chief operating officer of Canva, said in an interview. “These acquisitions really tie into us becoming that collaborative visual communications platform for the world.”The Australian upstart has now acquired a total of six companies, including image providers Pexels and Pixabay. Canva raised $60 million in June to expand features that allows users to collaborate on work in real time. That funding round nearly doubled its valuation to $6 billion from $3.2 billion previously. The company didn’t disclose financial details for the latest acquisitions.Canva’s business has more than doubled in the past year, Obrecht said. The firm now has 50 million monthly active users, up from 25 million a year ago. Its corporate clients include Skyscanner Ltd., Honeymoon Dessert and McDonald’s China.While Canva’s valuation has leapt several fold in recent years and its global operations expanded to 1,400 employees, it won’t be joining a red-hot IPO market any time soon, Obrecht said. The company has long been profitable and doesn’t see a need to raise capital by going public in the near future. Instead, it will focus on expanding its business organically and potentially through more acquisitions.“We’ve got no immediate plans” for an initial public offering, said Obrecht. “We are moving too fast, have too many big plans, to internally distract ourselves with such a big event.

2021-02-25,"Fast-food giant Mcdonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) launched its new premium chicken sandwich and the biggest winner could be chicken supplier Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (NASDAQ: PPC), according to BofA Securities. The Pilgrim's Pride Analyst: Peter Galbo maintains a Buy rating on Pilgrim's Pride's stock with an unchanged $25 price target. The Pilgrim's Pride Thesis: McDonald's entrance into the premium chicken sandwich war implies more than 50% of all quick-service restaurants feature a chicken sandwich on their menu, Galbo wrote in a note. The growing popularity of chicken sandwiches and continued adoption bodes well for chicken suppliers, especially Pilgrim's Pride. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) is among the largest chicken suppliers to McDonald's, but smaller-sized chickens are the preferred choice for sandwiches, the analyst wrote. Tyson's exposure to smaller chickens accounts for around 20% of its total chicken portfolio compared to Pilgrim's larger exposure at one-third of its U.S. capacity. Related Link: Yes, Even Taco Bell Is Entering The Chicken Sandwich Battle Pilgrim's is also converting one of its large bird facilities to small bird to address the growing demand for smaller chickens.

BYND stock climbed by about 3% in response to those new partnerships. Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com I’m surprised Beyond Meat’s stock isn’t soaring by 20%! These partnerships broadly underscore that Beyond Meat is, indeed, the Tesla of the plant-based food revolution, at a time when this revolution is on the precipice of going from niche to mainstream.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Luke Lango Reveals the One Stock That’s Like Buying Amazon in 1997 Over the next two years, I fully expect Beyond Meat to become a household name, and for the company’s sales and profits to soar far more than anyone is expecting. It will big a breakout two years for Beyond Meat. Amid that breakout, BYND stock will perform exceptionally well. Here’s a deeper look. BYND Stock Is The ‘Tesla of Plant Meat’ I’ve frequently called Beyond Meat the “Tesla of Plant Meat.” This comparison rests on the idea that — just as Tesla leveraged industry-leading technology, production capacity, distribution, and branding to turn into the unrivaled giant of the electric vehicle space — Beyond Meat will similarly leverage industry-leading tech, production, distribution, and branding to turn into the unrivaled giant of the plant-based meat space. Specifically, making plant-meat is a tough science. It requires expert knowledge to do it well, and to do it across multiple food verticals. Beyond Meat has mastered this science. Everyone I know who eats plant-meat will tell you that Beyond’s products are at the top of their list in terms of product quality. In fact, I’d be surprised if they weren’t near — or at the top — of everyone’s plant-based meat list. And Beyond Meat has figured out how to leverage this proprietary tech to make multiple plant-based meat products, like burgers, sausages and meatballs, giving them a wider assortment of products than anyone else in this space. At the same time, the company is the largest player in the plant-based meat space, with the biggest production footprint. That means Beyond Meat can make more plant-based meat than anyone else. This is a supply-constrained market, so Beyond Meat’s ability to consistently meet surging demand with adequate supply is a huge differentiator. A differentiator that will help the company win multiple contracts with retail and foodservice clients. That’s why Beyond Meat has the widest distribution network. The company’s products are everywhere: Grocery stores, restaurants, fast-food chains, etc. Some of these deals are exclusive. Some aren’t. But all of them give Beyond Meat a huge branding edge, wherein the Beyond Meat brand and name become synonymous with the plant-based meat trend — just as Tesla has become synonymous with the EV trend. All in all, Beyond Meat is the Tesla of plant meat. And, just as TSLA stock has soared with the EV revolution over the past decade, BYND stock will soar with the plant meat revolution over the next decade. Partnerships With McDonald’s and Yum Underscore the Tesla Thesis Beyond Meat’s huge partnerships with McDonald’s and Yum broadly underscore the aforementioned “Beyond Meat is the Tesla of plant meat” thesis. That’s because these are some of the biggest players in the foodservice space. McDonald’s is obviously McDonald’s. Yum owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Between these two companies, you’re talking four of the most heavily trafficked and popular fast-food chains on the planet. They don’t make supplier partnerships lightly. The suppliers for these companies will see their products be served to hundreds of millions of people globally. Thus, McDonald’s and Yum are looking for suppliers with great products, great reputations and the ability to scale production. That’s why each of them chose Beyond Meat to be their plant-based meat supplier. Beyond Meat has the highest-quality products in this space. They have the production capacity to ship out a ton of those high-quality products. And they have the reputation, expertise and branding that is unrivaled within the space. Beyond Meat truly is the Tesla of plant meat. That’s great news for BYND stock. But more than that, these partnerships set up BYND stock to have a big breakout over the next two years. Big Breakout in 2021-22 Beyond Meat’s retail business is doing great. Revenues rose 85% year-over-year last quarter. Buyer rates are up. Purchase frequency is up. Repeat purchase rates are up. When it comes to selling through grocery stores, Beyond Meat is killing it — and will continue to kill it for the foreseeable future as the company increases points of distribution and introduces new product SKUs, at a time when more and more consumers are looking to switch to plant-forward diets. That’s obvious. But, what is less obvious — and what will drive the big breakout in BYND stock in 2021-22 — is a surge in the company’s foodservice business in the coming years. Luke Lango Reveals the One Stock That’s Like Buying Amazon in 1997 Just think about the two partnerships Beyond Meat just signed. Between McDonald’s, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, you’re talking about some of the most trafficked fast food chains in the world. Those partnerships come on top of Beyond Meat products already being at A&W, BareBurger, BurgerFi, Carl’s Jr., Del Taco, Denny’s, Dunkin’, Luna Grill, Subway, and more. Beyond Meat is everywhere. That means that once we all start going back to fast food chains and restaurants more frequently over the next 12 to 24 months as Covid-19 takes a backseat to highly effective vaccines, we are going to see Beyond Meat products on a lot of menus. Some of us are going to order those products. Some of us are going to really like them. And some of us will return into loyal Beyond Meat customers, buying it at every restaurant we go to and loading up on it at our local grocery stores. In other words, thanks to creating a vast foodservice distribution network, Beyond Meat is on the cusp of going from niche to mainstream over the next few years. As that happens, Beyond Meat’s sales and profits are going to soar. BYND stock will soar, too. Bottom Line on BYND Stock Beyond Meat is positioned for a massive 2021-22 breakout. Amid this breakout, BYND stock will fly higher. That’s why I think this is one of the best growth stocks to buy today. But it’s not the best growth stock to buy today. Instead, the best growth stock to buy today is a company that reminds me of a young Amazon. Indeed, I think buying this stock today could be like buying AMZN stock back in 1997 — before it soared thousands of percent. Which stock am I talking about?

2021-02-26,"Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) has entered into supply deals with fast-food giants McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) and Yum Brands! Inc. (NYSE: YUM). The announcement of the deals came on the same day that the alternative meat maker reported a wider net loss for the fourth quarter despite higher revenues. What Happened: As part of a three-year deal with McDonald’s, Beyond Meat said it will be the preferred supplier for the patty in the McPlant, a new plant-based burger being tested in select McDonald’s markets globally. The two companies will also work to co-develop plant-based options for chicken, pork and egg as part of McDonald’s broader McPlant platform. Beyond Meat said it will expand its partnership with Yum! Brands to co-create and offer plant-based protein menu items that will be exclusive to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell over the next several years. Why It Matters: Beyond Meat’s business was hurt by the closure of restaurants amid the pandemic-induced lockdowns. The two supply deals are expected to boost the company’s growth prospects and also indicate that restaurants continue to see strong demand from health-conscious consumers for meat alternatives. Beyond Meat also announced a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) late last month to develop, produce, and market plant-based snacks and beverages. The company has been looking to adapt to global markets with relevant products and launched plant-based minced pork in China late last year. Price Movement: Beyond Meat shares closed 5.5% lower at $143.75 on Thursday, but added almost 0.9% in the after-hours session.

2021-03-01,"Plant-based meat alternatives are to the food industry what electric vehicles are to the transportation industry — a niche with a lot of startups today but maybe not so niche in the future, especially as further quality advancements are made. In today's edition of The Stockout, a CPG-focused newsletter, I discuss recent developments with Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND). I also share my thoughts about how the various products look and taste. Beyond Meat shares are sure polarizing, but regardless of your thoughts on investing, the growth of plant-based protein is clearly a mega-trend to watch closely, with implications for animal-based protein providers, manufacturers, retailers, agriculture companies and other ingredient suppliers. The rapid growth in plant-based proteins should not be ignored. In 2020, Beyond Meat posted revenue growth at retail locations of 104% y/y and 136% y/y in the U.S. and worldwide, respectively, with similar growth rates posted for the just-released fourth quarter. And those growth rates include share loss to Impossible Foods in the grocery channel; we have less information about Impossible because it's privately held. Of course, food sales at retail locations increased meaningfully across the board last year, and the company's retail revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in revenue in out-of-home foodservice locations (which declined 13.7% and 45.1% in 2020 in the U.S. and worldwide, respectively). Even with those thoughts in mind, it is still striking how quickly plant-based protein is growing in the context of the normally slow-growth food industry. For comparison, most of the largest food companies posted 2020 revenue growth of ~7% in their U.S. grocery channels last year, with declines of ~30%+ in outside-the-home channels. Even for the large, diversified food companies, plant-based products are often among the fastest-growing segments. Last year, Nestle's plant-based revenue grew double digits organically; it was the company's fastest-growing segment outside of pet food. Future sources of growth include not only greater consumer product awareness and adoption, but also future product launches. Beyond Meat's R&D last year was the equivalent of 7.8% of net revenue — very high for food companies, which normally have R&D expenditures in the low single digits, as a percent of net revenue. For what it's worth, I think Impossible looks and tastes more like ground beef than the others. In fact, I did a blind taste test with the three faux-meat burgers below and with a lean beef burger from Costco serving as a control. Impossible was the only one that fooled me — I thought it was real beef and I now understand Impossible's market share gain. Beyond Meat did taste quite a bit better than the Open Nature plant-based patties, but it still tastes like a garden burger to me. The prices I paid were commensurate with how I thought the products tasted; a two-pack of Impossible, Beyond and Open Nature costs $7, $6.50 and $5.50, respectively. The Impossible price was discounted from its original price, presumably to reflect the 20% cut to its grocery store prices. I recommend paying the extra 50 cents for Impossible. My family said they would pay an extra 50 cents for the Impossible burgers over Beyond Meat (which we still thought tasted good), but not an extra $1.50, so Impossible may have the right idea with its price cut. The caveat is that these are still early days and none of these companies are standing still. Consumer preferences could easily change as Beyond Meat rolls out version 3.0 of its products, and I am more than willing to give Beyond Meat another shot when it does. Or, maybe the established food companies will be the ones that develop superior products. Impossible looks and tastes more like ground beef. Can Beyond answer with new product development? (Image credit: Mike Baudendistel) Beyond Meat is officially McDonald's ""preferred supplier"" for the McPlant patty in a newly inked three-year deal. In addition to the McPlant patty, the companies are also collaborating on plant-based substitutes for chicken, pork and egg. Shares of Beyond Meat often jump when partnerships are announced, such as those with Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Yum! Brands and Pepsi, which, combined with its high short interest of 22.5% (it had been as high as 38%), seems to make it a candidate to become a ""meme stock"" should the trend continue. But, shares were initially down after the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) deal was announced because it did not make Beyond the exclusive supplier (the market had been expecting this since it was already known that Beyond was the supplier for a limited test with McDonald's in Denmark and Sweden). Shares rebounded with the explanation that McDonald's geographic reach is so large that it does not typically have single suppliers (and only about 20% of Beyond Meat's net revenue is from outside the U.S.). In fact, McDonald's does not typically announce who its suppliers are, which is likely why its announcement with Beyond had not come earlier. Beyond Meat expects the financial impact of the deal in 2021 to be ""fairly modest"" because it will take time for the partnership to phase in. McDonald's plans to roll out McPlant items more broadly later this year after test phases in the Scandinavian market, where nonmeat burgers are more common. Beyond Meat also makes bigger inroads with Yum! Brands, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Beyond Meat also announced an update to its agreement with Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM). Under the latest agreement, Beyond Meat is making items that are exclusive to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell during the next several years. The growth in plant-based proteins will increase domestic demand for various agricultural inputs. Unlike traditional ""bean burgers,"" Beyond Meat and Impossible take a different approach with inputs that include pea protein, mung bean, rice, coconut oil and cocoa butter. In addition, Impossible meat patties are made from a blend of soy and potato protein, and sunflower oil, among other ingredients. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) is the largest traditional protein company to market its own product line of alternative protein products (after selling its 6.5% ownership position in Beyond Meat in 2019 before its IPO) under its Raised & Rooted brand, which includes chicken nuggets alternatives make from pea protein isolate, egg white, bamboo and flaxseed. So, common ingredients to many of the meat-alternative products include soy and pea protein. If imitation meat alternatives continue to take hold, it could impact soybean trade flows, which are a net export from the U.S. Soybeans are often exported in international intermodal containers from the U.S. Midwest to the Pacific Northwest. Tariffs disrupted that trade in 2018-2019. Increased domestic consumption could impair future soybean export volumes. (Source: SONAR) Grow first, improve supply chains later. At this stage in Beyond Meat's life, the focus has been on getting new products to market quickly and becoming entrenched with key partners (Walmart, McDonald's, YUM! Brands, Pepsi, etc.) in order to exploit its early-mover advantage, which has put supply chain optimization secondary. However, it's clear that supply chain efficiency improvement is going to be one of the main methods for hitting its key objectives, including being able to underprice comparable animal products in at least one category without pressuring gross margins. Through increased supply chain efficiencies, Beyond and Impossible could increase their reach outside only the environmentally conscious and/or health-conscious buyer who is willing to pay a premium and begin targeting cost-conscious consumers and consumers in countries with a lower standard of living. With those objectives in mind, Beyond Meat is increasing its manufacturing capacity as it rolls out new products such as Beyond Meatballs, Beyond Sausage Links and the to-be-named products that will be served in fast-food restaurants. The company recently acquired a new manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, has a new facility in China with end-to-end capabilities, and recently enhanced its presence in the Netherlands to gain greater access to European supply chains. In addition, Beyond has avoided ingredients that are particularly high-priced due to added supply chains complexity or other reasons, such as genetic modification.

2021-03-08,"As the chicken sandwich competition continues to intensify, Margo Kahnrose, the chief marketing officer of marketing technology company Kenshoo, told Benzinga the battle for consumers' minds and wallets will merely increase. Taking Advantage Of Beef's Weakness: Beef's popularity has been declining since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic as the protein's association with cholesterol and obesity became a focal point among consumers, according to Signals Analytics, Kahnrose told Benzinga in an email interview. (Kenshoo is the parent company of Signals Analytics.) Fast-food giants heavily emphasized burger products during their early days of growth and the same marketing blitz may be underway with chicken sandwiches. Brands will leverage their social media platforms and other marketing to ""drive new buzz and excitement."" Chicken is also more of a crowd-pleaser menu item as the chicken itself is a ""blank canvas"" for other flavors like add-ons to take over. ""As the big chains continue to battle it out on social media, consumers will continue to stay engaged both online and through purchase behavior as long as there are new variations to try,"" she wrote. Winners And Losers: Some of the fast-food chains that focused on chicken before it was cool are not going to stand for new entrants trying to eat their lunch. Most notably, Restaurant Brands International Inc's (NYSE: QSR) Popeyes had a hilarious response to Mcdonald's Corp's (NYSE: MCD) website CHKNDrop.com website. Popeyes bought nearly every misspelled variation of McDonald's website — such as chkendrop.com — that redirected users to a Popeyes page offering the first 10,000 people a free chicken sandwich. Chicken sandwiches are for the most part interchangeable with each other so brands will need to make sure they have the ""most clever"" brand voice. This is especially true for legacy chicken joints like Popeyes and Chick-fil-A. ""It's easier than ever to steal customer loyalty away from your competitors when you can literally hijack their advertising efforts online and insert your brand into their conversation with customers,"" Kahnrose wrote. Taco Bell's Gamble: One of the more unusual entrants to the chicken sandwich space was Yum! Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE: YUM) Taco Bell. The differentiated fast-food chain needs to proceed carefully and avoid alienating its core customer at the expense of the ongoing momentum in chicken. ""When your brand caters to a specific customer need, it can be really risky and even detrimental to pivot wildly simply to take advantage of a moment in time,"" she wrote. ""They need to ask themselves whether they can build off the momentum without losing authenticity."" Related Link: Yes, Even Taco Bell Is Entering The Chicken Sandwich Battle Where Restaurants Are Advertising: Instagram is the go-to destination for restaurants looking to advertise their chicken sandwiches, according to a new report from the competitive intelligence platform BrandTotal. McDonald's opted to heavily focus its chicken sandwich marketing efforts on YouTube, likely due to the chain being one of the few companies taking part in the Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) boycott in the second half of 2020. Wendys Co (NASDAQ: WEN) had the highest volume of engagements from early November through early February as it promoted its 4 for $4 offer. Chick-fil-A showed the highest volume of paid media engagements and ranked top in terms of consumer sentiment. ""The most successful social media messages in the QSR space embrace humor and popular culture to build brand affinity, with a tone that often differs from that used in media efforts,"" according to the report.

2021-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, has been invited by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders to appear before his panel for a hearing on income and wealth inequality.Bezos has a net worth of $182.7 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, while many of Amazon’s workers earn so little they receive government subsidies for food and health care, putting the online giant in the company of other big employers like Walmart Inc. and McDonald’s Corp.Sanders plans the hearing for March 17. He also invited an Amazon worker at an Alabama fulfillment center where some employees are trying to form a union.An Amazon spokesperson said Bezos would be unable to attend the hearing and sought to place the focus on Sanders’s bid to increase the minimum wage. “We fully endorse Senator Sanders’s efforts to reduce income inequality with legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Under pressure from Sanders and activists, the company in 2018 bumped its starting salary to $15 an hour, roughly twice the federal minimum wage. Amazon has recently run high-profile advertisements supporting an increase in minimum pay.The right of Amazon workers to unionize is getting some Republican support as well. Florida Senator Marco Rubio said in a USA Today opinion column that Amazon has “waged a war against working-class values.”“Uniquely malicious corporate behavior like Amazon’s justifies a more adversarial approach to labor relations,” Rubio said. “It is no fault of Amazon’s workers if they feel the only option available to protect themselves against bad faith is to form a union.”Rubio criticized the Seattle-based company for crushing small businesses and competition and for inadequate working conditions during a year of record profits amid pandemic-related shutdowns. He also took issue with what he described as the company’s left-leaning values imposed on workers and retailers.Stuart Appelbaum, head of the retail worker union behind organizing efforts at the Amazon fulfillment center in Alabama, welcomed Rubio’s support and said the fight to support working people “should not be a partisan issue.”Amazon also touted its pay rates in a response to Rubio.“When Senator Rubio says Amazon is ‘waging war on working class values,’ does he mean our $15 starting wage, comprehensive benefits, or the paid parental leave we provide for hourly workers?” a company spokesperson said by email. “If he stands with American workers like he says he does, he should endorse Senator Sanders’s minimum wage bill today.”(Updates with Amazon comment on Bezos availability, Rubio statement, beginning in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Bernie Sanders Invites Jeff Bezos to Hearing on Income Inequality

2021-03-17,"The recent run-up in stocks, an expected economic expansion, and hopes of recovery in consumer demand have kept analysts busy as they continue to shuffle their recommendations. Between the ups and downs in the market, TipRanks, through its comprehensive research tools, continues to scan and examine the prospects of your favorite stocks, bringing you the latest analyst action on them. Without further ado, let's delve deeper into a few of the noteworthy bullish and bearish calls of the day. Upgrades Oppenheimer analyst Christopher Glynn has upgraded Roper Technologies (ROP) to Buy from Hold, given ""positive view of FCF growth profile and increasingly affordable FCF yield, anchored by operating progress around recent heavy acquisition activity and anticipated broadening organic growth profile in coming quarters,"" the analyst said in a research note. Glynn also established a price target of $460 on the stock. Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on ROP, compared to a sector average of 69% A pop culture consumer products company, Funko (FNKO), also received an upgrade from BMO Capital analyst Gerrick Johnson to Hold from Sell on the company's ""innovative new product lines."" Johnson also lifted the stock's price target to $16 from $5. Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on FNKO based on 2 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $17.61 implies downside potential of about 4.8% to current levels. Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Close raised the rating on Ontrak (OTRK) to Buy from Hold and lifted the price target to $46 from $32, following Jonathan Mayhew's appointment as new CEO. Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on OTRK based on 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $47.00 implies upside potential of about 36% to current levels. Cowen & Co. analyst Karl Ackerman lifted Seagate Technology’s (STX) rating from Hold to Buy and raised the price target to $95 from $66. In a note to investors, the analyst said, “We are increasingly convinced STX is transitioning from a period of secular declines toward a multiyear period of growth.” Like Ackerman, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 90% Bullish on STX, compared to a sector average of 69% Alcoa (AA) received an upgrade from Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry. Terry raised the rating from Hold to Buy and even lifted the price target to $36 from $22, citing strong balance sheet position and attractive free cash flows. The analyst expects the company to beat 1Q results. Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AA based on 2 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $28.30 implies downside potential of about 8.8% to current levels. Another Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan upgraded McDonald's (MCD) from Hold to Buy and raised the stock’s price target to $244 from $232. The analyst said, “Over the balance of this year, we think that continued momentum in the U.S. business as well as an arguably underappreciated market share opportunity in the IOM [International Operated Markets] segment should lead to upward revisions to consensus EPS, specifically in 2022e and potentially in 2023e as well.” Furthermore, MCD scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Downgrades Cowen & Co. analyst Doug Schenkel downgraded GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK) from Buy to Hold but lifted the price target to $24.05 from $23.00 after Roche Diagnostics made an all-cash acquisition offer of $1.8 billion for GenMark Diagnostics. From TipRanks’ Smart Score ranking, GenMark gets a 3 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to underperform market expectations. Truist Financial analyst Tristan Richardson downgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Hold from Buy following the company's financial restatements for FY18 and FY19. Due to accounting error news, shares of Plug Power are down over 20% in Wednesday's pre-market trading session. Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 58% Bullish, compared to a sector average of 69%. Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Kuske downgraded Mercer International (MERC) to Hold from Buy, citing the recent run in its stock and uncertainty related to pulp prices over time. Meanwhile, the analyst lifted the price target to $18 from $16 on the stock. However, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on MERC based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $16.80 implies upside potential of about 11.3% to current levels. Guggenheim analyst Glen Santangelo downgraded CVS Health (CVS) to Hold from Buy, as the analyst sees balanced risk/reward after the stock recovery. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on CVS, with 3% of investors reducing their exposure to CVS stock over the last seven days period. National Bank analyst Mike Parkin slashed Kirkland Lake Gold’s (KL) rating to Hold from Buy and lowered the price target from C$65 to C$56 (or $44.96), as the analyst expects the upcoming interim Detour Lake technical report to be a dampener. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on KL, with 2.2% of investors reducing their exposure to KL stock over the last seven days period.

2021-03-17,"Looking at Q4, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) earned $2.14 billion, a 15.18% increase from the preceding quarter. McDonald's sales decreased to $5.31 billion, a 1.92% change since Q3. In Q3, McDonald's earned $2.53 billion, and total sales reached $5.42 billion. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in McDonald's's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, McDonald's posted an ROCE of -0.27%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on MCD ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows McDonald's is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. For McDonald's, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions. Q4 Earnings Recap McDonald's reported Q4 earnings per share at $1.7/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $1.78/share.

2021-04-02,"Restaurants had a tough year in 2020 due to the novel coronavirus. Something like 110,000 U.S. restaurants closed, according to the National Restaurant Association. Meanwhile, restaurant stocks managed to generate a median return of 4% in 2020 despite the industry-wide carnage. Of course, compared to the S&P 500, which gained more than 16% last year, owners of restaurant stocks are hardly giddy. Especially if you didn’t own one of the outliers, such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), which gained 66% in 2020, and is up more than 119% over the past year through March 30. There’s no question that restaurants post-Covid-19 will look a lot different from what they did before the pandemic. However, how restaurants engage with customers isn’t the only thing that’s going to change. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are also going to affect the industry. This ought to alter the restaurant stocks investors choose to own over the next few years. 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds I’ll look at seven trends that ought to be at the center of these changes in 2021 and beyond. I’ll select the restaurant stocks I think can best benefit from each of these trends: Streamlined Menus, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) Virtual Brands, Brinker International (NYSE:EAT) Drive-Thru, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Beverage Subscriptions, BJ’s Restaurants (NASDAQ:BJRI) Technology, YUM Brands (NYSE:YUM) Plant-Based Meals, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Restaurant SPACs, USHG Acquisition Corp., (NYSE:HUGS.UN) Restaurants Stocks: Streamlined Menus, Darden Restaurants (DRI) Source: Shutterstock You wouldn’t know by looking at Darden’s stock performance over the past year that a pandemic has been raging around the globe. Up 166% over the past year and 25% year-to-date, the restaurant chain used Covid-19 as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to streamline some of its menus. Sure, it’s had its challenges over the past year, but it gave the restaurant operator a chance to simplify its menus at Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse. As CEO Gene Lee said last June, when only one out of 100 was buying certain items on its menus, it did little for sales but seriously complicated the kitchen processes. The changes it’s been able to make will positively impact the company for years to come. According to the National Restaurant Association, approximately half the casual and family-dining restaurants and 63% of fine-dining operators shrunk their menus over the past year. Those smaller menus are likely to stay post-Covid-19. Virtual Brands, Brinker International (EAT) Source: Shutterstock Last summer, Brinker International, whose brands include Chili’s Grill & Bar and Maggiano’s Little Italy, launched a virtual brand called It’s Just Wings. Brinker expects the brand to generate $150 million in annual sales in its first full year of operation. Some might call the Brinker operation a ghost kitchen because it only provides pick-up or delivery and no eat-in. Whatever you want to call it, it’s here to stay. Many major chains are figuring out how to implement the virtual brand/ghost kitchen into their operations. “[Ghost kitchens are] going to become a tool for cultivating more business, but it’s got to be a profitable tool for doing so,” Kathy Hold, the sales and channel lead at consultant JPG Resources told Restaurant Dive in October 2020. How’s it worked for Brinker? Well, I’d be lying if I said its business was operating at 100% efficiency. In January, Brinker reported Q2 2021 results. Sales were off by 12.5%, while adjusted profits fell 65.3%, with its Maggiano’s concept suffering far more than Chili’s. 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds I’d expect Brinker to continue to push ideas like It’s Just Wings in the future. Restaurants Stocks: Drive-Thru, McDonald’s (MCD) Source: CHALERMPHON SRISANG / Shutterstock.com I think it was safe to say drive-thrus were bound to become an even bigger part of the restaurant industry when Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) started focusing on this format in 2020. I’m a believer in the Starbucks brand. But I digress. This is about the Golden Arch’s efforts to expand its drive-thru network in the U.S. In late January, McDonald’s announced that its Q4 2020 U.S. same-store sales grew by 5.5% due to strong drive-thru and holiday sales. In the U.S., it plans to open 500 locations in 2021 while modernizing another 1,200. Many of them with a focus on drive-thru. “There continues to be a big focus on drive-thru operations, especially because we’ve seen drive-thru continue to be a bigger percentage of our business,” said Ozan. “There’s still opportunity to continue reducing those service times,” said CFO Kevin Ozan in January. Related to the streamlining of menus, McDonald’s cut 25 seconds off the drive-thru service time in 2020 by simplifying its menu. I continue to see McDonald’s committing to doing what’s necessary to drive sales. In 2021, that’s drive-thru, baby. Beverage Subscriptions, BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI) Source: David Tonelson / Shutterstock.com I had intended to discuss the increasing use of meal subscriptions by restaurant chains in 2021, but I couldn’t resist BJ’s Restaurant’s Brewhouse Beer Club subscription service. It launched March 2 in all of its California locations, with a national rollout throughout 2021. A customer pays $30 upfront and over the next two months gets $75 worth of perks. As part of the service, the customer is also signed up for its frequent-guest program, which provides $10 in points for a $100 spent in-restaurant dining and through takeout. Like a lot of things in the U.S., it’s state-by-state who allows this. Some allow alcohol subscriptions. Some are in the stone age and frown upon it. My guess is those states will be the last to legalize recreational-use cannabis. There’s no question we’re becoming a subscription-based economy. Whether it’s your streaming services, purchase of a new car, software, or a restaurant offering a pizza subscription, the writing is on the wall. 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds Good for BJ’s going all-in on its subscription service. Go big or go home. Restaurant Stocks: Technology, YUM Brands (YUM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com It doesn’t matter what business you’re in, technology is an important part of the operational game plan. Without the data to make decisions, you’re flying blind. On March 24, Yum Brands, the parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, announced that it was buying Tictuk Technologies, an Israeli company that specializes in conversational commerce using social media platforms to bring all the pieces of a restaurant’s engagement with its customer together to provide an enjoyable dining experience. As Yum highlighted in its announcement, the company’s digital sales hit $17 billion in 2020, 45% higher than in 2019, a sign that digital technologies are only going to become even more vital to a restaurant’s success in 2021 and beyond. In March, Yum announced that it had acquired Kvantum, a company that uses artificial intelligence to understand better where the consumer’s head is at when it comes to restaurants and dining. “The right technologies will allow us to better serve customers with the best offer and delicious food in a way that’s most convenient for them,” Yum Brands CFO Chris Turner said in a statement. One thing restaurants have learned during the pandemic is to make it as easy as possible for the customer to order and get their food. Yum’s investments will pay dividends for years to come. Plant-Based Meals, Beyond Meat (BYND) Source: Shutterstock One of the beneficiaries of healthy eating in 2021 will be Beyond Meat. It continues to sign agreements with global restaurant chains to supply its products. On Feb. 25, Beyond Meat announced that it had signed a three-year strategic agreement with McDonald’s that sees it become the preferred supplier for the McPlant patty, currently being tested at McDonald’s restaurants worldwide. They will also look at co-developing other plant-based items for the McDonald’s McPlant platform. “Our new McPlant platform is all about giving customers more choices when they visit McDonald’s,” said Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s executive vice president and chief supply chain officer. “We’re excited to work with Beyond Meat to drive innovation in this space, and entering into this strategic agreement is an important step on our journey to bring delicious, high quality, plant-based menu items to our customers.” If you recall, BYND stock dropped last November when there was confusion about the two companies’ working relationship. February’s announcement puts all of those rumors to bed. 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds Whether we’re talking Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and many of the other meatless alternatives, 2021 will be another busy year for this segment of the industry. Restaurant Stocks: Restaurant SPACs, USHG Acquisition Corp., (HUGS.UN) Source: Dmitry Demidovich/ShutterStock.com When you think of potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), most investors immediately think of electric vehicles, cannabis, fintech and other high-growth areas. Rarely do they think of restaurants. However, with the Feb. 5 filing by USHG Acquisition and its subsequent pricing on Feb. 24, restaurant veteran Danny Meyer is no in the game. And, I believe more restaurateurs will follow. Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group has been around since 1985 when he opened the Union Square Cafe in New York City. USHG does many things: it runs restaurants, consults on the restaurant business, invests in restaurant businesses and anything related to restaurant hospitality. Like all SPACs, it won’t limit its search within the restaurant industry. It plans to look at culture-driven businesses that operate in technology, e-commerce, food and beverage, health, retail, and consumer goods. But given many good restaurants closed in 2020, a few chains that have fallen on hard times could likely be in the mix. Maybe even a private equity situation such as Inspire Brands or some other owner of multiple brands and concepts. It’s about time a SPAC came along that will actually combine with a business that has real revenues and earnings and not just projections for 2024 or beyond.

2021-04-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp., Walmart Inc., Apple Inc. and hundreds of other companies are asking President Joe Biden to update the U.S. pledge under the Paris climate accord to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50%, arguing that the future of the economy is at stake if climate change isn’t adequately addressed.The letter to Biden was signed by 310 companies and comes as the administration prepares a new target to show the rest of the world that the U.S. is serious about confronting climate change after four years of inaction by Donald Trump. People familiar with the deliberations said last week that the White House was considering a target of 50% or higher reductions by 2030 relative to 2005 levels.QuickTake: Why the World Awaits Biden’s Pledge on Climate ChangeThe U.S. is on its way to satisfying a target set under former President Barack Obama, who vowed to reduce planet-warming emissions from 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 as part of the Paris climate pact. Signatories to the 2015 Paris pact are scheduled to reconvene in November in Scotland and pledge reductions through 2030.But the businesses, which also included McDonald’s Corp. and the Coca-Cola Company, argue that cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 is attainable.“To restore the standing of the U.S. as a global leader, we need to address the climate crisis at the pace and scale it demands,” the companies added. “A bold 2030 target is needed to catalyze a zero-emissions future, spur a robust economic recovery, create millions of well-paying jobs, and allow the U.S. to ‘build back better’ from the pandemic.”The Biden administration is expected to unveil its new climate target before an international climate summit it is convening in Washington later this month. An aggressive target, part of a White House push to encourage worldwide action to keep average global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels, would require broad action to clamp down on planet-warming pollution from power plants, automobiles, oil wells and agriculture.“If you raise the bar on our national ambition, we will raise our own ambition to move the U.S. forward on this journey,” the companies said in the letter. “While an effective national climate strategy will require all of us, you alone can set the course by swiftly establishing a bold U.S. 2030 target.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Biden Hears 310 Companies Urge Speed on Climate: ‘Raise the Bar’

2021-04-14,"McDonald's will make its 2m workers take anti-harassment training following a slew of workplace abuse claims. The fast food chain said training would be mandatory for all staff at its 39,000 restaurants worldwide from January in a bid to end harassment, discrimination and violence. Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive of McDonald's, told staff there was a ""business imperative and social obligation to make the restaurants, communities and world more equitable"". He said the company needed to ""strive for - and achieve - consistently high standards, and when we or our franchisees fall short, we must all have a system in place to address those shortfalls immediately"". The new training comes as McDonald's seeks to address allegations that it has ignored harassment taking place in its restaurants. More than 90pc of McDonald's restaurants are franchised. In the past the company has argued that franchisees should be held responsible for actions by staff in their restaurants. More recently, the company has been attempting to make changes following a backlash from workers. More than 50 staff have filed charges and taken legal action against McDonald's. In some of the legal action workers claimed managers had engaged in retaliatory behaviour after they logged complaints over inappropriate behaviour and assaults in the workplace. In the past, McDonald's had trained franchise owners on its harassment policies and set up a complaint hotline for staff, but had not required training for all those within McDonald's-branded restaurants.",McDonald’s makes 2m workers take anti-harassment training

Bartlett said in a research note to investors, “US SSS [same store sales] accelerated to +13.6% in 1Q21 and management expects the 2-year trend (+13.7%) to hold in 2Q21, implying SSS of ~+22.5%. This is ahead of the summer launch of its new loyalty program which has tested “incredibly well.” “The IOM [International Operated Markets] market continues to trail (SSS of +0.6%), but we expect a similar recovery to the US when dining rooms re-open (~50% currently). MCD expects higher check size to persist post-COVD, a positive for the fast food segment as a whole,” Bartlett added. Overall, consensus among analysts is that MCD is a Strong Buy based on 16 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $253.22 implies upside potential of about 7.7% from current levels.

2021-05-05,"(Bloomberg) -- The thousands of people driving those ubiquitous Amazon-branded blue vans aren’t employed by the Seattle leviathan. They work for small, independent businesses with contracts to transport packages for Amazon. But that hasn’t stopped the company from dictating the state of their fingernails—and a whole lot more.“Personal grooming must be maintained at an acceptable level, including but not limited to prevention of unpleasant breath or body odor, modest perfume/cologne, and clean teeth, face/ears, fingernails and hair,” Amazon.com Inc. says in a recent version of its policies governing these small delivery companies, or what the company calls Delivery Service Partners. The document, reviewed by Bloomberg, also requires that drivers refrain from “obscene” social-media posts, undergo training programs approved by Amazon, follow instructions from Amazon’s delivery app and be drug tested whenever Amazon representatives ask.The DSPs are required to adhere to Amazon’s policies, which the company can unilaterally change whenever it wants, according to a recent contract also seen by Bloomberg. They also have to provide Amazon physical access to their premises and all sorts of data the retailer wants, such as geo-locations, speed and movement of drivers—information the company says it has the power to use however it wants. For several years, Amazon has sought to bring order to its farflung delivery operations, which were plagued by accidents, complaints about thrown packages and infamous incidents such as the time a contract driver relieved herself in a customer’s driveway. But in exerting more control over these workers, legal experts say, the company has created legal risks for itself. Amazon has chosen not to directly employ DSP drivers, an arrangement that shields it from costs and liabilities the work incurs. Amazon’s growing sway over its delivery partners, however, could convince courts and government agencies that the company is actually a “joint employer” or “vicariously liable” party.“Amazon seems to want to have its cake and eat it too—to have all the control of an employment relationship, without bearing the costs,” said University of Miami law professor Andrew Elmore, who investigated employment cases as a section chief in the New York Attorney General’s Office. “These documents provide an important signal to courts and to government agencies that this is a relationship to look at.”Amazon is hardly the only company to use such a “fissured” labor model: Franchised, sub-contracted or ostensible contract workers staff most McDonald’s restaurants, have become the majority of Google parent Alphabet’s workforce, are a linchpin of FedEx’s business model and powered Uber’s rise from startup to corporate giant and verb.But the labor model—and Amazon’s in particular—is expected to get a closer look in President Joe Biden’s Washington. Critics have long argued that the company’s stringent delivery standards exacerbate the risk of accidents that can hurt or kill people. Under their agreement with Amazon, DSPs are obligated to “defend and indemnify” the company in cases involving acts by their drivers, including those involving “death or injury” to any human being. David Weil, the Obama administration’s top wage regulator and the author of a landmark book on the dangers of “fissured” work arrangements, is in line to be nominated for his former post at the U.S. Labor Department, Bloomberg Law reported, citing multiple sources familiar with the process.Amazon’s labor arrangements have already been challenged in court, both by drivers seeking to hold the company responsible for unpaid wages, and by victims of collisions who charge that Amazon is responsible for their injuries. Earlier this year, the company agreed to pay $8.2 million in a class-action settlement to resolve Seattle-area DSP employees’ claims of missed breaks and overtime pay without admitting wrongdoing. Amazon is facing similar complaints in a handful of other states. In March, California's Labor Commissioner fined Amazon and Green Messengers Inc., a Southern California DSP, $6.4 million for wage theft. The companies have appealed.Company spokesperson Rena Lunak said in an email that “the suggestion Amazon is seeking to avoid responsibility for delivery drivers is wrong.” She went on to commend the DSPs for their ability to tap into local communities and hire great drivers while taking advantage of Amazon’s logistics experience, technology and support services. “We’re proud that our program has empowered thousands of small businesses to create tens of thousands of jobs with competitive wages of at least $15 an hour and comprehensive benefits,” Lunak said. Amazon became the world’s largest online retailer, in part, by promising shoppers quick delivery, handing off items stored at warehouses to United Parcel Service Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service for the trip to customer doorsteps. The company about a decade ago started building its own capacity to move goods in an effort to accommodate its frantic growth and reduce its reliance on other companies. Today, Amazon is its own largest mailman, delivering more than half of its own shipments. To meet the task, Amazon turns to two groups of drivers: Amazon Flex workers, who like their Uber or Instacart counterparts are classified as independent contractors exempt from U.S. employment laws; and DSP drivers, who are classified as employees of local logistics companies. Amazon started the DSP program in 2018, pitching it as a way to support small entrepreneurs. Previously, the company relied on regional logistics providers, who transported packages with their own fleet of mostly generic delivery trucks. As the new, branded DSP program rolled out, the company cut ties with the regional firms in favor of these new startups that worked almost exclusively for Amazon. The company last year said there were more than 1,300 DSPs across North America and Europe, employing 85,000 people. “This kind of arrangement basically locks in place a low-wage economy, even as Amazon is incredibly profitable,” said Temple University law professor Brishen Rogers.Lawmakers have repeatedly expressed concern about Amazon’s delivery operation. In 2019, three Democratic U.S. senators unsuccessfully asked Amazon to disclose the names of companies it contracts with, citing Buzzfeed News, ProPublica and New York Times reports suggesting that Amazon’s pressure on DSPs leads to unsafe driving with potential deadly consequences. In March, more senators contacted Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos voicing concerns about CNBC and The Verge reports on Amazon’s installation of surveillance cameras in vehicles, which they said could “place unsafe pressure on drivers, and infringe on individuals’ privacy rights.” Amazon has said the video cameras improved drivers’ safety performance.As part of an aggressive social-media response to allegations that the company treats its workers poorly, Amazon's @amazonnews Twitter account in March denied that workers lacked time for bathroom breaks. “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?” the company said, responding to a tweet from Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat from Wisconsin. The post brought quick rebuttals from drivers on social media and in news articles, with many describing having to relieve themselves in the back of trucks or clean up after others who did. Amazon later walked back the statement and apologized to Pocan, saying the tweet was incorrect and “did not contemplate our large driver population.”Amazon’s recent DSP contract, and the policy it requires those companies to follow, includes several provisions shielding the retailer from liability or further embarrassment. DSPs are required to have policies on “employment at-will,” the discretion of management to fire workers for almost any reason or with no stated reason at all. DSPs can’t issue press releases about their Amazon work without the company’s permission. DSPs must handle any disputes with Amazon through individual arbitration hearings rather than class-action lawsuits and must require their drivers to do the same. If DSPs get sued, Amazon has a veto over legal settlements and the option to commandeer the companies’ defense. Amazon is specifically indemnified from liability for death or injury. DSPs must make their employees sign non-disclosure agreements and are also obligated to safeguard Amazon’s information. (The DSPs are required to keep the contract itself confidential too.)The retailer, on the other hand, is contractually guaranteed the data it wants from DSPs and retains the right to physically inspect their premises or make them hand over data—not just while servicing Amazon, but also for another three years after parting ways. DSPs’ data gets used in part to score their performance on metrics such as employee retention and successful deliveries, which Amazon can use to reward some DSPs with bonuses and terminate underperformers. Amazon can also punish DSPs with cancellation fees that it determines and restricts them from terminating their relationship during its busy months of November or December.The Obama administration adopted broader interpretations of a “joint employer,” a company with sufficient control over a group of workers to be legally liable for their treatment, despite not signing their paychecks. Obama’s National Labor Relations Board general counsel prosecuted McDonald’s as a joint employer in a years-long case about alleged retaliation against “Fight For $15” activists at franchised stores, which Trump appointees later voted to settle without finding the burger chain itself liable. (McDonald’s denied wrongdoing.)Trump appointees at both the labor board, which enforces organizing rights, and the U.S. Labor Department, which enforces wage laws, issued regulations taking a more business-friendly view, saying that having authority over workers doesn’t make a company a joint employer unless it meets narrower criteria such as setting their specific pay rates. Biden’s Labor Department has already started the process of rescinding Trump’s rule—which was also rejected by a federal district court—and by the fall Democrats are slated to have a majority on the labor board, where they could do the same.Legal experts said the terms in Amazon’s DSP contract and policies would give plaintiffs and prosecutors a strong case for holding the company responsible under laws governing when a company is “vicariously liable” for harms such as auto accidents as well as deeming the retailer a joint employer under state and federal laws—especially if Biden appointees enact tougher rules.“The degree of control that Amazon is exerting rivals—if it doesn’t exceed—the degree of control that led to the general counsel under the Obama board issuing a complaint against McDonald’s,” said University of California Berkeley law professor Catherine Fisk.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Amazon Work Rules Govern Tweets, Body Odor of Contract Drivers"

2021-05-12,"(Bloomberg) -- When a new ransomware group popped up on the scene last year, the hackers did what’s in vogue for digital extortion organizations these days: They issued a press release.The hackers had already made “millions of dollars” in profit working as affiliates for other groups when they decided to go out on their own, the announcement said. “We created DarkSide because we didn’t find the perfect product. Now we have it.”That product -- essentially a set of hacking tools and related services -- was responsible for the shutdown last week of the biggest fuel pipeline in the U.S., raising gas prices on the Eastern Seaboard and turning DarkSide into a household name.Much of the U.S. has been riveted by the attack ever since, and even Americans who knew little about ransomware are getting a lesson in the uniquely lucrative world of global cybercrime.As its coming-out announcement suggests, DarkSide is less a single hacking group than a sort of criminal franchise. The platform supplies affiliates with tools and follow-up services in much the same way McDonald’s Corp. supplies local store owners with pre-made soft serve and frozen hamburger patties.“These guys provide the marketing, the people who handle customer success, as well as the actual ransomware,” said Mark Arena, chief executive officer of the cybersecurity firm Intel 471, which tracks DarkSide. “Fortune 500 CEOs would be impressed with the efficiency of the business model.”List of VictimsThat model has helped the group rack up scores of victims beginning late last summer, ranging from oil field services companies to law firms to banks.An unpublished analysis by BAE Systems Applied Intelligence found that most DarkSide victims were U.S. companies, but the hackers also hit firms in Europe, South Africa and Brazil. The report noted that affiliates are asked not to attack targets within the borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a group of nations that includes Russia and much of the former Soviet Union, possibly indicating the hackers’ home base.Data posted to the group’s dark web page suggest that victims included Dixie Group Inc., a major U.S. manufacturer of carpets and rugs; the farm products supplier Carolina Eastern Inc.; and Paslin Co., a Michigan company that makes welding machinery for the auto industry. Representatives for the three companies didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but the Dixie Group in April disclosed a ransomware hack.None of those garnered the kind of attention that has resulted from the attack on Colonial Pipeline, which operates more than 5,000 miles of pipeline that ship gasoline and jet fuel from Houston up the East Coast to the area around New York City.There is some evidence that DarkSide did not intend for the hack to have so great an impact. The group’s operators released a statement Monday saying that they had no interest in geopolitics, and weren’t even in control of which companies get attacked using their platform.That could very well be true, said Adrian Nish, head of cyber for BAE Systems Applied Intelligence. “The traditional affiliate model is like a distributor in business,” he said. “You build the tools but then scale up by getting a whole lot of people to use your tools and services.”In DarkSide’s case, that includes not just the actual ransomware used to encrypt data on a victims’ computers, but also services like making calls to those victims and also hosting a website where sensitive data stolen during attacks can be posted. Ransom demands easily reach into the millions of dollars for large companies, and DarkSide takes a 10% to 25% cut off the top of any payment, according to Intel 471’s Arena.Ransom NegotiationsHe said Intel 471 analysts were able to observe a negotiation between DarkSide and a large U.S. victim over several days in January. The hackers began by demanding $30 million, which would double if payment wasn’t made by a defined date. The hackers also threatened to release sensitive data stolen from the company unless it paid, providing samples to validate the threat.During the negotiations, the hackers said they had encrypted 500 of the company’s main data servers, plus hundreds of back-up servers, a trick to make it harder for victims to recover from the attack. After four days of haggling, the company paid more than $14 million in ransom, according to an Intel 471 report on the event.The earliest cybersecurity experts can find traces of the criminals behind DarkSide is around 2013, when the same hackers were attacking financial organizations in Russia, before moving on in subsequent years to targets in the Middle East, Europe and United States, according to Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Inc.CrowdStrike dubbed that earlier organization Carbon Spider, and by 2016 the group had lost some of its hackers, who split off and formed their own crime organization focused on the financial sector.By 2020, some of the hackers were using ransomware from another group, called REvil, before launching the “ransomware as service program” called DarkSide that hit Colonial Pipeline, according to CrowdStrike.Some ransomware groups have vicious reputations -- hitting hospitals during the pandemic, for example -- but DarkSide has tried to cultivate a reputation for professionalism, and even humanism.Rules Against NonprofitsThey have rules against attacking hospitals and nonprofits, according to an analysis of the group’s postings by the cybersecurity firm eSentire. And they say they have donated several thousand dollars to a charity supporting disadvantaged children and another one that works to provide clean drinking water in Africa.At one point the group offered to provide stock traders with insider information from victim companies, which they could use to make money on the market -- a move that appeared to be an attempt to cultivate a Robin Hood-esque reputation for spreading corporate wealth, according to screen shots of the group’s blog provided by eSentire.Following all the attention garnered by the Colonial hack, the group vowed to be more careful in vetting affiliates and keeping an eye on the victims they are targeting. “Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society. From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future,” the group said in a statement posted on its dark web page.BAE’s Nish said he believes that DarkSide’s carefully cultivated image is just a marketing ploy. The group does pick its targets for ideological reasons, he said. Like other ransomware groups, DarkSide has learned that large manufacturing companies often have cyber insurance and pay quickly.“You hear this talk of the geopolitical stuff, but this is really about money,” Nish said. “These are criminals and they act rationally; they do what they need to make money.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",DarkSide Hackers Mint Money With Ransomware Franchise

On average, those salaries were 3% higher for men than women. Though certain markets have bigger gaps than others. In London, men have 10% higher pay, compared to 5% in the San Francisco Bay Area and 7% in New York.The gap shrunk slightly from 2019, when male candidates got higher offers 65% of the time, and received an average pay of 4% more than women. It improved for people of color too, as Black candidates saw wages that were 4% lower than the baseline in 2020 compared to a gap of 5% in 2019.“We were pleasantly surprised and excited to see that the gap is narrowing in terms of the wage gap, but we have a long way to go,” said Josh Brenner, chief executive officer at Hired. “We continue to see that underrepresented groups across the board are paid less than their White male counterparts for the same role.”The tech industry is notorious for its bro culture, defined by high-flying companies that are mostly male and have long had a history of widespread bias. While women are entering the field in greater numbers and starting to move up the ranks, progress is slow, and is especially reflected in pay. It’s also taken on a new prominence since last year’s Black Lives Matter protests, as companies have placed a renewed focus on narrowing racial inequity.The discrepancies can often be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Women expected to earn 6% less than men in 2019 compared to 3% in 2020, improving alongside the actual wage gap. The two are so strongly correlated that a narrowing gap in expectations can end the resulting disparity entirely, Brenner said.“People can get stuck in a cycle of having lower pay over time because they truly don’t know,” Brenner said. “They don’t know what is the average or what is the fair compensation for the role, for the experience that they have.”One of the best ways for businesses to move toward pay equality is by being transparent with compensation data, Brenner said. Companies like Starbucks Corp. and McDonald’s Corp. are increasingly releasing more statistics about the breakdown of their workforces. More may follow suit under President Joe Biden’s Paycheck Fairness Act, which requires employers to provide pay information data regarding the sex, race and national origin of employees to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to help enforce federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination.Hired surveyed more than 2,000 tech employees over the course of last year. It also drew data from its network of over 10,000 participating companies.

2021-05-20,"Carlyle Group's Nina Gong sat through five-hour conference calls in January last year with panicking chief executives (CEOs) as the first coronavirus lockdowns decimated sales figures globally. Fast-forward to the present - and the world's second-largest private-equity firm is reaping profits as China's economy rebounds from the impact of the pandemic. Carlyle's stake in Chinese short-video and e-commerce giant ByteDance is soaring in value; McDonald's China franchise plans 500 new store openings this year; and the US$260 billion asset manager is shepherding a clutch of Chinese firms towards listings in New York and Hong Kong. Carlyle-backed companies eyeing initial public offerings (IPOs) this year include JD Logistics, ANE, Spark Education, Adicon and Abbisko Therapeutics, according to people familiar with the deals. The Washington-based firm is also looking to sell its stake in Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite Telecommunications to strategic investors, the people familiar said. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. ""2021 we see as another great year for exits. The valuations are high and the market is open for IPOs,"" Gong, Carlyle's head of retail and consumer deals in China, said during an interview with the Post. Globally, Carlyle sold US$6.4 billion worth of assets in the first quarter. Gong said her roller-coaster ride over the past 15 months began with advising retailers on their fight for survival amid store closures, and has reached the cutting edge of e-commerce in the world's largest online market. Online sales captured about a quarter of China's consumer market last year, the greatest proportion globally, as the pandemic forced retailers to accelerate their e-commerce push. As a result of this mass digital pivot, China ﻿is likely to overtake the US as the world's largest consumer market in the coming years, senior officials in China have forecast. Chinese retailers are also benefiting from US-China trade tensions, which are prompting more Chinese consumers to buy local. ""The sense of nationalism and a preference for local designers is at an all-time high,"" said Gong. Carlyle has invested more than US$2 billion in China's consumer sector since 2000. US and European retailers are keen to get in on the action, but are wary of stiff local competition and political pitfalls. Retail giants Nike and H&M faced a backlash in China this year after expressing concern over alleged Uygur exploitation in cotton fields. ""Everybody wants to access the Chinese consumer, but nobody wants Chinese competition. So, more and more, they are turning to partners like us,"" said Patrick Siewert, managing director of Carlyle's Asia advisory team on investments in consumer and retail businesses. Carlyle is snapping up retailers, such as the UK's END, and helping them expand in China. Carlyle sold Italian brands Golden Goose and Moncler after advising them on Asian store openings. It has 20 Chinese companies in its portfolio, seven of which are in the consumer sector. It did not always look like a slam dunk. Carlyle's senior executives were stunned as they tracked the coronavirus outbreak back in January last year. ""Logistics volumes in the portfolio fell to zero and stayed there for about three weeks. This was shocking. We'd never seen anything like this,"" Jason Thomas, Carlyle's head of global research, said on a recent call with investors. Carlyle had to hit pause on some acquisitions. Siewert could not leave Hong Kong to conduct due diligence on Newcastle-headquartered END. The deal did not close until last month. At the peak of the pandemic in China, about a quarter of McDonald's restaurants closed. To cope, the Chicago-headquartered fast-food chain, which Carlyle had backed in 2017, ﻿ramped up deliveries to about 30 per cent of orders from 20 per cent in 2019. As China eased lockdowns, McDonald's largest franchise outside the US was able to reopen about 98 per cent of its restaurants by April and shared the temperature of its kitchen staff flipping burgers with diners. Still, most clients preferred to keep their distance: McDonald's customers placed around 80 per cent of their orders digitally, on smartphones or self-order kiosks, as of the end of last year, up from 40 per cent pre-pandemic. ""It won't be too long before that is 90 per cent of orders,"" said Siewert, a director on the board of McDonald's China and Hong Kong. Carlyle used the early experience of executives in China to prepare peers in North America and Europe as the outbreak turned into a pandemic. For one, McDonald's China CEO, Phyllis Cheung, spoke to other Carlyle-backed managers about how she oversaw the fast-food franchise's digital overhaul. McDonald's adopted an omnichannel tactic, a mix of online and bricks-and-mortar shops. It had 3,787 restaurants in China at the end of last year and has said it will have 4,500 stores by the end of 2022. Carlyle plans to hold onto its stake for now, as it sees potential for 10,000 stores in the long term, according to a person familiar with the matter. McDonald's is expanding its restaurant chain in China. Photo: Bloomberg alt=McDonald's is expanding its restaurant chain in China. Photo: Bloomberg Smaller companies in Carlyle's portfolio reached out to customers over the networks of China's giant internet platforms, including those of Tencent Holdings, Alibaba Group Holding and ByteDance. Carlyle's Gong encouraged home furnishings company Loulai Lifestyle Technology, which has about 3,000 stores, to launch an application on Tencent's mini applications programme, run by its social-media app WeChat. ""Because of this little tool, Loulai was able to recover 70 per cent of its original offline business sales, as of February 2020,"" said Gong, who led Carlyle's April 2019 purchase of a 10 per cent stake in the firm. Carlyle saw Shenzhen-listed Loulai's share price dive to 7.86 yuan by the end of 2019 and then recover to 14.79 yuan as of this month. Loulai also stabilised sales by creating a task force to sell inventory on Alibaba's Taobao Live, China's largest e-commerce live-streaming platform, and via ByteDance's short-video unit Douyin. Alibaba owns the Post. More than 24 million live-streaming events took place last year, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. Online retail sales jumped 30 per cent in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier, said the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Douyin, the Chinese version of viral app TikTok, has set a target of shifting 600 billion yuan (US$92 billion) worth of gross merchandise value over its e-commerce platform, up from 170 billion yuan last year, according to an internal memo cited by Bloomberg on April 16. ""They [ByteDance] are developing their own e-commerce platform and they expect to grow very fast - outgrow[ing] the overall e-commerce sector,"" said Gong. Carlyle invested US$150 million in ByteDance in a round of fundraising that pegged the private company's value at US$180 billion as of December last year. The surge in e-commerce was not entirely smooth. It provoked an antitrust crackdown on powerful internet platforms, which ensnared the world's largest financial technology platform, Ant Group, as well as smaller Carlyle-backed payments company Du Xiaoman Financial. Carlyle owns 0.35 per cent of Ant Group after investing in 2018. ByteDance was fined in January for spreading vulgar content. The world's most valuable unicorn said it was not yet ready to IPO. Still, the economy has regained enough of its poise for financial sponsors to liquidate a host of investments. Carlyle sold shares in China Literature, Microport and Zhongmei last year, a relatively high number of exits. Venture capitalists have sold about US$26 billion worth of equity in Chinese companies in the year to date, and are on track to equal last year's tally, which was at least a 10-year high, according to alternative markets data provider Preqin. Chinese regulators halted Ant Group's record-breaking IPO amid a broad crackdown on the digital economy.

Photo: AP Carlyle will be showcasing its exits and return on investments to big money managers as it seeks to raise capital for its latest fund, Carlyle Asia Partners Growth II, LP, according to a US filing. Carlyle is currently harvesting from its fund Carlyle Asia Partners IV, which has a 1.9 gross multiple on invested capital (MOIC) ahead of exiting from investments in companies such as McDonald's China and the same fund that was prevented by regulators from potentially exiting Ant Group during its IPO last year. Carlyle Asia Partners IV invested US$100 million in JD Logistics ahead of its upcoming IPO. Its Carlyle Asia Partners V had a MOIC of 1.4 times as of March 31. Carlyle sold Venice-headquartered sneaker brand Golden Goose Deluxe Brand to another private-equity fund called Permira in February last year after helping it expand in China, but retains about 10 per cent of the firm. The investment had a 3.4 times gross return as of the end of last year. Carlyle's investment in puffer jackets brand Moncler notched up an MOIC of 5.69 times, according to people familiar. Carlyle-backed Chinese cosmetics firm Yatsen Holding and China's largest mobile device charging service provider Energy Monster made their stock market debuts on US markets in November and April, respectively. ""For sure, [we'll] see more IPOs in China and Hong Kong,"" said Gong, who said she was now travelling every week for business on virtually full flights around China.

2021-05-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Animal rights activists are blocking supplies to some 1,300 U.K. restaurants operated by McDonald’s Corp. in an attempt to persuade the fast-food giant to adopt an entirely plant-based menu.About 50 protesters from Animal Rebellion have blockaded all four of the company’s U.K. distribution centers, the organization said in a statement. Using trucks and bamboo structures, the group intends to protest at the sites for at least 24 hours, it said.“McDonald’s is just a symbol of a much bigger problem, the entire animal agriculture industry,” according to Animal Rebellion. “These protests happening across the country are calling out the animal agriculture industry for their part in the global climate crisis.”A spokesperson for McDonald’s said the company is “assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items.”Meat suppliers have faced increased pressure from consumers and investors as scientists say the industry is a major contributor to methane emissions and deforestation. Livestock farming accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Animal Rebellion, a group allied with the climate occupy movement Extinction Rebellion, has in the past targeted offices linked to agrifood giant Cargill Inc. and London’s historic Smithfield meat market.McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski has previously called plant-based food “an ongoing consumer trend.” The world’s biggest restaurant chain, which is rolling out its McPlant burger in some markets, also has a supply arrangement with Beyond Meat Inc., maker of plant-based meat substitutes.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Vegan Activists Block McDonald’s U.K. Burger Supplies in Protest
2021-05-22,"Activist group Animal Rebellion has blockaded four McDonald's Corp (NYSE: MCD) distribution centers in the United Kingdom. The group is calling attention to the role that raising livestock plays in climate change and is pushing McDonald's to transform into an all plant-based company by 2025. Protestors are using trucks and bamboo structures to disrupt McDonald's supply chain, Animal Rebellion said in a statement. Animal Rebellion says McDonald's is ""just a symbol of a much bigger problem, the entire animal agriculture industry."" The group says a transition to a plant-based food system is needed to stop the climate crisis and end the suffering of animals. McDonald's is frequently a target for activists given its size, brand recognition and emphasis on beef. Cattle-raising uses huge amounts of land and is among the main reasons behind deforestation, including in the Amazon rainforest. The meat and dairy industry also is a major source of greenhouse gases, in addition to having a reputation for factory farming. Campaigners point out that the land could be used much more efficiently to feed people by using it for plant-based food. The group's blockade began on Saturday. The activists plan to stay for 24 to 48 hours. McDonald's has 1,300 outlets in the U.K., according to the BBC. McDonald's U.K. office told the BBC that it is ""assessing the impact"" the protest is having on supplies. The company announced in November that it plans to introduce a plant-based burger called the McPlant. Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ: BYND) co-created the plant-based patty that is to become the McPlant, Beyond Meat said at the time. McDonald's plans could extend to chicken and breakfast sandwiches as well.
