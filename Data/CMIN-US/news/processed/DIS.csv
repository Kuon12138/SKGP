The entertainment giant said that Disney Plus subscribers had risen by 8.7m in the first three months of the year, a marked drop from the 21.2m at the end of 2020. Its US-focused streaming services, ESPN+ and Hulu, also saw slowing growth. The figures are the latest indication that the streaming boom of the last year, which saw the likes of Disney and Netflix sign up tens of millions of new subscribers, is fading. It came despite the success of the Marvel miniseries WandaVision, which premiered during the quarter.

2021-05-14,"After a slippery couple of days, stocks regained their footing on Thursday and continued that momentum on Friday. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades for next week. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Coinbase (COIN) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) started off higher on the day, but ended up falling about 2.5% after reporting earnings. This is certainly not how investors were hoping the stock’s public debut would go over the last month. Shares rallied to the 10-day moving average and failed to reclaim it. In fact, this measure acted as resistance. Keep that in mind going forward, as this level needs to be reclaimed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips If it’s reclaimed in the semi-near future, see if the 21-day moving average can be reclaimed next. That will bring up a test of the $300 level. On the downside, keep a close eye on the $250 mark. A few weeks ago, I said that level was a buy, as it’s the reference price that was set before Coinbase came public. However, we have already got our $50-plus bounce in the stock. 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List Now we watch. If it acts as support again, traders should be able to get a nice bounce. However, if it breaks it could trigger more selling pressure. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Airbnb (ABNB) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Despite a strong day in the markets, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is not exactly tearing it up after earnings. In fact, we have an inside day in the stock, which is highly surprising. I bet the premium sellers weren’t banking on that calm of a reaction from the stock. In any regard, let’s see if ABNB stock can take out its two-day high here near $142.25. Above quickly puts the $145 area in play, which has been resistance this week. Above that, and the 10-day moving average is in play. Above $150, and perhaps we see $165 and the 21-week moving average. On the downside, however, keep an eye on this week’s low at $131.28. A daily close below this mark could put $121 to $125 in play, the post-earnings low range. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Farfetch (FTCH) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider I really like Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) for the long term. Like most growth stocks though, Farfetch has been struggling. Shares dipped in Thursday’s after-hours trading on earnings, but investors weren’t having it today, jamming it higher by more than 12% on Friday. Despite the rally, the stock is struggling with the 10-day and 50-week moving averages. Notice the stock remains in a downtrend. If it can get above these marks, it puts the 21-day and 200-day moving averages in play, as well as channel resistance. Above that, and who knows — $50 wouldn’t be out of the question. 7 Fitness Stocks Hoping to Take Peloton's Crown A break of $40 on the downside could put the pre-earnings low back in play. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Disney (DIS) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider The House of Mouse isn’t getting too many cheers after earnings, with Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock down about 2.6% on the day. However, it is hammering off the session low nicely — not that you can tell by the weekly chart above. The stock broke below the April low earlier this week. That was a warning to bulls who are trading this name (not investing in it). The stock was also below the 10-week and 21-week moving averages. Although good earnings could have easily rectified the situation, the setup was not all that encouraging coming into the report. Again, that doesn’t mean Disney couldn’t have popped — just look at what FTCH stock did — but that short-term traders had several reasons not be involved with this one on the long side. In any regard, it’s bouncing even before testing into that $167 to $170 area. Let’s see if it can reclaim some of the levels we mentioned above. If they continue to act as resistance, it’s worth remaining cautious on this one. Below $167 could put the 10-month and 200-day moving averages in play, as well as $153.

2021-05-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. tumbled the most in almost 11 months Friday after saying it attracted fewer streaming customers than expected last quarter, stoking fears that a key engine of the century-old company’s transformation may be losing some momentum.The entertainment giant on Thursday reported 103.6 million Disney+ customers at the end of last quarter, shy of the 110.3 million projected in the Bloomberg Consensus. The shares fell as much as 5.4% in New York trading Friday, the biggest decline since June 24.The results marked a rare stumble for Disney+, which has enjoyed explosive growth over the past year and a half, elating investors along the way. After its launch in November 2019, the service quickly became a formidable rival to Netflix Inc. and provided a contrast to pandemic-fueled declines in other Disney businesses.But in recent months, a lack of new programming made it harder for Disney to lure as many subscribers as hoped. Production delays caused by Covid-19 have taken a toll on the company, along with other streaming services. Netflix also posted disappointing subscriber numbers last quarter, citing a dearth of programming.“We met the expectations that we’ve set for ourselves,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek said on Bloomberg Television. “We added 30 million subscribers in the first two quarters. We’re happy with where we ended up and think we have a great road paved to the guidance we gave in December” of as many as 260 million subscribers globally by the end of 2024.Disney also announced new deals with Major League Baseball and Spain’s LaLiga soccer league, the latest in a series of sports-programming deals by the media giant. Quarterly profit came in ahead of Wall Street projections. Excluding some items, Disney’s earnings rose to 79 cents a share, compared with a 32-cent average estimate. But sales fell to $15.6 billion, missing estimates of $15.9 billion for the period ended April 3.The company’s streaming revenue per subscriber also declined last quarter, falling 29% to $3.99 a month due to the launch of a less-expensive service in India.Traditional TVDisney’s traditional TV business, meanwhile, posted a profit of $2.85 billion -- a 15% increase from the same period last year. Higher affiliate fees and lower programming costs countered a drop in advertising. But the company also said operating income in the division will shrink this quarter because of a $1.2 billion increase in programming and production costs at ESPN.With Disney’s parks now reopened everywhere but Paris, that unit, a lucrative one in good times, will be more of a focus for investors. The business lost $406 million in the quarter.The U.S. government’s decision Thursday to relax masking guidelines could hasten the turnaround for the division.“We think it’s going to make for a much more comfortable experience this summer in the heat and humidity of Walt Disney World in Orlando,” Chapek said.The movie studio generated $312 million in profit, in a quarter where the company’s newest animated film, “Raya and the Last Dragon,” was released online to Disney+ customers for an additional $30 fee, as well as in theaters. Two other pictures, “Black Widow” and “Jungle Cruise,” will have similar hybrid releases in July.But Disney is getting back to exclusive theatrical releases -- its strength before the pandemic. “Free Guy” and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” will both play in theaters for 45 days before going online, Chapek said.Shorter WindowTheater chains have been eagerly waiting for big studios to embrace cinemas again, and they’ve had to make some compromises. The 45-day window is still far shorter than the three months that theaters used to enjoy.Disney shares fell as low as $168.78 Friday, their lowest price since Feb. 1. The shares were down 1.6% this year through the close Thursday in New York.Even with the shortfall in new subscribers, Disney+ has been “way more successful than anyone thought,” said Markus Hansen, an analyst at Vontobel Quality Growth.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“The streaming user shortfall ... at Disney+ is a glitch in the grand scheme of Disney’s overall investment thesis that will bring back the focus to the company’s legacy businesses, notably its theme parks and film studios. ... Disney’s parks can rebound quickly on pent-up demand, an easing of Covid-19 mandates and pandemic-induced cost efficiencies.”--Geetha Ranganathan, media analystClick here to read the research.And its expansion globally remains in its early stages. Disney+ is set to launch in Malaysia on June 1 and Thailand on June 30. A Star+-branded Latin American service is due Aug. 31.“Disney still has room to run,” Hansen said.Disney also said that subscriptions picked up in the latter part of the quarter and that it’s nearly back to full production for film and TV. More Marvel and Star Wars shows are coming, building on the success of “WandaVision,” “The Mandalorian” and “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.”“We’re spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that’s going to keep consumers coming back,” Chapek said on a conference call with investors. That will drive subscriptions and improve “our engagement growing across all of our platforms.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Disney Falls Most in 11 Months After Streaming Growth Falters

2021-05-14,"The Walt Disney Company (DIS) reported mixed second-quarter results as revenues declined year-on-year while net income increased. The media and entertainment giant posted revenues of $15.6 billion, down 13% year-on-year versus analysts’ expectations of $15.86 billion. Disney reported adjusted earnings of $0.79 per share, up 32% year-on-year, blowing past consensus estimates of $0.26 per share. The Walt Disney Company’s CEO, Bob Chapek said, “We’re pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses, and we remain focused on ramping up our operations while also fueling long-term growth for the Company. This is clearly reflected in the reopening of our theme parks and resorts, increased production at our studios, the continued success of our streaming services, and the expansion of our unrivaled portfolio of multiyear sports rights deals for ESPN and ESPN+.” The company’s direct-to-consumer services including Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu experienced a surge in paid subscribers in Q2 with 103.6 million, 13.8 million, and 41.6 million subscribers, respectively. However, the average monthly revenue per paid subscriber was down 29% year-on-year for Disney+ in Q2 to $3.99. Disney’s theme parks business revenues plunged 44% year-on-year to $3.2 billion, while this segment suffered a loss of $406 million in the second quarter versus a profit of $756 million in the same quarter last year. This was a result of a majority of its theme parks being closed around the world or operating at a reduced capacity due to the pandemic while sailings of cruise ships were suspended. DIS stated that as operations at its theme park and cruise ships resume, and as film and production shoots including live sports events restart, the company expects to incur additional costs of $1 billion in FY21 to “address government regulations and implement safety measures for our employees, talent and guests”. (See The Walt Disney Company stock analysis on TipRanks) Prior to its earnings, Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson reiterated a Buy and a price target of $218 on the stock. Mitchelson noted that investors are expecting that subscribers to the company’s Disney+ streaming service are likely to moderate to a level of 104 million. The analyst added, “Overall, we expect in line F2Q results, but a favorable forward outlook, including: (a) pent up Parks/Cruise Ship demand and a structurally improved cost structure suggesting a return to Parks profitability in F3Q and returning to FY19’s EBIT level in FY22; (b) ARPU increases driving greater streaming revenue momentum than forecast; and (c) soft U.S. advertising in F2Q rebounding with the economy driving F3Q+. Despite shares consolidating this year, we remain bullish as earnings power should be clarified.” Overall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $215.31 indicates upside potential of around 20.7% from current levels.

2021-05-15,"Benzinga has examined the prospects for many investor favorite stocks over the past week. The past week's bullish calls included the iPhone maker and software and aerospace giants. Semiconductor and ride-sharing leaders were among the bearish calls seen during the week. The big U.S. indexes ended another volatile week in the red, led by a more than 2% retreat in the Nasdaq. The struggle between growth and value remains, as tech stocks continue to struggle. Inflation fears were boosted by higher than expected Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index figures, leaving investors to keep a close eye on what the Federal Reserve may do next. While the flow of earnings reports (which have been largely positive) began to slow, a reopening bellwether disappointed last week. Attention turns to the major retailers this coming week. The past week also saw a cyberattack with major consequences and the expansion of COVID-19 vaccine efforts, while the semiconductor shortage continues to hurt the auto industry and others. Also, it was another rollercoaster ride for cryptocurrency investors, and Securities and Exchange Commission rule changes could affect retail investors. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors.

2021-05-16,"AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is reportedly in talks to merge its media assets with DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS INC (NASDAQ: DISCA). What Happened: The talks are ongoing, and a deal could be announced as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported today, citing people familiar with the matter. It is unclear what the the structure of the deal might look like, but such a merger could create an entertainment colossus. AT&T owns CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT and the Warner Bros. studio. Discovery owns networks including HGTV, Food Network, TLC and Animal Planet. Why It Matters: The proposed deal could create an entertainment giant to compete with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). HBO and HBO Max now have 63.9 million global subscribers, compared with over 100 million for Walt Disney Co's Disney+ and 207.6 million for Netflix.

2021-05-18,"(Bloomberg) -- James Bond and Rocky Balboa may be past their prime, but a nearly insatiable appetite for content in today’s streaming era has boosted their appeal.The characters are from a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer portfolio of movies and shows that has attracted a $9 billion offer from Amazon.com Inc., according to a person familiar with that matter, part of a massive reshuffling of streaming content this week. AT&T Inc. is merging its WarnerMedia division with Discovery Inc. in a deal that will create a new media company with purportedly more material than Netflix Inc., the market leader in streaming.The frenzy also is boosting shares of another potential target, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. The film-and-TV studio jumped 7.3% on Tuesday. Its stock is now up 57% for the year.The latest speculation follows bidding wars in recent years for back catalogs of sitcoms, with “South Park” and “Seinfeld” fetching $500 million or more apiece. The question now is whether the biggest streaming providers will further consolidate the market, gathering larger arsenals of content and squeezing out smaller rivals.“There’s going to be a handful of winners in the streaming wars, and content is always going to be the important factor,” said Tuna Amobi, a media and entertainment analyst at CFRA Research. “Everyone is upping their spending significantly. It seems almost what you have to do to be considered a very serious or viable competitor.”The few studios that haven’t sold out completely to streaming services have still engaged in lucrative one-off deals. In March, Netflix paid $450 million for the rights to the next two films in the “Knives Out” franchise, produced by Media Rights Capital and distributed by Lions Gate. The deal was one of the largest movie-rights deals ever, and worth $140 million more than what the first movie generated in global box-office sales.Streamers are also paying big for old ideas. Walt Disney Co. said it will spend $16 billion on content a year by 2024, largely by plumbing the depths of its own intellectual property. The company announced in December that it’s making 10 Star Wars series and 10 Marvel series, as well as shows based on characters from “Moana,” “Zootopia” and “Big Hero 6.” Even Dug, the dog from Pixar’s 2009 film “Up,” will get his own spotlight -- all part of a push to bolster the company’s 18-month-old Disney+ service.“The streaming market is one where scale, particularly in content, is important,” said Ian Whittaker, founder of analysis firm Liberty Sky Advisors. “These players are now effectively global pay-TV providers -- and weaker players risk throwing good money after bad.”A deal for MGM would give Amazon hit franchises like James Bond, “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Hobbit” -- though it’s unclear how soon they could appear on the company’s streaming service given existing distribution deals. The AT&T transaction, meanwhile, merges programs such as “Friends,” “The Big Bang Theory,” Game of Thrones” and “The Wire” with Discovery’s reality-TV shows and Food Network.Vulnerable PlayersAs streaming giants get bigger, the most vulnerable players are the smaller U.S. media companies that are outmatched both in their home countries and overseas, Whittaker said.“What, for example, is ViacomCBS’s strategy in a streaming world split between the global giants and consolidated national players in Europe?” Whittaker asked.Amobi said the strategy is more clear for a company like Amazon, which has the heft to become one of the few essential streamers for everyday entertainment consumers -- and boost the value of the online retailer’s Prime membership. Amazon is less dependent on streaming than its media rivals, since the service is essentially an add-on to Prime, its free-shipping program. But if the purchase of MGM goes through, Amazon may also be able to make extra money on the content by licensing it to third parties.“Consider that Netflix is spending, this year, north of $20 billion,” Amobi said. “If you’re Amazon video, you just have to take notice. You can’t just sit idly by when your competitors are looking to spend.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon’s Talks With MGM Bring Fresh Shine to Old Movie Libraries
2021-05-18,It's becoming increasingly clear that studios are able to cost-effectively deliver their product directly to consumers.,This 1 Comment From Discovery's CEO Should Terrify Cable Companies
2021-05-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is in talks to buy James Bond movie company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, according to a person familiar with the matter, potentially taking one of the last major independent film studios off the market.Amazon is considering a bid of about $9 billion, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Discussions could still fall apart and details such as price may change, the person said. The Information and Variety previously reported on the talks.An agreement would cap a rush of streaming deals that are set to make 2021 a record year for media takeovers. Reports about the discussions came on the day that AT&T Inc. announced its plan to create a new entertainment company by merging assets with Discovery Inc. in an entity that will be valued at about $130 billion including debt.The proliferation of streaming services, including newer arrivals such as Disney+, HBO Max and Paramount+, has put pressure on Amazon to acquire more programming. MGM’s vast backlog also provides plenty of material at a time when production of new shows and movies is still recovering from the pandemic.MGM and Amazon declined to comment on deal talks.More than $80 billion in media takeovers have been announced so far this year, according to data collected by Bloomberg. That puts 2021 on track to be the busiest period for the industry since at least 2000, when AOL and Time Warner Inc. announced plans to combine.MGM has been seen as a takeover target for years, but was never able to close a sale. The company made a fresh push last year, when the Wall Street Journal reported it hired advisers to solicit offers.How the Pandemic Pressed Fast Forward on the Streaming Wars: QuickTakeMGM also discussed other scenarios with tech giants. MGM, whose library includes the “Rocky” films and “Silence of the Lambs,” held talks with Apple Inc. and Netflix Inc. about taking its new James Bond film directly to streaming. But the company said last year that it’s committed to a theatrical release for the film, which is currently slated for Oct. 8 in the U.S.Amazon, meanwhile, is reshuffling its entertainment operations with the return of longtime executive Jeff Blackburn. He briefly left the e-commerce company to join Silicon Valley venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners. But now he’s taking command of Amazon’s entire entertainment division, including the Prime Video streaming service, Amazon Studios and the video-game-streaming site Twitch.An Amazon acquisition of MGM would be its largest purchase since it bought Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion in 2017.Talking to ChairmanAmazon’s bid for MGM is being handled by video executive Mike Hopkins, according to Variety. He’s dealing directly with MGM Chairman Kevin Ulrich, the publication said.MGM traces its roots back to the 1920s merger of Marcus Loew’s Metro films with a film company run by Hollywood legend Louis B. Mayer. While making great pictures like “Dr. Zhivago” and “2001: A Space Odyssey,” MGM drifted in and out of financial distress in the second half of the 20th century. Over the decades it was owned by Time Inc., CNN founder Ted Turner and more than once by the late billionaire Kirk Kerkorian.Now, it’s one of the last large movie studios that’s maintained its independence from larger media groups. Warner Bros. is now part of AT&T, Walt Disney Co. acquired 20th Century Fox, Paramount is owned by ViacomCBS Inc., and Universal Pictures is controlled by Comcast Corp.There’s been speculation before about Amazon acquiring entertainment companies. It was previously seen as a possible buyer of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the movie chain, with some investors confusing it with AMC Networks Inc., the owner of cable channels.Investors suffered a similar sort of confusion on Monday, with the Information report boosting shares of MGM Resorts International, a casino company that isn’t part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM Resorts stock jumped as much as 5.8% in late trading before quickly retreating.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Considers Buying Movie Studio MGM for $9 Billion

2021-05-19,"Despite having its theme parks shuttered or vacant for most of FY20, Disney’s (DIS) streaming service, Disney+, had been keeping the company afloat, with subscription numbers soaring during that time. However, on May 14, Disney released numbers which indicated a deceleration in subscriber growth for Q2FY21. Despite this drop, Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo remains bullish on the stock. Cahall maintained a Buy rating on the stock, although he lowered the 12-month price target from $219 to $209. Disney currently trades at $169.68, indicting a potential upside of 23.17% if this target were to be met. Disney+ subscriptions were estimated to hit 11 million in Q2, but reached only 9 million. Cahall, though, remains unfazed by the miss, because Disney’s theme parks are now seeing a sharp rise in attendance along with the fading of the COVID-19 pandemic in developed countries. Additionally, he notes that there will be a “pick-up in content” creation for Disney+, as production crews get rolling again after a multi-month hiatus. Expounding on the slowdown in Disney+ subscriber growth, Cahall says there is “a bit of consternation around guidance, but we’re not worried.” Disney+ guidance was reaffirmed for FY24, but investors did express some concern as this was the only piece of guidance reaffirmed during the May 13 earnings call. Cahall expects the stock to “pull-back and hang out for a bit” but also sees it as a good time to pick up more shares. Other analysts were not as forgiving, like Doug Creutz of Cowen and Co., who wrote, “Disney+ needs to add an average of at least 9 million subscribers per quarter for the next 14 quarters to reach management’s targets, and as the service gets more penetrated, the pace of adds is likely to slow down.” Creutz has a much more pessimistic estimate on Disney, with a price target of only $147 (13.36% downside potential). According to TipRanks, Disney remains a Strong Buy, based on 21 analyst ratings from the last three months. Additionally, the average analyst price target of $209.89 implies 24% upside potential.

2021-05-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc. is more aggressively embracing augmented reality, showing off a new version of its glasses with AR and expanding shopping features to compete in e-commerce with other social media platforms such as Facebook Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok.The company said it has upgraded augmented reality technology to let those on the popular Snapchat app use their voices and gestures to make changes in Lenses, or animated overlays, on photos and videos. The announcements were made Thursday at Snap’s annual partner summit, where the company outlines innovations and upgrades to its app.Snapchat, most known for ephemeral videos and its popularity among teenagers and young adults, now has more than 500 million monthly active users and roughly 40% of its members are located outside of North America and Europe, the company said.The new products are a “meaningful step forward in our platform strategy,” Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said in an interview before the summit.Snap also released the next iteration of Spectacles, glasses that are now powered by augmented reality. The product isn’t available for general sale, but is aimed at spurring creators to design new experiences that mesh the real world with digital overlays. The glasses “redefine the way we interact with and see the world,” Spiegel said at the summit.Snapchat also improved the visibility of the Scan feature, which works with partner companies to let people use the app’s camera to identify everything from types of plants and dog breeds to wine bottles and car models. Snapchatters also can scan an outfit and receive recommendations to buy similar looks from hundreds of brands.The social media company said it was teaming up with the dating app Bumble to allow users to send their matches video notes with Snapchat AR products. Snap also announced a partnership with Walt Disney Co. to allow tourists at Walt Disney World to incorporate Snap AR experiences into their visit and photos.The company also introduced a new way for popular creators to monetize their videos by allowing fans to pay money to send them “gifts,” which can be traded in for cash. Previously, Snap announced it would pay $1 million a day to creators of the top-performing posts. The company said Thursday more than 5,400 creators have earned more than $130 million dollars as part of the program.Shares rose as much as 6% on the news from the conference. The stock had gained 7.7% this year though Wednesday’s close.The Santa Monica, California-based company is hoping its investments in augmented reality will help the app capitalize on the e-commerce boom. As the spread of Covid-19 kept many would-be shoppers away from brick-and-mortar stores, more advertisers experimented with AR shopping experiences such as allowing customers to try on clothes, accessories or beauty products from their homes. Augmented reality layers digital information on top of real-life images.Snap’s push into augmented reality is just one part of its strategy to deliver multiple years of 50%-plus revenue growth in the future. Other companies such as Facebook, Pinterest Inc., TikTok and Amazon.com Inc. have also made new investments in AR.Snap has made some recent acquisitions to bolster its AR technology including the $124.4 million purchase of Fit Analytics, a tech company that uses machine learning and webcams to allow users to create personalized fit profiles. The company said it was introducing new technology to enable more accurate experiences trying on eyewear, watches, jewelery and full-body outfits. More brands will also be able to create their own business landing pages on the app to house their AR campaigns.(Updates with new glasses in the fifth paragraph and Bumble, Disney partnerships in the seventh paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Snap Bets Big on Augmented Reality With New Features for App

2021-05-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Jam City Inc., the developer behind mobile games including “Cookie Jam” and “Disney Pop Town,” has agreed to go public in a deal with a blank-check company.As part of the transaction, Jam City is acquiring Montreal-based game publisher Ludia Inc., according to a statement Thursday, which confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report. The two companies will combine with DPCM Capital Inc., the special purpose acquisition company set up by a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive, Jam City said in the statement.The combined company will have a valuation of $1.2 billion including debt, the statement shows.Nearly all gaming companies benefited from the home-entertainment surge during the coronavirus pandemic. With more people stuck indoors, the companies’ user bases exploded, and are expected to stay high even as life returns to normal. Attracted by the companies’ explosive growth, investor interest in gaming stocks has also been high. Earlier this year, game-maker Roblox Corp. went public via a direct listing, another alternative to an initial public offering.“We’ve proven our ability to acquire new companies and we’ve proven our ability to build great mobile entertainment experiences in-house,” Jam City Chief Executive Officer Chris DeWolfe said in an interview. “We want to fuel that growth -- we need more capital to do that, and we need a public currency to do that.”Jam City projects that by 2023 it will produce $1 billion in booking revenue after the combination with Ludia and the SPAC, up from $471 million in 2019, an investor presentation showed.Upon going public, Jam City plans to remain acquisitive, DeWolfe said. It is in constant dialogue with 30 to 40 companies and plans to make another acquisition within a year after the SPAC transaction closes, he added.Netmarble Led PlacementKorean gamemaking giant Netmarble Corp., an existing investor of Jam City, and a group of other investors have committed $100 million to a private private placement to support the deal, according to the statement. While new shares issued in the placement have a value of $10, placement investors paid $8.42 per share, according to an investor presentation.Investors usually pay $10 a share in the placement with few exceptions. Lucid Motors Inc. raised $2.5 billion in a PIPE at $15 per share when it announced a combination with Michael Klein’s Churchill Capital Corp IV after the SPAC’s shares ran up to as high as $58 before the deal was announced.Ludia, which makes games based on the “Jurassic World” movies, was valued at $175 million in the takeover, the statement shows.Jam City was founded in 2010 by DeWolfe, a MySpace co-founder as well as its former CEO. Culver City, California-based Jam City has a multiyear game development agreement with Walt Disney Co., along with its in-house offerings.DPCM, the blank-check firm, is led by Chairman and CEO Emil Michael, a former senior vice president of business for Uber.

2021-05-20,"Shares of media and entertainment giant Disney (DIS) have officially corrected. Since hitting a high of more than $200 per share in March, shares have been on a rather steady decline to the $169 level at the time of writing. This 15% discount to all-time highs is a juicy one for long-term investors in Disney. Indeed, those who wish to add to their collection of this high-quality blue-chip stock may be enticed to do so now. There are a number of reasons for this. Investors have a few key issues on their radar when it comes to Disney stock. (See Disney stock analysis on TipRanks) Streaming Growth All the Rage These Days Disney’s long-term growth prospects have received a much-needed boost throughout the pandemic due to the company’s well-timed Disney+ launch before the pandemic. No one knows whether CEO Bob Chapek has a crystal ball, but Disney+ has taken off as former moviegoers sought a massive amount of in-home entertainment this past year. The growth in Disney+ subscribers thus far has been meteoric. Disney was able to generate 100 million subscribers for its Disney+ platform in less than a year and a half. It took Netflix (NFLX) roughly ten years to accomplish the same goal. Other data suggest Disney+ subscribers are “stickier” than investors initially though. The company’s relatively low pricing plan for its platform has given the company what appears to be a competitive niche in a high-growth market. Investors appreciate the company's ability to retain customers. Now, Disney is investing billions of dollars into this platform. That's going to cause a cash drain for a while, and it’s not yet profitable. However, looking at how Netflix has grown over the past ten years, it's possible to forecast great things for Disney+. Post-Pandemic Surge Driving Expectations Higher Additionally, there continues to be a ton of anticipation around the kind of revenue growth Disney could see from the resumption of activity in its theme parks and travel-related businesses. The pandemic had caused Disney’s theme parks, cruise operations, and hospitality businesses to completely shutter. There’s hope that a surge in demand will be able to make up for lost time moving forward. It remains to be seen whether a revenue boom will take hold in these segments. However, an accelerated vaccination rollout and the resumption of activity at the company’s flagship theme parks herald great promise for the company. What Analysts Are Saying About DIS Stock According to TipRanks’ consensus analyst rating, DIS stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 21 analyst ratings, there are 18 Buy recommendations and 3 Hold recommendations. As for price targets, the average analyst price target is $209.89 with 24% upside potential. Analyst price targets range from a low of $163.00 per share to a high of $230.00 per share. Bottom Line Disney is a world-class company that is currently trading at a level which many long-term investors may find attractive. The company’s portfolio of intellectual property is among the most valuable of any blue-chip company on the market today. Accordingly, Disney’s business model is much more defensive than other high-growth options in the marketplace today. For those true believers in the potential of Disney+ to take off and disrupt the streaming space, Disney’s valuation may not be too steep. For others valuing this company more on its revenue from its theme parks and media divisions, the valuation may be less attractive. Disney’s long-term growth rate has likely received a shot in the arm from the company’s digitization efforts. It is up to the individual investor to decide about the extent to which this has already been priced in.

2021-05-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. is setting out to prove it’s best placed to weather a storm of antitrust scrutiny that’s wiped about $200 billion off the value of China’s largest company in a span of months.Its results on Thursday should affirm the resilience of the world’s largest game-publishing business as the pandemic recedes, now buttressed by growth in newer arenas such as fintech and the cloud. Yet it’s struggled to claw back the market capitalization it’s shed since its January peak, right around the time Beijing began a clampdown on Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Ant Group Co. before moving on to rising star Meituan.Tencent has largely escaped the hostilities for now -- despite its ubiquitous WeChat app offering unrivaled insights into virtually every facet of Chinese life and an overwhelming share of the gaming, music and social media markets. But questions remain over eventual fallout from a campaign that’s aimed at curtailing the influence of China’s internet companies and, much as in the West, exposing alleged abuses of their power.A good set of results should go a long way toward assuaging investors. The Shenzhen-based company is expected to deliver 24% revenue growth for the March quarter thanks to a strong payments and cloud services recovery, while gaming and other content continue to hook users. Nearly 96% of analysts tracking the stock on Bloomberg gave it a buy rating or equivalent, the highest ratio since Beijing kicked off its antitrust campaign in November. Its shares erased gains of as much as 1.3% to trade little changed Thursday.“If there is no regulatory concern, Tencent is very attractive in terms of valuation,” said Julia Pan, a Shanghai-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian. “It’s a defensive play within the tech sector, since they don’t need to burn cash for their core businesses like Alibaba and Meituan.”Here are a few things to watch when Tencent reports earnings after the bell in Hong Kong.The Elephant in the RoomWhile Xi Jinping’s government has yet to single out Tencent in its antitrust drive, investors haven’t fully dismissed potential fallout for Pony Ma’s sprawling online empire.Rivals like TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. argue WeChat is locking users inside its ecosystem by blocking links to external services. Tencent portfolio companies like Shixianghui and Yuanfudao have been penalized for unfair price tactics and other anti-competitive behaviors. Its music spinoff faces heightened scrutiny over exclusive dealings with record labels. And perhaps most alarmingly, Tencent’s fintech arm -- the closest analog to Ant in China -- is said to be next in line for increased supervision.Executives will likely again seek to reassure investors. The company has always been cautious with fintech regulations and will stick with its normal practice of acquiring minority stakes in startups. “Compliance is our lifeline,” Tencent President Martin Lau told investors in March.But Beijing’s scrutiny may yet show up in Tencent’s bottom line. Ad sales could take a hit if online tutoring startups -- major marketers in China -- decide to dial it down to stay on Beijing’s good side. A prudent approach to fintech could also mean growth shifts to vanilla payments rather than the more lucrative businesses of wealth management and lending. For now, Tencent’s fintech and cloud business is expected to grow 41% in the March quarter -- the fastest in eight quarters -- from a low base a year ago when Covid-19 emerged.That Evergreen Cash CowWhen China went into lockdown at the start of 2020, online games became one of the biggest beneficiaries of a stay-at-home entertainment boom. That’s why this time around, Tencent faces a tough comparison for year-over-year growth: a slower 16% sales increase projected for its bread-and-butter business. Still, mainstay games like Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile are topping the charts for global player spending, despite formidable challengers like miHoYo’s Genshin Impact.Tencent announced a pipeline of more than 40 new titles during its annual games showcase on Sunday. After a year of carving out slices of at least 31 gaming firms around the world, it’s now trying to churn out new mobile hits based on familiar content including Japanese manga series One Piece and Digimon.“Tencent continues to face strong competition from large tech companies such as ByteDance and Alibaba, as well as medium-sized firms such as Lilith Games and miHoYo but is in no immediate danger of losing its market leading position,” game research firm Niko Partners wrote in a May 16 note.Horse RacesLonger term, investors should also pay attention to the competition.Tencent is famous for its unforgiving culture of internal competition -- often likened to a horse race because of its swift and exacting nature -- where rival teams compete to develop similar products until one wins out. But it’s finally breaking down some internal walls, so as to better fight externally.The social giant last month folded its mini-video app, video streaming platform and mobile store into a single business unit in a rare restructure. Ross Liang, the former head of the QQ social app, took over as new chief executive of Tencent Music Entertainment Group, a year after a similar leadership reshuffle at its literature arm.All of this highlights Tencent’s effort to pull together resources to build a Walt Disney Co.-style franchise and recover lost ground from rivals like ByteDance, whose addictive apps have been chipping away at user screen time and advertising dollars. For one, creators on Tencent’s music apps will share short clips on WeChat’s fast-growing video accounts as in-house platforms work more closely together, Liang said in a post-earnings call on Tuesday.Competition is also fierce in cloud services. The pandemic disrupted IT projects but the pace should have picked up last quarter as the world’s No. 2 economy rebounded. Tencent will be keen to make up lost ground in 2021. Huawei Technologies Co. overtook Tencent last year to become China’s No. 2 cloud infrastructure provider, with a market share of 16.3% versus Alibaba’s 35.1%, according to Gartner research.(Updates with shares in fourth paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Tencent Tries to Recover From $200 Billion Antitrust Slide

Disney+ now has 103.6 million subscribers, well short of the 110 million the Street expected. (See Disney stock analysis on TipRanks) It’s Not Just About Disney+, Folks! Over the past year and a half, Disney+ has grown to become one of the top needle movers for Disney stock. This was bound to change in the post-pandemic environment. The incredible growth in the streaming platform has rewarded Disney stock in spite of the turmoil suffered by its other major segments, which have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 impact. As the economy gradually reopens, Disney has a lot going for it. Visitors are returning to its parks, cruises and movie theatres, all of which have suffered from severely suppressed numbers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic headwinds for Disney’s parks were a huge tailwind for Disney+, as stay-at-home orders drove people toward streaming content. As the population makes the move towards normalcy, the tables will turn again and parks will start to outshine streaming. Unlike most other pure-play video streaming plays like Netflix (NFLX), Disney stands to be a net beneficiary from the economic reopening, even if Disney+ takes a lengthy breather. Post-COVID Hangover Unlikely to Last Had it not been for Disney+, shares of Disney would not have hit new all-time highs back in March of 2021. Hats off to Disney’s new CEO, Bob Chapek, who weathered the storm with Disney+. Chapek filled the shoes of long-time top boss Bob Iger, who stepped down amid the pandemic. As stay-at-home orders disappear, streaming growth has likely peaked for the year. Many will opt to ditch video streaming for movie theatres and other forms of entertainment that were unavailable during the pandemic, and Disney+ will slow down. Looking way out into the future, Disney+ will probably pick up traction again. The streaming platform has some appealing content flowing in, and that could fuel a drastic subscriber growth reacceleration. It would be an mistake to think a post-pandemic slowdown in Disney+ is the start of a long-term trend or that the streaming business can’t reaccelerate in the future. Wall Street’s Take According to TipRanks’ consensus analyst rating, DIS stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 21 analyst ratings, there are 18 Buy and 3 Hold recommendations. As for price targets, the average analyst price target is $209.89. Analyst price targets range from a low of $163.00 per share to a high of $230.00 per share. Disney’s Park Business Preparing to Roar The latest easing of mask rules is a significant sign that the world is en route to conquering COVID-19. Many shut-in people will make a return to the physical realm, with ample disposable income in hand to spend on real-life experiences. As restrictions gradually ease, Disney’s iconic parks will be tasked with meeting pent-up travel and leisure demand. The next big step could be a gradual increase in park capacity, causing attendance to shift toward pre-pandemic levels. Indeed, Disney’s coming parks tailwinds seem way stronger than near-term headwinds that cause Disney+ to pull the brakes after its incredible growth streak. So, as investors punish the stock for any modest (and probably temporary) slowdown in Disney+ subscriber growth, contrarians would be wise to punch their tickets into Disney. Now would be the time to take action, before the ""house of mouse"" has a chance to fire on all cylinders across all fronts.

2021-05-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. agreed to buy the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie company for $8.45 billion, a bet that a nearly century-old Hollywood icon can feed an insatiable demand for streaming content.The proliferation of streaming services, including newer arrivals such as HBO Max and Disney+, has put pressure on Amazon to acquire more programming. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has made no secret of his desire for movie moguldom, and MGM’s vast backlog provides an abundance of streaming material, not to mention an opportunity to mine the iconic James Bond and Rocky franchises for new films and television shows.Moreover, with retail rivals like Walmart Inc. rolling out more sophisticated online stores, Amazon must work even harder to keep its 200 million Prime subscribers loyal.“This jump-starts them by 50 years,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “That’s really what it comes down to. They weren’t going to be able to produce enough content to ever get close to Netflix.”Pachter said that Amazon’s studios produce a few hundred hours worth of television shows and movies a year. MGM adds a back catalog of 25,000 hours that Amazon could divvy up between its Prime Video offering, or its free-to-stream, ad-supported IMDb TV.Amazon shares were up less than 1% Wednesday morning in New York.The takeover is Amazon’s biggest acquisition since it agreed to buy Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion but follows investments of about $11 billion on content for its streaming video and music services last year alone. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, in a statement pointed to MGM’s “deep catalog” as justification for the purchase.MGM has been seen as a takeover target for years, but was never able to close a sale before. The company made a fresh push last year when it tapped advisers to seek offers.Previously, Amazon has acquired smaller startups it perceived as a threat -- footwear seller Zappos, say, or Diapers.com parent Quidsi. Amazon also has snatched up-and-comers in new business lines, such as the game platform Twitch or Kiva, which makes warehouse robots.It’s unusual for Bezos to spend big bucks on a legacy business like MGM. The only other example is the purchase of Whole Foods Market in 2017, which came after Amazon spent a decade trying to become a player in grocery sales -- with little to show for its efforts and investment. Today, some analysts deem the Whole Foods acquisition wrong-headed and point to the fact that Amazon has since started a rival grocery chain.Bumpy EraFor MGM, the studio that brought James Bond and Scarlett O’Hara to the big screen, the deal provides a finale to a bumpy era of hedge-fund ownership that began with a bankruptcy over a decade ago. MGM’s lead shareholder is the Anchorage Capital Group LLC, which became an owner with other investors as part of a 2010 bankruptcy agreement that erased about $4 billion in debt.MGM’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 48% to about $307 million last year, lifted by profit from its 4,000-title film library. But with a lack of new releases, sales declined 3% to $1.5 billion.Under Anchorage, the studio aspired to its old glory -- a legacy that includes “Gone With the Wind,” the top film of all time in ticket sales, and the biblical classic “Ben-Hur,” which shares the record for most Academy Awards at 11.The new owners hired a moviemaker CEO in Gary Barber, a Hollywood heavyweight known for films such as “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” and “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.” He oversaw a new James Bond movie, “Skyfall,” that generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales -- the studio’s biggest-grossing film ever -- and partnered with Warner Bros. on the blockbuster “Hobbit” films.MGM also branched out into television. The studio took control of the premium cable network Epix, and acquired the TV production company owned by famed producer Mark Burnett, known for creating “Survivor” and “The Apprentice.” The studio also created the critically acclaimed series “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Fargo,” adding to a lucrative library.Hedge funds rarely hang on to such investments for more than a few years, and observers long thought that Barber was prepping the studio for sale. In 2017, reports suggested that MGM was in discussions with a Chinese company, though no deal materialized.Behind the studio’s renewed financial stability under Anchorage and the M&A rumors, there was turmoil within MGM’s executive ranks. Five months after Barber’s contract was renewed in 2018, he was abruptly fired by Anchorage CEO Kevin Ulrich. Reports surfaced that the two had clashed, and that Barber’s relationship with Bond producer Barbara Broccoli was also tense.Barber ultimately walked away with a $260 million exit package. Ulrich never named a replacement for Barber, and instead created an office of the CEO, which has been in place for three years. The unusual arrangement led the Hollywood Reporter to say Burnett was sowing chaos within the company. He was said to have, at least in part, led to the ouster of film studio head Jonathan Glickman in early 2020, among other executives.Postponed BondWhen the coronavirus struck, MGM was particularly hamstrung. Its biggest anticipated film release, the new James Bond film “No Time to Die,” has been postponed repeatedly. The company approached both Apple Inc. and Netflix Inc. about buying the film for their online services, but never reached a deal.While coping with the prospect of production delays and higher costs due to Covid-19, MGM suffered another blow. In a June 2020 lawsuit in New York, a woman accused Ulrich of sexual battery in a swanky Manhattan hotel in June 2019. The case was ultimately withdrawn.Late last year, MGM reportedly hired advisers to explore a sale of the company. The studio was said to seek about $5 billion, compared with the more than $8 billion that Ulrich predicted the company could fetch given time.LionTree LLC and Morgan Stanley advised MGM on the transaction. Amazon didn’t use bankers, and the corporate development team was involved.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer traces its roots back to the 1920s merger of Marcus Loew’s Metro films with a film company run by Hollywood legend Louis B. Mayer. The studio, while making great pictures like “Dr. Zhivago” and “2001: A Space Odyssey,” drifted in and out of financial distress in the second half of the 20th century. Over the decades it was owned by Time Inc., CNN founder Ted Turner and more than once by the late billionaire Kirk Kerkorian.Turner kept much of MGM’s library, which is now owned by AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia, soon to be part of Discovery Inc.“I am very proud that MGM’s Lion, which has long evoked the Golden Age of Hollywood, will continue its storied history, and the idea born from the creation of United Artists lives on in a way the founders originally intended, driven by the talent and their vision,” said Anchorage’s Ulrich, who is chairman of the board of MGM. “The opportunity to align MGM’s storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination.”(Updates with advisers in fourth-to-last paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Agrees to Buy MGM Film Studio for $8.45 Billion

2021-05-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s takeover of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is sparking fresh criticism about the spreading tentacles of America’s technology giants, but the deal underscores how competition watchdogs have their hands tied when it comes to curbing the companies’ growth.Critics of tech firms in Washington on Wednesday slammed the MGM deal as the latest example of how the industry’s biggest players snap up companies to expand their reach, even as they face a flurry of antitrust lawsuits and moves by lawmakers to rein them in.“Another day. Another mega merger,” tweeted Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who led a sweeping investigation of Amazon, Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. “Amazon’s proposed purchase of MGM reinforces what we already know -- they are laser-focused on expanding and entrenching their monopoly power.”Amazon announced the MGM deal a day after being sued by the attorney general of Washington, D.C., who said the online retailer is engaging in anticompetitive conduct that’s leading to higher prices for consumers. The case, the first government antitrust lawsuit against Amazon in the U.S., opened a new front in the regulatory assault on the tech industry.Attorneys general from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have joined the list of officials looking at Amazon for potential antitrust violations, which already included California, New York, Washington state and the Federal Trade Commission, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported Thursday.Amazon was little changed at $3,249.36 at 11:11 a.m. in New York.The MGM deal presents an early test for the Biden administration’s antitrust agenda. The president has yet to nominate an assistant attorney general to run the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which would probably review the MGM deal.For those troubled about the relentless growth of the biggest tech companies, the MGM acquisition could highlight how antitrust law falls short, said Sam Weinstein, who teaches antitrust at Cardozo School of Law in New York. Under traditional antitrust analysis, which would look at whether Amazon will gain outsized market power in film and TV content, the MGM deal is very likely to be cleared by regulators, he said.“If you’re really concerned about how big a company is -- just how big it is, not that it’s creating a monopoly in a particular market -- this acquisition will bother you, and the antitrust laws as currently constituted aren’t designed to deal with something like this,” Weinstein said.Amazon is the second-largest paid streaming service in the world behind Netflix Inc., and the MGM acquisition will give it more than 4,000 movies and 17,000 TV shows, including “Rocky,” “RoboCop” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.”But the combination still leaves many studios competing to produce content. MGM doesn’t even rank among the top five Hollywood studios by box office share: Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Group Corp. and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Then there’s Netflix, which produces its own content for its streaming service, including hits like “Bridgerton,” “Stranger Things” and “The Queen’s Gambit.”That’s not stopping criticism of the takeover.“In acquiring MGM Studios, Amazon is brazenly trying to take over another sector of the economy,” said Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly organization in Washington. “Congress should respond quickly by passing bipartisan legislation to ban mergers by large tech firms.”On Capitol Hill, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, a fierce critic of tech platforms, said on Twitter that Amazon is a monopoly that “shouldn’t be able to buy anything else. Period.”“This is a major acquisition that has the potential to impact millions of consumers,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who chairs the Senate’s antitrust panel. “The Department of Justice must conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that this deal won’t risk harming competition.”Amazon and its tech peers have bought hundreds of companies in the last decade, none of which has been stopped by antitrust enforcers. Their buying spree has triggered criticism that antitrust cops aren’t being aggressive enough to challenge the companies. It’s also fueling calls for new legislation that would revise antitrust laws.The $8.45 billion MGM deal is Amazon’s second-largest acquisition after Whole Foods Market Inc., the grocery chain Amazon bought for about $13.7 billion in 2017. That deal was cleared by antitrust officials at the FTC without an in-depth investigation.With the Whole Foods deal, Amazon was making a major acquisition in a market where it wasn’t a big player, so it didn’t raise competition concerns. The MGM acquisition fits the same pattern, said Jennifer Rie, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who expects the deal will clear the antitrust review. That will probably help build support for antitrust legislation that will give enforcers new tools to stop deals, she said.The biggest critics of the tech companies “simply don’t think these companies should be able to get any bigger,” Rie said. “That’s not where the law stands now.”(Updates with news about more states scrutinizing Amazon in fifth paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon-MGM Slammed by Tech Foes on Likely Path to Approval

2021-05-30,Investors who knocked the stock down 5% after fiscal second-quarter earnings were focused on the wrong thing.,Did You Miss This Valuable Info in Disney's Latest Earnings?
2021-05-30,"The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is a leading global entertainment and media business that owns numerous extremely popular and valuable franchises, characters, and businesses, such as Star Wars, Mickey Mouse, and Pixar. Between the wide name recognition of both the business’ brand and its individual products, DIS possesses compelling competitive advantages and pricing power that derive from its strong pricing power and customer loyalty. (See Disney stock analysis on TipRanks) The main value for DIS comes from the numerous ways in which it monetizes its powerful brands, vast library of highly valuable content, and large and loyal global consumer network. Between its wildly popular theme parks, feature-length Hollywood films, toys and apparel, sports and other themed TV channels, and its recently added high-growth streaming businesses, DIS is a very profitable and well-diversified business. It has been able to generate strong returns on equity, and can be expected to have strong staying power for decades to come. Additionally, with a BBB+ credit rating from S&P, no dividend to burden the balance sheet, and nearly $16 billion in cash on hand, the company is in great shape to weather any unforeseen challenges. Moreover, it simultaneously invests aggressively to emerge a winner in the highly competitive streaming wars. That said, the streaming wars will not be easy to win. Amazon (AMZN) just announced a massive $8.45 billion acquisition of Hollywood studio MGM (MGMB), significantly upgrading its already highly competitive position in the space. Meanwhile, AT&T (T) recently made a significant deal as well to bolster its media and streaming business. Last but not least, Netflix (NFLX) continues to invest aggressively to retain its position as the world’s number one streaming giant. Valuation Metrics Despite the heavy competition, DIS still has a good chance to emerge a winner. Its pluses include a massive existing content library, powerful brands, deep pockets, and strong pool of in-house talent that it can draw on to create new content. Additionally, the valuation is reasonable. The price to forward normalized earnings is fairly high at 46.5x, but revenue is expected to surge by 25.2% in 2022 and normalized earnings-per-share are expected to grow by 19.4% in 2021 and 109.4% in 2022. That makes today’s price a more reasonable 35x expected 2022 earnings. Wall Street’s Take From Wall Street analysts, DIS earns a Strong Buy from average analyst consensus, based on 18 Buy ratings and 3 Hold ratings in the past 3 months. Additionally, the average price target of $209.89 puts the upside potential at 17.5%. Summary and Conclusions DIS has a a long and rich history of entertaining generations of loyal fans of its numerous popular franchises. Furthermore, it is well-positioned to emerge a winner in the cutthroat streaming industry. Nevertheless, it still faces numerous challenges from companies like NFLX, AMZN, and others who are also investing aggressively to strengthen their positions in the streaming space. Meanwhile, Disney's other business should continue to thrive and achieve steady growth for decades to come. Particularly, its theme parks should recover nicely over the next few years as COVID-19 headwinds dissipate. Overall, the business is likely to continue growing and analysts remain very bullish on the shares here. Given that the valuation remains reasonable, it could be an attractive way to invest in the continued growth of the streaming industry.
