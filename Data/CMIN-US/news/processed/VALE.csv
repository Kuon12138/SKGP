2018-08-10,"Emerging markets have been a real minefield of late. The United States and China have ratcheted up their trade war rhetoric, and investors have been shunning emerging-markets stocks and sticking with the comforts of home. But they may be doing so at their own detriment. Emerging markets are cheap after a decade of underperformance marked by sagging commodity prices, political instability and strong home-country bias by American investors. For the contrarian investor willing to look past the headlines, testing the waters in emerging markets makes sense. U.S. stocks are as expensive as they were in the late 1990s by some metrics, while foreign markets in general and emerging markets in particular are cheap and unloved. If history is any guide, EMs should beat the pants off of American stocks over the next decade. &quot;There is no doubt that the U.S. stock market is expensive (though not quite a bubble like the 1990s), with foreign markets much more reasonable,&quot; explains Meb Faber, CEO of Cambria Investment Management and manager of the Cambria Global Value ETF (GVAL), among other funds. &quot;Today, we find the most reasonable valuations in the beaten-down, emerging markets that sport a valuation roughly half that of the U.S. -- some countries are even clocking in with single-digit P/E ratios. &quot; Faber recommends that investors &quot;close your eyes, hold your nose, and buy a basket of the cheap countries with the plan to hold them for a decade.&quot; Today, we&apos;ll look at 10 ways to make that trade on emerging-markets stocks using a mixture of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds (CEFs) and individual companies.

2019-01-09,"Why Goldman Sachs Expects Iron Ore Prices to Drop to $60

## Resilient iron ore prices

As we noted in Is the Party Over for Commodities as China Steel Feels the Heat? in November, iron ore prices started collapsing after Chinese steel mills’ margins gave way.

In iron ore’s typical price pattern, prices once again started rising and increased ~11% in December. Prices have rallied back to over $70 per ton.

## Goldman Sachs says prices could drop to $60

According to Bloomberg, in a note released today, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts, including Hui Shan, stated that while the industry’s fundamentals have improved, more supply is on the way, which should restrict the rise in prices.

The bank expects iron ore prices to fall to $60 per ton in the next six months. Goldman’s analysts argue that $75 per ton for iron ore is not sustainable for two reasons: “First, part of the rally was fueled by mills restocking ahead of the Chinese New Year. Second, supply is set to increase in 2019.”

## Downside ahead for iron ore?

Morgan Stanley (MS) also expects to see losses in the commodity (XME). On January 7, it said, “We’re iron ore bears from here, though, expecting falling crude steel output and growing seaborne supply to ultimately bring price back to the mid-low-$60s/ton.”

Moreover, big miners such as Vale (VALE), BHP (BHP), and Rio Tinto (RIO) have been enjoying higher premiums on higher-grade ore due to China’s switch in a bid to control pollution. This switch was supported by higher margins. As margins have waned, it seems like the party might be over for iron ore miners, at least in the short term. The producers of metals such as copper (FCX) and aluminum (AA) have also been under pressure due to China’s muted demand outlook.

2019-01-14,"If you think 2018 was a rough year for American stocks, take a look overseas. Emerging markets were absolutely hammered last year.

The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), the most widely followed proxy for emerging-markets stocks, finished 2018 down 17%. Many individual developing countries fared even worse. The Xtrackers Harvest SCI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) - which tracks the performance of China's largest domestically traded shares - lost 29% last year. The iShares MSCI Turkey ETF (TUR) shed 43%.

But as we jump into 2019, there are several reasons you might want to give EMs another look.

To start, emerging-markets stocks actually were less volatile than American stocks during the wretched final quarter of 2018. Three months isn't a long enough period to draw any firm conclusions, but it's starting to look like investors have already largely abandoned emerging markets and there's &quot;no one left to sell.&quot; That could mean a relatively low-risk entry point for an investor looking to allocate new money to emerging markets.

Secondly - and perhaps most importantly - emerging markets also are wildly cheap relative to American stocks. Perhaps not surprisingly, the U.S. market is now one of the most expensive in the world, according to estimates by Star Capital, trading at a cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (&quot;CAPE&quot;) of 26.8. To put that in perspective, developed markets as a whole trade at a CAPE of 22.2, while emerging markets as a group trade at a CAPE of just 14.5.

Emerging markets can be a roller-coaster ride. The booms can make you wealthy, but the busts can be devastating. So don't overload your portfolio in EM stocks. But at today's prices, it makes sense to have a little skin in the game. With that said, here are five solid emerging-markets stocks to buy in 2019.

Their most recent concern? The longevity of the company's recent red-hot growth.

While recently-imposed tariffs on steel imports have proven a boon for U.S. companies like Cleveland-Cliffs and United States Steel (NYSE:X), a trade deal could wipe those tariffs away in an instant.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Cleveland-Cliffs stock also recently jumped on news that a multiple-fatality accident near a mine operated by rival Vale (NYSE:VALE) would crimp its iron ore output for the foreseeable future. It won't be crimped forever though.

This may be a case, however, where investors take a step back and look at the bigger picture, and come to their own conclusions about a company without analysts' guidance.

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



### War of Words

Never let it be said Cleveland-Cliffs doesn't bring lots of drama to the table.

The current chapter actually started back in early 2014. On the brink of bankruptcy following a few too many ill-advised acquisitions, the often-colorful mining industry veteran Lourenco Goncalves was named CEO. His first job? Save the company.

He's done that, even if the effort was at times ugly. Cleveland-Cliffs is poised to report a 2018 profit of $2.10 per share of CLF stock once its fourth quarter results are posted. That will be the best year since 2013, partially thanks to a pare-down of unfruitful operations and partially thanks to a cleaner balance sheet.

Still, analysts have their doubts and haven't been afraid to voice them. Goncalves, however, hasn't been afraid to voice his doubts about analysts either.

During the Q3-2018 earnings call, Goncalves called out Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn (who didn't ask a question during the call), strongly suggesting Korn rethink his views and opinions of Cleveland-Cliffs. He ultimately warned Korn &quot;you can run, but you can't hide.&quot;

Similarly, in 2014, right as the turnaround was getting underway, Goncalves told Wells Fargo analyst Sam Dubinsky he wasn't going to answer the analyst's question because he &quot;already knew&quot; everything about the company.

And yet, Goncalves may have a valid point about Wall Street's handicappers habitually underestimating Cleveland-Cliffs, and undervaluing CLF stock.

### CLF Is a Vexing Stock

For the better part of 2017, CLF shares traded above the consensus price target of around $7.00, as the pros were slow (if not downright unwilling) to adjust their targets even though the stock was ultimately en route to a price above $12 by September of last year.

Time and the environment eventually caught up with a vindicated Goncalves, of course. The stock fell back below $8 per share by December. That was right around the time the analyst community started to dial back their targets after finally upping them to above $13 late last year.

Their timing couldn't have been worse. Since January, CLF stock has snapped back to $10.70, matching the latest consensus target but en route to what appears to be even higher highs.

This stock continues to vex the very people paid the most to keep a handle on it.

Grossly overshadowed by the drama is just how will the company has done in the current environment.

Cleveland-Cliffs is on the verge of logging its most profitable four-quarter stretch in years, and while analysts are currently modeling declining revenue and earnings for the year now underway, they've grossly underestimated earnings in three of the past four reported quarters.

Their worries are understandable. The tariff war will eventually end, for better or worse, and Vale still has a stunning amount of production capacity at its disposal. It won't be down for long. Analysts, however, are still giving the company little to no credit even after being burned. The turnaround effort largely supersedes the tailwinds likely brewing for Cleveland-Cliffs.

### Pessimism and Cleveland-Cliffs Stock

It's difficult to pinpoint the blame. Investors don't like uncertainty, and Cleveland-Cliffs has a plateful of it dead ahead. Nobody needs any help from professional stock-pickers to appreciate that.

Nevertheless, one can't help but wonder if the analyst community errantly is steering investors away from an otherwise compelling prospect, even if as a subconscious pushback to Goncalves' unconventional treatment of them.

CLF stock is trading at 3.8 times its trailing earnings and only 6.5 times 2019's profit outlook that arguably understates how will the mining name will do this year… a bargain by any standard.

Bolstering the argument that the pros are unfairly doubting Cleveland-Cliffs is the most recent steel price outlook from The World Steel Association. In October, the association made up of industry insiders predicted steel prices would improve by 1.4% this year after rising 3.9% in 2018.

It's admittedly an outlook one has to take with a big grain of salt. In fact, The World Steel Association explicitly said in its October outlook that &quot;global steel demand faces uncertainty from tensions in the global economic environment,&quot; It's an understatement to be sure.

Nevertheless, even with so many unknowns on the radar, the group sees at least a modicum of strength on the horizon.

### Looking Ahead for CLF Stock

The challenge for new investors is largely the same challenge analysts face. CLF stock is a fast-moving target with a lot of moving parts in play.

But investors slowly but surely are beginning to recognize how well Goncalves' turnaround has taken hold and pricing the stock accordingly.

CLF stock has made a string of higher lows and higher highs since 2016 and is pointed toward new 52-week highs right now. Shares are also shrugging off the fourth quarter's weakness nicely, as fewer investors seem to believe the tariff boost is a future liability if and when it evaporates.

In the meantime, the global economy, for all of its problems, is still going strong, with or without demand from China. The U.S. and even emerging markets are well-positioned headed into the heart of 2019. That will drive demand for steel as well.

Yet, the pros continue to rate CLF stock between a &quot;Buy&quot; and a &quot;Hold,&quot; which is something of an insult given analysts' bullish bias. Perhaps the pros are simply trying to prove something. Perhaps they have a chip on their shoulder.

Whatever the case, more price volatility is almost guaranteed for Cleveland-Cliffs shares. For true long term investors who know analysts are just best-guessing too, however, this is an interesting prospect.

2019-03-26,"Since hitting a low of about $1,175 per oz. on Aug. 14, gold prices have steadily risen. Gold took off as stocks dropped dramatically last fall. However, as shares began to recover from a December 24th low, gold and gold stocks continued to rise. Gold now trades above $1,315 per oz., close to levels seen last April.Many blame the rise in gold prices on an inverted yield curve in the bond market. As the annualized rate on 90-day loans exceeds that of the 10-year bond, many see that as a sign of recession. Such an inversion preceded the previous seven recessions, according to the Cleveland Fed.Gold stocks, which usually rise and fall with the price of gold, should also benefit. Gold stocks have suffered in the last eight years. The yellow metal experienced a bear market as prices fell from the almost $1,900 per oz. level they saw back in 2011. Now, with the bull market having persisted more than 10 minutes, many wonder if a pullback -- and subsequently a rising interest in gold -- is imminent. Our own Aaron Levitt has cited the increasing M&A activity that has come with gold trading above $1,300 per oz.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend Assuming a new bull market in gold has begun, these three stocks on the rise could benefit: Gold Stocks on the Rise: Goldcorp (GG)Source: Shutterstock Canada-based Goldcorp (NYSE:GG) has become a leading target among gold stocks as Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) seeks to acquire the company.GG stock has risen by about 15% since the two companies announced the proposed takeover. It has also increased around 32% since the Q3 earnings report last October sent the stock plunging. Thanks to the merger and rising gold prices, it trades at just over $11 per share today.Under terms of the proposed deal, the new company will become Newmont Goldcorp. Current Newmont shareholders will own 65% of the company with the remainder of the control going to current holders of GG stock.Although the deal has received regulatory approval in Canada and Mexico, it has faced opposition in some quarters. Hedge fund Paulson & Co. had initially opposed the deal. However, Newmont's CEO offered a special dividend of 88 cents per share to Newmont shareholders if the transaction occurs. With that, Paulson withdrew its opposition.Moreover, even without the merger, GG stock looks poised to move higher. Thanks to rising gold prices, analysts forecast a 200% increase in profits this year. They also predict earnings will increase by 45.5% next year. With that kind of growth and its 23.5 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, one can understand Newmont's interest.The deal awaits regulatory approval in the U.S. However, whether traders deal with GG stock or NEM stock longer-term, the future appears bright for holders of Goldcorp stock. Barrick Gold (GOLD)Source: Jeremy Vohwinkle via Flickr (Modified)Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) led the recent consolidation move among gold stocks. Its takeover of Randgold Resources likely inspired the proposed deal between Newmont and Goldcorp. That merger made the Toronto-based company one of the world's largest gold producers.Barrick had also attempted a hostile takeover of Newmont. Both have operated mines in Nevada for decades, and Barrick wanted to benefit from the potential synergies of combining operations. Instead, both companies will enter into a joint venture to combine the Nevada mine operations.Despite mixed success on the takeover front, GOLD stock has risen by almost 50% since hitting lows in September. After the Randgold merger closed at the end of 2018, Barrick stock has traded in a range. Now, GOLD has finally begun to rise above post-merger levels in recent days. Today, it trades in the $14 per share range.Now, with merger-related speculation likely over for now, the future of GOLD stock again relies on the price of physical gold. Barrick stock trades well below 2011 levels, when it last saw prices above $50 per share. Analysts foresee profit increase of 14.3% this year and 17.5% the next. The company has shown confidence as it has hiked its dividend for three years in a row. This has taken the annual dividend yield to about 2%, or 28 cents per share on a yearly basis.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly However, the accuracy of those forecasts hinges on gold prices. It took gold prices of almost $1,900 per oz. to take GOLD stock to the $50 per share level. However, gold has not traded above $1,365 per oz. since 2013. Assuming the price of gold can finally rise above that level, both profit forecasts and the price of GOLD stock should eventually move back toward 2010-2011 highs. Vale (VALE)Source: Shutterstock Vale (NYSE:VALE) faces a different set of challenges than gold stocks like Goldcorp and Barrick. Unlike these Canadian counterparts, the Brazil-based materials company mines a variety of minerals. A ruptured dam in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais killed more than 300 people in January. Since that time, that state has won its bid to freeze more than 2.95 billion reals ($795 million) in company assets. A dividend suspension following the disaster has also weighed on VALE stock.Due to this dam issue, VALE stock has not risen in the last six months like other gold stocks. Also, with profits forecasted to fall by 3.7% this year, near-term hopes look dim. However, as grim as this may sound, such disasters tend to create buying opportunities for investors.Indeed, the outlook improves dramatically once it can put the tragedy in Minas Gerais behind it. Analysts expect profits to increase by 50% next year. Also, despite the recent setback, VALE stock has risen dramatically from 2016 levels when the stock briefly dipped below $2.50 per share. Now trading at about $13 per share, VALE has stabilized despite the setback. Like other gold stocks, Vale trades well below 2011 levels when the equity approached the $35 per share level.Given the uncertain political environment in Brazil and the issues with the ruptured dam, the reputation of Vale has seen a setback. However, the rising price of gold and other precious metals offers VALE stock the opportunity it needs to recover both its reputation and its stock price.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-04,"Do you want to have your cake and eat it too? Or better yet, how about enjoying leadership and relative strength at the start of a new bull market? Then look no further than Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) stock to mint some big-time profits.Source: Shutterstock Has the market run its course? It's a popular question these days given the U.S. averages' stellar first-quarter run. But rather than simply run away in fear or run toward equities with open arms due to fear of missing out, purchasing streaming metals outfit Wheaton Precious Metals stock looks like a great hedged bet.Formerly known as Silver Wheaton Mining, WPM is in the business of purchasing metals via negotiated fixed-price contracts called streaming. And it's a good business to be in and for other investors taking stock in shares of Wheaton Precious Metals as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe low-cost deals in exchange for upfront capital, which Wheaton Precious Metals secures are with other producers such as Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), Goldcorp (NYSE:GG), Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) and Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX).  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio The business doesn't make WPM the proverbial house like Vegas, but these high margin contracts do allow WPM stock to offer investors stronger cost predictability, direct leverage to increasing precious metals prices and a high-quality asset base.Now with silver, gold and other metals finding price floors and WPM smartly diversifying and growing its portfolio away from silver in this overall stronger operating environment, conditions on the WPM stock chart also look good for investors interested in going long. Wheaton Precious Metals also has less risk and greater upside potential at current levels. WPM Stock Daily Chart  Click to EnlargeWithin the metals complex, WPM stock has proven itself a technical leader in 2019. Shares have displayed relative strength compared to its peer group with a year-to-date gain of around 19%. But that's not all Wheaton Precious Metals stock has going for it.In 2019 and on the heels of confirming a combination double-bottom with an explosive mid-December bullish gap, WPM has minted an uptrend. The bullish foundation looks even more durable as the series of higher highs and lows began with a solid-looking breakout in January.The breakout sent shares firmly into bull territory after toiling in a congestion pattern with the longer-term, 200-day simple moving average for a handful of weeks. And Wheaton Precious Metals stock has never looked back.Now, with shares pulling back over the course of several sessions, it's time to consider buying WPM shares on weakness as technical support for the uptrend is tested. How would I approach a purchase of Wheaton Precious Metals stock in today's market? With Wheaton Precious Metal stock's stochastics oversold, but not yet showing a crossover signal, having a bit of constraint to avoid potentially catching a knife makes sense.Specifically and to help avoid any larger corrections, my suggestion is to simply wait for confirmation of a pivot low on the daily chart before buying WPM.If a buy trigger does occur but shares fail to follow-through on the upside, keeping a stop tethered to the trend's newly formed show of support makes a good deal of technical sense. This exit also offers investors stronger &quot;cost predictability&quot; in Wheaton Precious Metals stock and that makes it worth betting on here.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-04-22,"Thanks to its plunge in late January, shares of Vale (NYSE:VALE) are up less than 1% in 2019. That certainly doesn't make it a big outperformer, particularly when the overall markets are up so much.The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSEArca:SLX), which counts VALE stock as its second-largest holding at 11.7% of its portfolio, is up 15.7% year to date.Should investors put their faith in VALE stock or are they best off in a different name?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet's look at Vale stock to determine if this is one that should be in our portfolio. Vale Balance Sheet and Cash FlowThe first thing I look at is the balance sheet. For Vale stock, it's clear that management is committed to deleveraging the balance sheet and paying down debt. With its $68.6 billion market cap, Vale has $16.03 billion in debt. That's down almost 30% from $22.4 billion in the prior year. Two years ago, the figure stood at $29.2 billion, with 2018's year-end balance down almost 50% from that figure.At the same time, the metals miner's cash flow remains strong. Over the past year, Vale has generated almost $13 billion in operating cash flow and more than $9 billion in free cash flow. The steel industry can have a hefty capex budget, so to see its free cash flow (which includes capex) so strong is encouraging. Valuing Vale StockCurrent estimates call for Vale to earn $1.86 per share this year. On May 9, we'll get Vale's first-quarter earnings results, and we'll see whether the company is on track for this figure. Worth pointing out is that Vale stock has beat on earnings estimates for at least 13 straight quarters. Given that estimates for the first quarter have fallen to just 36 cents per share from 57 cents per share 30 days ago likely means the stock clears the bar.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Why the hit? A Brazilian dam break from January has become quite the issue. Management didn't give investors a ton of details on the situation on the last conference call, but investors will expect some updates this quarter. The assumption is that -- despite estimates calling for 10.7% revenue growth to $9.53 billion this quarter -- this disaster is going cost Vale a pretty penny.It knocked about 20% of production offline, while authorities froze about $4 billion in assets to cover the potential costs.Although Vale stock is expected to grow full-year revenue 3.6% this year and earnings by more than 40%, this is an overhang that may keep Vale stock volatile. Trading Vale Stock  Click to EnlargeVale stock has been a volatile one. As we mentioned, the Brumadinho dam break back in January dealt a serious blow to the stock price. Shares gapped down to uptrend support, then flushed below it in the ensuing sessions.The big issue, technically speaking, came a few days later. Vale stock rallied back to trendline support and failed on its retest. It then went on to take out its lows (which were actually 52-week lows). Unfortunately, that kind of price action is necessary to create a bottom. That doesn't mean VALE can't go lower or that this type of rebound happens every time. But we've seen similar price action in names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) this year, too.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm Now, though, Vale stock has put in a series of higher lows and has reclaimed that prior trendline. With its recent bounce off this mark, Vale could gain some momentum to clear its major moving averages. If it can, a run to $14.50 is possible before it hits downtrend resistance.On the downside, below uptrend support and Vale stock will likely test its 50-day moving average. If that doesn't hold, Vale could take out its March lows, negating the higher lows trend and forcing investors to wait for shares to reset before going long again. Trendline support will then be on watch for possible resistance.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

It's held onto that rebound in the meantime.The stock's still not above key lines in the sand, to be clear, and is far from kick-starting a fresh, full-blown uptrend. There's a reason the largely tacit bulls have kept Cleveland Cliffs stock in the hunt for a breakout move, though. That is, despite an assumed lack of global economic strength, industry insiders have been hard-pressed to find real evidence that the iron ore pellet business is truly on the defensive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCLF stock still looks just one nudge away from a wave of bullishness, and the undertow is pushing it in that direction. The Quarter That Wasn'tBlame Vale (NYSE:VALE) for the difficulty in pinning down the true strength of current and future iron ore market. The Brazilian behemoth suffered not one but two dam bursts near its mines in recent years, with the most recent one unfolding in January of this year. The latter one claimed a few dozen lives, and forced a shutdown of a major mining operation that has affected the global supply iron ore pellets.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money To what degree it's impacted that supply isn't clear. All producers like Vale and Cleveland Cliffs throttle their output to adjust for price fluctuations, but with Vale subdued, rivals like Vale and smaller Ferrexpo may have offered lower prices to secure new customers.Cleveland-Cliffs' Q1 results, however, don't quite jibe with the market price of iron ore and the apparent demand for it.As one would expect with Vale's partial absence, iron ore priced advanced from $76 per tonne before Vale's January accident to $93 per tonne now. The advance only extends price growth that started to take shape in 2016 though, and if demand was the driver, one couldn't tell it from last quarter's numbers from Clevaland Cliffs. Total volumes of ore pellets sold fell from 1.61 million tonnes for the comparable quarter a year earlier to only 1.55 million tonnes for the three-month stretch ending in March.Cleveland Cliffs didn't enjoy much of iron's price growth either. While volume was down, revenue was as well, falling nearly 13% from $180 million to $157 million.The Q1 numbers weren't the problem, though. It was the comparison figures from a year earlier that were unfairly high. Iron Ore Market to Remain RobustWhile consumption of ore pellets isn't terribly seasonal, the industry's capacity to ship it is. This is particularly true of Cleveland Cliffs, which relies heavily on access to access to locks and causeways that facilitate deliveries to its customers in the lower Great Lakes. An abnormally cold and lengthy winter season this year shut down water-based shipping in that region for longer than it may normally have been halted.Cleveland Cliffs was also a victim of unfortunate timing.CFO Keith Koci explained during the first-quarter conference call: &quot;During last year's first quarter, because the AMM hot-rolled coil price rose from $653 to $860 per short ton from the beginning to the end of the quarter. We had an enormous favorable revaluation adjustment. With HRC prices remaining relatively flat during this year's first quarter, we had no such adjustment at this time, explaining the year-over-year decline in revenue rate.&quot;AK Steel (NYSE:AKS) confirmed the stagnation of hot rolled coiled steel prices with its recently quarterly report, but dialed back its profit outlook on the likelihood that HRC prices will remain suppressed through the end of the year.Bank of America recently downgraded U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) on a similar concern.There's a disconnect between finished steel and iron ore right now. The supply of iron feeding steel mills remains tight enough to lay the groundwork for more strength ahead.The evidence in plentiful. Case(s) in point: China's demand for iron ore grew for a fifth straight month in April. A recent World Bank report suggested iron ore prices would rise another 11% this year, fueled by disruptions not just with Vale's mines, but with mines operated in Australia by BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO). And Ferrexpo recently predicted the seaborne ore pellet market would be short of demand this year between five million and ten million tonnes. Looking Ahead for CLF StockIt's this backdrop that quelled the knee-jerk selling to Cleveland Cliffs' first-quarter report. And, it's this undertow that's kept CLF stock on the cusp of a rally that's been brewing -- but on hold -- for months. Few traders are willing to the ones to stick their neck out first, but there are plenty of traders willing to follow someone else's lead.Bolstering the bullish case is a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 -- a valuation that suggests investors have priced in a worst-case scenario, and then some. An ongoing tariff battle is at least partially to blame for the pessimism.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Even if those tariffs remain in place in perpetuity, though, there's room and reason for gains. The trick is just getting enough traders to give Cleveland Cliffs stock the right nudge. Breaking above the upper boundary of the channel that's been in place 2016 is the key, though there's room for a decent gain between here and there.

2019-05-17,"Stocks started yesterday's action out on a firmly bullish foot, but didn't end the session quite as enthused. Up as much as 1.44% near the middle of the day, the S&P 500 was dialed back to a gain of only 0.89%. It's not clear how much conviction the bulls have, or don't have.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Leading what was left of the bullish charge was Nokia (NYSE:NOK), up nearly 4% mostly as a snapback from nearly a month's worth of strong selling. A potential end to trade worries was inspiring enough to cut into the stock's 18% slide since late April. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) was the big winner for the regular session though, rallying nearly 8% headed into its post-close earnings report that turned into a 15% loss in after-hours action. This year's revenue outlook was a major letdown.At the other end of the spectrum, iron ore miner Vale (NYSE:VALE) fell more than 4% after it warned yet-another one of its mines is in danger of collapsing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week None of those names are top trading prospects headed into the final trading day of the week, however. Rather, it's the stock charts of PPL (NYSE:PPL), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) that are shaping up as the best bets. Here's what should happen next. PPL (PPL)Utility stock PPL had plenty of help moving lower yesterday. The entire sector lost ground as traders migrated out of the safety they tend to offer and back into riskier sectors.PPL was unique, however, in the sense that the stumble carried shares to new multi-week lows, and did do on lots of volume. There's a chance any budding pullback could be caught before it spins out of control, but there's also a chance it might not find support at that floor.  Click to Enlarge  * The floor in question is currently at $26.80, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. That line tags the last two major lows.  * Yesterday's weakness also took shape on unusually high volume, yet wasn't prodded by the news. This could be a hint there are more sellers waiting in the wings to see a little more trouble before bailing out.  * On the flipside, regardless of what happens from here, new technical ceilings have been defined. The upper one of those is as high as $37, lining up with the string of higher highs seen in the latter half of last year. It just may not matter for a while. Tyson Foods (TSN)It's tempting to want to get on the Tyson Foods train. Shares are up a stunning 65% from their late-December low, and still appear to be accelerating. The higher it flies, the seemingly stronger it gets.The rally is setting up to be more of a trap, however, luring in the last of unsuspecting investors before the buyers unload into that strength and kickstart a pullback. It hasn't started yet, but we saw a subtle hint in yesterday's bar that suggests we could be at the pivot point. And, the future is primed for selling.  * Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 -- So Far   Click to Enlarge  * As of yesterday's close, TSN shares are 31% above the white 200-day moving average line. That's even more divergence than we saw in late-2017 when a massive selloff took shape.  * The shape of Thursday's bar is also a concern. The open and closer were in the bottom half of the intraday high/low range, suggesting yesterday was the point that transitioned from a net-buying to net-selling environment.  * Although yesterday's bar is a red flag, it's only confirmed by a move lower, and ideally an open within Thursday's intraday range followed by a close below yesterday's low.  * The weekly chart's RSI indicator has been into overbought territory for a while, which doesn't happen often, and didn't last long the last time we saw it happen. Electronic Arts (EA)Electronic Arts is one of those names investors seem to know they punished too severely in the latter half of last year, but have been hesitant to undo that damage.Traders are increasingly willing to test the waters for a potential turnaround though. The repetition of this effort is telling in and of itself, but the simple act of forcing more and more 'trial balloons' is chipping away at the big technical ceiling as well. One more good day could get EA over the hump.  Click to Enlarge  * That 'hump' is mostly the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Simultaneously, the major peaks going back to February line up to make a near-term technical ceiling that as of yesterday is being pressured again.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the Chaikin line is back above zero, and the MACD lines are showing a new bullish divergence. The budding uptrend already has multiple tailwinds.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore’s dramatic year continued Wednesday as investors were whipsawed by two big pieces of news with conflicting implications.First, Brazil’s Vale SA said it won court approval to revive operations at one of its biggest projects, a development that’s likely to help ease global supply concerns that had sent prices to a five-year high. But just a few minutes later, No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group said it’s not going to be able to hit an already lowered output target this year after problems at its sprawling operations in Western Australia.The iron ore market has been on a roar since January after the fatal collapse of a dam in Brazil resulted in steep reductions in supply from Vale, the biggest shipper. Those supply concerns have been compounded by operational problems in Western Australia, where Rio and BHP Group mine.Today’s announcements come after iron ore prices renewed a surge in recent days, hitting the highest levels in five years. Prices have been driven higher as the effects of supply disruptions in Brazil ripple through to China, where port inventories have tumbled and steel mills are churning out record volumes.London-based Rio now expects to produce 320 million to 330 million tons this year. That’s less than an earlier goal of 333 million to 343 million tons. Vale’s restart could bring on an additional 5.4 million tons this year, according to BMO Capital Markets.Vale said today that Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice revoked the injunction stopping the iron ore miner from using its dam in Brucutu, clearing the way for the company to reopen the mine within 72 hours.That’s the third time the Rio de Janeiro-based miner signaled the return to normal operations at facilities that accounted for almost a third of the capacity that’s been shuttered since the fatal tailings dam disaster in January.“The net impact of Rio Tinto and Vale’s announcements is a further reduction in iron ore supply in an already tight market,” BMO analyst Edward Sterck said. “Price spikes in iron ore probably cannot be ruled out, but we still think that pricing is sufficient to stimulate swing supply.”Rio cut its guidance in April after a cyclone hit its operations in Australia, lowering an original target of 338 to 350 million tons. BHP Group, the No. 3 producer, also cut its target, adding to supply concerns.Rio shares fell as much as 5.4% in London trading. The stock is still near the highest level in more than a decade because of the rally in iron ore, the most important commodity for the company.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel Hill, Dylan GriffithsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Investors Whipsawed as Iron Ore’s Dramatic Year Continues

2019-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore exports from Australia are set to post the first annual drop in almost two decades following bad weather and output setbacks, worsening a global shortage and bolstering prices that have already surged to a five-year high. Futures advanced.The world’s top shipper cut its 2019 forecast to 814 million tons from 867 million in March and boosted its estimate for this year’s average price by almost 20%, according to a report by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science on Monday. That would be the first contraction since 2001. Last year, Australian exports totaled 835 million tons.Iron ore has soared above $100 a ton, driven by the twin forces of supply disruptions in Brazil and Australia and strong demand from steel mills in China. This will push the value of Australia’s exports to A$79 billion ($55 billion) in fiscal 2020, reflecting higher prices that are largely due to Vale SA’s dam disaster in January, the department said.“The iron ore price is expected to be higher than previously forecast -- and for a longer period -- due to the limited capacity of other operations in Australia and elsewhere to ramp up and replace Vale’s production loss of high-grade supply, at least in the short term,” the report said.On Monday, futures on the Singapore Exchange surged as much 6.3% to $120 a ton, the highest since 2014, while the contract in China jumped 4.1%. Benchmark spot ore was last at $118.05 a ton, according to Mysteel Global. In Sydney, miners’ shares rose.Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group both revised down their annual production outlooks in the wake of Cyclone Veronica in the first half, and Rio in June further lowered its output target after problems at its sprawling operations in Western Australia.“The seaborne iron ore market is thus likely to stay tight, and prices elevated, out to at least 2021,” the report said.Global seaborne iron ore supply is forecast to decline by 4.1% to around 1.5 billion tons in 2019, driven by events stemming from the dam collapse, the report said. Vale’s production is expected to gradually recover over the next three years, with the full recovery in its production hinging on 60 million tons of production associated with the use of tailings dams, the department said.At the same time, steel production in China is heading for a record year, the department said. Infrastructure stimulus and good margins will aid the sector, although production will gradually decline through 2021. The world’s largest steelmaker had pushed run-rates to a record above 1 billion tons a year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official statistics.An expected slowdown in global economic growth in 2019 and 2020 is a key risk to the outlook, and will likely to lead to less demand for steel-making inputs — metallurgical coal and iron ore, the report said. However, China is expected to respond to slowing growth and U.S.-China trade tensions by loosening monetary policy and increasing government spending on infrastructure and construction projects, it said.(Updates prices in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Krystal Chia in Singapore at kchia48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Jake Lloyd-SmithFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Australia's Iron Exports to Drop for First Time in 18 Years

2019-07-02,"(Bloomberg) -- A Brazilian Senate committee is expected to recommend that 12 current and former executives of Vale SA, including Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani and ex-Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schvartsman, face criminal indictments for a fatal dam disaster in January.The rapporteur of the committee proposed the indictments Tuesday after a 2-1/2-month congressional inquiry into the causes of the dam break that left at least 246 people dead and unleashed a sea of mud over the city of Brumadinho, where Vale had an inactive iron ore mine. His report says the company was negligent and its risk and compliance controls were flawed.If approved, as expected, the report will be sent to several Brazilian authorities, including federal and state police and prosecutors, as well as the governor of Minas Gerais and the ministries of energy and environment. The report, which will be voted on by the committee on July 9, has political weight and sends a message from lawmakers to their electorate, but it will be up to the authorities to decide on legal action.&quot;Vale respectfully disagrees with the recommendation for indictment,” it said in a statement Tuesday. &quot;The company considers it necessary that a scientific and technical conclusion be reached on the cause of the disaster before criminal culpability is determined. Vale and its employees will continue to cooperate with authorities to determine the cause of the dam breach.&quot;The panel also recommended a special participation tax of as much as 40% on highly profitable miners. Shares of the world’s largest iron ore producer tumbled 4.2% to 51.39 reais, the worst performer on the 66-member Ibovespa index in Sao Paulo.Risk ToleranceVale’s attempt to reduce costs resulted in heightened tolerance for risks, according to the report, which recommends criminal indictments for homicide, bodily injury and environmental damage. It also suggests that authorities continue investigating Vale and its executives.The report also recommends indictments for two people from TUV SUD, which Vale hired to inspect the dam.Federal prosecutors of Minas Gerais are already investigating Vale in cases that are running under secrecy. They haven’t criminally charged anyone yet. In Brazil, prosecutors and police can both recommend criminal action to a judge.&quot;As expected, the first version of the investigation report about the Brumadinho accident would have a punitive in nature,&quot; said Bradesco BBI’s analyst Thiago Lofiego, in a report from July 2. &quot;While we do believe that mining sector legislation is likely to change in Brazil, we do not think the highly punitive proposals in question will materialize,&quot; Bradesco analysts said, referring to the tax.The levy would be &quot;very negative&quot; for Vale, said Leonardo Rufino, a partner and portfolio manager at Pacifico Gestao de Recursos, which oversees about 2 billion reais ($520 million) in assets, including Vale shares.&#92;--With assistance from Luiza Ferraz.To contact the reporters on this story: Maria Luiza Rabello in Brasilia Newsroom at mrabello@bloomberg.net;Sabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.net;Vinícius Andrade in São Paulo at vandrade3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, ;Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Walter BrandimarteFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Vale CFO Should Face Criminal Indictment for Dam, Panel Says"

2019-07-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazilian stocks have extended their year-to-date gain to about 20% on renewed optimism that Latin America’s largest economy will finally overhaul its heavily indebted social security system. But the rally that has pushed the market to record highs still may have some juice left.The benchmark Ibovespa index may climb 11% from current levels to about 115,000 by the end of 2019, according to the average forecast of 10 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. Their targets range from 105,000 to 123,000, implying an increase of as much as 18%. That would mark the fourth year of double-digit gains for Brazilian stocks.Reforming pensions should allow Brazil’s central bank to reduce the benchmark interest rate below the current, historically low 6.5%, pushing more funds into the local stock market, strategists say. While the domestic swap rates curve is pricing in an easing cycle of 108 basis point until the end of the year, some of the nation’s fund managers and economists see room for the Selic rate to reach 5%.“A strong fiscal anchor will likely open room for deeper interest rate cuts,” Bradesco BBI analysts led by Andre Carvalho wrote in a July 10 report, raising their target for the Ibovespa to 122,000 from 116,000. “Low interest rates should help boost the capital markets and M&A activities, as well as reduce financial expenses and increase the attractiveness of bond-like stocks,” Carvalho said.Bank of America has reiterated its overweight rating for Brazilian stocks in its Latin American portfolio, seeing the Ibovespa at 120,000 in the end of this year. “Flows into equities should keep supporting the market,” BofA’s Latin America equity strategist David Beker wrote in a note.Passing pension reform is also expected to unlock a long-awaited rebound in Brazil’s economy.

That’s still below the 96.8 million tons Vale produced in the second quarter last year.A dam collapse in January forced the company to halt operations with capacity equal to almost a quarter of this year’s original production target of 400 million tons. While Vale has managed to bring its 30-million ton Brucutu mine back to normal operations, that hasn’t halted the surge in prices. Rivals BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group also saw their output decline, deepening the supply shortfall.&quot;The focus should be around plans for restarting any additional capacity,&quot; Scott Schier, an analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities, said in an interview. &quot;There’s been some chatter about a potential restart of some more operation in September-October.&quot;Iron ore prices have surged more than 60% this year in Singapore this year amid the supply disruptions in Brazil and Australia. Futures closed 3% higher at 916 yuan ($133.10) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange Friday, the highest since December 2013.In May, Vale Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani Pires said the company expects to bring back online another 30 million tons in shuttered capacity over the next six to 12 months, after Brucutu returns to normal operations. Reviving the remaining 30 million tons would take another two to three years. The miner has maintained its 2019 sales guidance for iron ore and the semi-processed material called pellets at 307 million to 332 million tons.HSBC Holdings Plc analysts expect a tighter iron ore market longer-term because of &quot;significant supply disruptions,&quot; and better demand prospects through 2021. The bank raised its 2019 price forecast for iron ore to $95 a ton, from $82.80 in mid-July.Rio Tinto’s iron ore production fell 7% to 80 million tons in the second quarter from a year earlier, as a result of a cyclone and operational challenges at its mines. Annual output from BHP’s Australian mines slipped about 2% to 269.6 million tons, missing an average forecast of 272 million tons among five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Vale’s iron ore and pellets sales likely rebounded to 70.6 million tons in the second quarter, from 67.7 million three months earlier, according to the average of five analyst estimates. That’s still down from 86.5 million tons a year earlier.&quot;We expect supply will take at least two to three years to normalize given the magnitude of the tragedy at Vale,&quot; HSBC analysts including Jonathan Brandt said in a note July 14. &quot;A combination of supply disruption from the major iron ore producers and better-than-expected steel production in China has led to a significant rally in iron ore prices.&quot;To contact the reporters on this story: Vinícius Andrade in São Paulo at vandrade3@bloomberg.net;Sabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, ;Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Iron Ore Market Looks to Top Miner for Clues on End to Shortages

2019-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Samarco Mineracao SA, the Brazilian mining venture that hasn’t operated since a deadly dam collapse in 2015, is close to regaining a license to restart production and move closer to paying back $3.5 billion in defaulted debt.The license will most likely be granted within the second half of this year, the Minas Gerais state environmental agency press department said in an email. A Samarco spokeswoman declined to comment. Negotiations with creditors will resume in October following the license renewal, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plans.The venture, jointly owned by Vale SA and BHP Group Ltd., has already reached an agreement with the regulator and could get formal permission to operate as soon as mid-September, said people familiar with the regulatory situation, who asked not to be named because talks between the company and the government are private.“There might be some optimism that Samarco can get theirs later this year to restart in 2020,” said Roger Horn, a senior emerging-markets strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York. “The bigger issue is how quickly they can ramp up” to start servicing their debt.The miner’s November 2022 bonds rose as high as 76.181 cents on the dollar on Wednesday from 75.75 cents the day before, according to Trace price data.Greenpeace AdviserSamarco has been advised by Lina Pimentel, a former Greenpeace lawyer and now environmental legal specialist at law firm Mattos Filho. Pimentel, who also served as chief of the environmental agency in the state of Sao Paulo, started working with Samarco right after the 2015 accident in Mariana, Minas Gerais, which killed 19 people.She was key to helping the company get an initial license in December. But the efforts became delayed in January when Vale suffered an even worse disaster at one of its mines in Brumadinho, also in the Minas Gerais state. The Brumadinho dam burst killed 248 people with another 40 missing and presumed dead, prompting the state to pass new regulations to avoid future accidents.“We decided to keep the bond after meeting with her in April,” said Ian McCall, who oversees $190 million in emerging-market assets at First Geneva Capital Partners, referring to Samarco’s $2.2 billion in defaulted bonds maturing between 2022 and 2024. “It was quite a pleasant surprise to meet her, understand her background and the job she has been doing for years.”As part of the regulatory negotiations, the miner is revising its business plan to move 80% of its production to dry processing. The new plan will be put up for shareholder approval in August, while the regulatory go-ahead may come before the Mining Expo, the largest in Latin America, that will take place in Sept. 9-12 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais’s capital, one of the people said.(Updates with creditor talks to start in October in second paragrah, bond trading in fifth)&#92;--With assistance from Dan Wilchins.To contact the reporter on this story: Pablo Gonzalez in Sao Paulo at pgonzalez49@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Alec D.B.

2019-08-02,Vale's (VALE) second quarter marked its second consecutive quarterly loss owing to the Brumadinho dam disaster.,"Vale (VALE) Reports Loss in Q2, Revenues Hit by Dam Disaster"
2019-08-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore has gone from high-flier to sinking star in a matter of weeks. The commodity that lit up the first half with a stunning rally dropped back below $100 a ton as supplies pick up, mills’ profitability falls and investors dump raw materials amid the escalating trade war.Futures in Singapore fell as much as 8.6% to $94.32 a ton, while the contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange extended losses after entering a bear market last week. Miners’ shares retreated, with markets focused on the consequences of China allowing the yuan to weaken to the lowest in more than a decade.Iron ore’s fortunes have shifted as the drivers that aided first-half gains -- a supply squeeze coupled with booming demand -- have weakened. Brazil’s Vale SA has been restoring more capacity after its dam burst, with exports rebounding. At the same time there are headwinds to consumption in China as the trade war rumbles on, with a gauge of mills’ profitability turning negative, and the yuan sinking beyond 7 per dollar for the first time since 2008.Iron ore is “past its peak pricing after the Vale event this year sent it into the clouds,” David Lennox, an analyst at Fat Prophets, said from Sydney. The yuan’s drop “feeds into the concerns about economic growth,” which are ultimately driven by uncertainty around U.S.-China trade relations, he said.The trade war between Washington and Beijing has dented investors’ appetite for raw materials, and the rise in tensions comes on the heels of data highlighting a manufacturing slowdown in key markets. Global steel output dropped in June from a month earlier, with declines seen in nations including China, Germany, the U.S. and India, according to the World Steel Association.‘Outright Bearish’“We are outright bearish on demand,” Marex Spectron Group analyst Hui Heng Tan said. Mills’ margins have taken a turn for the worse, construction activity is facing a slowdown and steel inventories are higher, he said.Ore for September was 7.3% lower at $95.63 a ton in Singapore at 7:28 p.m., heading for the lowest close since early June. Benchmark spot material has also suffered as the negatives stacked up, collapsing to $99.50 a ton on Monday. That’s down from a five-year high of $127.15 last month.Bearish SignalsAmong recent market signals:Port inventories of ore in China expanded 1.5% to 121.05 million tons last week, rising for a third week, according to Shanghai SteelHome E-Commerce Co. Holdings of material from Australia and Brazil both climbed, with ore from the South American nation rising 5%.Shipments from Brazil climbed to 34.3 million tons last month, according to government figures. That’s up 17% from June, and the highest total this year. Vale said it expects a better second half.A Bloomberg gauge of profitability at mainland blast furnace operators has turned negative, dropping to the lowest level since 2017. China accounts for more than half of global steel supply.Both banks and ore users have said they expect prices to ease. Among forecasters, Morgan Stanley sees $90 in the fourth quarter, saying Chinese demand will gradually retreat while supplies gain.Declines in futures in Singapore and Dalian have been given added impetus as markets are backwardated, with lower prices further out, so rolls between contracts as interest and volumes shift forward amplify moves in a falling market.While lower prices aren’t good news for top miners including Vale, Rio Tinto Group, BHP Group and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., they remain substantially higher than a year earlier and well above their costs of production. Shares in Fortescue slumped 7.2% in Sydney.Shares of Vale, the world’s largest iron ore producer, fell as much as 4.1% in Sao Paulo, heading for a fifth straight decline.&#92;--With assistance from Krystal Chia, Martin Ritchie, Ranjeetha Pakiam and Vinícius Andrade.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Jake Lloyd-Smith in Singapore at jlloydsmith@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Iron Ore Bulls Take to Their Heels as Futures Plummet Below $100

2019-08-06,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips The first two quarters of 2019 have been challenging for Vale S A NYSE VALE The company posted quarterly losses resulting from the dam burst in January As a result Vale stock,Vale Stock to Trend Higher on Positive Industry Tailwinds
2019-08-06,"The first two quarters of 2019 have been challenging for Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE). The company posted quarterly losses resulting from the dam burst in January. As a result, Vale stock has been depressed with a failure to breakout above $14 twice in 2019.However, I believe that the second half of 2019 will be better for VALE stock and investors can use the current decline to accumulate the stock.This article will discuss the company and industry-specific factors that will support a possible positive momentum in the second half of 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Burden of Write-DownsFor 1Q 2019, Vale reported total write-downs of $4.95 billion. For 2Q 2019, the total write-downs were $2.0 billion.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long This translated into quarterly losses for Vale and overshadowed positive industry developments. With nearly $7 billion in write-downs, it is likely that further write-downs will be minimal. This negative factor is therefore discounted in the stock price.I am of the opinion that market attention will now shift to the restart of production, positive industry developments, and deleveraging. Production Restart TriggerVALE had to halt production totaling 93 Metric tons per year (Mtpy) in its first quarter of 2019. The company has already resumed iron ore production of approximately 43 Mtpy.The company further expects resumption of 20 Mtpy production by the end of 2019. The remaining production of 30 Mtpy is likely to be recovered over the next two to three years.The key point here is that total iron ore production for the second half of 2019 will be higher as compared to the first half of 2019. Production growth is likely to sustain in 2020 from the lows of 2019.As sales volume trend higher, EBITDA and free cash flow visibility will improve in the next 12-18 months for Vale stock. Higher Iron Ore Price Effects Vale StockMid- and high-grade iron ore prices have trended to multi-year highs with Chinese port inventory declining to its lowest level since October 2017.Even for Vale, higher EBITDA in 2Q19 as compared to 1Q19 was primarily driven by higher ore prices coupled with higher sales volume. This trend is likely to sustain in the coming quarters.It is also important to note that the company's iron ore sales product mix indicates 86% premium products in 2Q19 as compared to 77% in 2Q18. This would imply margin expansion on a year-on-year basis on the back of a favorable product mix.In addition, stoppage and extraordinary logistics expense related to Brumadinho dam rupture was $5.7/t in 2Q19. These expenses are likely to decline by $1.5/t in 3Q19 and will also support EBITDA margin expansion. Ongoing DeleveragingFor 1Q19, Vale's gross debt had surged to $17.05 billion. In the second quarter, the company was able to reduce gross debt to $15.79 billion.I believe that VALE will continue to deleverage in the second half of 2019. The company's free cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion for 2Q19. I believe that free cash flows will increase in the next two quarters on higher sales volume and price realization (iron ore).Therefore, decline in debt will improve the company's credit metrics and potentially take the stock higher. While Vale pursues deleveraging, 65% of the company's debt is due on or after 2023. Clearly, there is no debt refinancing pressure in the foreseeable future. Risk Factors to VALE Stock Bullish OutlookChina's economic growth is the key trigger for trend in commodity prices. As mentioned earlier, iron ore prices have trended higher as a result of decline in Chinese port inventory.I do believe that China's growth has bottomed out. However, weak growth in the U.S. or Europe can possibly imply even lower GDP growth in China. Therefore, weak economic growth and its impact on commodity price is one key negative trigger that needs to be monitored.One factor that can offset this risk is an expansionary monetary policy in the United States. A weak dollar can send commodity prices surging higher.It is worth noting that commodity, as an asset class, has been an under-performer in the last two decades. It seems unlikely that there is meaningful downside in commodity prices in the coming years. Concluding Words on Vale StockVale stock has been sideways to lower in the last 12-months. In particular, the first half of 2019 has been challenging for the company.However, I am of the opinion that the second half of 2019 will be positive. I expect higher revenue driven by growth in sales volumes. Importantly, write-downs should decline significantly and Vale will continue to deleverage.These developments should translate into higher Vale stock price and current levels are attractive for exposure to the stock.As of this writing, Faisal Humayun did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-25,"(Bloomberg) -- The Church of England has dumped Vale SA, and it doesn’t look like the Brazilian miner will make it back into the good books any time soon.The church sold its shares in Vale after a tailings dam collapse in January killed at least 249 people in the Brazilian town of Brumadinho. It has also blocked investments in the miner through an ethical exclusion process, according to Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the church’s pension board.There’s a “long way to go” before the church is ready to backtrack, he said by phone before the Financial Times Commodities Americas Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where he is scheduled to speak.“We obviously need to see the outcome of various investigations,” Matthews said. “We also need to further understand that the company has done all it possibly can to ensure the community locally has been supported and compensated -- to the extent that’s even possible -- and then at that point we will make a judgment but I think that’s quite some way off.”The Church of England has been at the forefront of a divestment movement targeting companies failing to meet environmental rules and tackle climate change. While its total holdings in Vale were less than 10 million pounds ($12.5 million), the move highlights how investors are flexing their muscles to pressure companies to adhere to environmental standards.The collapse at the Feijao mine was Vale’s second fatal disaster since 2015. That year, a Samarco Mineracao SA mine co-owned by Vale spewed billions of gallons of waste in Mariana, in what was largely considered Brazil’s worst environmental disaster ever. Iron ore producer Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Group, is currently awaiting an environmental permit to resume operations.The Church of England wrote to Vale and more than 700 other companies requesting details on all their tailings dam operations and asking for full disclosure of their responses as part of its Investor Mining & Tailings Safety Initiative. Representatives of the church will also meet Vale in a few weeks in London at the company’s request to discuss the issue, Matthews said.“Tailings management isn’t just an issue related to Vale, although obviously we now have two disasters connected to that company specifically,” he said. “It’s a global issue that has implications across multiple jurisdictions and we are looking at how you can fix that issue across the whole of mining.”Vales has faced increased government oversight following the two disasters. Upstream dams have to be taken out of service or drained of mining waste by 2027, the National Mining Agency said last month. The producer said it would invest 11 billion reais ($2.6 billion) in the next five years on a dry method for processing iron ore that eliminates the need for riskier wet waste storage dams.Investors and business forces are aligning on climate change in ways that will reshape energy and mining for years to come. The Church of England played a major role in pressuring Royal Dutch Shell Plc to cut carbon in its portfolio and increasing pressure on firms to disclose more about their lobbying.“We do feel that disinvestment has a role, but we don’t believe in just disinvestment from the whole sector and walking away,” Matthews said. “We haven’t walked away from the oil and gas sector, we haven’t walked away from the mining sector. We do think there’s the potential for companies in those sectors to transition.”But when it’s clear that some companies don’t have a way forward, the church is willing to use disinvestment on both financial and ethical grounds, he said.To contact the reporters on this story: Isis Almeida in Chicago at ialmeida3@bloomberg.net;Sabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, Nicholas Larkin, Luzi Ann JavierFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","After Dumping Vale, Church of England Says Miner Has ‘Way to Go’"

Mozambique exported $1.7 billion worth of the fuel used in power stations and steel plants last year, with Vale operations in the center of the country accounting for almost all of that.The company completed a review of its Mozambican coal mines and decided to shift the focus to producing more metallurgical coal -- used to produce steel -- and less of the lower-value product that power stations burn.

The need to retain their business is becoming ever more critical amid forecasts that the market is around its peak.“For miners, Chinese import volumes are basically not going to grow the way they used to,” said Tomas Gutierrez, analyst at Kallanish Commodities Ltd. “Any increase in value for iron ore will come from either adding service to mills or from cutting out the traders.”Rio and rivals -- who have spent more than a decade pumping billions into expansions to keep pace with China’s fast-rising appetite for iron ore -- are now preparing for an era of slower growth and an eventual high point in the nation’s steel output.They are introducing a range of initiatives to retain existing sales and add new customers -- from Rio’s development of a mobile app, to portside sales, and selling directly from China’s ports in yuan instead of shipping cargoes from Australia or Brazil that are sold in dollars.New Strategies“Our China portside customers will be able to order via a mobile app,” Rio’s Chief Commercial Officer Simon Trott told an investor seminar in October. “You can order a few tons of ore, in the same way you’d place an order on Amazon.”Rio has started portside sales, while BHP also has been testing “spot sales during transport to China as well as sales in smaller quantities with shorter lead times from bonded stockpiles in China,” Rod Dukino, vice president for sales and marketing iron ore, said at a conference in September.Selling at ports allows miners to blend different types of ore, and means “more money in the miners’ pockets,” according to UBS Group AG managing director and global head of mining, Glyn Lawcock. “We have seen over the last few years increasing sales to traders and now the miners are clawing back some of that lost margin essentially.”In particular, the use of the Chinese yuan is a breakthrough for an industry dominated by the dollar. For mills, this eliminates currency risks. For miners, this broadens their customer base and again cuts out the traders, said Lawcock.In June, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. set up a sales office in China, offering direct supply of smaller volumes in the yuan. “This represents a new sales channel for Fortescue to complement our existing seaborne trade,” Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said in an email.BHP sees “huge potential in the digitization of our post-trade processes across our portfolio, both for customers and suppliers alike, through increased visibility and traceability of goods” Dukino said in an email.Large and medium-sized steel mills in China generally support the miners’ new sales strategies, according to a survey by Bloomberg of five executives at mills and industry groups.“As producers get closer to a diverse range of end customers, they understand their needs more, to facilitate an evolution in interaction and even digitalization,” according to Andrew Glass, founder of Avatar Commodities Pte and formerly head of iron ore financial trading at Anglo American Plc.Still, launching new sales channels also has its risks, and companies need to be mitigating them at the same time as extending their supply chain, Glass warned.Tight RaceThe initiatives follow similar strategies adopted by Vale since 2015. The Brazilian miner, which is still grappling with the effects of a fatal dam disaster earlier this year, blends and sells from 16 ports in China. It also has a center in Malaysia, where ore can be stored and blended.In the first for a foreign miner, Vale signed a deal with a Chinese steel mill based on prices of iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.While Vale has had a headstart in sales efforts, Rio is catching up, according to Kallanish’s Gutierrez. “Now that the port stock market is more developed, and the sales mechanisms are developed, then all the miners will need to compete in this area.”“The enhancement of having things like port stocks and port trade allows flexibility, and allows smaller parcel deliveries to customers,” Rio’s iron ore Chief Executive Officer Chris Salisbury said in a interview last week.&#92;--With assistance from David Stringer, Winnie Zhu and Alfred Cang.To contact the reporter on this story: Krystal Chia in Singapore at kchia48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Buying Iron Ore Is Getting More Like Shopping on Amazon

2020-01-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Samarco Mineracao SA has rejected creditors’ formal request to resume talks to restructure its defaulted debt, signaling heightened risks for bond holders, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation.The Brazilian iron ore venture between BHP Group and Vale SA said it has yet to firm up its business plan. And without that, the company argues that it will be at a disadvantage if it were to resume talks that have been put on hold for almost a year on its $2.9 billion in defaulted debt, the people said.Samarco has said it will restart iron ore mining in the second half of this year after securing all the permits required by authorities. Operations have been halted since a waste dam collapse in 2015 that killed 19 people, curtailing the company’s ability to meet its obligations to creditors.The continued delay in talks to restructure the debt may antagonize Samarco’s creditors, the people said. That’s bad news for holders of the company’s $2.2 billion in bonds maturing 2022 and 2024 that have fallen to 66 to 69 cents. The company has been in default on these obligations for almost four years.Samarco estimates production to hit as high as 8 million metric tons per year in 2020 and reach full capacity of about 24 million tons of pellets by around 2030.Negotiations for the restructuring of the defaulted debt were put on hold at the end of January 2019, when Vale, which owns half of the venture, suffered an even worse disaster at a mine in Brumadinho, also in the state of Minas Gerais. That spurred heightened scrutiny of applications for environmental permits by regulators.BHP, Vale and Samarco declined to comment.To contact the reporter on this story: Pablo Gonzalez in Sao Paulo at pgonzalez49@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Luzi Ann Javier, Christopher DeRezaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Samarco Rebuffs Creditors on Resumption of Debt Talks

2020-01-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Almost one year to the day, Vale SA shares recovered all the ground they lost following the deadly dam break that weighed on global iron-ore supplies and led to an international backlash.The stock on Tuesday traded as high as 56.35 reais, up 1.9% on the day and topping the 56.15 real close on Jan. 24, 2019, the day before the Brumadinho dam collapse buried a Brazilian village and killed more than 250 people. Vale lost a quarter of its value in the trading session following the disaster, its second dam break in a little more than three years, which also led to fines, a dividend suspension, and possibly criminal charges.“The de-risking is already in course,” Bradesco BBI analysts Thiago Lofiego and Isabella Vasconcelos wrote in a report dated Jan. 12. They see room for further share gains on the back of potential upside for iron-ore prices and “a good chance of Vale reinstating its dividend policy in the first half of 2020.”But risks remain. The world’s biggest iron ore producer is still struggling to restore lost output and rebuild its reputation among investors. And Brazil prosecutors are expected to file criminal charges in the case soon.Output still hasn’t fully recovered, either. The Brumadinho disaster forced Vale to halt operations that account for almost a quarter of its 400 million-ton target last year, roiling iron ore markets across the globe. Vale said during an investors day last month that it expects to produce between 340 million and 355 million tons of iron ore in 2020.Vale’s ADRs also still have a ways to go before catching up to their pre-disaster price, although that has a lot to do with a weaker real that’s still trading down 11% compared with a year ago.

2020-01-16,"(Bloomberg) -- In the weeks and months after Vale SA’s deadly dam disaster, some of Brazil’s biggest investors snatched up shares in a bet they’d bounce back and then keep rising.A year later, the gamble paid off, but with a caveat: The stock rebounded, but Vale’s reputation hasn’t -- and that’s the problem. While the world’s largest iron ore producer, like all miners, has struggled with plenty of environmental issues in the past, there’s no denying that a company’s green credentials suddenly matter now more than ever.“With sustainability growing in importance by the day for the global investor, my big concern now relates to the long term and whether Vale is going to be able to change its image,” said Leonardo Rufino, portfolio manager at Pacifico Gestao de Recursos. “Because if it can’t, the risk is that Vale ends up being a cheap stock forever.”Pacifico, along with SPX Capital and Vinland Capital, were among asset managers that scooped up Vale stock after the dam break in January 2019 wiped out a quarter of the company’s market value. Although Tuesday marked an important milestone for Vale as shares closed at their highest since the accident, a look at the miner’s valuation tells a different story. Vale still trades at a discount of at least 20% to peers BHP Group Ltd. and Rio Tinto Plc, based on enterprise-value-to-expected-Ebitda ratio.Exposure to Vale shares and holding company Bradespar SA at Pacifico Acoes, a fund that Rufino helps manage, rose to about 12% of assets at its peak from 8% around the time of the dam break. The fund has since sold its position in Bradespar, but Vale is still among its top five holdings.Room to RunIf all else were equal, Vale’s fundamentals would signal that the stock has more room to run, Rufino said, adding that he still believes further gains are in its future. The company’s generating cash, and analysts from Bradesco, Scotiabank and Goldman Sachs see a good chance of dividends being reinstated sometime this year. Meanwhile, Rufino says the nuts-and-bolts fallout from the Brumadinho disaster, including potential liabilities and the hit to output, is “mostly priced in.”Vale has taken several steps to clean up its image in the aftermath. It replaced its chief executive officer, committed to decommissioning the type of dams that faltered and built a treatment plant to clean up polluted water. At investor meetings last month, it focused on green initiatives, including projects to help it become carbon neutral, and also launched an ESG website. The company declined to comment for this article.“The company’s been careful, taking a lot of provisions and focusing on handling the problem,” said Rufino, who helps oversee 2.2 billion reais ($530 million) in assets at Pacifico. “A discount to its global peers seems unjustified.”Vale shares were little changed at mid-day in Sao Paulo, trailing the 0.4% advance for Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa, amid news of a fresh blow to output, albeit a limited one. Vale said Thursday that it halted operations at the newly acquired Esperanca mine near Brumadinho. The move was a precautionary step to improve safety conditions. Esperanca produces about 1 million tons of iron ore a year, the company said in note.An Urgent NoteBut as the world grows increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, money managers are plowing more and more funds into investments that fulfill environmental, social and governance -- or ESG -- standards. The Church of England dumped Vale after Brumadinho’s tragedy and blocked investments in the miner through an ethical exclusion process. And BlackRock, which upped its stake in Vale to above 5% as of December, struck an urgent note in its annual letter to corporate executives: Climate change will upend global finance sooner than they might think. CEO Larry Fink said his firm will take steps to address the issue across the thousands of companies in which it invests.Brazil’s own reputation isn’t helping Vale. President Jair Bolsonaro has questioned the need for action to combat global climate change and scoffed at his counterparts in Europe who called for him to do more to end the burning of the Amazon.That backdrop may continue to hinder any Vale upside.“At some point,” Rufino said, “we need to see a multiple expansion.”(Updates with new output halt, stock move in 9th paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Vinícius Andrade in São Paulo at vandrade3@bloomberg.net;Sabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Cancel at dcancel@bloomberg.net, Jessica Brice, Brendan WalshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The Big Problem Haunting Top Iron-Ore Miner Isn’t So Easy to Fix

2020-01-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA was dealt back-to-back blows on Tuesday as Brazilian officials announced criminal charges including for homicide in the wake of last year’s deadly dam collapse, while a prosecutor indicated additional output cuts may be on the horizon.Former Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schvartsman was charged with 270 counts of homicide, and the world’s largest iron ore miner and a contractor, TUV SUD, were accused of environmental crimes. Minas Gerais state prosecutors allege that the 65-year-old executive, who was at the helm when the Brumadinho disaster unleashed a deluge of sludge that buried a small town, knew about the risks, but made false statements and hid information to protect the company’s share price.“Fabio Schvartsman acted directly to create corporate incentives, not to avoid risks, but to channel efforts into protecting Vale’s market value,” William Coelho, a state prosecutor, told reporters in Minas Gerais. Schvartsman took over in 2017, a little less than two years after the Mariana tailings dam collapsed in a separate accident, killing 19. “He entered the role with the slogan ‘Mariana Never Again,’ but it was a false slogan.”Globally, it’s rare that a top executive would be charged with murder because of corporate actions -- though not totally unheard of. The head of Union Carbide Corp. was charged with manslaughter by Indian authorities for a 1984 gas leak that killed thousands in Bhopal (he was arrested but never faced trial after the U.S. refused to extradite him). The CEO of ThysssenKrupp AG’s Italian unit was sentenced to prison after a fire at a steel plant there killed seven workers in 2007; and the CEO of a South Korean ferry company was charged with homicide through occupational negligence after hundreds died when his vessel sank in 2014.Schvartsman ranks as the highest-profile executive yet to face charges after at the disaster in January 2019. He took a leave from his post in March after federal prosecutors recommended his immediate exit. Other former employees were also accused of homicide. Prosecutors filed charges against 21 people in 2016 for the Mariana disaster.Vale expressed “its perplexity at the accusations of fraud,” the miner said in a statement. “It is important to remember that other agencies are also investigating the case, and it is premature to point out a conscious risk taking to cause a deliberate breach of the dam.”As CEO, Schvartsman pushed ambitious plans to ramp up production, but Brumadinho changed all that. Plans to boost production to between 390 million tons and 400 million tons by 2019 were delayed by three years. Output in 2019 came in closer to 350 million tons.One of the prosecutors on the task force investigating the accident is reviewing additional operations and said she hasn’t ruled out the possibility that more production could be affected in what would be a fresh blow to the world’s largest iron ore miner. The shuttering of capacity last year helped benchmark iron ore prices surge 27% in 2019.“Last year’s experience showed us Vale wasn’t proactive in disclosing risks to authorities,” said Andressa Lanchotti, coordinator of the task force. “To the contrary, the company initially denied any risks at all.”More Dams at RiskSafety concerns have already prompted Vale to halt some production, including the Brucutu mine after it was flagged by an independent auditor and not by the company, Lanchotti told Bloomberg. Vale temporarily suspended part of Brucutu production in December after raising the risk level of the nearby Laranjeiras dam from 0 to a 1, the second lowest on four-tier scale where 3 means a burst is imminent. A level 2 requires evacuations.Independent auditors including Los Angeles-based Aecom are analyzing 25 Vale mines in Minas Gerais, as well as a 100 dams and dikes, Lanchotti said. The auditors were hired as part of a settlement between Vale and the Minas Gerais Prosecutor’s Office, whose task force includes about 20 people. Vale is covering the costs of the audit, but the information is sent directly to authorities.“It’s information the Prosecutor’s Office is still receiving,” she said during an interview in Belo Horizonte, the state’s capital. “Since the audit is ongoing, I can’t rule out new problems that could be identified in coming days or months that would require suspensions.”Vale is working to prevent possible stoppages at four level 3 mines, including at the Gongo Soco mine. But Lanchotti said more problems may be out there at mines that sit lower on the risk scale. She cited the Itabirucu dam in Itabira, Vale’s birthplace and a top iron-ore region. Vale partially shut production there after Aecom recommended that the structure be categorized as a level 1 in October.Committed to Safety“It’s important to note that Vale has always been committed to the safety of people and structures, and has been continuously improving its preventive risk management processes,” Vale said in response to Bloomberg questions. The auditing process is part of “the company’s commitment to provide the greatest transparency possible.”The company also said that results of the audits and relevant data is continuously shared with authorities.Vale’s American depositary receipts tumbled 2.8% to $13.25 in New York, the biggest decline since November. In Sao Paulo trading, shares were down 2.3%.In October, Vale said it posted $6.3 billion in expenses related to the Brumadinho rupture, which sent iron-ore prices on a roller coaster. The company lost about a fourth of its market value in the immediate aftermath, but it has since largely recovered in Sao Paulo trading.A report released in December from a panel of experts commissioned by Vale blamed faulty design for the dam’s collapse. The facility was too steep and had insufficient drainage, resulting in high water levels that put stress on the structure, according to the report.In September, Brazilian police indicted Vale, the testing service TUV SUD and 13 employees of the two companies for producing misleading documents about the safety of the dam that buried the community of Brumadinho, in Minas Gerais state.&#92;--With assistance from Joe Richter and Krystal Chia.To contact the reporters on this story: Sabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.net;Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at pmillard1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Phoebe Sedgman, Alpana SarmaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Iron Ore Output Far From Certain as Vale Homicide Charges Filed
2020-01-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Fabio Schvartsman was supposed to be the fresh face that would help Vale SA, the world’s biggest iron ore miner, advance after a 2015 dam collapse. Instead, the 65-year-old is facing homicide charges after the company’s latest deadly disaster.While he knew little of mining and metals, Schvartsman had more than doubled the shares at Klabin SA, Brazil’s largest paper producer, where he secured financing to roll out low-cost projects and gained a reputation for cost efficiency. He was named to lead Vale in May 2017, just as the company brought the industry’s largest new project online, boosting both production and profit.Now, 2 1/2 years later, Schvartsman stands accused of 270 counts of homicide as a result of a second dam collapse near Brumadinho in January 2019. He’s charged with knowing ahead of time of safety issues at the massive tailings dam and helping hide them prior to the deadliest such event in Brazil’s history.Ironically, Schvartsman -- who left the top post in March -- began his role as the Vale CEO with a vow never to allow a repeat of the Mariana dam failure in 2015. Now, he’s awaiting a judge’s decision on the state charges he faces for Brumadinho, and is facing the possibility of federal charges ahead.“Fabio Schvartsman acted directly to create corporate incentives, not to avoid risks, but to channel efforts into protecting Vale’s market value,” Willian Coelho, a state prosecutor, told reporters in Minas Gerais.He “entered the role with the slogan ‘Mariana Never Again,’” Coelho said. “But it was a false slogan.”In a statement, Vale said it was perplexed by the accusations of fraud. “It is important to remember that other agencies are also investigating the case,” the company statement said “And it is premature to point out a conscious risk taking to cause a deliberate breach of the dam.”‘A Brazilian Jewel’Schvartsman, meanwhile, was unavailable for comment on Tuesday. In a February 14 public hearing last year, he called Vale “a Brazilian jewel that can not be condemned for an accident that happened in one of its dams, even as it was a tragedy.”Schvartsman was seen by many as a potential savior for a company that had been on a roller coaster ride with the previous CEO. Under Murilo Ferreira, Vale’s shares lost about 30% as commodity prices tumbled amid slowing Chinese demand and expanding supply. Ferreira, though, helped push through the opening of a $14 billion mining complex in an area where ore quality is higher and costs will be lower.Criticism over the 2015 Mariana disaster, however, dogged him, and eventually he was pushed aside, making way for Schvartsman. For awhile, it was a perfect match. Vale shares almost doubled between the time Schvartsman was named CEO and when the dam disaster hit.Previous CEOOf all the Brazilian business leaders to be charged in recent years, Schvartsman stands out with the homicide charges. Ferreira wasn’t included in criminal charges from the 2015 dam spill. Corruption and insider trading have been more common crimes in recent years.In December, Brazilian prosecutors filed a case against meatpacker JBS SA, its holding company and 14 people for alleged fraud in loans from the nation’s development bank. Prosecutors requested the companies and founders Joesley and Wesley Batista be convicted for wrongdoing regarding transactions between the meat giant and BNDES that resulted in illegal enrichment.Less than three months earlier, Eike Batista, formerly Brazil’s richest man and no relation to the JBS owners, was sentenced to an additional eight years and seven months of prison time for insider trading. Batista had already been convicted for paying $16.6 million to get government contracts as part of a sprawling corruption probe known as Carwash and sentenced to 30 years, which he is serving under house arrest.While Schvartsman was charged with homicide and Vale was accused of environmental crimes, it is unclear when or if he will actually be put behind bars. A criminal case from the 2015 dam spill, which also included homicide charges against some Vale executives, was suspended by in 2017 after a judge found evidence of illegal wire tapping by investigators.To contact the reporters on this story: Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at pmillard1@bloomberg.net;Sabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, Luzi Ann JavierFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","From Mining Savior to Homicide Charges, the Fall of Vale’s Chief"

2020-01-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Exactly one year ago, a Brazilian dam operated by iron ore miner Vale SA gave way to a tsunami of 9.7 million cubic meters of mining sludge that buried part of a town and killed 270 people.In the days, weeks and months since Jan. 25, 2019, the world’s largest iron ore miner has made progress in undoing some—but not all—of the damage done when the dam burst. Its chief executive officer stepped down. (He was charged with homicide this week by local prosecutors.) Vale’s stock price has recovered, and output is on its way back. But the community that was unmade when the structure fell will never truly be remade.People who were in the city of Brumadinho on Jan. 25, 2019, and those who have visited since then struggle to find words to describe the devastation in a way the outside world can grasp. It is, even to those who lived through the tragedy, beyond understanding.Gone is the constant whoosh of helicopters overhead that spirited out the dead on dangling stretchers. In their place is the sound of hundreds of bulldozers and trucks.While the surrounding community will never be rebuilt, Vale is on the hook for at least cleaning up the sludge that’s laced with iron ore residue and mining waste so that it doesn’t further pollute Brumadinho water supplies. It is laborious work that requires draining the water from the mud, packing the dirt down into bricks, piling them up in the countryside and covering them up with replanted vegetation.Local firefighters still scour the mud at Brumadinho. Each day, the hunt for the missing goes on. And each day, more often than not, body parts are all they can find.In the days after the collapse, the mud was so wet in some areas that body-sniffing rescue dogs couldn’t catch scents. A team of 150 rescuers crawled through the wreckage and searched the sludge with their hands. So far, 259 bodies have been identified through DNA sampling; around Christmas 2019, two more bodies were found. Eleven people are still missing, and the 90 firefighters that remain say they won't give up until they find them. They use excavators now to dig, watching closely as the dirt falls to the ground for any signs of the dead.“We haven't stopped for a single day, not even on Christmas, and we don't plan to,” Lieutenant Douglas Constantino says. “Those families need closure.” Zeca Goncalves was finishing lunch when he heard what sounded like an explosion. He rushed out of his hilltop home to find that a wall of mud had buried part of the city where he was born. The 68-year-old retired bricklayer looked toward a bed and breakfast at which two cousins and two nephews worked, but he could no longer see it. A neighbor’s house, some 20 meters away from his own, was also destroyed.“I just stood there and stared at it for some 15 minutes. I went completely dumbfounded,” he said. “I went home to tell my wife, but she didn't believe me. So I came back out and stared for hours more.”Just about everyone in the mining town knew someone—most likely more than one—who died that day. Goncalves’s four relatives, along with several friends, were among them. Many of the people who remained took the cash payouts Vale offered, packed up and moved away. Direct family members got at least 700,000 reais (about $170,000), while others such as Goncalves received 50,000 reais, plus small monthly payouts. Goncalves can point out four or five houses on his street in the Corrego do Feijao neighborhood that now stand empty. He said he plans to stay put and has used the money to buy a car. “This used to be the best place ever,” he recalled.People across Minas Gerais state are still furious at Vale over the disaster. Fabio Schvartsman, who was the company’s CEO at the time, was charged this week with 270 counts of homicide, while Vale and a contractor, TUV SUD, were accused of environmental crimes. State prosecutors allege that the 65-year-old executive knew about the risks but made false statements and hid information to protect the company’s share price.“They turned a blind eye,” Prosecutor General Antonio Sergio Tonet told reporters. Their negligence, another official added, caused “the dam to break with the strength of a tsunami that destroyed everything in its way.&quot;In certain pockets around Brazil, people still ask themselves: Could we be next? A key factor in the disaster was the type of structure Vale used to contain tailings from its upstream mining operations. Mud built up behind a front wall that was 700 meters wide and as tall as a 24-story building. But there was internal erosion, and the dense mud liquefied. Prosecutors say the company intentionally hid signs that the structure was failing. It has been ordered to dismantle at least nine similar dams and reintegrate them back into their environment.Residents around the riskiest of the dams were relocated to settlements. But others still live nearby, always on alert for the sirens that Vale installed to warn them if it becomes time to flee. All in all, Vale has spent $6.3 billion on provisions and expenses related to Brumadinho.  To contact the author of this story: Sabrina Valle in Rio De Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net, Philip Brian TabuasFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",A Brazilian Town Has Been Covered in Sludge for One Year

As a result, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Newmont Corp. are curbing their operations in the country.The impact of the pandemic goes far beyond Peru. In Canada, Vale SA said it’s putting its Voisey’s Bay mine under temporary care and maintenance in a move that’s seen trimming the company’s copper output. In Mongolia, Rio Tinto Group’s multi-billion project to develop an underground mine at the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold site has also been slowed.The global pandemic that has killed more than 7,400 has forced governments to limit the movement of people to contain the coronavirus, disrupting supply chains and economic activity. Companies including metal producers have curbed their operations to critical activities, while cutting non-essential travel of its office employees to protect their workers against the disease. Below are the impact on their operations:Freeport-McMoran said its Cerro Verde mine, which produced 1 billion pounds of copper last year, will be under care and maintenance for 15 days beginning March 16 after the Peruvian government declared a national emergencyNewmont said coronavirus-related government restrictions in Peru will require the company to safely cut down its mining operations at Yanacocha while gold production from leach pads and managing critical safety and environmental activities will continue.Vale said copper concentrate output from its Voisey’s Bay operations in Canada will be “reduced proportionally to the period of mine stoppage.” Production at the site reached 25,000 metric tons last year.

2020-03-18,"(Bloomberg) -- When shares of Brazil’s Vale SA suddenly crashed last year after a deadly dam collapse, Nick Price did what any fund manager might have done for a stock he already owned: He purchased more.It was a profitable trade by traditional measures: The stock gained 24% in the year after the dam failed, outperforming global emerging-market benchmarks—a win for a Fidelity International fund manager with a record of beating his peers.But the story doesn’t end there. That’s because for a growing cohort of investors, stock picking is no longer a straightforward matter of financial risk and reward. As Price was buying, a number of fund managers dedicated to promoting responsible corporate behavior and fighting climate change were dumping Vale even if that meant missing out on any stock gains.“Responsible investing and maximizing value for shareholders don’t overlap as much as we had hoped,” said Duncan Austin, a former partner at London-based Generation Investment Management, the firm co-founded by Al Gore. “Unfortunately, when they clash, most of our business metrics and incentives still nudge investors to favor profit over planet.”Not at the Church of England and Germany's Union Investment though. Within days of the January 2019 collapse of a tailings dam owned by Vale in Brumadinho, Brazil, which resulted in the deaths of 270 people, the Church of England Pensions Board unloaded its shares and Union, which manages 368 billion euros ($407 billion) of assets, sold its holding a few weeks later.The Church of England also partnered with the Council of Ethics of the Swedish National Pension Funds to form the Mining and Tailings Safety Initiative and signed up firms overseeing more than $13.5 trillion to their campaign. The group is compiling a global database on tailings dams, which are earth-filled embankments used to store mining waste, to assess their construction and stability.“We are all in process of internalizing the reality of what happened at Brumadinho,” said Adam Matthews, director of ethics for the Church of England’s pensions board and co-chair of the initiative. “There have been tailings dam collapses over many decades that resulted in loss of life, but for any company that has a Vale-style event now, it would be company-destroying event as we are also much more aware of the impact.”Even before the dam collapse, ESG investors had plenty of reasons to steer clear of Vale; as the world’s biggest producer of iron ore, it’s by definition a large carbon emitter. Justifying a trade on ESG grounds after the event should have been harder still: the environmental (E) toll was huge—the incident unleashed 12 million cubic meters of toxic sludge; the social (S) cost was massive loss of life; and the incident highlighted governance (G) failings at Vale – this was the company’s second fatal disaster since 2015.Just a few years ago, only a select group of money managers and funds used the label ESG, but today assets managed using a broad definition of the ESG approach exceed $30 trillion. With climate change and gender inequality becoming top social concerns, a growing list of firms from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to BlackRock Inc. are pledging to use their resources to combat such ills.“What worked for fund managers in the old world won’t work in a world where environmental impact is on a par with financial performance,” said Virginie Maisonneuve, Singapore-based former chief investment officer of Eastspring Investments. “ESG portfolios will become the norm over the next decade and the skills you’ll need to analyze potential investments, the kinds of data you’ll use and the way you interact with the companies you’re invested in will evolve dramatically .”Price’s decision to add to his stake raised eyebrows among Fidelity’s own team of ESG experts, who monitor the firm’s ESG practices. Not only did they consider the trade out of step with their ideas of sustainability and good corporate behavior, it also jarred with what Price and fellow emerging markets portfolio manager Grigorios Konstantinidis had told a French pension fund client just a month before: that ESG considerations were key in their investment decisions, according to people familiar with the matter.A spokesman for Fidelity International, which manages $448 billion of assets, said the asset manager “immediately and urgently” engaged with Vale following the dam collapse &quot;to understand the company’s oversight, processes and operating practices” and was satisfied that the miner’s management &quot;had been proactive and were urgently carrying out appropriate remediation measures.” “We take an active ownership approach and strongly believe that fostering change is the most effective and lasting way to positively influence corporate behavior,” the spokesman said. “In order to do this, we always focus on engagement rather than opting out and excluding. This will mean that we will often continue to hold, or even in some cases, increase our stakes in companies that are actively dealing with significant ESG issues and push for change.”Price started at Fidelity in 1998 and now manages more than $9 billion across four funds. Data for the flagship $4.8 billion emerging markets fund show it held a $70 million position in Vale in April 2019, three months after the dam collapse, having not owned the stock in its year-earlier filing. The company spokesman said the fund first built a position in Vale in September 2018 before increasing its holding in the first half of 2019 and ultimately selling in September 2019. The divestment &quot;was not due to ESG factors&quot; and Fidelity continues to hold the stock through its Latin American Fund co-managed by Konstantinidis, the spokesman said.Price was among Fidelity executives that held several calls with Vale officials following the deadly accident to discuss its strategy to deal with the disaster, according to one of the people familiar. “Asset managers can have a bigger net positive effect by holding a group of ESG basket cases and successfully engaging with management to change those companies’ ESG performance than by holding a portfolio only of the virtuous,” said Catherine Howarth, chief executive of responsible investment campaign group ShareAction. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Fidelity’s Brazil Trade Highlights ESG World’s New Conflicts

2020-03-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA is tapping into $5 billion in credit lines to boost its cash position as the coronavirus pandemic forces cutbacks at a time when the iron ore producer was working to recover from a dam collapse last year.Vale asked banks to disburse the lines in two tranches, with $2 billion due in June 2022 and $3 billion due in December 2024, according to a statement filed to Brazil’s securities regulator. The company said the decision was made given the risk presented to its business by the pandemic, adding that it’s “prudent” to have more cash in hand “in the next few months.”The global pandemic has prompted Vale to limit operations in Canada and Asia as governments struggle to contain the virus.

2020-04-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors have been piling into shares of the world’s largest iron-ore producer, touting it as one of the biggest opportunities to emerge from the carnage in Brazilian markets.Vale SA sank to a three-year low in March amid the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted production chains across the globe and sent growth estimates plunging. The stock has recovered about 30% in the past week, but is still trading at levels last seen in 2019 after a dam disaster that killed 270 people.“Vale is an opportunity like those that happen every 10, 15 years,” said Paolo Di Sora, chief investment officer at RPS Capital, during a videoconference hosted by Banco BTG Pactual SA.One of the reasons behind the optimism is that the miner benefits from a weaker Brazilian real as most of its revenue is in foreign currency. The real has lost more than 23% this year, one of the worst performances in the world. Di Sora said the stock’s valuation implies an exchange rate of about 3.50 reais per dollar, much stronger than the current 5.26 per dollar.Read More: Top Brazil Fund Buying Stocks Every Day, Not Guessing on BottomAdam Capital, one of the country’s biggest independent hedge funds, is also among the bulls. According to Marcio Appel, who founded the asset manager in 2016 with Andre Salgado, the stock is attractive even in adverse scenarios for iron-ore prices.“If I had to pick one Brazilian stock that’s particularly cheap it would be Vale,” Appel said during a videoconference hosted by Itau Unibanco Holding SA on Tuesday.According to Goldman Sachs, which recently upgraded Vale’s American depositary receipts to buy, current stock prices imply no volume growth and iron ore prices at $65 per ton for an extended period, which the bank deems unlikely. Iron ore is down 11% this year to about $80 per ton, a less drastic drop than the one seen in other commodities amid speculation China will ramp up stimulus.Read More: World’s Miners Slowly Grind to a Halt on Virus RestrictionsCredit Suisse’s Caio Ribeiro also sees the current discount as excessive, especially considering “strong free cash flow generation prospects,” according to a report.In its fourth-quarter earnings, Vale said cash generation allowed it to reduce net debt to about $4.9 billion, the lowest since 2008. The company also tapped into $5 billion of credit lines to bolster its cash position amid the recent turmoil.“Our main metric nowadays has been whether a certain company is able to survive stress scenarios,” Felipe Campos, a founding partner at asset manager Navi Capital, said in an interview. “Vale has solid cash, lower costs and is surely on that list.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Fund Managers See Once-In-Decade Shot in Brazil’s Iron-Ore Giant

2020-04-20,"Dry bulk has been the ""Wile E. Coyote"" of ocean shipping for the past decade – forever chasing after profits only to lunge at empty air and repeatedly fall straight off a cliff.Rates for Capesizes, the workhorse bulkers with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons, are now enjoying their seasonal upturn, but even so, they're still below breakeven.Will this be yet another lost year for dry bulk shipping, and for top U.S.-listed Capesize owners Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ: SBLK), Golden Ocean Group Limited (NASDAQ: GOGL) and Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK)? Evercore ISI analyst Jon Chappell is not optimistic on the sector's prospects. ""Dry bulk challenges will just not abate,"" he said in a client note on Monday.Dry bulk's lost decadePrior to 2009, vast fortunes were made in dry bulk, the largest cargo business in the world measured by volume and the freight segment with the most active derivatives market.According to Chappell, ""Since the end of the global financial crisis, a myriad of issues ... have derailed the promise of another sustainable cyclical upturn, resulting in year after year of losses and ‘cheap' stocks. Dry bulk shipping cannot seem to catch a break.""  Brazilian iron-ore production estimates reduced. Photo credit: ValeThe stage was set for recovery in 2019. Then a dam in Brazil holding back iron-ore mining residue collapsed, killing over 270 people. The mine closures that followed slashed Chinese imports from Brazilian iron-ore miner Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE), crippling Capesize spot rates.The stage was then set for recovery in 2020. Vale's mines were expected to come back online and Capesize owners were predicted to profit from exhaust-gas scrubbers. The scrubbers would allow owners to keep burning cheaper high-sulfur fuel and not switch to the expensive low-sulfur fuel required by the new IMO 2020 regulations.Then came the coronavirus. The ensuing global recession threatens steel demand, the driver of the seaborne iron-ore trade. The collapse in oil prices erased the spread between high- and low-sulfur marine fuel, destroying the value of scrubbers. Meanwhile, Vale still isn't back to full speed and the pandemic could create further delays in Brazil.Vale production woes persistIn a production report issued after market close on Friday, which one dry bulk participant dubbed ""terrible,"" Vale slashed its full-year iron-ore production outlook from 340 million-355 million tons to 310 million-330 million tons – a midpoint reduction of 27.5 million tons or 8%.Vale warned that COVID-19 could have a ""meaningful"" impact on its mining productivity and could delay the resumption of production at mines closed by the 2019 dam accident by ""delaying inspections, assessments and authorization processes.""On a positive note, Vale's first-quarter production came in at 59.6 million tons (9% below the forecast midpoint), meaning that production must accelerate to an average of 83.5 million tons per quarter if Vale is to hit the bottom end of its reduced full-year range.""As we anticipated by looking at trade flows, Vale greatly missed its own guidance for the first quarter and naturally cut its full-year guidance,"" said John Kartsonas, founder of Breakwave Advisors, the creator of the Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF (NYSE: BDRY).Kartsonas told FreightWaves, ""The silver lining is that if [Vale] manages to sell as much as it says for the rest of the year – and that's a big if – there will be around 25 million tons of incremental iron-ore demand versus last year and the highest iron-ore trade ever out of Brazil [during] the second half of 2020. That bodes well for Capesize rates.""Rate outlook and driversFrode Mørkedal, managing director of research at Clarksons Platou Securities, believes a ""ramp up in [iron-ore] shipments for the remainder of the year, coupled with increasing stimulus spending and seasonal improvements in activity, could support a strong freight rate recovery.""  Bulkers loading Brazilian iron ore. Photo credit: ValeBreakwave Advisors said in its latest outlook, ""We anticipate a considerable ramp up in volumes [from Brazil] for the rest of the year ... there is ample room to see a repeat of last year's rally when rates peaked at almost $40,000 per day in September.""U.K.-based consultancy Marine Strategies International (MSI) struck a more cautious note in its new outlook released on Monday. It estimated that average non-scrubber spot rates would rise to $12,400 per day by June and $13,100 per day by October.According to MSI, ""Indications of a bounce-back in steel demand in China – including increased sales of construction equipment, a drawdown of steel stockpiles and, surprisingly, a sharp uptick in steel imports – may provide a glimmer of hope. But the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases, such as the outbreak in Harbin [China], underpins our more cautious expectations.""Chappell is more bearish. Last week, he cut his full-year 2020 Capesize rate forecast to just $11,000 per day, from $15,000 per day previously. He reduced his 2021 forecast to $14,500 per day, down from $19,000 per day.Can dry bulk stocks recover?In mid-day trading on Monday, shares of Star Bulk were down 10%, Genco 8% and Golden Ocean 4%. In each case, stocks were back to levels seen in 2016.Chappell doesn't foresee the dry bulk companies he covers booking full-year profits until 2022 at the earliest. ""Cheap doesn't always mean attractive,"" he said, noting that the question for investors is: ""Why do I need to own these stocks?"" and that his answer to investors is: ""You don't.""""At a time of maximum macro uncertainty, high-beta, small-cap commodity stocks are about as far from a ‘safe haven' as there is,"" he added.Deutsche Bank transportation analyst Amit Mehrotra commented in a client note last week, ""There's nothing much to say here except it's bad. Clearly dry bulk stocks won't work until spot cash flows are accruing to equity holders – and we're a far way off from that happening.""Spot rates and fuel spreadsTo get a closer look at what's going in with Cape rates, FreightWaves has developed a series of charts covering year-to-date Cape performance based on data from S&P Global Platts.Last year, Platts began publishing the CapeT4 Index; it produces dual indices, one for Capesizes using exhaust-gas scrubbers burning traditional 3.5% sulfur heavy fuel oil (HFO) and one for non-scrubber Capes burning 0.5% sulfur fuel known as very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO).Rates assessed on a dollars-per-day time-charter equivalent (TCE) basis are calculated net of fuel, meaning that scrubber ships burning cheaper HFO post higher TCE rates. Jefferies analyst Randy Giveans told FreightWaves that 22% of Capesizes currently on the water are equipped with scrubbers.What's striking about the Platts index data is that scrubbers were designed to save ship owners money – and they have – but the year-to-date (YTD) rate trend for scrubber ships is down and the trend for non-scrubber ships is up.Non-scrubber Capesize rates were assessed on Friday at $9,809 per day by the Platts T4 Index, double the rate at the beginning of the year and quadruple the YTD low set in January. In contrast, TCE rates of scrubber ships have fallen 29% YTD, to $11,680 per on Friday, because the discount of HFO to VLSFO has collapsed (and thus, the savings and TCE benefit have reduced) at a much faster pace than base freight rates have risen.The downward rate trend for scrubber Capes has reversed in recent weeks for two reasons. First, the HFO-VLSFO spread is about as low as it can get, so there's less room for a spread decline to reduce scrubber Cape TCE rates. Second, base rates are rising off first-quarter seasonal lows, supporting both scrubber and non-scrubber Capes.Brazil vs. Australia exportsThe Platts CapeT4 is primarily driven by two roundtrip routes: Australia-China and Brazil-China.In the Australia-China market, the scrubber advantage has almost completely vanished this month, with non-scrubber Cape rates assessed at $8,199 per day on Friday and scrubber Capes at $8,712 per day. Scrubber Cape TCE rates in this geographical segment are down 54% YTD and non-scrubber rates are up 47%.In the Brazil-China market, rates are higher than out of Australia and while scrubber savings have slimmed, they haven't disappeared to quite the extent they have in Australia. Platts assessed non-scrubber Cape rates in this market at $11,360 per day on Friday and Cape rates at $14,493 per day. Scrubber rates in this segment are down 22% YTD and non-scrubber rates are up 141%.Scrubber promises unfulfilledThe closing of the HFO-VLSFO spread means it will take much longer for companies that paid huge sums for fleetwide scrubber installations to recoup their capital costs, let alone earn a profit from this strategy.Star Bulk, for example, is spending $209 million to install scrubbers on 114 ships, equating to an average of $1.8 million per scrubber. On a back-of-the-envelope basis, assuming a Capesize uses a scrubber 300 days a year, the current daily savings imply the investment won't break even for over three years.And the actual cost is even higher still when including the opportunity cost – earnings lost during the installation process, including voyages to and from the yard.Basil Karatzas, founder of Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co., told FreightWaves, ""There is a Greek shipowner who put all five of his Capes in drydock to install scrubbers last summer. Cape rates spiked and he basically made no money on that spike because he was out of position. His ships were in the yard. He thought he was doing the right thing by installing scrubbers, but now, the spread is minimal, so not only did he miss the spike, but he isn't making any money out of the scrubbers.""

2020-04-20,"Vale SA (VALE), the world’s largest producer of iron ore and nickel, has materially downgraded its production targets for FY20, due to the fallout from Covid-19.The Brazilian multinational is now looking for 310-330mt of iron ore, down from 340-355mt previously. It reduced guidance for pellets to 35-40mt from 44mt, copper to 360-380kt from 400kt and nickel to 180-195kt from 200-210kt, while removing coal guidance altogether.Vale also released its Q1 production figures Friday after-market. Production was generally in line with forecasts, although the smaller manganese and coal divisions posted a notable miss and nickel was slightly stronger.“We would expect consensus FY20 earnings downgrades following these results” RBC Capital analyst Tyler Broda told investors on April 20.“Brazilian real weakness, expectations in the market that Vale was struggling with production and potential support to iron ore price sentiment from the guidance cut are likely to help offset some of the share price impact” he wrote.Looking forward, the analyst continues to note challenges facing the iron ore markets. He calculates a sizable 6% surplus for 2020 and sees risks of prices falling significantly, especially as ‘Chinese steel prices begin to fade into weak demand’.Broda currently has a hold rating on the stock with a $9.25 price target, but believes VALE looks fundamentally inexpensive and adds “we would look to get more constructive once the iron ore market transitions through this potentially weaker period.” Shares are currently trading down 37% year-to-date.Overall, however, Vale retains its bullish Strong Buy analyst consensus on TipRanks.

2020-05-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Iconic Brazilian companies Vale SA and Eletrobras SA were removed from the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund due to environmental and human rights concerns.Norges Bank Investment Management said in a statement it’s excluded iron-ore giant Vale from Norway’s $1 trillion pension fund after repeated dam breaches in Brazil killed hundreds of people and caused environmental damage. Eletrobras was withdrawn because of the “unacceptable risk” that the country’s largest utility contributes to serious or systematic human rights violations.Norges’s move deals a blow to Vale, which has taken steps to improve its image after a dam collapse early last year killed 270 people. The Rio de Janeiro-based mining company replaced its top manager, committed to decommissioning riskier dams, and built a treatment plant to clean up polluted water.For Eletrobras, it’s also a reminder of the problems associated with the Belo Monte plant, where construction in the Amazon forest was marked by fierce opposition from environmental groups and a corruption scandal. Norges’s Council on Ethics said the project led to “increased pressure on indigenous lands, the disintegration of indigenous peoples’ social structures and the deterioration of their livelihoods,” with about 20,000 people displaced by the dam. The council also said the company has been involved in other projects that have been criticized for human rights violations.Eletrobras, controlled by the Brazilian government, said in a statement that it has taken “important strategic steps” to strengthen its commitment to human rights practices including closely monitoring subsidiaries like Belo Monte’s operator.Vale declined to comment.Norway’s wealth fund owned $375 million in Vale stock at the end of 2019, according to the latest figures available on the website of Norges Bank Investment Management. It also held $53 million in shares and $21 million in bonds of Eletrobras.Eletrobras fell 1.1% at 3:43 p.m. in Sao Paulo, extending this year’s decline to 46%. Vale rose 3%, reducing 2020’s losses to 9%.Other companies excluded from the fund include Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc., Suncor Energy Inc. and Imperial Oil Ltd. due to emissions.

2020-05-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Black Cube, the private intelligence agency run by former Israeli spies, spent months setting up companies around the world. Offices, websites and employees were painstakingly put in place -- all part of a sting targeting former executives at Brazilian mining giant Vale SA.The Black Cube operation, made public in a court filing Thursday and described by people familiar with it, represents the latest escalation in a bitter fight between Vale and mining billionaire Beny Steinmetz.What started in Guinea as a partnership in one of the world’s richest mineral deposits has devolved into a globe-spanning dispute that sheds light on how fortunes can be made and lost in the world of African mining.As surging Chinese demand for raw materials spurred a race for assets in Africa, Steinmetz acquired the rights to an iron-ore project known as Simandou in 2008. Vale bought a 51% stake about a year later. Then a new president in Guinea seized the asset back after a corruption probe -- and Vale is pursuing Steinmetz for compensation.While Steinmetz has always denied wrongdoing, he says in the filing that Vale suspected all along that his original acquisition of the assets could have been problematic. Vale has said in court documents it didn’t know.Steinmetz says the sting operation -- detailed in court filings that include a declaration from one of Black Cube’s founders and transcripts of conversations with former Vale executives -- showed the Brazilian company was suspicious before it signed the deal. That undermines Vale’s claim to compensation, he argues.A spokesman for Vale, which was awarded $2 billion in a London arbitration last year that it is still trying to collect, declined to comment.“This report just confirmed what we were saying from day one. Vale knew everything, there was no surprise for them. Now we have the full proof of that. I was happy to see that, because until now we were fighting and no one believed us,” Steinmetz said in an interview with Bloomberg News this week. For almost a decade, Steinmetz has faced legal challenges and probes over how he obtained the rights to the deposit in Guinea. The Guinean government withdrew charges of corruption against him after a seven-year dispute. He denies any wrongdoing.Last year the London Court of International Arbitration found that Steinmetz’s BSG Resources Ltd. made fraudulent representations to Vale when it sold the mine stake. Steinmetz’s appeal was thrown out.The court ordered BSGR to pay the Brazilian company $2 billion for its losses in the joint venture. To collect the cash it is owed under that order, Vale has sought to freeze Steinmetz’s assets and is asking a U.S. judge to help it secure evidence about investments he and others allegedly made in New York real estate.‘Nose Closed’In a conversation with Black Cube’s undercover operatives -- according to a transcript filed with the court documents -- former Vale executive Jose Carlos Martins said he’d had suspicions about the deal. While he recommended Vale go ahead with the purchase, “I’m proposing it with my nose closed because I smell something wrong,” he said, according to the transcript.Martins, who spent almost a decade running the company’s iron ore business, didn’t respond to requests for comment.In the transcript, Martins compared the deal to a beautiful woman with a sexually-transmitted disease.“You bring her to your hotel room, she’s naked, marvelous, and then she says: ‘A little problem, maybe I am with AIDS’, okay? It’s a problem.”Black Cube, which says on its website it hires veterans of the Israeli intelligence community, had a team of more than 20 agents working on the investigation, according to people familiar with the situation. It specializes in targeting human sources for information, often in cases where little or no documentary evidence can be found.The company mapped out all those it believed could have information on the case and built psychological models of its targets, before deciding on the best cover stories and approaches, the people said. The operative who spoke to Martins presented himself as a partner in an investment consultancy, and all recordings were legal, Black Cube says in the court papers.‘Don’t Tell Me’Martins told the Vale board about entering the deal “closing our eyes,” he said to the operative, according to the transcript. “One of the board members said, ‘Don’t tell me, I don’t want to know at all.’”At the beginning of the last decade, Simandou was seen as one of the most strategically important assets in the mining world. Its development was a threat to the three dominant iron ore miners, Vale, BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group, at a time of insatiable Chinese demand for the steelmaking ingredient. It was in that context that Vale wanted the asset.“Everybody knows that there was something wrong,” Martins told the undercover agent, according to the filing. “Myself, the CEO. But it was so important not to let this buying to get the competition hands.”Black Cube also targeted another former Vale executive, Alex Monteiro. According to the transcript, he told operatives: “All the diligence we did was fine, but still, there was that smell of something that could have been done wrongly.” When approached for comment by Bloomberg on Thursday, Monteiro said the due diligence didn’t produce any concerns.“Based on an in-depth due diligence we did, there was no bad smell,” he said by email.Dying PresidentSteinmetz, 64, has a long history in difficult environments across the globe after having been originally sent out by his family to secure supplies of rough diamonds. He developed a diamond mine in Sierra Leone before setting his sights on Simandou in neighboring Guinea.Ailing President Lansana Conte stripped Rio Tinto of its rights to half of the asset, which the Anglo-Australian miner hadn’t developed in a decade of control. The rights lost by Rio were transferred to Steinmetz weeks before the president died in 2008. Then BSGR sold half the asset to Vale.After Alpha Conde was elected in 2010, he announced a review and clean-up of the mining industry, Guinea’s main source of income. Billionaire George Soros and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair advised on and funded Conde’s initiative. A dossier of alleged corruption became the basis for BSGR’s loss of rights. BSGR denied it paid any bribes.In 2014, a Frenchman with ties to Steinmetz and BSG Resources was sentenced to two years in prison for interfering with a U.S. probe of bribery in connection with mining rights in Simandou. Steinmetz is also facing corruption charges in Switzerland over the mining asset, which he denies.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Mining Billionaire Gets Help From Ex-Spies in Bitter Legal Fight

2020-05-26,"Australia’s New Century Resources Ltd. is in talks with Brazilian miner Vale SA (VALE) for the acquisition of its nickel and cobalt mine operations on the Pacific island of New Caledonia.The zinc miner has entered into a 60-day exclusivity period with Vale Canada Limited, a subsidiary of Vale S.A., to complete due diligence and negotiate the acquisition of 95% of the issued shares in Vale Nouvelle Calédonie S.A.S. (VNC), which owns and operates the Goro nickel & cobalt mine in New Caledonia. The mine also has a processing plant and a port facility.Financial terms of the talks weren’t disclosed. However, Vale informed investors that with the announcement, the investment held at VNC will be recorded at the fair value and classified as an ""asset held for sale"" in its consolidated financial statements, leading to an additional impairment loss of about $400 million to be recognized in the second quarter income statement.If the talks progress to a deal, the purchase would turn New Century Resources into a major supplier of nickel and non-DRC sourced cobalt for the electric vehicle industry, the zinc miner said.Furthermore, IGO Limited, a major shareholder in New Century, is supportive of the acquisition opportunity, New Century said in the statement.Shares in Vale have seen a nice advance in the past two months gaining 36%. However, the stock is still down some 33% year-to-date.BMO Capital analyst Edward Sterck last month raised Vale’s stock rating to Buy from Hold, while lowering the price target to $9.50 from $12, citing the miner’s low-cost iron ore exposure offering a ""relative safe-haven"" for investors during the COVID-19 market volatility.The analyst added that he sees the company’s Brazilian production more at risk of slowdowns than absolute shutdowns.Turning now to the rest of Wall Street analysts, a bullish outlook prevails. Vale scores 9 Buy ratings adding up to a Strong Buy consensus. The $11.50 average price target indicates 28% upside potential in the shares in the next 12 months.

2020-06-02,"(Bloomberg) -- The decision to keep Chinese factories shut after the Lunar New Year sent shudders through the massive mines of Brazil and Chile that feed them. Now, with China getting back to work and Latin America the new virus hot spot, concern is shifting from demand to supply.Iron-ore shipper Vale SA had a scare last week as it had to fend off an attempt by Brazilian prosecutors to close a complex that accounts for a tenth of its output. A union at copper behemoth Codelco said members are concerned that a still small outbreak of the virus will spread.Alarm bells are starting to ring again in metal markets as the outbreak explodes in Latin America, with the region’s highly urbanized population of 600 million accounting for about 40% of daily deaths globally. That’s coming at a time when Chinese demand is recovering and markets tighten. Chile is the top exporter of copper and Brazil is the second-largest shipper of iron ore.“Mine supply problems from Covid-19 in Latin America are far from over yet,” Wenyu Yao, senior commodities strategist at ING Bank, said by phone from London. “Chile is a big unknown now.”So far, mining heavyweights like Vale and Codelco have managed to continue operating through the outbreak, adopting safety measures without stalling output. Other mines in the region that did shut are now reopening. But the industry has been helped by relatively low rates of illness in the wider populations. That’s no longer the case.On Friday, spot iron ore surged past $100 a ton as worries that the pandemic may curb Brazilian supply coincide with sustained, robust demand in top steel producer China. Futures now look set to hit that level, too, with the contract in Singapore advancing for the past four days.Brazil surpassed the U.S. in new coronavirus cases last week, and the disease is now spreading in northern states such as Para, which accounts for 8% of global iron ore supply. In April, Vale cut its shipment guidance due to bad weather and the virus’s impact on operations.The disease has also reached Brazil’s meat-processing industry, with JBS SA ordered to shut operations at a plant in Rondonia state last week in the country’s first beef-facility closure. Brazilian oil has also been hit, with nearly 500 confirmed cases and one death among offshore workers, although production hasn’t been impacted.Compounding Brazil’s health disaster is a potential political crisis. Protesters clashed on the streets of Sao Paulo Sunday and President Jair Bolsonaro joined a demonstration against Congress and the Supreme Court.“The Covid-19 outbreak in Brazil creates tangible risks to iron ore supply over the upcoming weeks, despite mining being allowed to operate as essential business,” Citigroup Inc. analysts including Tracy Liao wrote in a report. “Rising infections among workers may prompt the miners or local authorities to impose more draconian quarantines, which could limit productivity or even close mines.”Meanwhile, port stockpiles of iron ore in China have continued to decline and Chinese steel demand has improved notably over the past two months, reflected by inventory drawdowns. Even though prices may stay elevated for longer, Citigroup maintains its bearish view, forecasting prices to fall to $70 a ton by the end of 2020, with Vale expected to manage the outbreak well.In a response to questions, Vale reiterated annual production guidance of 310 million to 330 million tons, which factors in pandemic risks such as higher absenteeism and the possibility of tighter restrictions in Brazil. The company has also offered financial support to its supply chain and imported health equipment for regions where it operates. Like Codelco, Vale has implemented social-distancing measures, workplace disinfection, screening and testing.It’s a similar story in copper as supportive demand-side data fuels a rebound. On Monday, copper futures reached the highest level since mid-March after manufacturing data from China pointed to a continuing recovery.Chile’s Codelco has managed to keep operating at close to normal rates, helping prevent markets from tightening further. But maintaining output may become more difficult as Covid-19 cases in the country surge. With a population of just 18 million, Chile is reporting new cases on a per-capita basis at a pace comparable to that of Spain at the peak of the spread in March, pushing hospitals toward collapse and prompting authorities to tighten restrictions.Workers at Codelco’s Chuquicamata mine are concerned that the number of infections, while still small, will grow, Miguel Veliz, director of Union No. 3, said by telephone.Fifteen staff members and 34 contract workers have tested positive at the mine, said Liliana Ugarte, who heads Union No. 2. Another 140 people are quarantined, she said.Mine workers began getting sick April 20, with detections accelerating in recent weeks, Veliz said. To be sure, the number of cases is a small fraction of the workforce -- Chuquicamata has 4,000 staffers and 7,000 outsourced workers.In a written response, Codelco said it implemented preventive controls at Chuquicamata that allow it to quickly detect and isolate sick workers and their contacts. Most infections happened outside the mine in rest periods, it said. Chuquicamata is just north of Calama in the Antofagasta region, which has seen a sharp rise in cases in recent weeks.Still, mines typically operate with greater social distancing than, say, meat packers. who have been much harder hit by the virus. Assuming South American mines navigate the pandemic, the copper rally may run out of steam with China’s reopening well-flagged and relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorating.“Risk exists -- like the pandemic emerging in the mining districts,” said BTG Pactual analyst Cesar Perez. “There could be a possibility where the government becomes restrictive, but given how strategic companies have been, the risk of meaningful disruptions to production is still distant for now.”(Updates mine worker infections in 16th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Latin America Virus Surge Puts World’s Biggest Mines at Risk
2020-06-03,"Weakness in iron ore prices is not a major concern for Vale SA (NYSE: VALE), while rising oil prices could act as the main catalyst for the stock, according to UBS.The Vale AnalystAndreas Bokkenheuser upgraded Vale from Neutral to Buy, while reducing the price target from $13 to $12.The Vale ThesisDespite the decline in iron ore prices to $60 per ton, missing expectations of $65-$87 per ton by a wide margin, Vale will not be significantly impacted, Bokkenheuser said in the note.He explained that the company's correlation with iron ore had declined to around 50% in recent years, while its correlation with crude oil had risen to more than 90%.The analyst noted three main reasons for the upgrade:  1. The energy team at UBS believes oil prices could rise to as much as $48 per barrel in 2021. Rising oil price may &quot;lift the overall iron ore cost curve in support of prices and, in turn, Vale's shares,&quot; the analyst wrote.  2. Following the Brumadinho spill, Vale lost almost 100 million tons of iron ore production. This could result in significant cost dilution as the company ramps, partially offsetting lower iron ore prices.  3. Ramping production is likely to drive freight cost inflation, putting Vale at an advantage versus its peers with higher spot freight proportions.VALE Price ActionShares of Vale had risen almost 2.5% to $10.50 at the time of publication Wednesday.Related Links:10 Basic Materials Stocks Moving In Friday's Pre-Market SessionBenzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For May 11, 2020Latest Ratings for VALE  DateFirmActionFromTo  May 2020RBC CapitalUpgradesSector PerformOutperform  May 2020JP MorganMaintainsOverweight  Apr 2020RBC CapitalMaintainsSector Perform    View More Analyst Ratings for VALE   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Gilead Analyst: Coronavirus Drug, Arcus Collaboration Make Biopharma A Buy  * Growth Is A Challenge For CBOE, JPMorgan Says In Downgrade  * Slack Has Big Tailwind Amid Work-From-Home Shift, Cowen Says(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore futures surged above $100 a ton after Brazil’s Vale SA was ordered to suspend operations that account for about a 10th of its output after workers contracted Covid-19, boosting concerns surging cases will disrupt other mines in the top shipper after Australia.The ruction is the latest supply shock to hit the global market over the past 18 months, following a dam burst at a Vale mine in 2019 that roiled prices as well as weather-related disruptions this year. Iron ore could hold above $100 for the next two months, Morgan Stanley said, although it cautioned that a surplus and lower prices were still expected in the final quarter. Higher prices will benefit Australian majors BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.“This is the birth of yet another supply issue in Brazil” and prices will remain elevated in the short term, according to CITIC Futures Co. analyst Zeng Ning. At the same time, demand in China is strong, with good steel-mill profitability, rising utilization rates and low port stockpiles, he said.Vale’s shutdown comes as Covid-19 explodes in Latin America, with the region’s highly urbanized population of 600 million becoming the new global center in a continent that’s a major shipper of copper and agricultural products, as well as iron. Brazil’s case count is now second only to the U.S.A Brazilian labor court issued an order to halt mining at the Itabira complex after 188 workers tested positive, restoring a ban sought by prosecutors that Vale fended off last month. The halt is in place until a final ruling or until Vale satisfies inspectors on control measures. Vale said there’s no need for now for cutting export guidance after making a reduction in April.Futures surged as much as 6.2% to $103.53 a ton, and traded at $102.49 at 2:57 p.m. in Singapore, set for the highest close since August. Spot prices topped the $100-a-ton level in late May and have largely held above that since then.Before the Itabira order, the global market had been expected to shift to a surplus in the second half, echoing last year’s pattern that saw prices surge in the first half on a supply crunch before dropping as output picked up. Morgan Stanley said there’ll still be a glut at the end of this year.While the outlook in Brazil is uncertain, Australian shipments are booming. Exports from Port Hedland -- the country’s main iron ore port -- swelled to a record for the month of May and were the second-highest ever, according to data Monday.In April, Vale cut annual guidance to between 310 million tons and 330 million tons, with that revised projection considering as much as 15 million tons of losses from eventual Covid-19 impacts. Considering the expected monthly production of 2.7 million tons from Itabira, “there is no need, at this moment, to revise the guidance,” it said.The company said the Itabira shutdowns may cause shortages of pellets for blast furnaces used in the domestic market given the mines supply the Tubarao pelletizing complex.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Iron Ore Blasts Past $100 After Pandemic Forces Brazil Mine Halt
2020-06-08,"A Brazilian judge has ordered Vale SA (VALE) to shutter several mines due to concerns over Covid-19, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage across the country.Vale has been instructed to suspend its activities in its Itabira iron ore mining complex until it can obtain a judgement to ensure safety for its workers. It will be fined a nominal BRL 500k ($100k) per day until this is resolved.Itabira consists of the Caue and Conceicao mines and three beneficiation plants and is part of Vale’s Southeastern System. It produced 36mt of iron ore in 2019 (11% of Vake total 302mt) and has been relatively unaffected by the impacts from the Brumadinho tailings disaster.It remains uncertain at this point how long this operation will remain shut, but Vale has left its iron ore production guidance unchanged. That’s because its 2020 310-325mt guidance already includes 15mt of potential Covid-19 disruptions, points out RBC Capital analyst Tyler Broda.He is forecasting Itabira will produce 31.8mt of iron ore in 2020. “In isolation, this disruption does not change our outlook for a global iron ore surplus (we calculate ~80mt in 2021), especially considering this disruption is likely short-term in nature and already more than captured in VALE guidance” Broda reassures investors.However, the analyst says this latest issue does reinforce structural supply side concerns about Brazilian production. Further disruptions could cause more challenges, especially with an anticipated acceleration in H2 of assets returning post-Brumadinho, the analyst says, writing: “We see risks of consensus production downgrades over the coming weeks.”In terms of pricing, Broda expect iron ore prices to react positively in the short-term to this development, especially with the wider macro reflation trade ongoing. Moreover, he calculates that the economic impact to VALE is a net positive as price impact outweighs volume impact.“With VALE’s inexpensive valuation, the likely return of a dividend and buybacks, and with coming divestments acting as catalysts for the shares, we continue to see the shares positively” the analyst concludes. He recently upgraded the stock to buy with a $10.25 price target.Indeed, Vale shows a firmly bullish Strong Buy analyst consensus thanks to several recent analyst upgrades. The stock now has only buy ratings, alongside an average analyst price target of $11.82 (7% upside potential). Shares are currently trading down 16% year-to-date.

2020-06-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, the top commercial nickel producer, will resume operations next month at its Voisey’s Bay mine in Canada after halting work to monitor the coronavirus outbreak.Production at the nickel-cobalt-copper mine in Labrador is expected to restart early July and reach full capacity by early August, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a statement Thursday.Voisey’s Bay was placed on care and maintenance in mid-March as mining companies around the world paused while governments implemented measures to stem the spread of the disease. Its resumption comes as economies begin to reopen and prices of steel-making inputs recover.The restart of Voisey’s Bay may be more significant for the copper market than nickel. Vale continued processing nickel inventories during the mining shutdown but didn’t have enough stockpiles to keep supplying copper, BMO analyst Edward Sterck said in a report.Vale is partnering with a private testing lab in Newfoundland & Labrador to provide testing of all employees entering the site. There have been no cases of Covid-19 to date at the site, Vale said.“Vale remains firm in its commitment to the safety of its people and the communities in which it operates and will continue to consult and cooperate with local health authorities to establish world-class initiatives in the fight against Covid-19,” the company said.The resumption includes restarting critical path activities related to an expansion project.The announcement comes a day after Vale said it got approval to resume operations at three iron-ore mines in southern Brazil after authorities approved its revised Covid-19 protocols.(Adds comment on copper and nickel markets in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Vale to Restart Nickel Mine in Canada After Covid-19 Pause

2020-07-30,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the world’s biggest mining companies is now comfortable enough operating in the pandemic to reinstate dividends.Vale SA’s board decided to resume its dividend policy, allowing stockholders to start sharing in a windfall from recovering iron ore, nickel and copper prices, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a statement Wednesday.Once the most generous payer of dividends among major mining companies, Vale stopped payments early last year after the Brumadinho tailings dam collapse that left 270 people dead. Now the company is preparing to bring back mines halted after the disaster as it benefits from a surge in prices driven by strong Chinese demand.“Following the reduction of uncertainties related to the pandemic, with risks of a second wave in China mitigated and the stabilization and decline in COVID-19 cases, especially in the northern states of Brazil, Vale assesses that the worst is likely behind us,” it said.The policy requires minimum dividends calculated from first- half results to be paid in September. The board also approved the payment on Aug. 7 of interest on equity of about 1.41 real (27 cents) a share, Vale said in a statement that preceded its quarterly earnings release.While second-quarter earnings before items came in below expectations, the result was above year-ago levels. Iron ore is trading near the highest in a year on robust steelmaking demand from China, offsetting higher operating costs.Vale said in its earnings statement that the global steel market’s “bottom seems to have been reached” in the second quarter, with demand set to slowly recover.For Vale, the pandemic is a double-edged sword. A surge in Covid-19 cases in Brazil makes mining more difficult. But its operations are seen as the swing factor for the market’s supply-and-demand balance, meaning its own production struggles can help keep prices high, pushing up earnings.After producing slightly less iron ore than expected last quarter, Vale is looking to accelerate to at least meet the lower end of its annual production target. Its shares have surged about 40% in the past three months, outpacing its main iron-ore rivals Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group.“Vale’s compelling exposure to high margin iron ore and strong free cash generation with large capital return potential creates a compelling catalyst to rerate the shares,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda wrote.Get MoreAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $3.37 billion in the second quarter. That compares with the $3.7 billion average estimate and $3.1 billion a year ago.Click here for the full earnings reportVale will hold earnings calls Thursday at 9am and 11amFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Iron Giant Vale Restarts Dividends With ‘Worst Likely Behind Us’

2020-07-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Producers don’t typically talk down the price of their commodities. But that’s what Vale SA is doing with iron ore.The Brazilian company, which lost the title of world’s biggest iron-ore supplier in the wake of a tailings dam disaster last year, doesn’t see support for high prices in the short to medium term as it ramps up output in the pandemic, executives said on an call Wednesday.While demand from Chinese steel mills continues to be strong, consumption elsewhere is still weak and producers have shown they can keep mines running in the pandemic. The stabilization of Covid-19 cases in northern Brazil was part of Vale’s decision to resume dividend payments.The prospect of virus-related disruptions in Brazil helped iron ore futures surpass $100 a ton for the first time since August, with Vale’s operations seen as the swing factor for the market’s supply-and-demand balance.Now Vale says it can build on a second-quarter production recovery to reach its annual target range. With its S11D high-grade complex in northern Brazil hitting its straps and the return of mines halted after the dam disaster, Vale looks like reclaiming top spot from Rio Tinto Group.All that would mean less supply risk and price support.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Iron’s Swing Factor Says There’s No More Support for Pricey Ore

CFRA strategist Sam Stovall sees conditions as overbought, and believes that investors are in for a shock between now and the end of September – in the form of a 5% to 10% sell-off.Stovall cites a number of factors to support his contention that we’re on the verge of a market cliff, including “tech and large-cap dominance, the concerns surrounding soaring gold prices, the falling dollar, [and] historically low interest rates…” Stovall looks back at his 35 years’ experience on Wall Street, and notes that he typically sees the S&P average drop 1% in August. 2020 is hardly a typical year, however, and Stovall believes the downward pressures will be correspondingly greater.The upshot is, while increased volatility is almost certainly going to stay with us for a while, it’s time to consider defensive stocks. And that will bring us to dividends. By providing a steady income stream, no matter what the market conditions, a reliable dividend stock provides a pad for your investment portfolio when the share stop appreciating.With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up three dividend stocks yielding 5% or more, with a Strong Buy consensus rating and over 20% upside potential. Vale SA (VALE)The first stock on our list is a major Brazilian mining company. Vale has an international presence, is the world’s largest iron ore and nickel producer, and fourth-largest producer of manganese. The company also produces coal and copper and operates major logistic networks in Brazil, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mozambique.After a deep hit in Q1, Vale saw Q2 profits surge. Earnings more than tripled, from 7 cents per share in the first quarter to 22 cents in the second – although the EPS did come in below the forecast. Net profit for the quarter was $955 million, a strong result that allowed the company to resume its dividend payment. Rising prices for iron ore, and a favorable currency exchange regime, underlay Vale’s successes in Q2.The resumed dividend was announced at 59 cents per common share, giving the stock a dividend yield just over 5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% average found on S&P listed companies, and should be a clear attractions for VALE shares.RBC analyst Tyler Broda notes the company’s potential as a dividend cash cow in the current metals markets, writing, “VALE's restarted dividend now allows for sizable cash returns even if iron ore prices tumble back to earth. Should they stay higher, the cash return/buyback potential of VALE is unrivaled…” The analyst added, &quot;We have increased our target EV/EBITDA multiple to 5.5x from 5.0x as we expect VALE's shares will rerate as the cash returns and buybacks start to generate industry leading returns.&quot;Broda’s confidence is shown in his Buy rating and $16 price target, implying a 43% one-year upside to the stock. (To watch Broda’s track record, click here)The Wall Street consensus rating on VALE is a Strong Buy, and it’s unanimous – the stock has received 9 Buy ratings in recent weeks. The shares are selling for $11.21, and the $14.24 average price target suggests it has room for 27% growth in the coming year. (See Vale stock analysis on TipRanks)Chevron Corporation (CVX)Next on our list is Chevron, the oil giant. Chevron, with a market cap of $163 billion, has sufficient resources to survive the current low-price oil markets and general economic crisis. The company saw earnings turn negative in Q2, falling from $1.29 per share in Q1 to the current $1.59 per share loss. Even with that dismal result, Chevron was able, in July, to enter into a $5 billion all-stock deal to acquire Noble Energy.In addition to a major acquisition, Chevron has maintained its dividend during the crisis. The company pays out $1.29 per share of common stock, a level that has been stable for three quarters. The company has history of raising the dividend payment after every fourth quarter. The current payment was declared on July 29, for payment on September 10. The yield, at 5.9%, is excellent by any standard.4-star analyst Phil Gresh, of JPMorgan, likes what he sees in CVX, and rates the stock a Buy. His $109 price target implies the stock has room for a 27% upside this year. (To watch Gresh’s track record, click here)In his comments, Gresh supported his stance: “[The] company has an attractive global asset base with best-in-class cash margins and an enviable position in the Permian, in our view. Following the multi-year improvement in FCF … CVX remains in a good position to maintain a low dividend coverage breakeven ($45-50/bbl Brent) and a strong balance sheet…”Overall, Chevron stock is selling for $86.03, and the average price target of $106.54 suggests it has a 24% upside in the coming 12 months. The stock holds a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 11 Buys and 3 Holds. (See Chevron stock analysis on TipRanks)Synovus Financial Corporation (SNV)Last on our list today is Synovus, a financial services company offering investment, commercial, and retail banking services, and holding $54 billion in assets. The company has a strong presence in the Southeast, a major growth region in the US, with 294 bank branches and 335 ATM machines in Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.Synovus has felt the impact of the corona crisis, with earnings falling 77% in Q1, but it has also felt the gains as the economy has begun to reopen. Q2 EPS turned upwards, gaining 9.5% sequentially. The share price, however, remains low; SNV is still down 42% from pre-market crash levels.Through all of this, Synovus has kept up its dividend. The payment was raised in Q1, on schedule, and the Q2 payment went out in June. The common stock dividend, at 33 cents, annualizes to $1.32 and gives a robust yield of 6.5%.Brad Milsaps, writing from Piper Sandler, likes what he sees in Synovus, noting: “[We] still view it as a name with room to move higher considering it trades at just 77% of tangible book value. The dividend seems safe for now, while we continue to project that the company will earn the dividend through 2021.&quot; Milsaps added, “For now and given the uncertain economic environment, we would rather be conservative and model on the lower end of expected outcomes… However, we think the stock is simply too cheap relative to the risk that could arise from its loan portfolio related to the virus…”Milsaps backs his stance with a Buy rating. He gives the stock a $41 price target, suggesting a strong 103% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Milsaps’ track record, click here)Synovus has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, with 5 recent reviews breaking down to 4 Buys and 1 Hold. Shares are priced at $20, and the average price target, at $25.75 implies an upside potential of 29%.

The real crumbled 1.7% against a strengthening dollar after the Trump administration unveiled bans on U.S. transactions with China's ByteDance, owner of video-sharing app TikTok, and Tencent, operator of messenger app WeChat, which go into effect in 45 days.

2020-08-16,"​​With iron ore markets tight and margins at astronomical levels, Vale SA (VALE) has announced that its board of directors have approved the implementation of the Serra Sul 120 Project, in Canaã dos Carajás, Brazil.The Serra Sul 120 Project consists of increasing the S11D mine-plant capacity by 20 Mtpy, which will total 120 Mtpy at site, and has total multiyear investments of $1.5 billion. Its start-up is expected in the first half of 2024.The project includes: (i) the opening of new mining areas; (ii) the duplication of the long-distance belt conveyor; (iii) the implementation of new processing lines at the plant; (iv) the expansion of storage areas.According to Vale, the Serra Sul 120 Project will create an important buffer of productive capacity to face eventual production or licensing restrictions in the Northern System.Investments in the mine-plant together with the logistics solution under development aim to increase the Northern System’s total capacity in 20 Mtpy, to 260 Mtpy.With the Serra Sul 120 Project and the delay in the execution of projects in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vale says that it will update in due course its $5 billion investment guidance for 2021.“Perhaps more important than the incremental 20mtpa capacity are the operational flexibility and redundancy that will be built into the existing S11-D system” commented RBC Capital’s Tyler Broda following the news.He has a buy rating on Vale and $16 price target, adding “although not separately disclosed, we believe S11-D is at the bottom end of Vale’s iron ore cost curve and the incremental tonnes, which will likely serve to replace Southern or Southeastern system capacity, and should marginally reduce medium-term cash costs.”He believes the project will see VALE upgrade its already sector-leading iron ore portfolio, and says the stock looks attractive even on base-case forecasts, which imply a $65/t iron ore price from 2022. (See Vale SA stock analysis on TipRanks)Indeed the stock shows a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus, with nine back-to-back recent buy ratings. The average analyst price target indicates the stock can surge 26% from current levels.

2020-09-08,"(Bloomberg) -- In the clearest sign yet of the challenges to nickel mining in New Caledonia, a would-be buyer failed to put together a deal that would have seen it paid to acquire a major asset.New Century Resources Ltd. said Tuesday it was unable to generate a suitable funding package and equity structure to acquire the Goro operation from Vale SA.Vale’s response was equally telling. The Rio de Janeiro-based miner said it would prepare to mothball Goro while exploring other options, all of which would “contemplate Vale’s exit.” The decision comes even with nickel’s prospects bolstered by growing demand for use in rechargeable batteries as part of an electric-vehicle boom.The failure to offload the operations comes after a string of financial and operational setbacks at a mine that was brought online late and over-budget in 2010. Goro struggled to hit production capacity in subsequent years.“Despite significant resources, the operation has continued to disappoint and has never achieved design production rates, remaining a cash drain on the larger group,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Sterck wrote.Vale picked up Goro as part of its 2007 acquisition of Inco, a deal that led to it becoming the world’s largest producer of mined nickel. But in a decade of production, Goro never reached more than 70% capacity and capital expenditure overruns exceeded $3 billion, showing the difficulties producing nickel from laterite deposits using the high pressure acid leach process, according to BloombergNEF.In the wake of two deadly waste-dam spills at Vale’s operations in Brazil, the miner has also faced criticism over the use of similar tailing dams facilities at Goro. Acid spills have also interrupted processing operations.In May, New Century said it was negotiating an arrangement under which it would be paid to take over the operations. Now that an exclusivity period with the Australian company has lapsed, Vale will start to place Goro on care and maintenance. That could be a precursor to a halt in production, unless a solution can be found in the coming months.The miner continues to discuss the asset’s future with the French state and local authorities, and will approach the closure of the mine with strong commitments to the maintenance of the dam and its social obligations, Vale said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Vale’s Divestment Collapse Underscores Nickel-Mining Challenges

2020-09-28,"On Monday, shares of Vale (NYSE: VALE) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $10.72.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-06  * Strike Price: $11.00  * Volume: 17  * Open Interest: 8Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Bausch Health Cos  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: WPX Energy(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA produced more iron ore than expected last quarter amid a record haul at its newer mines in northern Brazil, in the latest sign of rising supplies that have stalled a rally in prices.The Rio de Janeiro-based company reported third-quarter production of 88.7 million metric tons, its best result in almost two years and ahead of the 85.7 million-ton average estimate among six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Futures of the steelmaking ingredient have slipped almost 8% since hitting a six-year high in mid-September as shipments out of top-producing nations Brazil and Australia increase ahead of a seasonal slowdown in Chinese demand.Vale is navigating legal and pandemic obstacles in its recovery from the Brumadinho dam collapse that cost 270 lives and its title of world’s top producer. Accelerating second-half output has it on track to hit an annual target of 310 million tons, Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani Pires said earlier this month.“Vale showing they can operate at these rates of production for a sustained quarter is likely to be negative for consensus iron ore forecasts,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda wrote. “This said, we continue to see potential for deficit iron ore markets in 2021 should Chinese steel growth stay even modestly positive off of 2020.”Even after the recent pullback, iron ore prices are 27% above where they started the year amid strong Chinese demand. Vale was raised to an investment-grade credit rating by Moody’s early this month and has reinstated dividends after cases of Covid-19 among staff stabilized. Its Sao Paulo shares are up about 16% this year.To be sure, not all of Vale’s output is hitting the market immediately, with the company expected to replenish inventories along the supply chain, including in Asian distribution centers, said Bradesco analyst Thiago Lofiego. Sales volume was just 65.8 million tons in the third quarter.Vale’s nickel production slumped 21% from April-June, mainly because of maintenance work that was rescheduled from previous quarters. Copper output was up slightly quarter on quarter but down 11% from a year earlier. Coal also improved from the second quarter but was down 40% in the year-ago comparison.Vale is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the close of regular trading on Oct. 28, with calls the following morning.(Adds comment from analyst in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Vale Is Ramping Up Faster Than Thought in New Blow to Iron Bulls

2021-02-01,"(Bloomberg) -- With iron ore at a crossroads, investors turn to Brazilian producer Vale SA for the final piece of the supply puzzle.Last month, BHP Group boosted its forecast for annual production, while Rio Tinto Group is also seeking to lift shipments of the steel-making ingredient this year. Vale -- the other member of the trio of suppliers that dominate the seaborne market -- will deliver its production report on Wednesday, including updating annual guidance.Stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter output or an increase in 2021 projections at Vale could pour more cold water on iron ore prices that have recoiled on China’s push to rein in steelmaking amid slumping margins and rising port stockpiles.Futures, which surged to as high as $175 a metric ton in December, have slipped back to about $150 and could end the year at $100, according to Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.Click here for more on iron’s nasty weekStill, there’s also a stronger-for-longer case, with Morgan Stanley this week outlining the “plausible scenario” of $165-plus over the next three years. A disappointing report from the world’s second-largest supplier would support such a storyline. While Chinese demand may slow, it remains robust.The Rio de Janeiro-based company will report quarterly output of 86.6 million tons, according to the average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be a slight decline from the third quarter but well ahead of the same period a year earlier.Assuming there were no big surprises in the final three months of the year, attention will focus on guidance. In its previous report, Vale lowered its 2020 iron ore projection to between 300 million and 305 million tons and forecast 315 million to 335 million tons this year. At the time, executives described the 2021 goal as part of a conservative approach, leaving the door open to adjustments. Since then, operations resumed at its Samarco venture with BHP.Vale is still looking to return to a capacity of 400 million tons, which would see it regain the title of world’s biggest producer that it lost to Rio Tinto in the wake of the Brumadinho dam collapse that killed 270 people.But the production recovery is taking a little longer than thought as Vale navigates legal and pandemic obstacles. That helped fuel last year’s price rally that pushed up earnings. The company was raised to an investment-grade credit rating by Moody’s and has reinstated dividend payments.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Shaky Iron Market Turns to Vale for Final Piece of Supply Puzzle

Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-04-16 Strike Price: $19.00 Volume: 20 Open Interest: 10773 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

In a statement, Minas Gerais officials, alongside state and federal prosecutors, said a meeting had been set for Thursday, during which Vale and the state would discuss the terms of the potential accord whose value was not disclosed.  The deal would require investments by Vale in the area affected by the 2019 Brumadinho disaster, when a tailings dam burst, killing 270 people and burying a river valley in meters of sludge.","Brazil's Vale, Minas Gerais state move closer to settlement for 2019 disaster"
2021-02-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA reached a settlement agreement with Brazilian authorities for a dam collapse that killed 270 people and led to production cutbacks that stripped the company of the title of world’s biggest iron ore producer.The deal comes two years after the Brumadinho disaster, giving affected communities a clear framework for compensation and reparations and removing a considerable legal overhang for Vale. Its shares were little changed in Sao Paulo.Vale will pay 37.7 billion reais ($7.03 billion) including cash payments to affected people and investments in environmental projects, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a statement. Vale estimates it will book an additional expense of 19.8 billion reais in 2020 results.“This is the largest reparation agreement ever signed in Latin America in financial terms and with the participation of the state,” and one of the largest in the world, Minas Gerais said in a statement.The two sides come together after Vale initially presented a value of about 21 billion reais, while Minas Gerais outlined 28 billion reais in material damages plus 26 billion reais in moral damages.Vale said about 8,900 people are already parties of civil or labor indemnification agreements, while more than 100,000 have received emergency aid totaling 1.8 billion reais.With Vale benefiting from high iron ore prices, the Brumadinho settlement isn’t expected to jeopardize any of its investment plans, according to Ativa Investimentos. Iron ore futures climbed 73% last year on strong Chinese demand.The agreement is about two thirds of the amount initially sought by the courts, “which corroborates a positive negotiation for Vale,” Ativa analyst Ilan Arbetman said. “In addition, its adjusted net debt allows it to dispose of the amounts not provisioned without further complications.”Vale’s shares extended gains after a trading halt, but then pared the advance.

2021-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, the world’s second-largest iron ore producer, appears set to raise its dividend, joining other miners that are boosting payouts on the back of surging metal prices.Bloomberg’s Dividend Forecasting team is projecting Vale will increase its payout to 2.697 reais a share from 1.41 reais in September. The stock has almost doubled in the past year to about 98 reais ($17.85). The Rio de Janeiro-based company resumed its dividend policy last year after halting payments in the wake of a tailings dam disaster in early 2019. It’s expected to outline dividend plans as part of its fourth-quarter results after the close of regular trading Thursday. The three-year growth rate for Vale’s dividend is estimated at 15%, Bloomberg data show.Mining companies from BHP Group to Glencore Plc are rewarding investors for sticking with the industry through several lean years. Now with metal prices surging to multi-year highs on the prospect of resurgent demand and supply shortfalls, miners have become cash machines once again. Vale is expected to report its highest earnings before items since 2011.One of Vale’s Australian iron-ore rivals, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. doubled its interim payout year-on-year, while Grupo Mexico, which owns one of the world’s biggest copper producers, raised it by more than 50% from last March. In Brazil, materials companies are projected to lead dividend payouts on the benchmark index, with a projected 36% increase compared with 2020, Bloomberg data show.While a recent $7 billion dam disaster settlement is expected to take a toll on Vale’s minimum payment, analysts still see room to offset that through extraordinary payments.

2021-02-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, once the most generous payer of dividends among major miners, is looking to regain that status as surging prices of iron ore, nickel and copper flood its coffers.The Rio de Janeiro-based company announced on Thursday a bigger-than expected payment from profit generated in the second half of last year and pledged Friday to return any excess cash to shareholders this year. Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Bartolomeo also said a share buyback is on the table, although no decision has been made on that yet.It’s a sharp turnaround from the last couple of years after a tailings dam disaster sent Vale into crisis mode, cutting dividends and scaling back operations as it focused on repairing the damage and shoring up safety. Now, with a dam-collapse settlement signed with authorities and prices of its metals rallying to multiyear highs, Vale is ready to reward investors who suffered through the lean years.The surge in prices has turned miners into cash machines once again, with Vale’s iron ore business generating its second-highest earnings ever and the company squarely focused on growing its existing assets rather than splashing out on deals as it did in previous booms.“So the natural way for money to flow is to the shareholders, as long as we can keep our business growing and safe,” Bartolomeo told analysts on Friday.Cash SurplusChief Financial Officer Luciano Siani Pires said on the same call that the company’s cash position “is way too high” and “we are looking into a number of alternatives.” BMO Capital Markets estimates Vale will generate free cash flow of $36 billion from 2021 to 2023, 36% of its current market value.Doling out more money to shareholders or buying back shares would also help Vale narrow its valuation gap with rivals BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group, whose mines are closer to China and headquarters are in developed nations.Vale’s shares trade at a ratio to estimated profit that is about half those of BHP and Rio Tinto. It’s a discount that “bothers us,” Pires said.Vale’s board approved a March dividend payment of 3.427 reais a share, beating a projection of 2.697 reais by Bloomberg’s Dividend Forecasting team and up from 1.41 reais in September. The stock has doubled in value in the past year to about 95 reais ($17).The CFO said Vale is already back in front of some competitors on dividend yield. “The expectation is that we can, going forward, lift these values,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Vale Dangles More Dividends and Buyback With Cash ‘Way Too High’

2021-03-01,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the hottest trades in emerging market debt hasn’t paid a penny of interest in five years.Prices on the defaulted bonds issued by Samarco Mineracao SA, the Brazilian iron ore mining venture jointly owned by Vale SA and BHP Group Ltd., have skyrocketed to 83 cents on the dollar from just 34 cents at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, handing creditors a return of 144%.There are a handful of factors driving the rally: Iron ore prices are surging; Samarco officials have begun prepping a debt restructuring plan; and the mine is finally producing again, albeit at a fraction of the levels it was at before a 2015 dam burst that killed 19 people and wiped out much of two villages downstream.But still, even at a time of wild froth in global financial markets, the sheer scope of the gains is somewhat perplexing. The bonds had only traded a few pennies higher in the days prior to the catastrophe. The bankers advising Samarco and its shareholders have been taken by surprise. They see the 83-cent price as being markedly higher than the amount that will be offered in the restructuring, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified.The only way the current price would make sense, they said, is if Vale and BHP were to inject fresh capital into Samarco to help pay back the debt, something they insist will not happen. The company needs to shrink its $3.8 billion debt and adjust its payment schedule to reflect its new smaller size, they said.Bankers are clearly trying to temper expectations -- but investor interest in the bonds remains high. A difficult debt restructuring negotiation may be resuming soon.“Bondholders simply won’t accept a haircut because Samarco has two healthy shareholders that they believe could inject money,” said Carlos Gribel, a managing director at Andbanc Brokerage in Miami. “To compromise they could agree to a delay on payments, for instance.”BHP, Vale, Samarco and New York-based investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc., which is advising a group of bondholders, declined to comment.To put the defaulted bond rally in perspective, an average of emerging market materials bonds have returned about 33% since April 7 while Brazilian government notes have returned 11%, according to Bloomberg Barclays indices. Iron ore prices have jumped more than 10% this year alone.Some creditors aren’t willing to wait for an out-of-court restructuring and are pursuing their claims in court.A group of Samarco bondholders filed a lawsuit in New York in October asking the firm to fork over $2.7 billion in principal and interest on the defaulted notes. Davis Polk & Wardwell is representing the creditors in New York while Samarco is being advised by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.Some litigants pursuing export prepayment loans have been more successful in Brazil.Judge Jeferson Maria in Belo Horizonte ruled on Feb. 8 that Samarco needs to pay a promissory note of $125 million which matured on Dec. 3 to York Global Finance BDH, LLC. The notes were used as collateral in a loan from Mizuho Bank Ltd. in 2013 that was sold to York in June 21 2018, according to court documents. The company can still file a motion to stay the enforcement proceeding.Padis Mattar Advogados and Ferro, Castro Neves, Daltro & Gomide Advogados are representing York in Brazil, while Cescon, Barrieu, Flesch & Barreto Advogados is representing Samarco.Some creditors of another $1.6 billion of export prepayment loans and other obligations are planning to go to court in Brazil after the success on the first lawsuit, one person said. They are mostly investment funds, after banks sold most of their holdings.Ahead of a new round of restructuring talks expected on the $2.2 billion of bonds maturing in 2022 and 2024, a group of creditors is being advised by Houlihan Lokey. Samarco is getting advice from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Vale is working with Moelis & Co. and BHP with Rothschild & Co.Depending on how the lawsuits play out, Samarco may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection against creditors in Brazil, three of the people said, while adding that this isn’t the most probable outcome for now. Samarco is prepared to go to court if its cash gets seized by creditors or if operations are harmed in any way by lawsuits, the people said.On Feb. 4, Vale announced a 37.7 billion reais ($7.03 billion) settlement agreement with Brazilian authorities for a separate dam collapse that killed 270 people in 2019.“The timing for Samarco to restructure all its liabilities is very good right now, since the company is back producing, the real is weak and prices of iron ore and pellets had an amazing rally,” said Rafael Fritsch, chief investment officer for distressed-asset funds at Sao Paulo-based Canvas Capital SA, which holds Samarco debt.“The firm’s two shareholders have resolved some of their legal issues and have clear business plans, and that adds to the optimism,” Fritsch said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Five Years Into Default, a BHP-Vale Bond Is Suddenly Soaring"

2021-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s a very odd security, technically a perpetual bond from Vale SA that pays out when the Brazilian mining giant’s ore output reaches certain thresholds. And for years, few in Sao Paulo financial circles seemed to notice it, with prices stuck at just a few cents in thin trading.But investors are giving the notes a fresh look, and prices are soaring. The appeal is that while the bonds are sold in the local currency, the payout is based on Vale’s dollar revenue. That means securities from an investment-grade company will pay a dollar yield of about 10% this year, an almost unheard of figure in a world where global central banks have done their best to hold down interest rates.Now, a fresh supply of the notes is about to hit the secondary market, increasing liquidity and providing an opportunity for new investors to jump in just as prices for industrial metals seem on the cusp of a new supercycle. Brazil’s government and state development bank BNDES, which own about 55% of the outstanding amount, plan to sell their stake next month, worth about 12.9 billion reais ($2.24 billion) at current prices. It’s part of a plan to shed state assets championed by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes.“The notes are very attractive right now,” said Ulisses de Oliveira, a money manager at Sao Paulo-based Quasar International Cap Mgmt Ltd., which owns the debt. “The BNDES sale brings liquidity to the trade.”The securities now fetch almost 60 reais after more than doubling over the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Anbima, the country’s capital markets association.The notes were issued with a face value of 0.01 real each in 1997, just before Vale’s privatization, with owners given one for each equity share they held. The idea was that investors would be directly rewarded as Vale ramped up production, and would get windfall payouts in years when output and metals prices were particularly robust.The notes don’t have a fixed coupon and instead pay holders a dividend equal to 1.8% of net revenue from some iron-ore sales and 2.5% of net revenue from copper and gold after certain production thresholds are met, some of which are tied to where the ore is being mined. The revenue is calculated in dollars, then converted to reais for the distributions to investors.While output thresholds haven’t been reached in the region that encompasses southern Brazil after a deadly dam rupture in Minas Gerais curbed production, the northern region alone is providing bondholders with attractive yields, according to Oliveira. In October last year, Vale payed 1.27 reais per note in dividends. The first payment this year will be for 2.76 reais on April 1, and Oliveira estimates a payment of at least 3 reais this October, which would provide a dollar yield of 9.6% given a price of 60 reais for the security.That’s an extraordinary level when considering that Vale’s longest term overseas bonds, due in more than 20 years, yield just 4.2%. The perpetual notes also pay more than three times the 2.8% average dollar yield for emerging-market companies rated in the BBB bucket, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.With an increase in production volumes at Vale’s northern mines and considering the 80% jump in iron-ore futures over the past year, the securities represent a great value, according to Jorge Junqueira, a partner at asset management firm Gauss Capital Gestora de Recursos Ltda., which owns the notes.“Those notes are very peculiar, and some time ago there was a total lack of knowledge of those assets, even from some of Vale’s top equity analysts,” he said. “With the dollar at this level, this asset is very interesting for investors.”Of course the payouts to noteholders are painful for the Rio de Janeiro-based company. Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani Pires said in a conference call with analysts in October that Vale planned to repurchase the securities at some point, a prospect that concerns bondholders since it could reduce liquidity.At a bondholder meeting March 19, the government and BNDES voted their majority stake in favor of changing the clauses of the securities -- without paying any compensation to bondholders -- so that Vale can repurchase them. Oliveira and Junqueira say they voted against the proposal and now that it was approved are considering legal options to try to revert the decision.In a emailed response to Bloomberg, Vale said repurchases aren’t a priority for now, and it would do “a public and transparent” tender offer if it decides to buy back the notes in the future. It said capital market regulations forbid the company from bidding on the notes being sold by the government and BNDES next month, and also don’t allow Vale to buy the securities slowly on the secondary market, denying speculation it was doing so.BNDES, also based in Rio de Janeiro, mandated banks in September to organize the sale, with presentations to investors running from March 30 to April 9.“If Vale wants to buy back the notes, they will have to come up with a very attractive proposal,” Oliveira said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Paying 10% Dollar Yield, Obscure Vale Bond Is Now Talk of Brazil"

2021-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, the biggest producer of mined nickel, closed a deal to divest its underperforming New Caledonian mine to a group that includes the operation’s managers and workers.The divestment will allow operations to continue and gives Vale the right to a portion of output amid growing demand for the battery metal, Vale said in a statement Wednesday. Tesla Inc. will support the operation through a “technical and industrial partnership” with the consortium, called Prony Resources.Vale had intended to mothball the facility if the deal fell through after a string of financial and operational setbacks. Vale picked up the Goro project as part of its 2007 acquisition of Inco. It was brought online late and over-budget in 2010 and never reached more than 70% of capacity, showing the difficulties producing nickel from laterite deposits using the high pressure acid leach process. Vale will focus on base metal assets in Brazil, Canada and Indonesia.Protests by independence activists in New Caledonia had blocked access to facilities, disrupting processing. Operations recommenced this week with the restart of nickel production expected in mid April, Prony said in a separate statement.The consortium, which includes Singapore-based Trafigura and is supported by New Caledonian and French authorities, is taking a majority interest.The exit comes with a cost. The transaction provides a financial package of $1.1 billion, of which Vale Canada Ltd. will contribute $555 million to support continuity of operations. While responsibility for funding a sustainable development pact transfers to the new owners, Vale is securing that financing.“Simply put, this means that Vale will ensure Pact commitments are met in the unlikely event the new owners are ever unable to do so for reasons of insolvency,” the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in an emailed response.The deal gives Trafigura a 19% stake and an offtake agreement. Investment firm Agio Global also has a minority interest, Prony said, without giving the size.Vale had a Goro sale arrangement in place with New Century Resources Ltd., but the Melbourne-based firm said in September that it was unable to generate a suitable funding package and equity structure.(Adds details of funding arrangment in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Top Nickel Miner Vale Turns Page on 14-Year Caledonian Foray

2021-04-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, one of iron ore’s biggest swing factors, may determine whether prices of the steelmaking ingredient break through to multiyear highs or retreat once again.The Rio de Janeiro-based mining company reports quarterly production after the close of trading Monday.

2021-04-19,"Iron ore production at Brazil's Vale SA fell sharply in the first quarter on a sequential basis, but rose compared to the same period a year ago, buoyed by the ramp-up of multiple key mine complexes.  Among the other factors that buoyed Vale's iron ore output in the period was a relatively dry January, as well as the late 2020 restart of its Serra Leste facility, which had been halted since the Brumadinho disaster.  Conversely, scheduled maintainence stoppages at its S11D mine in northern Brazil, regulatory restrictions at its Itabira mine and ""habitual seasonality"" weighed on production compared with the previous quarter, Vale said.","UPDATE 1-Brazil's Vale Q1 output up vs year ago; issues at Itabira, S11D weigh"
2021-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s top two iron ore miners struggled to keep up with strong Chinese demand in the first quarter of 2021, hit by operational challenges and weather disruptions, in a positive sign for prices that are already at decade highs.Brazil’s Vale SA churned out less ore than expected last quarter after lower productivity at one mine and a ship loader fire, with its recovery from an early-2019 tailings dam disaster proving a little slower than expected. Rio Tinto Group’s shipments were disrupted by wetter-than-average weather at its Pilbara operations in Western Australia.Benchmark iron ore surged Monday over $180 a ton -- the highest since May 2011 -- following news that China’s crude steel production jumped 19% last month from a year earlier to near a record. The nation’s output of the alloy is booming at the same time as a pollution crackdown has lifted prices and benefited profit margins at mills.“With the market relatively tight at the moment, it will certainly see any failure to meet current guidelines as relatively positive for the price,” said Daniel Hynes, senior commodities strategist at ANZ Banking Group Ltd. Vale and Rio both maintained their forecasts for full-year production, though a slower-than-expected recovery at Vale could see the market reset its expectations, he said.Rio cautioned that its guidance for annual output of up to 340 million tons was subject to logistical risks associated with bringing 90 million tons of replacement mine capacity on stream. It also said that Tropical Cyclone Seroja had impacted its Pilbara mine and port operations in April.It was a “mediocre quarter” for Rio, Tyler Broda, mining analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. Quarterly production was 6% less than the bank’s estimate, he said. “Not all that much is going in the right direction from a bottom-up basis for Rio Tinto as they continue to tackle the various challenges at their operations and projects, but main commodities iron ore and aluminum are both benefiting from the China decarbonisation theme.”Iron ore futures in Singapore rose as much as 3.7% to $182.80 a ton before trading at $182.75 by 2:48 p.m. local time. Prices in Dalian gained as much as 4.7%, while hot-rolled coil and rebar both rose in Shanghai. Rio Tinto’s shares settled 0.5% lower in Sydney.Steel prices in China finished the quarter at decade highs as construction activity and demand in the first quarter exceeded both 2020 and 2019, Rio said. Strong demand and margins -- at their highest since 2018 -- have lifted demand for higher quality iron ore products and the nation’s renewed focus on reducing steelmaking emissions will likely restrain exports in 2021, supporting margins globally, the company said.The short-term outlook for iron ore prices remained strong, ANZ’s Hynes said, with Chinese steel mills content to accept current high prices for their main feedstock while their margins were so strong. However, he added the cost of ore was now well above fair value, with the risk of a pullback later in the year if Beijing’s plans to curb steel production to control greenhouse gas emissions start to impact on demand.“If we saw a 1% fall in Chinese steel production that would potentially wipe out about 15-20 million tons of iron ore,” said Hynes(Closes shares in 7th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Iron Ore Giants Challenged in Race to Meet China Demand

Both advanced over 3% this week as Mysteel Global reported Handan city in Hebei province planned to curb output, while some mills in the Fengrun area of Tangshan halted production from Thursday.Chinese authorities and the steel sector have pledged to lower output from last year’s record, with Tangshan already facing a slew of restrictions amid the push to control emissions.

2021-04-27,"Brazilian iron ore miner Vale SA is ""closely analyzing"" a possible spinoff of its base metals division, Chief Executive Eduardo Bartolomeo said on Tuesday, a move that could help the company take advantage of increasing demand from electric car manufacturers.  The company previously considered spinning off its base metals division in 2014, but delayed the move in 2015, and later abandoned the idea.

2021-04-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, the world’s second-largest iron ore producer, is exploring spinning off of its base metals business as the global transition to clean energy and transport spurs demand for copper and nickel.“We are in a phase of studying -- analyzing the possibility,” Chief Executive Officer Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo told analysts on a conference call Tuesday.The Rio de Janeiro-based miner, which is recovering from an iron-ore tailings disaster in 2019, continues to trade at a discount to its Australian-focused rivals BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group. Housing base metals operations in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia in a separate company may help unlock value as the company expands copper and nickel output and exits coal.Vale, already the top commercial producer of mined nickel, sees an opportunity to grow in the electric-vehicle supply chain as the world tries to wean itself off fossil fuels.The company recently signed a “significant” multi-year contract to supply battery-grade nickel, and wants to channel 30% to 40% of its high-quality nickel to the EV space, said Mark Travers, who heads the base metals business. Vale has the “ESG credentials” of low-carbon intensity and the respected jurisdiction of Canada to do so, he said.In copper, the metal used in wiring that’s trading near the highest levels in a decade, Vale is looking to lift annual output from about 360,000 tons to 500,000 tons in the coming years as it explores the Hu’u deposit in Indonesia.Iron ore miners tend to trade at a discount to base metals. Perth-based Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., for example, fetches 4.7 times enterprise value over earnings before items compared with Chilean copper miner Antofagasta Plc’s ratio of 6.7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.“This is not the first time Vale has looked at a spin off,” BI analyst Grant Sporre said. “The company is one of the biggest nickel producers globally but the earnings are dwarfed by iron ore. So this is all about unlocking value.”(Adds comments from BI analyst in last paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Battery Boom Prompts Iron Giant Vale to Mull Base Metal Spin-off
