## Chart indicators

Even though utilities outperformed broader markets in 2018, the recent weakness is a concern. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), the representative of top utilities in the country, fell almost 10% in the second half of December. Let’s see where top utility stocks might go in the short term.

NextEra Energy (NEE) is trading at $169.8—almost 4% below its 50-day simple moving average and marginally above its 200-day moving average level. The 200-day level close to $168.9 will likely be crucial support for NextEra Energy stock going forward. NextEra Energy’s RSI (relative strength index) is 33.

## Southern Company stock is oversold

Southern Company (SO) stock is trading in the “oversold” zone with its RSI below 30. RSI levels at extremes indicate an impending reversal in the stock’s direction. Southern Company is trading 5% and 4% below its 50-day and 200-day moving average levels, respectively. The fair discount to both of these levels indicates weakness in the stock.

Recently, Duke Energy (DUK) and Dominion Energy (D) shares fell below the 50-day moving average, which suggests weakness in the stock. Duke Energy and Dominion Energy have an RSI close to 34, which indicates that they aren’t in the oversold or the overbought zone. Their respective 200-day moving average level might act as a support in the short term.

## A shaky start to 2019

Utilities, the defensives, underperformed broader markets last week. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), the representative of the top utility stocks in the country, closed marginally down. The S&P 500 gained almost 2% in the week ending January 4. The broader markets were still volatile. The better-than-expected jobs report for December and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on being patient about raising rates helped the sentiment late last week.

## Movers and shakers

NextEra Energy (NEE) fell marginally, while Duke Energy (DUK), the second-biggest utility by market cap, fell 0.8% last week. Duke Energy declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9275 per share last week, which indicates a dividend yield of 4.4%. The ex-dividend date for the dividend is February 14. The dividend will be paid on March 18. Duke Energy has a long dividend payment history. Duke Energy has paid a cash dividend for 93 consecutive years.

According to Reuters, wildfire-stricken PG&E (PCG) is considering filing for bankruptcy. The company is facing a multi-billion dollar liability associated with wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Bankruptcy isn’t certain yet. However, the company reported in November that its existing insurance wouldn’t be enough. The wildfire-related liabilities could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition. PG&E fell 30% in after-hours trading on January 4 following the news, according to Reuters.

Top regulated utility stock Southern Company (SO) rose 1.7%, while Dominion Energy (D) fell 1.4% last week. Dominion Energy completed its much-awaited SCANA (SCG) acquisition last week.

## Analysts’ target prices

Analysts expect an upside potential of almost 10% from NextEra Energy (NEE) stock based on the median target price of $186.1 and its current price of $169.8.

Duke Energy (DUK), the second-largest utility by market cap, has a median target price of $87.7, which reflects a potential upside of almost 4% from its current price of $84.7 over the next 12 months.

The above chart shows Wall Street analysts’ views on the top utility stocks as of January 2.

Southern Company (SO) stock offers a potential upside of more than 7% over the next 12 months. Analysts gave the company a median target price of $46.9—compared to its current price of $43.7.

Dominion Energy (D) has a median target price of $76.6—compared to its current price of $71.2, which implies a potential upside of 7.6% over the next 12 months.

Utilities’ outperformance last year was mainly driven by market uncertainties. The recent weakness in utilities could be an opportunity given the fair valuation of many big names. Considering the estimated gain based on analysts’ target prices and the current dividend yield, top utility stocks present an attractive total return for 2019.

The markets -- down 6%-plus for the full year -- fell into a turmoil and it looked as if the bulls were finally rolling over into a big bear market. Stocks, commodities and other risk assets tanked as global growth worries moved to the forefront of many investors' minds.

At the time of writing, the S&P 500 is now roughly 12% below its recent September highs, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 14% from its recent peaks. But just as it looked like the markets' woes could spill over into the New Year, the market got its Santa Claus rally after all. From Dec. 24 to Dec. 31, the S&P jumped 6.6% while the Nasdaq gained 7%. Year-to-date so far, the S&P is up another 3%. The Nasdaq, 4.4%.

That doesn't mean that the bear market is over. Far from it. This is a great time to strengthen your portfolio's diversity, introducing a number of defensive stocks to batten down the hatches in case more dark clouds roll over the horizon.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Luckily, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make shifting portfolio strategy a breeze.

By using ETFs, investors can add a dose of safety to their portfolios and potentially save themselves some losses as the bear takes over. Moreover, they can do it quickly with one ticker access. There's no major selling or buying with ETFs. That makes using them the perfect way to hedge a portfolio.

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



With that, here are three defensive ETFs to buy right now to limit a potentially elongated bear market's growl.

Source: Shutterstock 

### Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF)

Expense Ratio: 0.60%, or $60 per $10,000 invested

One of the oldest and most successful ETFs providing safety to portfolios is the $165 million Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:DEF). Heck, it even has &quot;defense&quot; as part of its name. The key to that defense comes down t its underlying construction.

DEF tracks the Invesco Defensive Equity Index. That benchmark combs through the universe of large-cap stocks and finds those superior risk-return profiles during periods of stock market weakness as well as offer gains during bear markets. The basic underlying idea is to create a portfolio of stocks that should hold up- or at least fall a lot less than the broader market- when things get dicey.

The ETF currently holds 100 different stocks- with its top holdings reading like a who's who of America's &quot;bedrock&quot; stocks, including drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) and consumer products firm Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL). Stocks in the ETF are equally weighted so that investors can gain the most from each holding's defensive nature. Healthcare stocks make up around 20% of the portfolio, while industrials and tech make much around 15% of assets each.

As far as performance goes, DEF has been one of the better defensive ETFs around. During market troubles, the fund has managed to hold its own. Considering 2018's performance, DEF has managed to beat the S&P 500. That outperformance should continue next year as the market drifts lower.

### Defensive ETFs To Buy Today: iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY)

Expense Ratio: 0.39%

Investors often forget one of the best ways to score some great defense is through firms that pay hefty dividends. After all, making a few percentage points in yield can mean the difference between a loss and gain at the end of the day during drifting and sinking markets. More importantly, reinvested dividends can propel an overall position that much higher as prices rebound. Dividend ETFs such as the iShares Select Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:DVY) make it easy to add a dose of dividends to a portfolio.

DVY can be seen as a &quot;catch-all&quot; fund when it comes to dividend ETFs. The ETFs underlying index -- Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index -- looks at U.S. stocks that have long histories of paying dividends as well as high yields. This allows investors to score a high yield today as well as one that will last the test of time. That's perfect for today's low return environment. The more pennies you can pick-up today, the better.

And while the idea of &quot;high yield&quot; may sound scary, investors shouldn't fret. DVY's top holdings are not fly-by-night names. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and utility Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) are some of the stalwarts dotting its top-holdings. Those stalwarts and its remaining holdings help produce a tasty 3.51% yield.

  * Morgan Stanley: 7 Risky Stocks to Sell Now 



All in all, dividends can help boost a portfolios defense and DVY could be one of the best ETFs to get that exposure.

### SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)

Expense Ratio: 0.40%

When the going gets tough, investor's flock to gold. That relationship has been tested time and time again. And lately, the various gold ETFs are continuing the trend. Gold prices have spiked in recent weeks as the market has sputtered and finished December at six-month highs. And if you remember, six months ago was the last time the market had a slight meltdown. Because of this, gold ETFs could be one of the best ways to kind of hedge the upcoming storm in the year ahead.

And you can't get much better than the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD).

The $33.5 billion GLD is one of the largest ETFs in the world and is the behemoth among the gold ETFs. The fund doesn't use futures to get its gold exposure but owns physical bullion stored in a vault on behalf of investors. That keeps GLD's share price closely mirroring what is happening in the gold market. Each share of the ETF represents a 10th of an ounce of gold. So, buy 10 shares and you have an ounce of physical gold in your portfolio. This makes the GLD one of the easiest ways to add exposure to the asset class.

There's no need to pay exorbitant fees to own gold and gain from its hedging abilities. In fact, GLD costs a cheap 0.40% in expenses. Given the markets current state, adding a touch of gold could be one of the best defenses around.

At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have an exposure to any ETF or stock listed.

2019-01-18,"The immediate fears surrounding Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) appear to have passed. A falling stock market and plunging oil prices late last year led to a selling spree in CHK stock. However, as oil prices have moved back above the $50 per barrel mark, interest in CHK returned.

Still, for all of these improvements, Chesapeake Energy stock remains a struggling penny stock. As such, a sustained drop in oil prices could compromise the profits on which CHK has slowly built a recovery. Still, assuming it can stay the course and continue to reduce its debt, CHK stock appears positioned for an eventual move higher.

### CHK Stock Is Back. . . To Its Slow Recovery

CHK stock has enjoyed a dramatic recovery since Christmas Eve. From its 52-week low of $1.71, it has surged to around $2.90 per share range in under a month.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

A few factors have worked in favor of CHK stock in that time. For one, the overall market recovered. The S&P 500 has increased by over 11% since the December 24th low. Oil prices, which saw a surprisingly dramatic plunge in the last months of 2018, have begun to recover. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude again trades at over $50 per barrel.

### Both Risk and Reward Lies in the Balance Sheet

While concerns of an impending bankruptcy have abated, this takes us back to the scenario described in my previous article on CHK stock.

  * 7 Companies Apple Should Consider Buying 



Chesapeake remains a $2.55 billion company with negligible cash reserves. It also still holds almost $9.4 billion in long-term debt. This may explain why CHK remains a penny stock despite a 4.5 forward P/E ratio. Given these circumstances, CHK stock remains a poor choice for risk-averse investors.

However, for those who can tolerate more risk and want a speculative play, I see a high degree of potential for Chesapeake. For one, despite the high costs of servicing its debt, analysts forecast profits every year through at least fiscal 2020.

As it realizes those profits, Chesapeake can pay down more of its debt. Reduced debt should lead to a higher CHK stock price over time. This virtuous cycle of falling debt and higher equity would return Chesapeake to financial stability in time.

### Strategic Moves Should Pay Off, Eventually

I think the strategic moves that might have concerned investors will ultimately build confidence in CHK. CEO Doug Lawler announced that the company would reduce active rig counts from 18 to 14 for 2019.

Some might wonder how reducing the number of rigs improves the business. My colleague James Brumley believes it helps. He described this move as prioritizing &quot;quality over quantity,&quot; and I agree. With oil prices down by almost one-third from their October highs, I think this makes sense. The production level of 462,000 to 464,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day fell from last year's numbers. However, it comes in ahead of the 448,000 per day analysts had expected.

Also, the costs of the proposed $4 billion acquisition of Wildhorse Resources (NYSE:WRD) probably made some investors nervous as well. However, it increases the company's stake in oil, which for now produces much higher margins than natural gas.

Speaking of natural gas, its margins should also improve over time. CHK remains one of the largest natural gas producers in the country. As such, it can benefit from the burgeoning export industry in liquefied natural gas (LNG).

A third terminal began LNG production in Corpus Christi, Texas late last year. Several other terminals are in the planning stages, and analysts estimate that the U.S.'s export capacity will more than double this year. Both Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) and Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) operate terminals. In the coming months, industry analysts expect Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) and Freeport LNG to finish construction on their terminals.

### The Bottom Line on CHK Stock

For all of the price fluctuations and possible strategies that can affect CHK stock, maintaining a virtuous cycle of falling debt and rising stock prices remains critical to inspiring confidence.

The immediate fears caused by the drop in oil prices appear to have passed. Oil again trades over $50 per barrel. Also, production should become more focused once the Wildhorse Deal closes in February. Moreover, prospects for natural gas should only improve as more LNG export terminals come online.

Still, for all of the optimism, debt levels remain well above the market cap. But profit forecasts for CHK stock offer a plausible path back to financial stability. If debt continues falling, those investors who bear the high risks of CHK should enjoy massive gains as Chesapeake stabilizes. However, no matter how much oil and natural gas prices influence moves in the stock, it is debt and equity that will ultimately define CHK stock.

2019-01-25,"PG&E (NYSE:PCG) exploded late in Thursday trading. Traders found relief as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection absolved the utility of any fault related to the Tubbs Fire. PCG stock surged by almost 75% to $13.95 per share following the release of this news late in the Thursday trading session. So far in Friday's trading, the rally has settled a bit, and PCG stock price hovers around 12.40.

However, they still face tens of billions in liability related to 17 other fires, which killed at least 13 people. They also face some likelihood that investigators will find them at fault in the Camp Fire -- the deadliest fire in California history. Hence, a huge chance of bankruptcy remains. For this reason, investors should probably avoid PCG stock despite the move higher.

### PCG Stock Spiked on Tubbs Fire News

According to state fire officials, a private electrical system caused the Tubbs Fire. They said PG&E beared no responsibility for the fire, which burned almost 37,000 acres in Napa and Sonoma counties and killed 22 people.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now 



The news heartened owners of PCG stock as the price of the equity spiked higher. However, the firm still bears responsibility for 18 wildfires that occurred in 2017. Fire officials have also not exonerated the company in the Camp Fire. That blaze killed 86 people, and PG&E admitted that a high-voltage line failed in this area before the fire started.

### PG&E Not Out of the Woods

Investors should also note that even without liability from the Tubbs Fire, the costs related to other fires could still push the company into bankruptcy. Analysts had estimated the total damages at about $30 billion. Although that figure includes the Tubbs Fire, the company still faces billions in fire-related liability. Moody's cut PG&E credit rating to junk status. They said that the decision regarding the Tubbs Fire would not change that rating.

Not all agree that this will lead to bankruptcy for PCG stock. To be sure, the PCG stock price of almost $13 per share implies less of a danger of bankruptcy. Moreover, a bailout from the State of California remains possible. However, Governor Gavin Newsom has shown no interest in such a move.

Hence, investors should approach this stock on the likely assumption of a Chapter 11 filing. At this stage, buying PCG stock amounts to a gamble that the company will avoid liability in the Camp Fire. Given the utility's admittance of a power line failure in the area, that seems like a bet investors are unlikely to win.

### PG&E Not the Usual Utility Stock

Also, as I mentioned in a recent article, utility stock investors do not sign up for this kind of turmoil. Usually, investors buy utility stocks for stability and dividend income. They want firms such as Dominion Resources (NYSE:D), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), or Southern Company (NYSE:SO) that quietly generate power, deliver service, and distribute profits among shareholders.

Prospective buyers should also remember the fact that this company holds a monopoly in providing the energy needed to sustain life. Even with that guaranteed book of business, they still face Chapter 11. One can debate whether the PG&E management team or poor forestry management in the state led to this point. However, no matter where the fault lies, the investment decision remains the same.

Even if the company avoided bankruptcy, liability costs would preclude a return of the dividend for years to come. Hence, all signs point to PCG stock as a high-risk gamble at best.

  * 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



### The Bottom Line on PCG Stock

Despite the surge in PCG stock, risks remain incredibly high, and even risk-tolerant investors would likely see better results looking elsewhere. Although PG&E will not bear any liability from the Tubbs Fire, the utility still faces tens of billions in liability stemming from other blazes. Given that cost and the decreasing likelihood that the firm will receive a bailout, speculative investors should look to other equities.

2019-05-02,"By any conventional measure Southern (NYSE:SO) is a hot utility stock. SO stock is up 20% since the start of the year, against a 16.5% gain for the average stock in the S&P 500. Yet the 60 cent per share dividend, which is covered by earnings, still yields a fat 4.7%.Source: Shutterstock While Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG), which tied its future to renewable energy, has gone into bankruptcy, Southern continues to stand tall.What could possibly go wrong? To put it simply, the rise of wind and solar power.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Southern's Nuclear StrategySouthern is one of the largest operators of nuclear power plants in the country, with six in all.  It's building two more, an expansion of its Plant Vogtle on the Savannah River.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Assuming the plants come on stream by 2022, Southern will have an additional 2.4 Million megawatt hours of capacity to sell, over 10% of the region's demand.Of course, that's a big if. A similar nuclear expansion across the river, in South Carolina, cost $9 billion, resulted in 9 rate hikes, and was eventually abandoned. The utility company behind it was sold to Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) for $13.4 billion in cash and assumed debt.For now Vogtle is the only nuclear power going up that qualifies under the Republican plans for &quot;green energy,&quot; and the project is being showered with largesse in the form of federal loan guarantees that now total $12 billion.  The expansion, originally slated to cost $14 billion, now has a budget of $28 billion. Changing WindsAs costs for solar and wind energy continue to fall -- they're now cheaper than maintaining coal-fired power plants -- the long-term fate of nuclear energy is increasingly precarious.Southern directors see which way the wind is blowing. They recently tied CEO Tom Fanning's pay to cuts in SO stock's carbon footprint.  But those plans are highly dependent on finishing Vogtle and getting that energy into the grid. The riskiest operating periods for a nuclear plant are when it's new, as the Vogtle plants will be, or when it's past its useful life.These are the long-term risks SO stock, and the southeastern U.S. economy, are running as construction on the plants continues. SO Stock EarningsSouthern reported earnings May 1. Earnings per share were in line with estimates at 70 cents. Meanwhile, revenue came in a bit low at $5.4 billion instead of the expected $5.8 billion. This isn't great, as revenues generally peak in the first quarter, which covers the winter, and the third quarter, which covers the summer.SO stock fell about 1.7% on the news.Analysts don't seem to know what to think of the risk-reward balance for so, with 13 of 21 just saying hold, against 2 buyers and 5 sellers. We'll see how that changes in light of Q1 earnings, however.The dividend is one of the highest in the utility sector, but most stock buyers today want risk and utilities, by their nature, are not risky investments.The red light flashing on Southern remains the debt, used to finance the nuclear power plants. It totaled $40.5 billion at the end of 2018. That debt load must be matched against the company's equity value, $54.3 billion. Its bonds currently yield about 4.6%, close to the stock's yield. The Bottom LineA recent analyst report on Southern said it offered &quot;short-term gain and long-term pain.&quot; That's about right.Southern stock has been the best-performing among the big southeastern utilities this year, outpacing NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Dominion and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). But the debt load is huge, and Southern has already sold $12 billion in assets to keep the bonds afloat, including its solar energy portfolio and Gulf Power, which serves Florida.For Southern stock and debt to pay off, the nuclear plants not only have to go online, but operate profitably, over decades, in an environment where solar and wind costs are continuing to decline.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away That's not a good bet for a risk-off investment.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-10,"As of midnight this morning, the U.S. boosted tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. The markets had expected this to be the week that this deal got done, but it blew up instead, and no one is sure how it ends at this point. It seems the market is still hoping for the best, while hedging for bad news. But it certainly hasn't priced in a worst-case scenario … yet.A couple positives: The tariffs don't hit until the current fleet of cargo ships that left port as of the deadline hit U.S. shores. That gives the parties a softer deadline of about 3-4 weeks to hammer something out before the tariffs take effect.And remember, regardless of the rhetoric, this is going to hit U.S. consumers and business. The companies will be paying more for goods and passing those prices on to consumers. It hits China, too, but the lion's share is out of U.S. pocketbooks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, economic numbers out of China have been trending down. That means they may be more interested in cutting a deal than they were when their numbers were coming in well above average.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days Regardless of how it pans out, it's a good time to add some income to your portfolio. These 7 dividend stocks to buy as the trade war reignites all get As in my Portfolio Grader for their momentum and rank high for fundamentals as well. They're great long-term foundation stocks. Best Dividend Stocks: Blackstone Group LP (BX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.5%Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) is a private equity firm that specializes in alternative investments (like real estate, infrastructure, etc), hedge funds and investment funds -- including closed-end funds -- for institutions and high-net-worth individuals.Set up as a limited partnership, it means investors are direct owners that participate in the company's net profits in the form of dividends. Its current dividend is a healthy 5.5% in the past year, and that's on top of a nearly 25% run for the stock in the past 12 months. That's a very respectable return on one of the world's top private equity firms that sports a $47 billion market cap.BX is built for a slow-growth economy. What's more, if a full-blown trade war does show up, this is the kind of stock that institutions will flock to for shelter from any storms. Dominion Energy (D)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5%Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) is one of the top electric utilities on the East Coast. Its primary market is Virginia, but it has reach into neighboring states and its unregulated business has prized assets like its Cove Point liquified natural gas (LNG) export facility in Maryland.Cove Point is the only LNG export facility on the East Coast at this point and one of only three import and storage facilities. This is a huge asset that grows in value for the utility every year, given the demand for natural gas in Europe, where prices are significantly higher.D also has a very good relationship with Virginia regulators, so that side of the business is strong.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From While the stock is up a solid 18% in the past 12 months, its rock-solid dividend kicks in another 5% on top of that. Its Mid-Atlantic Pipeline project has hit some snags, but the President Donald Trump administration is prepared to get the project done one way or the other. Darden Restaurants (DRI)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.5%Looking for restaurant dividend stocks? Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) sold its iconic Red Lobster seafood chain about 5 years ago now, and it hasn't looked back.Remember, it still owns Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains at the &quot;everyman&quot; level and high-end spots like Eddie V's and Capitol Grille. What's more, it has some mid-priced boutique restaurants like Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and Yard House in there as well.The point is, losing Red Lobster was a great opportunity to pivot into new markets and develop new ideas. And given the fact DRI stock started way back in 1938, staying nimble and seeing the next big thing coming along is part of its DNA.Given the continued strong economy -- more money for consumers to go out for bite more often -- its 33% return is impressive, but not surprising. There's more of that to come. Its reliable 2.5% dividend isn't a bell-ringer, but it shows that the company is investor friendly and that it can deliver, come what may. Hormel Foods (HRL)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.1%Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) began in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as a meat packing business that started national expansion ahead of the competition.Not only did HRL produce the first canned ham in the U.S., but it transformed that business by the 1930s into brands that live on today like Hormel Chili, Dinty Moore Stew and SPAM. Remember, this was at the height of the Depression and HRL was actually expanding its product line downwards so that people could buy cheap, quality food products.By the late '30s, HRL had introduced profit sharing for its employees.And that sense of loyalty combined with innovation has continued at the company. It now owns natural meat brands like Columbus and Applegate, as well as ethnic brands like Chi-Chi's, Embasa and Del Fuente. It even has its Hormel fuse burger brand that's a lean protein burger with whole grains and veggies.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips This is a competitive sector, but HRL has proven it can compete and endure where others flame out. Its 2.1% dividend is as reliable as sunrise; it's a great long-term foundation stock. Realty Income (O)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4%Realty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates properties for some of the biggest retail names in the business.Bear in mind, it doesn't operate big malls, but generally stand-alone properties. It's top 5 tenants, in order, are Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), 7 Eleven, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and LA Fitness. Its longer list of tenants is equally impressive.What's more, O pays its dividend monthly rather than quarterly, so it's a great choice for income seekers that want to diversify their income stream. Right now, it's delivering a 4% dividend that has been rock-solid for many years.And on the growth side, O stock is up 28% in the past 12 months. Given the slow-growth economy ahead, that's just the tip of its potential. REITs are one of the hottest sectors for 2019 and beyond. Kinder Morgan (KMI)Source: Roy Luck via FlickrDividend Yield: 5.1%Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) calls itself an energy infrastructure company, but what that means in laymen's terms is it's a major midstream energy company. Boiled down further, it's a energy pipeline and storage company.And that is a very good business to be in these days.Granted, it wasn't an easy path to get here. KMI used to be one of the first master limited partnerships in the burgeoning energy industry at the turn of the 21st Century. But when energy prices tanked and supply dried up, KMI dumped its MLP structure and became a corporation. That was 2014.Now, the stock is back, along with energy demand both domestic and abroad. And KMI is once again delivering an outsized dividend, just like in the good ol' days.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes Currently KMI stock, which is up 18% for the year, is paying out a healthy and sustainable 5.1% dividend. And if this slow, steady economic growth continues, so will the returns for KMI stock and many of its fellow dividend stocks. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.9%Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) may seem like an odd stock to be in a short list of dividend stocks, but it actually makes a lot of sense.First, QCOM, one of the leading mobile chip and equipment makers and licensing companies, has paid a dividend for a pretty long time.Second, now that all its lawsuits are over, QCOM is ready for the next wave of mobility technology products.Recently, the Justice Department interceded in a case before the Federal Trade Commission about the size of QCOM's royalty payments. It recommended that the FTC go easy on the firm because the U.S. needs a reliable 5G partner that's U.S.-based.This rekindled affection for QCOM is evident in the stock's 51% return in the past 12 months. It has been a few years since the stock has been in favor, so there's plenty of headroom left.Plus, its nearly 3% dividend is a welcome kicker for this top-performing tech on the rebound.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

Dozens of high-quality blue-chip stocks have been cut in price enough to lift their dividend yields above 4%.At present, familiar names from the consumer staples sector are combining decades of steady dividend growth with near-record yields and bargain-priced valuations.Energy stocks - which already were depressed due to weakened energy prices - were hacked even deeper. But these companies have already responded to market adversity over the past few years by shedding poorly performing assets, trimming costs, repurchasing stock and paying down debt. Some of those same companies were able to keep raising dividends, too, and now are positioned to survive in lean times and thrive as energy prices recover.Even some international stocks' yields are ballooning thanks to Brexit fears and a slowdown in several countries' growth.As a result, each of these 14 blue-chip dividend stocks currently off yields of 4% or better - with the highest payers delivering more than 6%.

Instead, Ford reported a solid earnings-per-share and revenue beat of 29 cents (non-GAAP) and $40.3 billion, respectively.The economic cycle may hurt auto sales, but Ford is ready to take on the challenging environment. It benefited from a strong product mix in North America. It may even issue a special dividend if truck and SUV sales exceed estimates in 2019. Philip Morris International (PM)Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) has a dividend yielding 5.84%.Source: Shutterstock Rumors that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to impose restrictions on e-cigarette sales hurt PM's stock price slightly. Still, it is holding up better than other cigarette suppliers, which is why it's one of the solid dividend stocks to buy.Philip Morris is adapting to the change in smoking habits. It continues to invest in its IQOS device, which has helped the company significantly in the longer term. IQOS 2 launched at the end of 2018 in Japan with notable success. By offering an alternative to cigarette smoking as consumers embrace the heated tobacco system, this company will bring in revenue growth quarter-after-quarter.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 And with that trend playing out, management may reward its loyal investors by increasing its dividends in the years ahead. Dominion Energy (D)Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) has a dividend yield of 4.97%.  The stock rallied from $61.53 and closed recently around $74.Source: Shutterstock The company's stock has started to rise out of its 2019 range, but it still has some legroom to run. Dominion Energy earned $1.15 a share and $3.16 so far for the nine months of the year. Power generation, power delivery and gas infrastructure revenue all came within the guidance range midpoint.Income investors may look forward to the completion of the SCANA merger later this year, as Dominion's business plan includes a diverse growth capital investment program that will spread its business risks.Ultimately, this is one of the dividend stocks to buy because, when you consider that it is starting a variety of businesses, it has an improved risk profile, strong earnings results. Chevron (CVX)Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is a major integrated oil and gas firm. At a yield just shy of 4%, consistency is what makes this one of the best dividend stocks to buy.Source: swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Chevron's upstream operations found a boost at the end of 2018 going into 2019, earning 828 million -- a vast improvement from a loss of $26 million last year. The unit benefited from crude oil prices moving higher, while the company increased production.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows Chevron stock is really closely tied to the price of oil, which has been volatile for the last five years, but the dividend is so reliable as to make that a non-issue. Iron Mountain (IRM)At 7.1%, Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM) offers one of the highest dividend yields on this list of dividend stocks to buy.Source: Shutterstock In its Q1 report, revenue rose 5%, year over year while adjusted EBITDA slid 6%. Iron Mountain benefited from rental revenue growing 2.6% so far this year. Internal service revenue growth of 1.8% is due to grow in the shred business, digitization and special projects.Markets often question the sustainability of Iron Mountain's dividend, but the NOI CAGR of 3.1% for Physical Storage, plus its expansion in emerging markets and data center, suggests the company will grow EBITDA through the end of 2020. If business keeps up at this strong pace, the share price will go up, lowering the dividend yield. But management may just hike the dividend in the future to keep its yield attractive while rewarding its shareholders.The takeaway here is that Iron Mountain is in the process of shifting its business into new segments. It has time to make the conversion because its borrowing was at a fixed-rate, averaging 4.8%. BCE Inc (BCE)Telecom giant BCE Inc (NYSE:BCE) is a Canadian firm whose dividend yields 5.04%.Source:  BCE, Inc. Bell allayed fears of any business weakness when it reported a good first-quarter report. It added a little more than 3% to its customer base when compared with Q1 2018. This added more than 2% in revenue growth and 6.9% higher adjusted EBITDA.In 2019, BCE will cut 4% of its management staff (700 positions). The capital intensity ratio will fall along with total cash pension funding. In effect, the cost controls will keep profit margins strong while the firm continues to pay out a dividend to shareholders.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Sure, investors could consider AT&T (NYSE:T) as an alternative, especially given that the dividend is north of 6%. But since BCE is a pure play in wireless and internet markets, with little exposure to content other than its CTV unit, it has a distinct advantage depending on your investment approach. And for that reason, I chose BCE instead. BP (BP)BP (NYSE:BP) already has added about 10% to its stock price this year and its dividend yields 5.81%.Source: Shutterstock While BP had a rocky 2018, 2019 has seen a little less volatility, given that this is an oil stock. This is because the company is well-prepared for an even bigger drop in oil prices. Over the years, it shed non-core assets, strengthened its balance sheet and continued paying a dividend despite the fluctuations in oil prices. Its underlying cash flow inflow is balanced with the outflow of organic capital expenditure and dividends. Should cash flow fall due to lower oil prices, BP may sustain its dividend but lower spending.To keep growing in the future, BP has five major projects currently in operation: Thunder Horse Northwest Expansion, Western Flank B, Atoll, Taas Expansion and Shah Deniz 2.BP's outlook is bright. It is shedding over $3 billion in assets and spending ~ $15 billion in capital expenditure in 2018. In the upcoming fourth quarter, it forecasts higher production from upstream. Downstream will benefit from higher levels of a turnaround thanks to its Whiting refinery in the U.S.Will oil prices keep falling? No one knows, but BP is prepared.As of this writing, Chris Lau owned shares of F and BP.

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended the White House take steps to protect the domestic production of uranium after finding the nation’s reliance on imports was a national security risk, said three people briefed on the matter.Among the trade remedies recommended is to require nuclear power plants to purchase a minimum of 5% of the radioactive fuel from U.S. mines, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss non-public deliberations. Two of the people said an option under consideration would see the quota escalate by 5 percentage points a year.A decision to impose the quotas would be a boon to the two small mining companies that petitioned the Commerce Department to take action, Energy Fuels Inc. and Ur-Energy Inc. The move would increase costs for nuclear reactor operators that are already struggling in the face of competition from cheaper sources of power generated by natural gas and renewables. Domestic nuclear providers rose on the news, with Uranium Energy Corp. up as much as 3.9%, Energy Fuels rising as much as 3.5% and Ur-Energy paring earlier losses to rise less than 1%.The Commerce Department concluded in April that the imports harmed national security, delivering a confidential report on the matter to the White House at the time, the people said.The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Commerce Department declined to comment on the contents of the uranium report and said it is at the White House. Confidential MeetingThe recommendations have yet to be presented to President Donald Trump, and a meeting on the matter between him and advisers on the issue that had been scheduled for Thursday was delayed, two people said.The matter is far from final, but one person said it is certain that the White House appears poised to take action. Other options being considered include doing nothing or putting limits on uranium from specific countries, one of the people said.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met with Trump on Thursday, was expected to make the case against import quotas on uranium, which his country produces.The Trump administration was asked by the two domestic uranium producers to impose a 25% domestic market quota on the grounds imports of uranium are a threat to national security. Wide Latitude A finding that the imports of uranium are harming U.S. national security gives Trump wide latitude to impose a trade remedy of his choosing -- or do nothing at all -- using the same trade law the administration has successfully used to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.While the domestic uranium producers, both of which are based in Colorado, initially asked the administration for a 25% quota, a lower amount could be a compromise that he utilities and the producers could live with, analysts have said.Nuclear utilities, which have estimated a 25% quota could cost them as much as $800 million annually, remain hopeful Trump will decide against any trade action.“President Trump is a longstanding champion for the U.S. nuclear industry, rightly recognizing the enormous economic and energy benefits that U.S. nuclear power delivers to American consumers,” said the Ad Hoc Utilities Group, which counts Exelon Corp., Duke Energy Corp., and Dominion Energy Inc. as members. “The U.S. nuclear industry supports 100,000 jobs while the two petitioners support a total of 150 jobs.” Australia, RussiaCurrently, the nuclear power industry gets nearly all of its uranium from sources such as Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, and Russia.The U.S. uranium industry produced roughly 700,000 pounds in 2018, according to Chris Gadomski, a nuclear industry analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. A 5% quota would translate to between 2 million and 2.5 million pounds, he said.The two miners who petitioned for the case have already begun expanding their mines in anticipation of a favorable decision.Executives from both companies said in a statement they were pleased “the administration continues to recognize the unique national, energy and economic security role of domestic uranium production.”“We continue to believe that reserving 25% of domestic demand for U.S. uranium is the most effective tool for sustaining domestic production of this critical mineral,” they said.

2019-06-27,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Solicitor General has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the fight to build a natural gas pipeline across sections of the scenic Appalachian Trail.Noel Francisco, representing the government, asked the top court in a filing Tuesday to review a decision by Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that vacated permits for Dominion Energy Inc.’s $7.5 billion Atlantic Coast pipeline.Atlantic Coast, which has seen its start date delayed and its price tag balloon, is one of several pipelines proposed for the eastern U.S. facing legal setbacks and opposition from environmental groups. EQM Midstream Partners LP also had work stopped on its Mountain Valley line and last year boosted the project’s cost estimate to $4.6 billion.The December appeals court ruling said the U.S. Forest Service violated the National Forest Management Act when it granted permits for the pipeline and that the agency lacked the authority to make the decision. The solicitor general argued in the filing Tuesday that the appeals court misread the National Trails System Act.Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion, which is developing Atlantic Coast with Duke Energy Corp. and Southern Co., has stuck to the plan despite the setbacks, saying the embattled pipeline is its cheapest option to carry gas from the Marcellus Shale basin to customers in the Southeast.&#92;--With assistance from Mark Chediak, Peter Blumberg and Greg Stohr.To contact the reporter on this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi in Singapore at ralrikabi@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Aaron ClarkFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Seeks Supreme Court Hearing on Atlantic Coast Pipeline Plan

2019-10-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Dominion Energy Inc., the U.S. utility giant that came under fire for overcharging its customers by almost $380 million, wants to keep the money and spend it on grid upgrades.The Virginia power company proposed using some of the extra cash to help install almost a million smart meters, create an online “customer information platform” and add more devices to the grid that could help prevent blackouts. It’s part of a plan that the state rejected in January, calling it too costly. The utility on Monday came back with a more modest proposal and a smaller price tag of $594 million, down from more than $1 billion.It’s the latest twist in the saga over Dominion’s massive overcharges in 2017 and 2018, which were flagged in a Virginia state report in August. Infuriated consumer advocates have called on the company to return the money to no avail, and one ratepayer group staged a “Rally for Our Refunds” in Richmond three weeks ago.Like most power companies, Dominion is only allowed to earn a certain amount. Some utilities have returned extra cash to customers in the past if earnings exceed the threshold. The latest fight in Virginia is centered on a state law passed last year that allows electricity providers to keep some excess profits so long as they re-invest the money in renewable projects or grid upgrades.Dominion has already said it plans to spend some of the funds on an offshore wind demonstration project, which broke ground this summer. “What a great way to fund the first utility offshore wind project -- to be able to do it without having a rate increase,” Thomas Wohlfarth, Dominion’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a phone interview.Using the company’s over-earnings to pay for such projects will limit rate hikes and cut down on financing costs, saving money for customers in the long run, he said.There is a hitch: Under the new law, Virginia’s first review of utilities’ excess earnings will cover a four-year period. So if Dominion doesn’t earn as much in the next two years as it did in the last two, there’s a chance the extra cash it has overcollected shrinks or disappears altogether, wiping out the money it’s proposing to set aside for grid improvements and renewable power.“The two-year look is not the final story,” Wohlfarth said. “We have to see what happens in the next two years.”Analysts attributed much of Dominion’s excess income to warmer-than-normal weather in Virginia last year, which led to stronger electricity sales. The state report showed that the money came from Dominion’s power-generation business, rather than its distribution system.“If the weather is warmer than normal and you sell more electricity than normal, you’re going to overearn,” said Charles Fishman, a utilities analyst at Morningstar Inc.Shares of the company climbed 0.2% to close at $81.22. They have risen about 14% in 2019.Dominion’s $594 million grid plan will need approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The company is proposing to cover about half of the cost with some of the extra cash and recover the rest through customer rates. The program would help deploy the customer platform and smart meters through 2021.(Adds utility executive quote and funding details starting in the fifth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: David R.

2019-10-04,The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by Dominion Energy Inc and President Donald Trump's administration of a lower court ruling that halted construction on a $7.5 billion natural gas pipeline due to run underneath a section of the popular Appalachian Trail in rural Virginia.  The administration and companies involved in the project have asked the justices to overturn a ruling that found that the U.S. Forest Service lacked the authority to grant a right of way for the pipeline.,UPDATE 3-U.S. Supreme Court takes up fight over $7.5 billion natural gas pipeline
2019-10-04,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will consider jump-starting Dominion Energy Inc.’s proposed $7.5 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, agreeing to rule on a key permit that would let the natural-gas line cross under the Appalachian Trail.A federal appeals court threw out the permit, saying the U.S. Forest Service lacked the authority to approve the right-of-way. Lawyers for the pipeline and the Trump administration say the lower court ruling threatens the 600-mile (965 kilometer) project’s viability.The appeals court “has effectively erected a 2,200-mile barrier severing the eastern seaboard from oil and gas sources west of the Appalachian Trail,” Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC argued in its appeal. The case will also affect EQM Midstream Partners LP’s planned $4.6 billion Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia.Dominion shares rose as much as 2.7%, making it the fourth-best performer on the S&P 500. EQM Midstream Partners climbed as much as 4.8%.The decision to hear the case is a boost for a project that has been beset by years of delays and cost overruns. The pipeline is one of a series of oil and gas projects that have stalled amid staunch opposition from environmentalists and landowners.The Supreme Court’s action Friday is a “favorable indicator” that the lower court’s decision was wrong, Brandon Barnes, a senior litigation analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a research note.The justices will hear arguments early next year and rule by early July.The environmental groups challenging the permit, led by the Cowpasture River Preservation Association, urged the Supreme Court not to hear the case, saying the companies were exaggerating the impact of the 4th Circuit ruling.The groups pointed to statements by Dominion officials expressing confidence they could work around the decision -- and proceed with the pipeline -- even if the Supreme Court didn’t intervene. Mountain Valley has said it’s exploring a land swap to get around the legal hurdles.Dominion is developing the pipeline with Duke Energy Corp. and Southern Co. Atlantic Coast would carry as much as 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Marcellus shale basin in West Virginia to customers in North Carolina and Virginia. The pipeline company says it will save consumers $377 million a year.Under the original proposal, a 0.1-mile segment would cross under the hiking trail at a depth of more than 600 feet. The exit and entry points wouldn’t be visible from the trail, according to the Trump administration.The 4th Circuit said the U.S. Mineral Leasing Act doesn’t let the Forest Service authorize that segment. The law excludes land that’s part of the National Park System from the Forest Service’s jurisdiction. The environmental groups say that was the right conclusion.“Because ACP seeks to cross the trail on an area of federal land in the National Park System, the MLA provides no authority for that right-of-way,” the groups argued.The Trump administration says that, while the National Park Service manages the Appalachian Trial, the underlying land for the proposed pipeline is part of a national forest -- putting it within the Forest Service’s purview. U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the justices the lower court ruling would upend a long-settled understanding of the Forest Service’s authority.The ruling “casts doubt on the Forest Service’s previously unquestioned authority to grant permits and other types of land use authorizations for power lines, communications sites, water facilities, and roads that cross the Appalachian Trail within national forests,” the administration argued.56 PipelinesThe Appalachian Trail, which runs from Maine to Georgia, was completed in 1937. It’s the world’s longest hiking-only footpath, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, based in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, which works to protect and maintain the trail.Atlantic Coast says 56 pipelines already cross the trail, some of them on Forest Service land.“The Appalachian Trail has never been understood to constitute an impediment to pipeline construction,” Atlantic Coast argued.But the environmental groups say none of those were authorized under similar circumstances. Some are on state or private land, while others predate the congressional designation of the Appalachian Trail, the groups say.“In the 51 years since Congress designated the Appalachian Trail, the Forest Service had never granted a new right-of-way to an oil or gas pipeline to cross the trail in a national forest,” the groups argued.The cases are United States Forest Service v. Cowpasture River Preservation Association, 18-1584, and Atlantic Coast Pipeline v. Cowpasture River Preservation Association, 18-1587.(Adds delays and opposition in fifth paragraph; an earlier version corrected the year the court will hear arguments in seventh paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Joe Ryan.To contact the reporter on this story: Greg Stohr in Washington at gstohr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Asséo, Ros KrasnyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Dominion’s Atlantic Coast Gas Pipeline Gets High Court Hearing

2019-12-13,"Few investors have realized better sustained profits than George Soros. His hedge fund’s annualized returns exceeded 30% for over 30 years, and made him one of the world’s richest men. He gained fame in 1992 when he made a famous bet against the Pound Sterling and generated over $1 billion in profits in just 24 hours. While his political activities have generated controversy and criticism, no one can doubt his financial acumen.He bases that acumen on a simple aphorism: “If investing is entertaining, if you’re having fun, you’re probably not making any money. Good investing is boring.” He means, of course, that the most reliable stocks are the ones least likely to make waves in the markets or headlines in the news. So, don’t expect to find anything exciting in his firm’s $3.6 billion worth of 13F securities – but do expect to find solid returns and reliable dividends. After all, that’s where the profit is.To find out just how good that profit can get, we’ve taken three of Soros’ big dividend moves and looked them up in the TipRanks database. These are investments that the Stock Screener tool reveals as ‘Buy’ rated and, more importantly, all three offer robust dividend yields, between 4% and 11%. The average dividend yield of the S&P-listed stocks is just about 2%, so Soros’ choices start at double that – and work their way up.BP (BP)Up first is BP, the world’s sixth largest oil and gas company. The company’s revenues in calendar year 2018 totaled $303.7 billion, and gave a net profit of $9.6 billion. BP has had some trouble maintaining that sort of performance in 2019, however. In the Q3 earnings release, the company reported $2.3 billion in profits, a 17% decline sequentially and a 39% drop year-over-year.The drop in profits comes on the heels of declining oil prices. Brent crude, the global benchmark price on the oil markets, is down 12.7% from its peak in April of this year. There are subtleties in pricing, however. BP’s quarterly earnings reflect the generally low oil prices, but those same oil prices have been trending slightly upwards since October – and BP’s Q3 numbers did beat the analysts’ expectations. Among the headwinds the company faces is a CEO transition, as current head Bob Dudley will be stepping down this coming March. He will be followed by the company’s upstream chief. The promotion from within promises continuity despite the upper level churn.So, BP is a stock that is weathering a down time in commodity prices, with the resources to wait out a low-price regime. That’s a good position for a company to hold. Even better, for investors, the company has maintained its dividend. The quarterly payment has been set at 61 cents for the last six quarters, and the was 60 cents prior to that. The annualized dividend of $2.44 gives a yield of 6.67%, more than triple the S&P average. At 92%, the payout ratio, while high, is sustainable long-term.With a background like that, it’s no wonder that Soros moved heavily into BP in Q3. The stock offers a solid industry position, a reliable dividend, and a clear path for future profits. Soros’ purchase of BP marked a new position, of 270,000 shares for his fund. At today’s prices, those shares are worth nearly $10 million.Wall Street is upbeat about BP prospects. Setting that tone is BMO analyst Daniel Boyd, who writes, “We think BP is turning a corner after years flagging financial performance driven in part by oil-spill payments that are dropping off. We expect strong production and cashflow growth, enabled by high margin projects, to fuel dividend growth and improved returns.”Boyd’s Buy rating is backed up by a $53 price target, suggesting a strong upside of 43%. (To watch Boyd’s track record, click here)BP shares have received three recent Buy ratings, giving the stock a unanimous ‘Strong Buy’ from the analyst consensus. The average price target stands tall at $51.33 -- indicating a robust upside potential of 39%. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks)Dominion Energy (D)BP wasn’t the only energy industry company that Soros was interested in. The master investor also made a large entry purchase in Dominion Energy, a power company based in Richmond, Virginia. Dominion is a major supplier of electricity in Virginia and the Carolinas, and also supplies natural gas to customers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia.Utilities are a profitable business. Dominion’s earnings in Q3 2019 came in at $1.18 per share, beating the estimates by 1.7%, and beating the year-ago number by 2.6%. Revenues were up more than 23% year-over-year, but missed the Q3 forecast by 3%.Dominion is due to pay out its next dividend on December 20. The payment, of 92 cents, annualizes to $3.67, giving a solid yield of 4.54%. The company has a 10-year history of committing to its dividend payment, and has been raising it annually for the last three years. Dominion has proven itself a reliable dividend stock.Long-term reliability of return likely drew in Soros, who purchased 150,000 D shares in Q3. His purchase is now worth over $12 million. Like BP, this was a new position for Soros, signaling an interest in the energy industry.Wolfe analyst Steve Fleishman takes a bullish stance on Dominion. Writing on the stock this week, he said, “Dominion has a balanced strategy, combining high-growth electric and gas utility operations with heavily contracted gas pipeline and LNG export assets. The company has done a good job de-risking the earnings mix and balance sheet, and we see it as attractive at current levels…”Fleishman gives D shares a ‘Buy’ rating with a $90 price target. His target indicates confidence, and about 12% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Fleishman’s track record, click here)Wall Street is evenly split right now on Dominion, with the analysts giving the stock 4 Buys and 4 Holds. The stock is trading for $80.69, and the $87.57 average price target implies a premium of 8.5% from the trading price. (See Dominion stock analysis on TipRanks)Annaly Capital Management (NLY)Turning away from the energy industry, we come to a stock in which Soros had already held a position. In the third quarter, the billionaire added over 1.15 million shares to his exiting holding in Annaly Capital Management, a substantial increase of 49%. The company is a real estate investment trust, and one of the largest in the US.Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are companies that own and manage combinations of residential or commercial properties, or invest in the loans and mortgages used to fund those properties. Annaly invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities, and holds some $133 billion worth of assets in its portfolio.For dividend investors, whether small-scale or billionaire hedge gurus, the stock is an obvious target. US tax code regulations require REITs to return as much as 90% of their income directly to shareholders, which is usually done in the form of dividends. For income investors, this is a boon. Stocks like NLY generally have dividend payout ratios that start at 85%; in Q3, NLY’s ratio was just over 100%, meaning all of the company’s income was sent back to investors. The current dividend, paid out quarterly at 25 cents per share, annualizes to a yield exceeding 10%.The high dividend makes up for slipping share value, helping to keep investors interested in NLY even though the stock has slipped 4.8% this year. As noted above, Soros’ interest in the company is substantial – and his total holding in the stock, of 3.517 million shares, is worth $32.88 million.4-star Barclays analyst Mark Devries lays out a clear thesis for investing in Annaly: “NLY's diversification into non-Agency and commercial real estate investments are initiatives that could generate attractive returns longer term. We like Agency focused Mortgage REITs at this point in the cycle given their defensive nature and ability to outperform in a bear market for equities.”Devries puts a $10 price target and a Buy rating on this stock. His target suggests a 7% upside to the stock – not spectacular, but still profitable. (To watch Devries’ track record, click here)Wall Street’s analyst give approval to NLY by a 3 to 1 advantage, putting a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock. The average price target, $9.69, implies a modest upside of 4% from the $9.35 share price. From an investor’s perspective, the high yielding dividend here is more attractive than the shares’ appreciation potential.

Yes, the stocks rise and the companies grow, but some of that cash for expansion is returned to shareholders on a regular basis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome industries are famous for their income -- real estate investment trusts, utilities, master limited partnerships.

Dividend Stocks to Buy: Southern Company (SO)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.6%Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is the second largest utility in the U.S. It runs the power companies for Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama. It also has extensive natural gas operations up and down the East Coast.It's the only utility in the U.S. that is building a new nuclear facility. Then its project management partner and nuke builder Westinghouse went bankrupt. That meant Southern had to take over the entire project.And it has done well. While the completion date has been pushed to 2021 or 2022, things are moving along on schedule.On the growth side, its massive natural gas distribution business as well as its renewable energy business are doing very well. And it's one of the best-run utilities out there.With a 3.6% dividend and 12-month return of 46%, SO stock is a rock-solid pick for any portfolio. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.4%Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has been in business since 1837.Wrap your head around that. It has been around for more than 150 years. Martin Van Buren was president when PG launched in Ohio. J. P. Morgan was born that year. There were still border wars with First Nation tribes.When you have been around that long, it means you're doing something right from the boardroom down to the products.Now, there have been some challenges of late, as new generations of less brand-conscious consumers have hit the markets and PG had to readjust its product portfolio.But it is finally through that transition. PG has raised its dividend every year for the past 60 years. That is an accomplishment few stocks can make. And it's that kind of focus on shareholder value that makes this unique.  * The 7 Stocks That Cautious Investors Should Sell Now The 2.4% dividend may not be huge, but it's consistent. And its 33% stock gain in the last year is also a nice kicker. However, if you do also want growth in your portfolio, there are better places to find it going forward.

Some firms even lease apartments and allow their employees to use them if they're in town on long-term assignments.That makes these cities' real estate needs unique. And that is a good thing for a niche player like EQR. It can keep its occupancy rate high, as well as its rates, because it offers top locations and quality accommodations in strategic cities.Now that prices in many of these cities have become incredibly expensive, renting has also become a real option for residents that want, and can afford, the convenience of downtown locations.The stock is up 18% in the past year and has a solid 2.7% dividend.

But this is a growing, dynamic company that is well positioned for the future of defense and security in the U.S. and beyond.It has a storied history that stretches back to 1969. And it has been a private contracting institution since its early days. It has worked on some of the biggest scientific challenges the U.S. government has come up against in the past 50 years.And now, it is focused on aerospace technologies. A recent $1.7 billion merger with aerospace firm Dynetics was announced just a month ago.This put LDOS in prime position for all the space work that is heating up both on the government side -- the Space Force -- and the private side -- the big defense contractors that build the equipment for the government.As a smaller player in the aerospace and defense sector, it can leverage its growth because it is more concentrated.But given the fact that all the major industrial powers now have active aerospace programs, this is the next frontier. And LDOS is already a reliable partner.And while the dividend isn't a big driver, the fact the stock is up 80% in the past year yet sits at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22 means that growth is just beginning.

2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Bonnie Rippingille looked out at the wisps of steam curling from the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant across Biscayne Bay with a sense of dread. In December federal regulators approved Florida Power & Light Co.’s request to let the facility’s twin nuclear reactors remain in operation for another 20 years beyond the end of their current licenses. By that point they’ll be 80, making them the oldest reactors in operation anywhere in the world.“That’s too old,” said Rippingille, a lawyer and retired Miami-Dade County judge who was wearing a blue print shirt with white sea turtles on it. “They weren’t designed for this purpose.”With backing from the Trump administration, utilities across the nation are preparing to follow suit, seeking permission to extend the life of reactors built in the 1970s to the 2050s as they run up against the end of their 60-year licenses.Read More: Nuclear Reactors Could Run as Long as 80 Years Under Trump Plan“We are talking about running machines that were designed in the 1960s, constructed in the 1970s and have been operating under the most extreme radioactive and thermal conditions imaginable,” said Damon Moglen, an official with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “There is no other country in the world that is thinking about operating reactors in the 60 to 80-year time frame.”Indeed, the move comes as other nations shift away from atomic power over safety concerns, despite its appeal as a carbon-free alternative to coal and other fossil fuels. Japan, which used to get more than a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power, shut down all its plants in 2011 after a tsunami caused a nuclear meltdown at three reactors in Fukushima. Only a handful have restarted while others that can’t meet stringent new standards are slated to close permanently. Germany decided that year to shutter its entire fleet by 2022 and is now having trouble meeting its ambitious climate goals. Other nations such as France and Sweden are allowing reactors to retire while they diversify into solar and wind power.By contrast, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is poised to decide this year on requests by subsidiaries of Exelon Corp. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at its Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, about 100 miles from Washington, and Dominion Energy Inc. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at a power plant in Surry, Virginia.Dominion has notified the commission it intends to ask permission to extend the life of two more reactors north of Richmond, Virginia. Duke Energy Corp. has said it plans to seek license extensions for its entire fleet of 11 nuclear reactors, starting with three in Seneca, South Carolina.“There are economic benefits,” said Rounette Nader, Duke’s director of nuclear license renewal. “Continuing to operate our existing nuclear fleet is cheaper than replacing it.”The nuclear industry has been buffeted by a wave of early reactor retirements in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and subsidized renewable power. Constructing a new nuclear plant—the only one being built in the U.S. is years behind schedule and over budget—can cost billions of dollars. Retrofitting an existing one is more likely to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars range.Read More: America to Decide Whether a Nuke Can Outlive a Human “It just makes sense,” said Maria Korsnick, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a Washington-based trade group that represents nuclear utilities. “I don’t think you should look at a plant just on calendar years, but rather the way that plant has been maintained, so many components have been replaced over the years. There is nothing magic about 80.”Critics such as Edwin Lyman, a nuclear energy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, argue that older plants contain “structures that can’t be replaced or repaired,” including the garage-sized steel reactor vessels that contain tons of nuclear fuel and can grow brittle after years of being bombarded by radioactive neutrons. “They just get older and older,” he said. If the vessel gets brittle, it becomes vulnerable to cracking or even catastrophic failure. That risk increases if it’s cooled down too rapidly—say in the case of a disaster, when cold water must be injected into the core to prevent a meltdown.Other concerns surround the durability of components such as concrete and electric cables, but an advisory board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent government agency that gave Turkey Point the green light to operate into the 2050s, said those risks could be managed safely “without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.”The commission’s decision doesn’t sit well with Philip Stoddard, a bespectacled biology professor who serves as the mayor of South Miami, a city of 13,000 on about 18 miles away from the Turkey Point plant. He keeps a store of potassium iodide, used to prevent thyroid cancer, large enough to provide for every child in his city should the need arise.“You’ve got hurricanes, you’ve got storm surge, you’ve got increasing risks of hurricanes and storm surge,” said Stoddard, 62, from the corner office in a biology building on Florida International University’s palm-tree lined campus. All of this not only increases the likelihood of a nuclear disaster, it also complicates a potential evacuation, which could put even more lives at risk. “Imagine being in a radiation cloud in your car and you’re sitting there running out of gas because you’re in a parking lot in the freeway,” he said.Gabriel Ignetti, a 72-year-old Miami resident and retired music teacher, views nuclear power as a lesser evil than climate change and welcomes extending the life of the plant. “We have a climate emergency,” he said, “and if you have a climate emergency you can’t say we are not going to use that tool.”That’s a point backers also highlight to make the case for extending the lives of nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy provides about 20% of the nation’s electricity and about 55% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Climate change is also one of the main cases against extending the life of Turkey Point, said Kelly Cox, the general counsel for Miami Waterkeeper, a six-person environmental group that has joined with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Friends of the Earth to challenge the NRC’s approval in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. New data show sea level rise in the area reach as high as 4.5 feet by 2070, but regulators from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission didn’t take those updated figures into account, said Cox.“They are going to be flooded,” Cox said. “If we are relicensing a major utility we need to be preparing for the impacts of sea level rise.”Scott Burnell, a NRC spokesman, said the agency’s review process did take into account the most recent information available on sea level rise, but that “the projected rate of sea level rise and associated revisions in flood hazard are slow enough that the plants will have ample time to appropriately analyze and address possible future effects.”Read More: U.S. Nuclear Power Plants Weren’t Built for Climate ChangeOther concerns exist about the condition of the plant’s unlined earthen cooling canals, a unique system that sprawls over nearly six thousand acres. Salty water from the canals is leaking underground toward the Biscayne aquifer, the source of drinking water for about 3 million Floridians, at a rate of about a foot a day, Cox said.Peter Robbins, a spokesman for Florida Power & Light Co., a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc., said the utility is addressing that problem using a series of pumps to decrease the salinity in the cooling canals. The main power plant and its critical component are elevated 20 feet above sea level and are protected by concrete and reinforced buildings designed to withstand hurricanes and floods.“At the end of the day it’s a very clean, reliable source of electricity,” Robbins said. “More than anything we think this is a win for our customers. It helps keep their reliability high, it helps keep their bills low, and there are no greenhouse gases as part of nuclear.”In the city of Homestead, not far from the Turkey Point plant, Brian Goodwin, a burly 52-year-old farmer, said he didn’t believe in climate change, but supports the reactors’ extension nonetheless. “I hope they build another one,” said Goodwin. “It’s good clean power.”(Updates location of the challenge petition in the 17th paragraph; corrects Edwin Lyman’s name in the 11th paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Ari Natter in Washington at anatter5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanJillian GoodmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The U.S. May Soon Have the World's Oldest Nuclear Power Plants

2020-02-24,"A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday seemed inclined to find that the federal government had authority to grant a right of way for a proposed $7.5 billion natural gas pipeline to cross under the popular Appalachian Trail in rural Virginia.  The nine justices heard a one-hour argument in appeals brought by Dominion Energy Inc and President Donald Trump's administration of a lower court ruling that halted construction of the 600-mile (965-km) Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which would run from West Virginia to North Carolina.  Questions asked by several justices suggested the court will overturn the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which found in its 2018 decision that the U.S. Forest Service lacked the authority to grant a right of way for the pipeline.",U.S. Supreme Court leans toward $7.5 billion pipeline in trail dispute
2020-02-24,"(Bloomberg) -- A majority of U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed supportive of a crucial permit for Dominion Energy Inc.’s planned $8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, suggesting the Forest Service acted lawfully by clearing the natural-gas line to cross under the Appalachian Trail.In an hour-long argument in Washington Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts said the position taken by environmental groups opposed to the pipeline would “erect an impermeable barrier” along the 2,200-mile (3540-kilometer) trail, separating consumers on the eastern seaboard from inland energy resources.A ruling in Dominion’s favor would eliminate the biggest obstacle to the 600-mile pipeline, which would carry as much as 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas per day from the Marcellus shale basin in West Virginia to customers in North Carolina and Virginia.Without the permit, “the whole enterprise is done,” Justice Department lawyer Anthony Yang told the court Monday. President Donald Trump’s administration is backing Dominion, challenging a federal appeals court ruling that tossed out the permit.Dominion, which is developing the pipeline with Duke Energy Corp., says it expects to begin construction by mid-year and complete it by the end of 2021. The company is still facing a pending administrative review of other environmental issues.The case will also affect EQM Midstream Partners LP’s Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia. Mountain Valley told the Supreme Court in December that the appeals court ruling forced a halt to its project, which is 90% complete at a cost of more than $4.3 billion.The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Forest Service lacked authority to issue the Atlantic Coast permit because the Appalachian Trail is controlled by the National Park Service. The U.S. Mineral Leasing Act says the Forest Service doesn’t have jurisdiction over “lands in the National Park System.”Dominion and the Trump administration contend that while the National Park Service manages the Appalachian Trail, the underlying land is part of a national forest -- putting it within the Forest Service’s jurisdiction.Justice Elena Kagan called that “a difficult distinction to wrap one’s head around.”“When you walk on the trail, when you bike on the trail, when you backpack on the trail, you’re backpacking and biking and walking on land, aren’t you?” she asked Yang.But Roberts likened the trail to an easement, in which one entity owns the underlying land but others have the right to walk along it in certain places.This “doesn’t strike me as that unusual a concept, that there are property rights that are distinct from rights in the land” the chief justice said.Below the TrailOther justices focused on the placement of the pipeline well below the trail.“When I think of a pipeline that is 600 feet below the surface, that doesn’t seem like a trail,” Justice Samuel Alito said. “So instead of having to draw this distinction between the trail and the land, why can’t we just say that the trail is on the surface and something that happens 600 feet below the surface is not the trail?”Michael Kellogg, the lawyer for the environmental groups, said that approach couldn’t be squared with the wording of federal law. Kellogg pointed to a provision that says the Interior Department, which houses the Park Service, has the authority to grant rights-of-way “upon, over, under, across or along” the Appalachian Trail.Justice Stephen Breyer said he worried about the implications of Kellogg’s position.“If you’re saying it goes down to the center of the earth, then there are all kinds of things some other Congress might do,” Breyer said. “This land belongs to the federal government down to the center of the earth.”Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s lawyer, Paul Clement, urged the justices to issue a broad ruling that would apply even if a pipeline were not so far below the surface. But he added: “It’s not my job to resist winning this case on a narrow ground, so I’m not going to do that.”The argument was a positive one for the pipeline, Washington-based ClearView Energy Partners told its clients in a note. “We like its chances with the Supreme Court,” the note said.Longest FootpathThe trail, completed in 1937, is the world’s longest hiking-only footpath, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, which works to protect and maintain it.Atlantic Coast says more than 50 pipelines already cross the trail, some of them on Forest Service land. But the environmental groups say none of those were authorized under similar circumstances. Some are on state or private land, while others predate the 1968 congressional designation of the Appalachian Trail.The case is to some degree a proxy for a broader fight over the nation’s energy policy. Business groups are backing the pipeline, as are unions that would benefit from the thousands of jobs it would create. Local property owners are joining environmental advocates in seeking to block the project.The Appalachian region, which includes the Marcellus shale basin, is practically drowning in natural gas. Pipelines like Atlantic Coast have been proposed as a way to shuttle fuel out of gas fields and toward demand centers in the southeastern U.S., where it can be used for heating and cooking as well as to generate electricity.Opponents question the need for new gas infrastructure, pointing to slowing demand in the years since the project was announced in 2014. Environmental groups say natural gas pipelines further America’s dependence on fossil fuels at a time when climate change demands a complete shift to renewable sources of energy.The cases are United States Forest Service v. Cowpasture River Preservation Association, 18-1584, and Atlantic Coast Pipeline v. Cowpasture River Preservation Association, 18-1587.(Updates with excerpts from argument starting in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Rachel Adams-Heard and Stephen Cunningham.To contact the reporter on this story: Greg Stohr in Washington at gstohr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie AsséoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Supreme Court Seems Ready to Back Atlantic Coast Pipeline Permit

2020-03-27,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. utilities have lined up more than $15 billion in cash and credit as uncertainty over the coronavirus strains the short-term debt market.Electricity giants including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc. have sold bonds, entered into new credit facilities or drawn on existing lines to boost liquidity. It follows a surge in costs in the commercial paper market, forcing companies to look for alternatives.“We expect to continue to see utilities drawing on credit lines,” Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said in a research note, citing AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement announced Monday. The move is a conservative stance to shore up funds, he said. “We do not see it in any way a sign of overall liquidity risk.”Utilities have also benefited from their defensive nature to issue new debt as the corporate bond market has been open mostly to the highest-quality investment-grade issuers. Banks have enjoyed similar status in comprising much of the recent supply, as well as frequent telecom and media issuers including Verizon Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp.New York utility Consolidated Edison Inc was the latest to tap the credit market with two bond offerings Thursday totaling $1.6 billion. That’s pushed the total amount sold by power and gas suppliers this month to about $9.6 billion, adding to at least $6 billion in new credit lines with banks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Xcel Energy Inc. is also seeking to sell $500 million in notes.It has come at a higher cost, as the coronavirus sell-off has sent bond prices down. NextEra Energy Inc.’s $1.1 billion sale of five-year notes Tuesday, through its Florida Power & Light subsidiary, priced at 237.5 basis points over comparable Treasuries. That’s more than twice as much as the company agreed to pay in a similar deal a year ago.NextEra declined to comment.Duke was still able to lock in record-low rates in a sale of $550 million in 30-year notes. Last week the company announced it had a new $1.5 billion term loan and borrowed $500 million from an existing line.“The majority of the funding will be used to reduce our commercial paper balances,” spokesman Neil Nissan said by email. “When the short-term funding markets return to a more stable environment, we may elect to rely on commercial paper like normal.”Other deals include AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement, which the company will use in part to pay down short-term debt. “We took these actions to fortify our liquidity in the challenging markets,” AEP spokeswoman Melissa McHenry said by email. The company earlier this month also raised almost $1.2 billion through bond offerings.Dominion tapped $1.2 billion in new bank lines while selling $750 million in notes last week, although the bonds were already part of its 2020 financing plans, spokesman Ryan Frazier said.“Yet given market volatility, Dominion Energy has taken prudent steps to increase liquidity via other financing transactions,” he said, noting that Dominion has no plans to drawn on its $6 billion master credit facility.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Utilities Line Up Over $15 Billion as Virus Roils Markets

2020-05-11,"(Bloomberg) -- WEC Energy Group Inc. and OGE Energy Corp. may face the utility industry’s steepest hits to earnings as unpaid customer bills pile up, according to a research report.The Milwaukee-based utility’s pre-tax income may slide as much as 3.7%, Hugh Wynne and Eric Selmon, analysts with the investment research company SSR LLC, wrote Monday. They warn that the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic may drive uncollected electric and natural gas bills to the highest in two decades.Other utilities that may face a significant drag on earnings include Oklahoma-based OGE, with an estimated 3% decline, Avangrid Inc.with a 2.9% drop and Dominion Energy with a 2.8% fall.With millions of people out of work, many utilities have stopped disconnecting customers for failing to pay bills. While certain states allow utilities to recover the cost of unpaid bills through additional charges, utility cash flows will suffer until the rate increases go into effect, the analysts said. In addition, eleven states including Wisconsin are allowing utilities to track Covid-19 expenses, they said.Annual changes in unemployment rates account for about 39% of the increase in uncollected electric bills and 45% of gas bills, according to the report. U.S. unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression, as shelter-in-place orders forced businesses to shed millions of workers.WEC Energy said that under current regulations, the company can recover bad debt expenses and is working with regulators and stakeholders to track bills for future recovery. The company is also working with federal and state governments to help customers manage their bills. OGE, Avangrid and Dominion didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Regulators are letting utilities defer virus-related expenses including those from non-payments for future potential recovery, WEC Chairman Gale E. Klappa said during an earnings call last week.Dominion can recover the costs of lapsed collections over time for nearly all of its gas utilities.

That's just about exactly in line with the same quarter of the previous year, when Duke's net income was $900 million.

2020-06-05,"This market has been on a tear. If, as the old saying goes, bull markets climb a wall of worry, this one has leapt that wall in a single bound.Now, maybe with all the Federal Reserve support and the trillions of dollars in stimulus approved by Congress this will continue.But there are also 40 million people out of work and the economy is in a recession that goes far beyond America's shores.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're an investor looking for opportunity but would also like sleep-at-night safety, or would like to go on holiday without looking at your portfolio every few hours, then utilities are a good place to start.For many electric utilities, they have both regulated and unregulated operations. That means one part of the operation provides a solid foundation of conservative growth. And the other provides opportunity to sell energy at market prices, offering greater growth.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts Here are 7 utility stocks keeping the lights on below  * NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * American Water Works (NYSE:AWK)  * Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP)  * Algonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE:AQN)  * Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA)  * Atlantica Sustainable Technologies (NYSE:AY)These are well-established companies with long records of growth and safety. Between that and their traditionally strong dividend yields, that makes high-quality utilities a must-have for my Growth Investor buy list. Utility Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com This company is a prime example of what I was talking about in the intro. It operates FPL (Florida Power & Light), which is a regulated utility that serves southern Florida.And it is also the largest producer of wind and solar energy in the world.Its regulated business operates in high-growth, densely populated sector of the state, which means solid, reliable returns.And its unregulated business sells renewable energy across the US to other utilities and industry. They can use the renewable energy to offset their carbon emissions and they don't have to get into the renewables business. It's a model that more and more utilities are adopting.Also, renewables are more resilient as climactic events rise.The stock is up 26% in the past year and 7% year to date. The latter figure is bullish given the drop in industrial and commercial demand due to COVID-19 lockdowns. NEE has a 2.2% dividend. You can see why this is among my favorite Elite Dividend Payer stocks for my Growth Investor recommendations. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com Dominion is one of the biggest utilities on the East Coast. It is the main regulated utility in Virginia as well as parts of the Carolinas. Meanwhile, its natural gas business covers the aforementioned as well as West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Utah and Wyoming.D has a $72 billion market cap and a rock-solid business in Virginia, where there are significant corporate offices for defense contractors, telecommunications and internet firms. The point being, it has steady strong demand on both the consumer and commercial sides.Its unregulated business leans on its natural gas operations. It's one of a handful of companies that has both extensive natural gas distribution assets as well as an export facility.Exporting natural gas is a huge opportunity, since natural gas prices are triple (or higher) in European and Asian markets. D also has expanding renewable operations in and beyond its core service areas.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts The stock is up 12% in the past year, 3% year to date. But it has a generous and rock-solid 4.4% dividend. American Water Works (AWK)Source: Shutterstock AWK's roots go back to 1886 when it was operating as a utility in the US and Canada. And its journey to its current path has been somewhat circuitous but now it operates divisions in more than 46 states and serves 14 million customers.The story of the water business has changed over the years. It used to be that cities, towns or municipalities ran their own water companies. But over the past 3 decades that became increasingly expensive, since this isn't a core competency of many municipal governments.This was the precursor to the rise of water utilities that could operate these water systems for the governments at set rates, like any other utility. The utilities could do this because they could operate at scale and were focused on just one task. This has worked out very well for both AWK and the states it operates in.AWK also has contracts for military bases, which is a reliable source of income. Given the current challenges of water demand for commercial and consumer operations, AWK is in a growth market with a broad reach.The stock is up 13% in the past year and 8% year to date. It also has a 1.7% dividend. And I've got even better growth-and-income plays where that came from. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)Source: Shutterstock Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is a Canada-based company with properties around the world. Those properties include utilities, transport, energy and data infrastructure businesses. BIP has been operating for 105 years and is still going strong.Just this year it was in a bidding war with Australia-based Macquarie Infrastructure (NYSE:MIC) for telecom Cincinnati Bell (NYSE:CBB). In the end it lost out to MIC.However, the company has a diverse portfolio of assets, which means it can take advantage of opportunities in a number of different industries, given their economic cycle.The company is structured as a limited partnership, which means stockholders are treated a direct owners, and net income is distributed as a generous dividend. That dividend currently sits at 4.6%.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts The stock is up 10% in the past year, despite being off nearly 7% year to date. Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN)Source: Shutterstock Canadian firm Alqgonquin Power holds an interesting mix of assets. And while its name might not be familiar to most south of the border, AQN has operations in 12 U.S. states under its subsidiary Liberty Utilities.Liberty's operations range from operating sewer companies to gas, water and electric operations in select cities and districts. Many of the properties were acquired from companies looking to spin off smaller operations and those that weren't matching the larger focus of the company.AQN can operate these at smaller scales and still remain profitable. That's the kind of business model I look for in making Growth Investor picks. The company also is very involved in renewable energy efforts in Canada, including hydroelectric projects.AQN delivers an attractive 4.2% dividend and the stock is up 20% in the past 12 months, and 3% year to date. Ormat Technologies (ORA)Source: Shutterstock This unique company started in Israel in the mid-1960s. It developed a proprietary turbine that could convert geothermal or recovered energy (the heat generated by other equipment) into electricity.By the oil crisis in the '70s, the value of self-sufficient, renewable energy resources became a very popular concept.In the decades that followed, ORA installed geothermal systems in Israel, New Zealand, Iceland, Guatemala, Kenya and the U.S. Today, the company is headquartered in Nevada.Most renewable energy headlines go to solar or wind these days, but there is a growing demand for geothermal as well. ORA has a solar division as well, plus a technology that can separate oil from oil sands more efficiently than traditional processes.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts While it is an energy company, it doesn't operate as a utility, so its dividend isn't spectacular, sitting at 0.6%. ORA is up 15% in the past year, and off 5% year to date. But its technology is at the heart of where energy generation, and thus utility consumption, is going. Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure (AY)Source: Shutterstock Atlantica Sustainable is a UK-based firm that owns a diversified portfolio of energy assets around the world.From solar farms in Spain, the US, South Africa and the Sahara, to wind turbines in Peru to electrical grids in Chile, AY has operations that span a variety of sectors in a range of countries.Almost all of its contracts are dollar or euro based, which helps stabilize its income stream. And most projects are under contract for the next decade or longer. This allows the company to look for new projects and show that it can sustain the new opportunity costs.Launched in 2013, the company is relatively new to the game, but its renewables focus certainly makes it a strong play on growth in the overall sector. It has a $2.8 billion market cap, so it's growing well.The stock is up 23% in the past 12 months and 3% in year to date. But it also has a 5.9% dividend, which is certainly a nice kicker.Speaking of income and growth plays…Currently, my Portfolio Grader I used to find Growth Investor stocks is picking up plenty of buys in all kinds of sectors. One that I'm particularly excited about now is helping enable a major upgrade across the telecom industry, across the world. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your wireless internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has good fundamentals, too -- making it a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system now.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my investment report, The King of 5G &quot;Turbo Button&quot; Technology, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-06-15,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a crucial permit for Dominion Energy Inc.’s planned $8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, saying the Forest Service acted lawfully by clearing the natural-gas line to cross under the Appalachian Trail.The 7-2 ruling eliminates the biggest obstacle to the 600-mile (965-kilometer) pipeline, which would carry as much as 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas per day from the Marcellus shale basin in West Virginia to customers in North Carolina and Virginia.Dominion pared earlier losses and was trading up .26% at $83.42 at 11:40 a.m. in New York. EQM Midstream Partners LP, which will also benefit from the ruling, was up 16% at $22.57 at 11:41 a.m. in New York, after earlier rising as much as 19%. Equitrans Midstream Corp. climbed 15% to $9.27 after gaining as much as 18%.Dominion, which is developing the pipeline with Duke Energy Corp., has said it expects to begin construction this year and have the pipeline fully in service by early 2022. The company is still facing review of other environmental issues.Dominion didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.“Today’s decision is an affirmation for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and communities across our region that are depending on it for jobs, economic growth and clean energy,” Duke Energy said in a statement. “We look forward to resolving the remaining project permits.”A federal appeals court had thrown out the permit, saying the U.S. Forest Service lacked the authority to approve the right-of-way because the Appalachian Trail is controlled by the National Park Service.Dominion and the Trump administration contended that while the National Park Service manages the Appalachian Trail, the underlying land is part of a national forest -- putting it within the Forest Service’s jurisdiction. The U.S. Mineral Leasing Act says the Forest Service doesn’t have jurisdiction over “lands in the National Park System.”Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the court’s opinion. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Brandon Barnes said the court’s decision will allow the project to shift toward lining up permits from the Forest Service.“With a high court decision in hand, the project can expect the U.S. Forest Service to wrap up work on reissuing approvals voided by the lower court, which we think happens this summer,” Barnes said in a research note.The ruling also will help EQM’s Mountain Valley gas pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia. Mountain Valley told the Supreme Court in December that the appeals court ruling forced a halt to its project, which is 90% complete at a cost of more than $4.3 billion.The 2,200-mile (3540-kilometer) Appalachian Trail stretches from Georgia to Maine.The case is U.S. Forest Service v.

2020-06-26,"The stock market's wild swings over the past few months have some calling for a swift V-shaped recovery and others forecasting the start of a new bear market. Of course, it's impossible to know for certain who's correct, but it doesn't hurt to prepare for either eventuality by shoring up your portfolio with some defensive, bear market stocks.Any seasoned trader will tell you that a bear market is an opportunity. They tend to be shorter than bull markets, making them worth investing in if you can wait it out. With that said, there are plenty of risks that come along with a bear market.Perhaps the best strategy for bear market investors is to keep some powder dry to take advantage of opportunities. As the summer earnings season approaches, uncertainty will start to creep in. Second-quarter results will mark the first time investors have had something concrete to price stocks on since the March drop. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy to Ride the Post-Covid-19 Wave Encouraging data could lead the market into another rally. But worse-than-expected figures could cause another nosedive. With that in mind, investors prepping their portfolios for a prolonged bear market should pick up big, reliable names that can weather the storm. Here are five great bear market stocks to help get you started:  * CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)  * Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)  * Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Bear Market Stocks: CVS Health (CVS)Source: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com Healthcare is one industry that makes sense as a long-term play -- especially as the population ages. CVS stock and its peers could have some volatility ahead as the U.S. presidential election heats up and healthcare reform moves back into the headlines. But CVS is a unique take on the healthcare industry because the company has become a one-stop shop for all things healthcare. While that much control could raise questions, it also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs and put more focus on preventative care. The firm's acquisition of Aetna has given CVS a powerful insurance arm which it will presumably use to direct clients to its walk-in clinics. By directing more people to its HealthHub clinics, CVS will increase store traffic and potential sales as well. For that reason, CVS stock makes for one of the best bear market stocks because the firm will see the benefits of its Aetna acquisition materialize over the next year. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com When it comes to reliable, big-name stocks that will remain relevant in the long term, there is no better choice than Alphabet. The firm is best known for its Google search engine, but GOOG stock offers more than just an online advertising play.For now, that's the firm's bread and butter, something that will insulate Google throughout the duration of the pandemic. Advertisers have no choice but to reach customers via Google's search engine, so even if spending falls, Google is going to remain a top advertising choice.  * 5 Housing Stocks to Buy Before the Housing Market Bounces Back In the longer term, though, Alphabet's other business arms are what make this stock worth holding onto. From healthcare technology to autonomous driving, Alphabet stock has its finger on the pulse of the future. Teladoc Health (TDOC)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com The pandemic has accelerated several developing technology trends as it forced the world to adapt to doing pretty much everything from home. But no sector looks more promising in the post-pandemic reality than that of virtual healthcare. Teladoc Health is a virtual healthcare company that allows people to contact a doctor for a wide range of health concerns without ever leaving their homes. This kind of treatment was already on the rise before the novel coronavirus struck, but its services have seen a spike as people avoid high-risk transmission areas like doctors' offices. Plus, Teladoc claims it can reduce healthcare costs by 28%, meaning that even if coronavirus concerns are totally eliminated over the next six months, people will still have a reason to continue using virtual healthcare. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com Another good place to look for bear market stocks is in the utilities sector. Companies like Dominion Energy are worth holding throughout periods of economic downturn. Why? Because no matter what, people are going to do everything they can to keep the lights on. D stock has the benefit of reoccurring revenue. And this makes it much easier for management to plan accordingly for the years ahead. That kind of stability is hard to find at the best of times, let alone during a pandemic.  * 10 Stocks to Watch in the Second Half Dominion offers investors a 4.4% dividend yield, which should help make any market volatility more bearable. While that figure is unlikely to rise anytime soon, much of the firm's revenue comes from state-regulated utilities. That gives the company a lot of strength for the foreseeable future. Facebook (FB)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Facebook, alongside many of its Big Tech peers, has risen to all-time highs amid the pandemic. Admittedly that makes FB one of the riskier bear market stocks on this list. But starting to build up a position in Facebook is a wise long-term play because the company is on the verge of challenging e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at its own game.Facebook's new Shops platform has the potential to pose a real threat to Amazon in the coming years. It makes it easier for people to buy things without ever leaving the platform. Facebook and Instagram already help people discover products. But giving consumers an easier way to buy those products gives Facebook serious power.Facebook's privacy issues and ongoing criticism of the way it handles free speech are likely to continue driving volatility. That's especially true in the lead-up to November's election. However, FB stock is a buy-and-hold investment that will pay off for years to come.Laura Hoy has a finance degree from Duquesne University and has been writing about financial markets for the past eight years.

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the largest utilities in America is starting to turn its back on natural gas.Dominion Energy Inc., the second-biggest U.S. power company by market value, on Sunday said it’s selling substantially all of its gas pipeline and storage assets to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for $4 billion. It’s the largest deal announced this year to buy U.S. energy assets, according to Bloomberg data.In a separate statement, Dominion and its partner Duke Energy Corp. said they’re killing the controversial Atlantic Coast gas pipeline along the U.S. East Coast, citing ongoing delays and “cost uncertainty.”The moves come as utilities face increasing pressure from local governments, investors and environmentalists to quit fossil fuels. While long heralded as a cleaner alternative to coal and heating oil, gas is drawing stiff oppositions from left-leaning state lawmakers, making it increasingly difficult to build pipelines and other infrastructure.“Until these issues are resolved, the ability to satisfy the country’s energy needs will be significantly challenged,” Dominion Chief Executive Officer Thomas Farrell said on a call with analysts. “This trend, so deeply concerning for our country’s economic growth and energy security, is a new reality.”Read More: Grim Day for Pipelines Shows They’re Almost Impossible to BuildShares of Dominion, which also announced it’s cutting its dividend, fell 11% Monday, the most in more than three months. The company is taking $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion in pre-tax charges related to the canceled pipeline, it said in a filing.The push away from gas positions Dominion as more of a pure-play state-regulated utility at a time when oil and pipeline operators have lagged the broader market. In the last year, an index of pipeline companies has fallen 36%, while the S&P 500 Index has gained 4.7%.“Given the bend towards decarbonization efforts in the country, the move away from natural gas, and investor demand for more simplified utility structures, we believe this is absolutely the correct move for Dominion to make,” Guggenheim analysts led by Shahriar Pourreza said in a research note.Read More: Wall Street Falls Out of Love With Once-Coveted Fossil FuelTo be clear, Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion, which provides power and gas to seven million customers in 20 states, isn’t walking away from the fossil fuel altogether. It will still sell gas to customers for heating and cooking. It’s retaining an interest in its Cove Point liquefied natural gas export terminal in Maryland. And 40% of the electricity the company generates comes from plants fueled by gas, coal and oil, according to its website.“They’ll still be burning lots of gas for decades ahead in the core utility business,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kit Konolige said in an email.But pressure is mounting. Virginia enacted a law in April requiring Dominion’s utility in the state to be carbon-free by 2045.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Dominion’s unsurprising shutdown of the troubled Atlantic Coast Pipeline project and $4 billion sale of midstream properties take pressure off the strained balance sheet.

Williams Cos. opted not to reapply for a permit in May for a $1 billion pipeline extension after regulators in New York blocked it. And in February the Oklahoma-based company canceled plans for a pipeline that would have run from Appalachia to New York.While the Atlantic Coast pipeline project won a key victory last month when the U.S. Supreme Court sided against environmentalists and upheld a crucial permit, the project still faced formidable opposition and costs. “That would indicate that that wasn’t a strategic decision as much it was as a practical decision,” said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates LLC.Read More: Duke to Book Charge of Up to $2.5 Billion From Canceled PipelineDeal with BerkshireDominion’s deal with Berkshire calls for the giant conglomerate to assume $5.7 billion in debt.

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett finally made a deal, but those fireworks you heard weren’t for him. As the U.S. closed out the Fourth of July holiday weekend, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said that it’s acquiring nearly $10 billion of natural-gas assets and associated debt from Dominion Energy Inc. It may not be the awe-inspiring mega-purchase that his followers have patiently awaited. Still, there’s much that can be gleaned from it about Buffett’s frame of mind as the nation enters month five of a pandemic that’s otherwise kept the famed investor on the sidelines. This is Berkshire’s biggest acquisition since 2015, yet it’s small by Berkshire standards — a relatively low-risk deal in the midst of a recession that’s set to change the outlook for some industries for good. Even though Buffett recently signaled little appetite to make any big bets so long as the end of Covid-19 remains entirely unknown, energy is one area where he’s been poised to make smaller, opportunistic purchases. During Berkshire’s unusually somber shareholder meeting in May, he cited the energy division, along with the BNSF railroad and insurance unit, as parts of his conglomerate that were less affected by the virus. “These businesses will produce cash even though their earnings decline somewhat,” he said. In his annual letter in February, the billionaire wrote of wanting to invest more of the energy unit’s retained earnings to take on large utility projects. The Dominion deal hands Berkshire more than 7,700 miles of gas pipelines and 900 billion cubic feet of gas storage. And it comes as Dominion and Duke Energy Corp. pull out of plans for a controversial pipeline project along the U.S. East Coast; other projects like it have been scrapped as well, and pipeline stocks have taken a beating. That confluence of factors created a rare chance in this environment for Buffett to get a deal at a price he likes in an industry he’s comfortable with — and at a time when he and seemingly everyone else is scared to do much else. It also happens to be an industry that Buffett’s successor-in-waiting, Greg Abel, knows well as the current head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.What stood out as noteworthy in Berkshire’s deal announcement was that the first quote was from Buffett, not Abel. This says that Buffett, even as he is set to turn 90 years old next month, is still calling the shots and wants that known. It’s also a reminder that Berkshire’s history of striking sweetheart deals with favorable terms is very much because of Buffett’s celebrity and acclaim — there’s something to be said for selling your company to the Warren Buffett. That leaves the question: Will Abel be awarded the same preferential M&A treatment when Buffett’s gone? If not, what’s he to do with Berkshire’s more than $100 billion of cash that not even Buffett has been able to spend?With 2020 now marked by economic shutdowns, virus fears and a host of canceled trips, weddings and graduations, it hasn’t been a good year for anyone, not even the world’s sixth-richest man (he was fourth-richest before the crisis). Ideally, Buffett would be making a splash with one more giant deal right about now, and something more fascinating to the average investor than a bunch of underground pipes at that. (Costco Wholesale Corp. is one such example I speculated on recently.)Buffett may not seem much older than he did a year ago — he’s certainly just as sharp — but turning 90 is symbolic as a final chapter for the Oracle. He won’t want the last footnote of his legacy to be an unmemorable purchase of gas assets, even if it is a fine transaction. Then again, Covid-19 isn’t leaving him much choice. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg) -- As Warren Buffett moves off the sidelines for the first time since the global pandemic struck, he’s sticking to the areas he knows best.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. announced an agreement Sunday to purchase Dominion Energy Inc.’s natural gas pipeline and storage assets for an enterprise value of $9.7 billion, expanding its energy empire even further. While the deal wasn’t the splashy “elephant-sized” acquisition that Buffett has sought for his $137 billion cash pile, the move shows he’s carefully opening Berkshire to acquisitions, according to Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research.“It represents a little bit of an opening of a valve. I don’t necessarily think it’s a light switch that flipped from off to on,” Seifert said. The deal is a “prudent move and one that can be strategically justified and also tucked into the existing business model.”Buffett has stayed relatively quiet as the Covid-19 outbreak ripped through the U.S., raising questions about whether he would find attractive deals or financing opportunities similar to the moves he pulled off in the 2008 credit crisis. In some ways, the Federal Reserve beat him to the punch, taking steps that helped swiftly unlock markets earlier this year. That meant that the opportunities Berkshire had been looking at dried up, Buffett told investors in May at his annual meeting.The deal with Dominion Energy hints that opportunities might start cropping up for his conglomerate. It also shows Buffett is willing to put some of his funds to work, despite expressing caution in May that his cash pile wasn’t unreasonably high when considering worst-case possibilities for the pandemic.“He’s willing to make investments now, of a fairly sizable amount,” said David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. “It’s very positive that he’s sending a signal for the right deal at the right price, $10 billion or more -- ‘We’re ready to go, we’re ready to invest.’”Buffett, who has crafted Berkshire into a conglomerate valued at nearly $443 billion, built his reputation as an investor able to swoop in during volatile markets to strike unique and complicated deals in past crises. After being stymied on the acquisition front during the recent bull market for stocks, Buffett still wasn’t finding any deals during the initial stages of the pandemic and even dumped his stakes in the major U.S. airlines.His inability to make a major acquisition recently has drawn scrutiny from his critics, who argued that Buffett lost his ability to pull off the game-changing transactions that helped vault Berkshire into the ranks of the most valuable U.S. public companies. Now, the deal to buy substantially all of Dominion Energy’s natural gas transmission and storage assets for $4 billion, along with the assumption of $5.7 billion in debt, ranks as its biggest acquisition in more than four years.“We are very proud to be adding such a great portfolio of natural gas assets to our already strong energy business,” Buffett, who is chief executive officer and chairman of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway, said in a statement Sunday.Berkshire’s Class A shares, which are down almost 20% this year, gained 2.1% to $273,254 at 10:30 a.m. in New York. Dominion Energy dropped 6.7% to $77.18.“I’m inspired to see that, given that he’s bearish, he’s still willing to make acquisitions where he thinks it makes sense and where it meets Berkshire’s hurdle points,” said Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management, which invests in Berkshire shares.Buffett has considered its energy business one of the “lead dogs” of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations alongside its railroad. The purchase expands its hold in the sector, adding more infrastructure to handle natural gas to its already sprawling energy operations across states such as Nevada and Iowa. Berkshire also struck the deal at a low point in the market. Natural gas futures in the U.S. dropped last month to their lowest point in 25 years and have recovered just slightly since then.“This looks like confirmation that commodities like energy are undervalued,” Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, which owns Berkshire shares, said in an emailed comment. “At the bottom, assets move from weak hands to strong hands.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Berkshire Hathaway’s $9.7 billion acquisition of Dominion’s gas-line assets and debt further solidifies its position in natural gas and is opportunistic, given the movement in energy prices this year and the desire of some participants to move to cleaner fuel sources.”&#92;--Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analystBerkshire is digging deeper into a business that’s been facing increasing scrutiny amid the push for energy companies to shift away from fossil fuels. In its own statement on Sunday, Dominion Energy cited its target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.The deal also highlights the work of one of Buffett’s key deputies, Greg Abel, who led the energy business for years and is now chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Energy alongside his role as Berkshire’s vice chairman for all non-insurance businesses. Abel gained a reputation as a key dealmaker for Berkshire with the 2013 purchase of NV Energy and even the battle to buy Oncor Electric Delivery Co., which didn’t ultimately come together. Abel is viewed as a potential successor to Buffett, 89.The Dominion deal is set to be Berkshire’s largest acquisition ranked by enterprise value since its purchase of Precision Castparts Corp. in 2016. Still, Buffett ended the first quarter with a record $137 billion on hand and has been hankering for a major acquisition to put a chunk of cash to work. The Dominion agreement’s total enterprise value would account for about 7% of that total.“It’s not something that’s going to move the needle from a balance-sheet standpoint, but it’ll produce several hundred million dollars a year in net income to Berkshire,” said Cheviot’s Pollock. “That’s no paltry sum. That adds up over time.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Buffett Sticks to Comfort Zones With His Dominion Energy Deal

2020-07-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett’s $9.7 billion bet on natural gas looks even more contrarian today.As Democrat Joe Biden unveils a staggering $2 trillion clean-energy plan—the most ambitious climate package ever offered by a presumptive presidential nominee—Buffett’s recent deal to buy Dominion Energy Inc.’s natural gas assets is a stark sign he’s expecting that the market’s shift away from fossil fuels won’t happen overnight.The deal is “a bet that the future doesn’t come as fast as some people think,” said Jim Shanahan, an analyst who covers Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. at Edward Jones. “I think they want to be bigger in renewables, but it’s going to take time. In the meantime, they have to be able to provide power generation to their customers.”On its face, Berkshire’s deal last week to buy gas assets including some 7,700 miles of pipelines seems risky even for a contrarian like Buffett. The energy industry is under increasing pressure from public officials and investors to abandon coal and natural gas. The use of natural gas for power generation, once hailed as a cleaner, cheaper alternative to coal, is now projected to drop to 36% in 2021 from 41% this year. In the last decade, prices for solar and onshore wind power have plummeted 90% and 70% respectively per megawatt-hour, according to BloombergNEF. Renewables now supply 20% of Americans’ power needs, up from 13% five years ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Biden’s plan, unveiled Tuesday, is an attempt to propel that surge, calling for spending $2 trillion for a clean-electricity economy and outlining a goal to have a carbon-free power sector by 2035.But despite, or, more likely, because of those trends, Buffett is following his well-worn investing path—buying assets cheap in a buyers’ market. Natural gas futures in the U.S. dropped last month to their lowest point in 25 years. Plus, he’s one of the few buyers in a market where many utilities are searching for ways to get out. Political, regulatory and legal pressure have stymied the building of new pipelines and other infrastructure. Just last week, Dominion Energy and Duke Energy Corp. shelved a plan for a new gas pipeline crossing the Appalachian Trail in the face of stiff environmental opposition.The prices and political pressure are likely to deter any new entrants, potentially allowing Buffett to reap natural gas’s historically good returns for some years coming.“People assume we’re getting rid of coal, and then we’re getting rid of gas next,” said Noah Kaufman, a research scholar at Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy. But because gas is plentiful, cheap and provides round-the-clock electricity it’s “a lot harder to get rid of.”The deal reinforces the idea that Berkshire, despite its expansive clean-energy portfolio, isn't a friend to environmentalists, who want a quicker shift to renewable energy. Berkshire routinely faces criticism for the company’s ties to fossil fuels. Buffett comes in at No. 3 on Bloomberg Green's list of billionaires whose fortunes derive largely from climate-damaging industries. He’s faced shareholder proposals from groups such as the Nebraska Peace Foundation urging Berkshire to disclose how climate change will affect its insurance subsidiaries, a significant chunk of the Berkshire empire.“Berkshire has made some bad fossil fuel investments over the last few years and we expect this one to be a similarly bad investment, and ultimately a losing investment,” said Mark Kresowik, a regional director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. (The Sierra Club has received funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, the majority owner of Bloomberg LP.)Buffett has acknowledged the risks from the changing climate, saying in a shareholder letter in 2016 that it seemed “highly likely” that it would be a “major problem” for the world. But he has also previously said climate change can’t be a decisive factor in deciding investments.Buffett didn’t respond to a request for comment. Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined to comment.In explaining the Dominion Energy deal, Berkshire positioned natural gas as part of its strategy for sustainability. Its energy company called it a “reliable” and “less-carbon intensive” energy source in a slideshow. Of the company’s generation capacity at the end of 2019, about 36% was from wind and solar, while 32% came from natural gas and 26% coal. The remainder came from hydroelectric, geothermal, nuclear and other sources, according to a filing.Buffett has gotten caught flat-footed in the past by burrowing into a market that was soon to be upended. Last year, he invested $10 billion to help finance oil-producer Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. But the investment has struggled since because of a volatile market. Occidental slashed its common dividend when oil prices crashed earlier this year and ended up paying the dividend on Berkshire’s preferred stock in Occidental shares.And Buffett’s been burned by volatile natural gas prices before. Berkshire bought about $2 billion of the debt of Energy Future Holdings, but ended up suffering a pretax loss of $873 million as that business filed for bankruptcy in 2014, according to his annual letter in 2014.For now, Berkshire is simply betting that controlling a wide swath of the natural gas transmission lines will be profitable for the immediate future, climate issues aside.“It’s wrong to say that he loves fossil fuels,” said Jigar Shah, president of clean-energy financier Generate Capital. “He’s just indifferent.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Warren Buffett Sees Natural Gas Sticking Around for a Long Time

2020-07-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Power companies are loaning out Teslas in Washington, electrifying bus fleets in Virginia and lobbying for electric vehicle tax credits on Capitol Hill.San Diego Gas & Electric Co. even went so far as to help train salespeople on how to convince consumers to buy electric cars and then paid them as much as $500 per sale. It’s all part of a $1.5 billion effort by utilities such as Exelon Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc. to promote vehicles that run on electricity.The companies see it not just as a chance to sell more power, but to balance electricity demand and meet sustainability goals, said Max Baumhefner, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.“The grid is built for the one hour of the year when electricity demand peaks,” Baumhefner said. Pushing energy consumption to after hours, when many drivers charge their cars at home, helps smooth out the swings in usage and could even reduce power costs for everyone, he said.But some aspects of the industry’s campaign -- such as lobbying for tax credits or against President Donald Trump’s rollback of efficiency standards -- put the companies at odds with powerful oil interests. Half of U.S. oil demand is for gasoline.Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are a threat to that, even if they currently account for about 1.4 million, or 0.7%, of the vehicles on U.S. roads. Within five years, BloombergNEF predicts they will represent as many as 7% of U.S. car sales due to declining battery costs and a growing number of options.That’s a promising figure for utilities, which have seen electricity demand flatten as household appliances become more efficient. According to BloombergNEF projections, 10% of electric demand will come from electric vehicles by 2040.Electric Vehicles Set for Rapid Growth, Defying Recession: ChartYet some motorists still have qualms.“When we did focus groups, customers were telling us, ‘We have apprehension. We’re uneasy,’ whether it’s range anxiety or the upkeep,” said Calvin Butler, the chief executive of Exelon Utilities.That’s led to some extraordinary efforts on the part of the electric companies to put consumers at ease, such as San Diego Gas & Electric’s collaboration with pro-EV PlugStar to train showroom salespeople.“Who better to sell somebody on an EV than the salesperson?” said Estela de Llanos, San Diego Gas & Electric’s chief environmental officer.“By incentivizing some of these dealer employees, we like to think we planted the seed for more of that to happen,” de Llanos said.An Exelon startup called EZ-EV has helped motorists take test drives, calculate mileage needs and winnow down options -- then score discounts at local dealerships. And motorists who sign up for a monthly car subscription with Exelon’s Steer can shift between electric models, from a Tesla Model X to a Porsche Cayenne.Utilities also have asked state regulators to approve more than 80 plans for advancing electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, according to Atlas EV Hub, which tracks the efforts. The bulk of the programs - some 78% of the requested initiatives -- have won approval, said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.But the proposals are meeting steep resistance from the oil industry, in some cases joined by the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity and large power consumers wary of higher costs. With about half of U.S. oil demand today tied to gasoline, the sector is fighting electric vehicles on all fronts, from statehouses and state regulatory commissions to Capitol Hill.In Congress, oil and utility interests have squared off over efforts to expand a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. The utility industry’s leading trade group, the Edison Electric Institute, has lobbied alongside automakers Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co. to expand the tax credit, while oil interests argue climbing sales and the surge in Tesla’s value show subsidies are no longer needed to jump-start a new industry.Refiners and their trade associations “have waged a state-by-state campaign” to block utility investments in electric vehicle infrastructure, the Edison Electric Institute said in a May court filing. They are using “all available tools in all available forums to attempt to slow or stop the general move toward electric and other clean energy transportation, which they view as an existential threat.”National GridLast October, Massachusetts regulators turned back much of National Grid Plc’s $167 million plan to install thousands of charging stations at parking lots, government offices, apartment buildings and other spots, after the American Petroleum Institute, gas station chain Cumberland Farms Inc. and fuel supplier Global Partners LP blasted the initiative.And in Minnesota, a coalition including Marathon Petroleum Corp., and Koch Industries Inc. refining company Flint Hills Resources Pine Bend have mounted a legal challenge to Xcel Energy Inc.’s $25 million electric vehicle plan.Oil industry interests also lobbied states to impose annual fees on electric vehicle users they argue are needed to ensure electric car drivers who don’t pay gas taxes help fund roads and bridges.“It’s fundamentally unfair to take the monopoly power that the utility has and charge everybody higher rates to build out infrastructure that 2% of today’s purchasers use,” said Derrick Morgan, senior vice president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. “It’s a very big gamble with other people’s money.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Test a Tesla or Buy a Bolt With Help From Your Electric Company

In all, more than 500,000 customers experienced outages as a result of the fast-moving storm. In terms of number of customers impacted, it ranks as the 10th largest storm to date. Crews are already assessing damage and are working around-the-clock to restore power as safely and quickly as possible. As of midday Tuesday, power had been restored to more than 40% of those impacted. However, initial damage surveys indicate that it could take multiple days to restore service for affected customers, particularly in North Carolina, Hampton Roads, Northern Neck and the Middle Peninsula.",Dominion Energy Crews Prepared for Multi-Day Restoration Effort Across Virginia and North Carolina Following Isaias' Impact
2020-08-05,"(Bloomberg) -- More than two million homes and businesses have lost power along the East Coast as Tropical Storm Isaias swirled through New York and the Northeast, killing a man in Queens, closing the Verrazzano Bridge and snapping power lines.The worst of the storm had faded in New York City by late afternoon, leaving gusty winds and water still rising along the seashore. Earlier, seven tornadoes were reported across Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey and at least 18 were tallied Monday. They injured two people, flipped cars, damaged homes and tore limbs from trees, according to the U.S. Storm Prediction Center.Isaias, which made landfall on Monday in North Carolina, is the Atlantic’s ninth storm and fifth to hit the contiguous U.S. this year, the fastest that both those milestones have been achieved in records dating to 1851. Forecasts called for an active hurricane season surpassing the long-term average of 12 storms in a single six-month season, which enters its traditionally most-active phase from the end of August through September.Isaias became a post-tropical cyclone as it moved into southeastern Canada with winds at 45 miles (75 kilometers) per hour, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 11 p.m. New York time. The Tropical Storm warning has been discontinued south of the Merrimack River, Massachusetts, it said.New Jersey was hardest hit in terms of power outages, with at least 1.3 million customers in the dark. In New York, more than 560,000 customers were without service, mostly in Westchester County, the Hudson Valley and on Long Island. The outages are hitting at an especially difficult time as millions work from home instead of commuting to office buildings, which often have back-up generators.The storm caused significant damage to Consolidated Edison Inc.’s overhead power lines in the New York city area, leaving 260,000 customers without electricity, the company said in a statement, adding that the destruction surpassed that of Hurricane Irene in 2011. Con Edison has returned service to 50,000 customers but full restoration will take multiple days, it said.Temporary flood barriers and sandbags were deployed in New York City, particularly in the Wall Street area, to defend against the storm thrusting sea water into streets. The Verrazzano Narrows Bridge was closed and traffic limited on the George Washington, which connects New York and New Jersey. At least 2,000 trees were toppled in New York.“Some of the storm has passed, but we’re still going to have these winds for a few more hours,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an interview with WINS radio.Wind strength has fluctuated in the last few days. Isaias briefly regained hurricane power as it came ashore in North Carolina late Monday, but from here on it will continue to weaken as it moves over land, eventually falling apart in northern Canada by Thursday.The storm didn’t have much impact on cotton, corn and soybean crops in North Carolina and across the Mid-Atlantic.Nuclear ShutdownDuke Energy Corp.’s Brunswick nuclear plant was in the path of the storm when it hit land in North Carolina Monday night. Unit 1, which had been ramping down for maintenance, was taken offline after losing backup power supplies, said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Atlanta.The other unit didn’t lose backup supplies and was operating at full capacity. The only other reactors in the immediate path of the storm were at Dominion Energy Inc.’s Surry Power Station in southeastern Virginia, and both of those were operating at full capacity at 8:10 a.m., he said.Isaias didn’t pose a threat to any major oil refineries or platforms.It’s possible that Isaias will leave about $2 billion in damage and losses in its wake, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. If Covid hadn’t discouraged tourism and more people were working in their offices, then the cost would have certainly been higher, he said.Overnight Isaias will push north into Canada passing east of Montreal and is forecast to be absorbed by a larger weather system in a few days. It killed at least four people on its sweep through the Caribbean and then up the U.S. East Coast.Forecasters are also watching a second potential storm in the eastern Atlantic, which has a 30% chance of developing, down from 60% earlier.(Updates with storm details in 4th paragraph, power outages in 6th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",More Than Two Million in Dark With Isaias Hitting East Coast

That size and scale makes it very attractive to businesses and other utilities that want to add renewable energy to their energy mix but can't afford to build at scale.The stock is up 30% in the past 12 months, and still delivers a nearly 2% dividend. But there's plenty of upside left. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com With a $66 billion market capitalization, Dominion is one of the biggest utilities on the East Coast. With 7 million customers, its prime service area includes the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area including the Pentagon, as well as Tidewater Virginia, where one of the biggest shipyards and a significant number of armed forces sit.In recent years, Dominion was focused on taking advantage of its natural gas properties in the Marcellus Shale and elsewhere. The industry was converting coal-fired plants to natural gas, and there were enormous export possibilities present.But it ran into significant headwinds building pipelines out of the Marcellus to distribution centers in Virginia and North Carolina. Even as it prevailed in court, it sold most of its gas pipeline and production business to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B).Now, it's plowing that cash into expanding its solar and wind operations. And Wall Street is loving it. It's up about 4% in the last year and has a 4.7% dividend as well. Solar Stocks to Buy: Duke Energy (DUK)Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com This North Carolina-based utility has been a leader in alternative energy resources for decades.DUK has about 7.8 million customers across the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. In the old days, King Coal powered the plants that generated electricity for these markets, since most of its service area was in or very near coal country.But it started to realize that East Coast coal was a dwindling -- and dirty -- resource and saw the need to pivot to more efficient and cheaper resources. That transition has been underway for decades. And now, DUK is a leader in utility-scale renewable energy distribution and development.DUK stock is off about 8% for the year, but its 4.6% dividend gets you back close to breakeven. It's a great long-term pick for investors looking for stable, investor-friendly growth. Xcel Energy (XEL)Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com Usually, there's not a lot of news about upper-Midwest companies unless they're exploration and production companies, agriculture firms or mining companies.XEL is a Minnesota-based utility with 3.7 million electric and 2.1 million natural gas customers in its home state, as well as the Dakotas, Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas and New Mexico.In a region where there's plenty of coal and natural gas, XEL was the first major corporation to declare that its electricity generation was going 100% carbon-free by 2050, and 80% carbon-free by 2030. That's a big deal.It has significant plans to add solar and wind from now to then. And that will transform energy systems in the High Plains.XEL stock is up almost 13% in 2020, but it remains a bargain. That's why Xcel Energy is one of the best solar stocks to buy. Solar Stocks to Buy: Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI)Source: Shutterstock Beyond the great long-term choices the utilities here offer, this is a hidden gem that has been overlooked by the broader market.And, it is a great play for two reasons. First, it is set up as a real estate investment trust (REIT), which means it pays you its net profits in the form of dividends.Second, its primary focus is the financing, development and installation of renewable energy projects. And most of these projects have state or federal backing, so the financing is rock solid, as well as the rents.At this point, HASI sports a $2.8 billion market cap, and it's about as expensive as the average S&P 500 stock, even in this hot sector. Plus, it's up nearly 45% in the last year and still delivers a 3.4% dividend. Canadian Solar (CSIQ)Source: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.com I'm sure some of you are hankering for a pure-play solar company, so I found one that avoids the triple-digit valuations that most firms have at this point.That other danger to avoid is buying companies that have a lot of potential, but don't have the established markets to make it work. If you remember SolarCity, a solar company that was bankrolled by billionaire Elon Musk, it could barely make it through the troughs and valleys and was finally absorbed into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It's not easy.But CSIQ doesn't have those problems because its main market, as its name suggests, is Canada. But it has subsidiaries in 20 countries on six continents including 17 manufacturing facilities in Asia and the Americas.It has shipped over 46 gigawatt modules and currently sits on a 15-GW production backlog, which means CSIQ has plenty of business to keep it going, even during a global pandemic.What's more, it has a U.S. division, Recurrent Energy, that has 2.4 GW of projects up and running in the U.S. and a 7-GW project pipeline.CSIQ stock's trailing P/E is still below 6 times and it's up 17% in the past year. It has a $1.5 billion market cap, so it's not huge, but it's big enough for institutions to buy in.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

2020-11-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett has always taken the stance that regardless of who is president or which party holds power, each generation of Americans will be better off than the one that came before it — even if dark moments test our ability to believe it. But that’s not to say the outcome of this election doesn’t matter. It’s pivotal for wealthy people like the 90-year-old Buffett, the future profits of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the lives of the 392,000 workers his conglomerate employs. Taxes, health care, energy policy and Covid-19 are just some of the big issues on the table, and Berkshire — with interests in a range of industries — is a good proxy to gauge the impact any changes may have on businesses as a whole. Berkshire also shows how none of those other issues can be tackled without first reducing the threat of the coronavirus — because when it spreads, everything stops.On Saturday, Berkshire is set to report third-quarter results. The easing of lockdowns during the period likely made for an improvement from the June quarter, when operating profit slid 10% and Berkshire took a $10 billion impairment charge on Precision Castparts, an aerospace-parts manufacturing subsidiary. Still, the latest results will show at a high level that Covid remains the No. 1 challenge across Berkshire’s smorgasbord of businesses — whether it’s BNSF railroad, which is transporting less goods and materials, the various Berkshire-owned retailers, which are suffering from a traffic slowdown, or the restaurant-equipment maker Marmon, which is feeling the knock-on effects of an industry under stress. If there’s a silver lining to a year spent at home, though, it’s that auto-insurance claims at Berkshire’s Geico division are down because of fewer accidents. Joe Biden promises more aggressive measures to stem the spread of Covid, including a national mask mandate, which is a trade-off businesses would take if it meant staying open. But he also promises higher taxes: for corporations like Berkshire, but also for top earners like Buffett. For his part, Buffett doesn’t begrudge paying more. The billionaire has lamented for years that his office staff have paid a higher tax rate than he has. At a Berkshire shareholder meeting eight years ago, Buffett highlighted some eye-opening findings: He said that in 1992, the top 400 incomes in the U.S. averaged out to $45 million, and of those only 16 were taxed at or below the roughly 15% standard rate. Fast-forward less than two decades and the average top 400 incomes had swelled to an astounding $270 million; of those, 131 were paying less than 15%. He went on:When we’re asking for shared sacrifice from the American public, when we’re telling people that were formerly given promises on Social Security and Medicare and various things, and we’re telling them we’re sorry but we kind of overpromised and have to cut back a little, I would at least make sure that people with these huge incomes get taxed at a rate that is commensurate with what they used to be taxed at not that long ago. The tax law has gotten moved over the years in a way to favor people who make huge amounts of money.Buffett’s concern about the lopsidedness of the nation’s tax system led former President Barack Obama to introduce the “Buffett Rule,” which proposed a minimum 30% tax for anyone earning at least $1 million a year. Republicans blocked the effort, and Trump later went on to instead implement a tax cut that was skewed toward the rich. For his part, Biden says he will raise taxes on households making $400,000 a year or more, which isn’t quite what Buffett had in mind. Buffett is also a proponent of expanding the earned income tax credit rather than raising the minimum wage, as Biden has campaigned on. Buffett says a higher minimum wage can backfire and reduce jobs, but “Expand the EITC” doesn’t have the same ring to it. Clean-energy investments and ESG funds should also get a boost from a Biden presidency, and his goal is for carbon-free power by 2035. While “the face of the genial Buffett is not the one normally conjured by the image of petroleum plutocrats,” Bloomberg News’s Tom Metcalf wrote in January, data he compiled indeed shows that Buffett is one of the world’s  biggest fossil-fuel billionaires. Berkshire Hathaway Energy generated 14% of the parent company’s $103 billion of pretax income last year, and it recently struck an almost $10 billion deal with Dominion Energy Inc. for 7,700 miles of gas storage and transmission pipelines. To be sure, Buffett and Greg Abel — the head of BHE and Buffett’s likely successor — have pledged to help fight climate change through billions of dollars of continued investments in wind and solar projects. Buffett may not have been all that consumed with the machinations of the presidential race, but the pandemic clearly shook him, and government’s mishandling of the virus has cost him. When Buffett said at the virtual shareholder meeting in May that he believes “nothing can stop America,” it was the first time he wasn’t convincing — partly because his words were mismatched by a somber tone, and partly because a virus had very literally stopped America. The economy is better now than it was then, but Berkshire’s earnings will likely show that there’s a long road back to normal.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-12-17,"Over the past three months, shares of Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) fell by 2.13%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Dominion Energy has.Dominion Energy's Debt Based on Dominion Energy's balance sheet as of November 6, 2020, long-term debt is at $33.15 billion and current debt is at $5.25 billion, amounting to $38.40 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $413.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $37.98 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Dominion Energy's $104.53 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.37. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Dominion Energy analysts model for earnings of $0.8 per share on sales of $4.24 billion. In the same quarter last year, Dominion Energy reported earnings per share of $1.18 on revenue of $4.47 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on D If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Friday, earnings would be down 32.2%. Sales would be down 5.25% from the same quarter last year.

2021-03-11,"Say ‘insider trading,’ and most people will immediately think of shady market moves and dishonest salesmen, or, perhaps, Martha Stewart, who was famously convicted of illegal insider trading after getting a stock tip on a biopharma company. But there is plenty of insider trading that can be conducted based on information in the public realm, even if it is generally known mainly by corporate officers or company directors. In that case, as long as the insiders publish their trades in timely fashion, in accordance with SEC rules, the insider trades are perfectly legal. The SEC rules don’t make the insiders’ knowledge more readily available, but they do make the insiders’ trades easy to follow. And following corporate officers, to see what trades they make and when, can make a viable strategy for retail investors. Bearing this in mind, we’ve used data from the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to find three stocks that are showing recent – and informative – insider buys. A dive into the stock data and the analyst commentary may provide some additional insight. Dominion Energy, Inc. (D) We’re starting in the energy industry, with a power utility company. Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion has its hands in the electricity and natural gas sectors, with electric utility customers in Virginia and both Carolinas, and natural gas customers in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and Georgia, along with parts of Utah out west. The past year has not been kind to Dominion, and EPS is down from 2019. In the recently reported Q4, the company reported GAAP earnings of 82 cents per share, down a significant 32% from the $1.21 reported in 4Q19. Full year earnings showed a worse picture, with a 57-cent net loss per share compared the $1.62 EPS profit in 2019. While 2020 showed losses for Dominion, the company did not attribute those losses to the corona crisis. Rather, the company noted several business factors that depressed earnings: charges due to planned retirement of electricity generation plants in Virginia; cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project; and lost operations due to the sale of the company’s Gas Transmission and Storage segment. These are all one-time charges, and in some respects offer the long-term benefit of streamlining business. Dominion guided 2021 full-year earnings to the range of $3.70 to $4.00 per share. Despite the mixed results of 2020, Dominion has seen some recent insider purchases that are pushing the insider sentiment needle into positive territory. President and CEO Robert Blue spent nearly $1 million on 14,442 shares of Dominion, while Board of Directors member Mark Kington made a smaller purchase of 2,000 shares, paying $138,578. Dominion has scored fans within the analyst community as well. Analyst Jeremy Tonet, from JPMorgan, covers Dominion Energy, and sees strength ahead for the company, in light of its ability to tack the political winds and shift to non-fossil fuel operations. “With 52% of Dominion growth allocated to zero-carbon investments, D’s leverage to ‘green rate of change’ leads most peer utilities and should drive a multiple re-rating over time. Importantly, the VA regulatory construct limits D’s offshore wind project risk relative to other industry participants given cost prudency presumption,” Tonet wrote. To this end, Tonet rates D an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and puts an $87 price target on the stock, implying an upside of 15% for the coming year. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here) The 6 to 2 breakdown on recent stock reviews, in favor of Buy versus Hold, shows that Wall Street generally agrees with Tonet here, and makes the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. Shares in D are priced at $73.21, and their $81.50 average price target suggests an 11% upside from that level. (See Dominion stock analysis on TipRanks) Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP) In these corona days, we should check in with a Doctor. Dr. Pepper, actually – a long-known brand in the food and beverage industry. The company owns over 55 brands of coffee, along with 20 flavored soda brands – including Dr. Pepper, 7Up, and A&W Root Beer – as well as an array of bottled waters, teas, juices, and mixers. Keurig Dr. Pepper is the 8th largest food and beverage company in the US, and saw more than $11 billion in total sales in 2020. While the company’s top-line revenues grew year-over-year in every quarter of 2020, earnings missed expectations in 4Q20 (EPS came in at 30 cents, against a 39-cent forecast). Yet, the company showed its confidence by increasing the regularly quarterly dividend by 25%, to 75 cents per share. At $3 per share annualized, this gives a yield of 2.27%. In early March, Board member – and corporate insider – Robert Singer made 4 informative purchases of KDP shares. Singer paid nearly $500,000 for a total of 9,500 shares. 5-star analyst Nik Modi appears to echo the Director’s sentiment. Providing key takeaways from the fourth-quarter, Modi noted: “Strong quarter for KDP with continued momentum in coffee and gains in packaged beverages. This quarter is another data point suggesting KDP is well positioned for 2021 and beyond. The dividend was also very positive news. We believe KDP has a very unique combination of strong underlying growth and significant balance sheet optionality."" Based on the above, Modi rates KDP an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $37 price target. This figure indicates a 10% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Modi’s track record, click here) Wall Street’s analyst corps are somewhat divided here, as shown by the Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds. KDP shares are priced at $33.56, and the $36.75 average price target implies a 9.5% upside for the year ahead. (See KDP stock analysis on TipRanks) Dentsply Sirona, Inc. (XRAY) We’ll conclude in the medical supply sector, where Dentsply is a major maker of dental equipment and dental health consumable. The company boasts annual revenues near $4 billion, based on equipment sales and educational services, and also has an active research program in the dental health field. Dentsply Sirona has global reach, with manufacturing facilities in 21 countries and marketing reach more than 120. The Q4 results showed $1.08 billion at the top line, compared to $1.11 billion in the prior year quarter, with EPS of 45 cents just 1-cent down from the year-ago quarter. Turning to the inside trades, Board member Gregory Lucier bought 5,000 shares of the stock on Mach 4, paying $294,750. Following the purchase, the Director now holds 23,142 shares, which are valued at $1.43 million. On the analyst front, Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar sums up the bull case for XRAY in his recent note on the stock: “[The] stock isn't getting enough credit for the visibility that management is providing... With a solid financial path to now follow and with management continuing to execute methodically towards its intermediate- to long-term financial targets, the ownership case for shares of XRAY remains attractive, in our opinion..."" Taking all of this into consideration, Bednar stays with the bulls. The analyst rates XRAY an Overweight (i.e. Buy) along with a $70 price target, which implies ~12% upside from current levels. (To watch Bednar’s track record, click here) As for the rest of the Street, the bulls have it. XRAY's Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell received in the last three months. However, shares are selling for $62.06 and their recent appreciation has pushed them almost to the $63.67 average price target.
