FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said earlier this year that though many smokers may use e-cigarettes to smooth the quitting process, he was concerned about young people using the products, particularly the popular brand Juul, which sells such flavors as &quot;crème brulée&quot; and &quot;cool cucumber.&quot; Though one Juul pod is roughly equal to a pack of cigarettes when it comes to nicotine strength, only a minority of young people who were familiar with or had recently used the Juul knew that it contained the addictive stimulant, according to one peer-reviewed study. The regulator said on Wednesday that it has asked Juul and others to respond with sufficient plans to reduce teen use, warning them that they chance a ban.

2018-09-26,"The legality of cannabis - marijuana - within the United States is a gray area. It&apos;s illegal in all forms at a federal level, but the nation&apos;s Drug Enforcement Agency and other law-enforcement arms have largely decided to turn a blind eye to states that have legalized cannabis one way or another. Nevertheless, the cannabis industry to date remains fragmented, served only by relatively small marijuana stocks and private companies that lose money more often than not. The missing ingredient: scale, or size. While so-called &quot;mom &apos;n&apos; pop&quot; shops may be able to eke out reliable profits, attempts at mass marketing have largely been fiscal failures. The cannabis business needs bigger backers if it&apos;s going to become a mass-market product. But Fortune 500 companies have mostly opted to steer clear given the inconsistent and unclear legalities. That&apos;s changing, though. A handful of large, prominent companies are signaling that this market is becoming big enough to address. Today, we&apos;ll give you a rundown of five blue-chip &quot;marijuana stocks&quot; to watch. Just note: These are enormous multinationals bringing in billions of dollars in revenues. Merely dipping a toe into the cannabis business won&apos;t make these stocks suddenly double overnight.

2018-11-15,"U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced on Thursday plans to ban menthol in products like cigarettes and cigars and restrict the sale of many types of flavored electronic nicotine systems like e-cigarettes in order to prevent youth use. The news sent shares of tobacco companies, many of whom also make electronic systems, down. Gottlieb also proposed banning flavored cigars &quot;to ensure that we&apos;re taking a comprehensive approach,&quot; he said. Use of e-cigarettes has become extremely popular in recent years among young people; the products are safer than e-cigarettes but do contain addictive nicotine and bear other health concerns. The FDA chief has been warning about youth use of e-cigarettes for some time, and previously forecasted the agency&apos;s plans to take additional steps in November. But Gottlieb also said on Thursday that &quot;if the policy changes that we have outlined don&apos;t reverse this epidemic, and if the manufacturers don&apos;t do their part to help advance this cause, I&apos;ll explore additional actions.&quot; The new policy, should it be finalized, would only allow the sale of flavored electronic nicotine systems in &quot;age-restricted, in-person locations and, if sold online, under heightened practices for age verification,&quot; according to the FDA statement, and would not apply to tobacco, mint and menthol flavors and non-flavored products.

## Cowen’s downgrade

Today, Cowen and Company downgraded Altria Group (MO) from “outperform” to “market perform” due to the accelerating decline in Altia’s cigarette sales. Also, Cowen lowered its 12-month price target from $74 to $53. The new price target represents an upside potential of 5.4% from its January 4 closing price of $50.30.

As CNBC reported, Cowen expects Altria’s cigarette volumes to decline at an annual rate of 7.3% over the next five years, compared to a decline of 3.1% over its previous five years. Weighing in on Altria’s recent investment in e-cigarette manufacturer Juul, Vivien Azer of Cowen said, “Although the Juul investment was likely the right move, Altria is incentivized to accelerate cigarette industry volume declines.”

## Other analysts’ recommendations

Of the 17 analysts that cover Altria, 52.9% have given the stock a “buy” rating while 35.3% favor a “hold” and 11.8% favor a “sell” rating. On average, analysts have set a 12-month price target of $59.29, which represents an upside potential of 17.9% from its January 4 closing price. On December 21, Citigroup downgraded Altria from “neutral” to “sell” and also lowered its price target from $67 to $45. On the same day, Stifel also cut its price target from $70 to $59.

## Peer comparisons

Among the 19 analysts who follow Philip Morris International (PM), 52.6% recommended a “buy,” 36.8% recommended a “hold,” and 10.5% recommended a “sell.” On average, analysts have a 12-month target price of $91.00, which represents an upside potential of 30.8% from its stock price of $69.55.

## Stock performance

Cowen’s downgrade appears to have led the company’s stock price to fall. As of 12:20 AM ET today, Altria was trading 2.2% lower. Last year was a tough year for Altria. Since the beginning of 2018, the company’s stock price has declined 29.6%. Meanwhile, peer Philip Morris has returned -34.2%.

2019-01-29,"Although the broader markets have gotten off to a great start in 2019, several overhangs may potentially ruin the party. First and foremost is the ongoing U.S.-China trade war that seemingly has no end. Second, bitter rivalries in Washington threaten domestic stability. As such, buying consumer stocks seems counterintuitive.

However, the actual data points may suggest a different tale. Although the latest reading for consumer sentiment slipped noticeably on a month-to-month and year-over-year basis, the metric compares favorably against longer-term averages. For instance, consumer sentiment has generally moved higher since the late summer of 2011.

Undoubtedly, domestic jitters and overseas conflicts have weighed on consumer stocks. But it's also worth noting that not all the components in this category are speculative affairs. Indeed, some of the best stocks to invest in are levered toward consumer markets.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

While the discretionary subsegment typically receives most of the attention, consumer staples represent viable opportunities. No matter what the economy brings, people must do the basics: eat, drink, change their underwear, etc. As a result, consumer stocks can be incredibly shrewd acquisitions, especially at this juncture.

  * 10 Triple-A Stocks to Buy in February 



So without further ado, here are the consumer segment's ten best stocks to invest in:

### Clorox (CLX)

Consumer stocks like Clorox (NYSE:CLX) often don't spark many headlines. As primarily cleaning-products specialists, they are hardly what you call compelling, next-generation opportunities. But when the smelly stuff hits the fan -- both literally and metaphorically -- CLX really comes alive.

While most other names took a nosedive in 2018, Clorox became one of the best stocks to invest in. Since falling to a bottom on April 23, 2018, shares have gained a phenomenal 37%. Adding to the overall story, CLX pays out a fairly decent 2.6% dividend yield.

Once the infighting stops in Washington and we can focus on the bigger picture, CLX may lose its charm. But until then, investors seeking shelter during this uncertainty can't go too wrong with Clorox. The company features steadily rising revenues and strong net margins, which combine to generate reliably predictable cash flow.

### General Mills (GIS)

If you want the best stocks to invest in during a tough market environment, anything food-related should do the trick. Obviously, humans work best when they have three (or more) meals a day. With breakfast being the most important, cereal-maker General Mills (NYSE:GIS) should be on the top of the list.

Unfortunately, that's not how things have turned out. Last year, GIS shares nearly hemorrhaged 32%, comparing unfavorably even against volatile consumer stocks. One of the key reasons for this disappointment is the product selection. As manufacturers of sugary concoctions like Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms, GIS lost traction with health-conscious fans.

  * 7 of the Best Sector Funds for 2019 



That said, management has learned its lesson. Moving forward, they're increasingly focusing on healthier options. While this transition will take some time, we're already seeing traction. In its most recent quarter, GIS rang up $4.4 billion in sales, up 5% year-over-year.

### Philip Morris International (PM)

The best stocks to invest in don't necessarily have to be the best for you. Case in point is tobacco giant Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thanks to several decades of anti-smoking legislation and initiatives, we know that tobacco is dangerous. Yet PM stock still attracts significant attention.

At first, this concept doesn't pass a basic logic test. According to the American Lung Association, smoking rates have fallen dramatically since the mid-1960s. More critically, this decline cuts across both young and older demographics. Given this backdrop, investing in PM seems like a guaranteed money pit.

However, e-cigarette usage has veritably skyrocketed. Although somewhat cynical, Philip Morris can easily advantage this dynamic. While smaller e-cigarette or vaporizer companies have captured the initial demand, PM can leverage its massive resources to reach a wider audience.

### Ulta Beauty (ULTA)

When it comes to picking out consumer stocks during this shaky period, chances are that the cosmetics industry isn't on the top of your list. However, the recent surge in Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) may help change your mind.

In fact, ULTA may be one of the best consumer stocks to buy because of its two-pronged attack. Primarily, the company generates revenues through its brick-and-mortar stores. Ulta represents one of the few names that hasn't completely fallen prey to the e-commerce revolution. Second, Ulta offers its own in-house brands of beauty products.

  * 10 of the Best Stocks to Invest In for February 



The latter point is especially significant due to cosmetics consumers' buying habits. Contrasting with other sectors, once a shopper finds the right product, they're essentially customers for life. This brand loyalty will likely lift ULTA, even as other industries struggle for traction.

### Avery Dennison (AVY)

If you firmly believe that consumer stocks will fly in 2019 and beyond, do yourself a big favor: take a long look at industrial firm Avery Dennison (NYSE:AVY). While other companies on this list focus on their products and services, Avery Dennison specializes in their packaging.

Without product labels and adhesives (and recently, RFID chips), the retail sector would quickly become chaotic. As a result, AVY stock enjoys indispensable demand. Just as importantly, almost every industry requires some form of labeling. Thus, no matter what happens among consumer stocks, Avery Dennison should always find clients.

Interestingly, AVY stock seemingly trades against its fundamentals. Last year, shares took a massive dive, yet sales have consistently moved higher since mid-2016. At a certain point, I believe AVY is due for a bounce back.

### Coca-Cola (KO)

As any study or survey will reveal, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is among the world's most powerful and iconic brands. But for many years, the beverage-maker rarely made it into a list of best stocks to invest in. While it was predictable, KO stock was predictably boring.

However, after a series of convincing earnings beats, KO finally started gaining traction. Last year, shares gained nearly 7%. Of course, in and of itself, that doesn't sound like much. However, funds levered toward the major indices took a beating, while KO spared its shareholders pain. In addition, the company currently pays a generous 3.3% dividend yield.

Moving forward, management's decision to revamp its iconic soft drinks will likely continue ringing up the cash register. Furthermore, its focus on healthier beverages has finally appealed to younger customers.

### Costco (COST)

If you're thinking about adding relatively safe consumer stocks to your portfolio, you can't do much better than Costco (NASDAQ:COST). As the pioneers of the members-only warehouse retail business model, COST represents consistent demand through every economic cycle.

In its most recent quarter, Costco pulled in $35 billion, up a little over 10% year-over-year. That contrasts sharply with other retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which experiences growth in the low single digits. But despite the strong sales trend, COST stock took a beating last month.

Still, I think the volatility provides a tempting entry point for speculators. As anyone can see from the German luxury cars and SUVs that dot any Costco parking lot, the retailer attracts affluent shoppers. That, along with its ultra-popular Kirkland private label, should help move the needle for COST stock.

### Lowe's Companies (LOW)

While many consumer stocks today offer long-term viability, some investments are simply doomed. The most obvious example we have is Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ). Thanks to an acidic leader and even more acidic decision-making, Sears fell from an iconic firm to bankruptcy.

But in business, one company's pain is another company's opportunity. Although a cynical mentality, the Sears meltdown strongly benefits Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW). First, Lowe's will soak up some of the demand that the centuries-old retailer left in its wake. Second, product makers that once did extensive business with Sears have now shifted to Lowe's.

  * 7 of the Best Sector Funds for 2019 



Most importantly, LOW stock has natural shelters against potential retail volatility. As a home-improvement specialist, shoppers don't have too many alternative options. After all, a leaky faucet isn't going to fix itself because the economy is underperforming.

### Brown-Forman (BF.A, BF.B)

I always take studies about millennials with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, recent reports about young Americans drinking habits caught my attention: they're increasingly ditching beer and even wine for spirits. If these assessments are accurate, you may want to consider Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A, NYSE:BF.B).

While Brown-Forman may not be a household name, its flagship product, Jack Daniel's, certainly is. The beauty of having a popular whiskey brand is two-fold. First, Brown-Forman can grow with their target millennial audience. Second, young drinkers prefer high-quality spirits due to their effortless ability to mix well with other beverages.

Perhaps the most compelling reason to buy either BF.A or BF.B is their discounted price. Since early summer of last year, shares have fallen by double digits. However, the bears are likely overstating their hand considering the company's underlying tailwinds.

Source: Shutterstock 

### Isodiol International (ISOLF)

If you really want to swing for the fences, you can try your hand at Isodiol International (OTCMKTS:ISOLF). As an over-the-counter investment, ISOLF probably isn't going to make many other lists of best stocks to buy. And after losing 91% last year, most have given up on the cannabis firm.

Technically, though, ISOLF stock is up 45% year-to-date. Of course, this is largely due to the law of small numbers. Nevertheless, the volatility has seemingly died down. But is this a genuine opportunity to buy Isodiol, or, instead, a bull trap waiting to snag its next victim?

So long as you understand the extreme risks, ISOLF presents an interesting case. Out of all the subsegments within the cannabis sphere, cannabidiol (CBD) arguably offers the most potential. Since CBD doesn't contain any psychoactive components, it has the potential to breakthrough both nationally and internationally.

  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy for Income 



Isodiol features a wide variety of CBD products, which could eventually skyrocket ISOLF. However, competition can also plummet shares.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-31,"Only two months since peaking at around $52 a share, Pyxus International (NYSE:PYX) is on the move again. On Jan 30, the stock rose 26% on no news. Perhaps speculators who missed out on the enormous rally in marijuana stocks are now looking at PYX stock. Or maybe the rebound in tobacco firms validates betting on Pyxus. So the question is, should you buy this stock today?

Pyxus rose to the $52 level when, in October 2018, Citron wrote that Pyxus &quot;has most to gain with a defined plan and management never seen before in Cannabis.&quot; In the month that followed, the stock lost all of those gains due to fundamentals. The firm posted third-quarter results that showed a serious deceleration in its business. Sales fell 12% from last year to $395 million. It struggled because of lower volumes and lower gross margins.

With such weak figures, why should investors even consider this company?

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Second-Quarter Typically Weak for PYX Stock

Pyxus reported weak Q2 numbers because it was a seasonally lower period for its business. Volumes fell in the period due to shipment timing, tougher year-over-year comparisons and the stronger U.S. dollar. The firm also faced foreign tariffs and increased tariffs on U.S. tobacco. This resulted in a net negative impact to operating income totaling $25 million for the full year.

For Q2, the company lost $55.4 million, while adjusted EBITDA came in at $45.3 million.

A delay in marijuana legalization in Canada delayed sales into the Q3 period. Since the company is scheduled to report results on Feb. 7 before market open, one might guess the markets are betting that Pyxus will realize cannabis sales and improved hemp sales.

However, chances are good that the third quarter will benefit from a reversal from the seasonal Q2 weakness. Typically, product shipment picks up in the third and fourth quarter. So long as Pyxus had a good season in South America, it may realize higher revenue from the increased output.

An increase in its building square footage is another positive catalyst for Pyxus. It had a delay in opening its facility, which also delayed shipments. With this issue resolved, it should achieve a stronger performance in many key geographies. These include Zimbabwe, Malawi, Uganda, Europe, Canada, the U.S. and Argentina.

### High Ambitions

Pyxus is very ambitious with its supply output targets. An astute investor will notice that the firm has a market cap of around $130 million. And its balance sheet is not pretty: its debt to equity is 7.15 times, while its long-term debt/equity sits at 4.25 times. As mentioned many times already, the firm is growing its capacity, growing its volume, and is expanding into more provinces to increase its facility space.

Pyxus has one notable facility in Prince Edward Island. On its conference call, it said it aimed to have another 300,000 square feet by the end of Dec. 2018. On its next call following its Q2 report, the firm should give an update on its status. And the growth in facilities does not stop there. Goldleaf has 200,000 square foot and could add another 700,000 square feet for this coming summer.

The markets may have eased up on selling tobacco stocks like Phillip Morris International (NYSE:PM), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) or British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI). Fundamentally, though, tobacco is a negative headwind for Pyxus. Tobacco costs are going up and face tariffs. And even though tobacco-related SG&A fell year-over-year in Q2, gross profits are still falling.

### Your Takeaway for Pyxus Stock

Pyxus is certainly compelling for speculators because it has the potential to grow its revenue levels. If management fills those warehouse spaces with goods, it just might deliver on an acceleration in revenue.

Short-sellers started backing off, lowering their short interest from 2.94 million shares on Dec. 30, 2018, to 2.53 million by Jan. 14. If the company reports better results in its earnings report, the 26% rally in PYX stock may hold up.

As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-13,"For the fourth consecutive quarter, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) beat earnings estimates. The New York-based international tobacco company reported higher-than-expected numbers on both the top and bottom lines. Although both profits and revenue fell on a year-over-year basis, investors reacted well to the news, bidding PM stock higher each of the following two days.  * 7 Forever Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains However, with its high dividend, most investors focus on the payout. The generous yield, along with the 11-year streak of increases, has drawn investors into Philip Morris stock since the beginning. However, investors may want to approach PM stock dividend cautiously, as it faces an unexpected danger. Earnings, Revenue Beat Boosted PM StockFor the fourth quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.25 per share. This came in eight cents ahead of analyst expectations. Despite the higher-than-expected earnings, it still represents a year-over-year drop as PM earned $1.32 per share in the same quarter last year. Revenues of $7.5 billion also beat estimates by $110 million. Still, they fell by 9.5% from last year's $8.29 billion in the year-ago quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors took the news well as PM stock rose by about 1.6% in Thursday trading. It increased by an additional 4.2% on Friday.Much like its former parent Altria (NYSE:MO), PM stock has dealt with the poor reputation and the marginalization of its core product. However, PM tends to maintain its profit growth. The company has also introduced IQOS, a &quot;heat, not burn&quot; smokeless product. It plans to ultimately replace cigarettes with IQOS in the coming years and that may boost profits as well.PM has also maintained steady growth is in its dividend. The company has increased the payout every year since its split off from Altria in 2008. The annual payout for this year will amount to $4.56 per share. This gives today's buyer a yield of about 5.7%.The PM stock price has grown by only 150% of its value since the March 2009 low. Since this significantly lags the 345% increase seen in the S&P 500 over the same period, most stockholders own PM for its dividend. Here investors need to exercise caution. Beware the Payout RatioActivists have long targeted tobacco and have increasingly disliked PM's smokeless alternative. However, the most immediate danger to PM does not lie there. The near-term threat with PM stock lies in its dividend payout ratio -- the percentage of net income paid out in dividends.The dividend payout ratio has risen to over 85%. Consumer defensive issues like Philip Morris stock tend to maintain higher payout ratios. However, even in PM's sector, they typically remain well under 85%. The company's reduced profit should cause concern. If that pace were to continue, PM could place itself in a position where it pays out more in dividends than it earns.Fortunately, analysts believe it can avert this fate. Wall Street forecasts an average growth rate of about 6% per year over the next five years. Alternative lines of business also remain an option. IQOS receives most of the attention in that area. Also, much like Altria invested in Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON), it could enter the cannabis sector. Philip Morris has so far given no indication it has such plans.Still, unless PM sees higher levels of profit growth, dividend growth should remain a major concern. If Philip Morris reports lower revenues and profits, I would recommend getting out before the inevitable dividend cut. The Bottom Line on PM StockThe dividend payout ratio on PM stock poses a more immediate threat to the equity than the reputation of its core product. Philip Morris continues to earn profits. However, the company reported lower profits than last year. This creates a precarious situation, as the company tends to increase its dividend annually and pay out nearly all of its profits in the form of dividends. Any interruption to these increases will devastate PM stock.  * 12 2018 Winners That Will Be Big Ol' Losers in 2019 For now, analysts expect profit growth to resume. It has invested heavily in its smokeless product and, like its U.S.-focused counterpart, it could also enter the cannabis market. However, profit growth has become paramount. If profits continue to fall, investors need to smoke PM stock out.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the  manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated  electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing  products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new  category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much  better choice than continuing to smoke.",Philip Morris International Inc.

2019-03-07,"Investors in Altria Group (NYSE:MO) enjoyed months of steady upside throughout much of last year, only to see the stock fall since November. But on Jan. 24, when the stock bottomed at $43.33 on the day, investors bottom-fishing appear to have started accumulating the stock, ahead of the dividend declaration.Source: Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)Those not holding the stock have until March 22 to be a shareholder of record to earn an 80-cent quarterly dividend. So, what are the pros and cons of buying MO stock now after the stock's 25% bounce from the bottom? Dividend IncomeThe 6.05% dividend yield is a pro for holding Altria stock, especially when the payout ratio is 76% and grew 10.3% over the last five years. Even if political uncertainties questioning the sale of tobacco might damage future sales, the industry has a way of surviving such attacks. Despite Altria, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) demonstrating its ability to continue on its business, Altria is diversifying its business. Very recently, it made a massive investment in a Canadian cannabis firm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Indirect Exposure to Growth in Cannabis MarketAltria's C$2.4 billion investment in Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) gives shareholders an indirect equity exposure to the fast-growing cannabis market. Cronos said that the investment received would support its innovation in cannabinoid innovation. It also lets Cronos create differentiated products and brands of cannabinoid-based products for both the medical and recreational markets.  * 7 Stocks That Should Be Worried About a Data Dividend Altria paid a hefty price tag for gaining a quick entry into the cannabis market but it has to do so. If cannabis becomes a substitute for cigarettes or e-cigarettes, Altria would still benefit from the trend through its Cronos investment. Investing in JuulOn Dec. 10, 2018, Altria shuttered its e-cigarette brands and took a charge of around $200 million. 10 days later, it announced a $12.8 billion investment in Juul, in an all-cash deal. Altria's 35% stake is strategically similar to that of the Cronos deal. Instead of starting the business from scratch, it is investing in a popular and well-known product to broaden its business and to gain a partner. Risks in Altria's InvestmentsNow for the cons of investing in Altria.Altria already has a debt/equity of 1.74 times. And investing billions, essentially paying a generous premium in the hot market of both cannabis and e-cigs, comes with some risks. If these companies do not maintain their high growth rates, Altria may have to write-down its investments.Competitors might follow suit by making similar investments, forcing Altria to do even more deals. Its cash balance will fall and the firm may need to raise debt to finance overpriced deals. By then, upset investors will be too late in voting out executives to change the company's strategic direction of acquisition through growth. ValuationAltria is still trading at 20% below its yearly high. 9 of the Wall Street analysts have, on average, a ~10% upside price target at $58 a share (according to Tipranks). With the stock trading at around 14 times earnings, and a long-term EPS growth target of 7% to 9%, the stock's PEG is as low as 1.55 times.Over the last 9 years, from 2009 - 2018, Altria grew adjusted operating income by 5.1% while its adjusted OCI margins expanded by 13.3%. These strong historical numbers suggest that the company will continue to grow all of its businesses. Its big investments in e-cigs and cannabis may pay off in the long-run as these two markets expand. Your TakeawayAltria is actively embracing future opportunities for tobacco harm reduction. Its investment in Juul is evidence that it wants to sell products that do not make its customers unhealthy. With the e-vapor international opportunity at $6 billion in North America and $17 billion internationally, Altria cannot afford to be without an investment in Juul. It also needs to continue to offer innovative tobacco products. The combination of these product streams will diversify Altria's income, which is net positive for its shareholders.Altria stock is not yet back to the $60 - $65 range but it could get there this year if the company demonstrates steady earnings growth.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-11,"As Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) investors know all too well, a high dividend yield is only as good as the underlying stock that pays it. With a yield of 5.2%, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock has one of the biggest dividends in the S&P 500. However, a look under the hood suggests that dividend from Philip Morris stock may not be reliable in the long-term.Source: Shutterstock A quick look at the PM stock chart reveals that a yield above 5% is on the high end of the stock's historical yield. One of the reasons for that high yield is that PM stock is down 18% in the past year. This is not the ideal route to a high yield for any shareholder. Investors want to see yields on the rise due to payout hikes, not falling share prices. Given PM's historical yield of between 3.2% and 5.0%, management may have never intended to have a dividend yield this high.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio  Philip Morris Stock FundamentalsThere's no guaranteed way to determine when a company is at risk of a dividend cut, but there are a handful of red flags to watch. First, it's good to take a glance at the stock's fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFortunately, Philip Morris stock fundamentals aren't terribly bad. A forward PE ratio of 14.9 is on the low side, and a price-to-sales ratio of 4.6 is reasonable. However, PEG ratio, which factors in growth, is 2.5. A PEG above 2 is less than ideal. In addition, Philip Morris had $31.7 billion in debt as of the end of 2018. The stock's debt-to-equity ratio is up 33% in the past five years.In the most recent quarter, Philip Morris increased net income by 175% and tripled net profit margins from a year ago. Unfortunately, revenue was down 9.5%. A longer-term look at the company's growth numbers highlights how the company is fighting a difficult environment.In the past five years, the company's trailing 12-month net income, profit margin and revenue are all down between 2 and 5% overall. Payout RatioGiven PM stock fundamentals are mixed, the million dollar question is can Philip Morris afford its dividend? For now, the answer is yes. However, the stock's payout ratio is cause for concern.The payout ratio is a stock's dividend payout divided by its earnings per share. The ratio is a rough estimate of how much of a company's profits are devoted to paying dividends.Ideally, I like to see even high-yielding stocks keep their payout ratios below 50%, but the lower the better.Unfortunately, PM's payout ratio has crept up to 88.3%. That ratio means that Philip Morris is paying out nearly 90 cents out of every dollar of profits to support its dividend. That's cash flow that isn't going to developing new products or growing the business. The FutureIt's easy to forgive some near-term red flags if a company has a long-term growth story worth believing. For Philip Morris and the rest of the tobacco industry, long-term growth will likely remain an uphill battle.Regulatory smoking bans, crackdowns on advertising, increasing competition and a general negative consumer sentiment toward cigarettes are all obstacles that Philip Morris must overcome.The company is marketing its IQOS &quot;heat not burn&quot; tobacco product as an alternative to cigarettes. However, it hasn't made an aggressive push into e-vapor products or cannabis, two potential long-term lifelines for the tobacco industry.Former Philip Morris parent company Altria (NYSE:MO) has made large investments in cannabis company Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON) and vaping leader Juul. In a cigarette industry under intense pressure, Philip Morris may need to join Altria in looking for potential escape routes. But those investments won't come cheap for Philip Morris, especially when 90% of its profits are committed to its dividend. The Bottom Line on Philip Morris StockWith revenue and income growth challenged, Philip Morris is in a difficult situation. The company needs to invest aggressively in its business. Unfortunately, the difficult environment may force management to take on even more debt to do so given its dividend obligations.For now, Philip Morris can afford to keep paying out $6.9 billion in dividends annually. But perhaps the better question is how long can the company continue to do so and at what cost?As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-14,"Tobacco stocks recently took a dive on news of the latest Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hire. Investors sold these stocks off as Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Alex Azar named National Cancer Institute director Ned Sharpless as the interim head of the FDA.Tobacco stocks had initially risen upon news of the resignation of outgoing FDA head Scott Gottlieb. Gottlieb had wanted to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes and ban menthol cigarettes. Now, with Dr. Sharpless in charge, these initiatives could continue to move forward.However, investors should remember that the Surgeon General's report outlining the dangers of smoking came out in 1964. Despite decreased use of the product in the U.S., tobacco stocks have steadily risen in the 55 years since the release of that report. Moreover, hemp legalization, as well as the full legal status of cannabis in several U.S. states could become a source for profit growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary Still, no matter the length of Dr. Sharpless's tenure at the FDA, all tobacco stocks will face regulatory challenges. However, by adapting to the regulatory environment and finding new segments of growth, these tobacco stocks can maintain generous dividends and continue offering returns: Altria (MO)Source: Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)As the owner of the popular Marlboro brand, Altria (NYSE:MO) remains one of the more profitable tobacco stocks. Like its peers, MO stock fell upon the news from the FDA. Given the background of Dr. Sharpless, one has to assume he will continue Dr. Gottlieb's anti-tobacco initiatives.However, I think this will serve as a non-event for MO stock. The equity recovered its post-announcement losses in a day. In my view, that recovery signals that the hire of Dr. Sharpless means the status quo, not further bad news.Profit estimates for this year have fallen from $4.32 per share 90 days ago to $4.20 per share today. However, that is old news. Investors also know that profit growth will average 6.91% per year, over the next five years. While this represents a slowdown from the 11.51% per year growth rate over the previous five years, investors have also priced that news into MO.Meanwhile, the company continues to build new sources of revenue. Altria invested $12.8 billion in electronic cigarette maker Juul. Moreover, with the company's $1.8 billion investment in Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON), cannabis can also serve as a new source of revenue.Even if anti-tobacco initiatives harm their traditional business, Altria appears to keep increasing profits and payouts. The dividend yield currently stands at about 5.7%. This payout has risen for ten straight years. Moreover, investors who have held the stock since 2003 and reinvested the dividends now earn back their original investment every year in dividends alone. Hence, while the tenure of Dr. Sharpless could affect stock price growth, MO stock is still likely to continue to deliver returns. Imperial Brands (IMBBY)Source: Shutterstock Those wanting tobacco stocks free from a harsh U.S. regulatory environment pay turn to Imperial Brands (OTCMKTS:IMBBY). This seller of the popular Kool and Winston brands sells tobacco products in more than 160 countries. It also leads the world in fine-cut tobacco products and serves as the leading seller of cigars in several of its markets.The U.S. accounted for about 21.7% of its revenue in 2018. Although this leaves most of the business outside the confines of the FDA regulation, IMBBY stock has suffered like most tobacco stocks as consumers around the world have increasingly turned away from tobacco.Interestingly, the company itself has followed this anti-tobacco trend. In 2016, IMBBY changed its name from Imperial Tobacco to Imperial Brands to reflect all of its lines of business. Like its major peers, Imperial has moved into e-cigarettes. IMBBY has also entered the cannabis business. In 2018, its subsidiary Imperial Brands Ventures invested in Oxford Cannabinoid. This gave Imperial a stake in the market of cannabis-based medicines.Moreover, Imperial has outperformed its peers in one area--dividends. This year's payout of $3.44 per share takes the yield to about 10%. Although the company cut this payout in 2016, it has risen over time.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners As an equity, IMBBY stock may not see big gains in the near term as slowing tobacco use and FDA regulation weigh on the company. However, the company now seeks to revive its fortunes in cannabis and e-cigarettes. This should leave Imperial Brands well-positioned to continue its generous payouts. Philip Morris International (PM)Source: Shutterstock Of the global tobacco stocks, none stand in a better position to avoid the FDA than Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). This company once acted as the offshore arm of Altria and became a separate firm in 2008. Other than possible issues related to its New York City base of operations, its offshore markets leave the FDA with little power to regulate PM.Philip Morris retains the rights to sell Marlboro and other brands outside of the U.S. However, investors should think of PM stock as more than &quot;non-U.S. Altria.&quot; It has also separated itself from other tobacco stocks by stating a desire to leave the tobacco business.The company has invested heavily in its iQOS e-cigarette brand. The company hopes iQOS will satisfy both consumers and regulators to the point that it replaces tobacco. At least so far, PM has also chosen not to enter the cannabis space. CEO Andre Calantzopoulos cited his hopes for iQOS as one reason why.Still, PM stock has behaved like a tobacco equity. Like its peers, it has fallen over the last year. Moreover, it has retained the dividend philosophy of its former parent. PM has increased its payout every year since its founding. This year's dividend of $4.56 per share yields about 5.1%. Predicted growth rates of 5.9% this year and 8.5% in 2020 should help the company fund further payout hikes.It remains unclear whether its iQOS-focused strategy will pay off in the long run. However, the non-U.S. focus protects PM stock from most FDA scrutiny. Moreover, its market positioning and generous dividend should make Philip Morris a long-term winner for income-focused investors.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-25,"Pow! A little fear went a long way on Friday, exacerbated by Thursday's surprisingly big advance. When all was said and done, the S&P 500 lost 1.9% on the last trading day of last week. Yet, it's still above all the key moving average lines. Assume nothing.Nokia (NYSE:NOK) did the most damage, losing more than 6% following reports that it was investigating the terms and conditions of a business acquisition made in 2016. Though not likely, any discovery of issues could lead to penalties. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) logged a much bigger loss though, off more than 9% after analysts with Spruce Point suggests DXCM shares could be cut in half as competition within the glucose monitoring system market heats up.Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) tried to resist the tide, advancing 2.5% as investors get fired up over its brewing rollout of 5G connectivity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere weren't enough names like Verizon to keep the broad market even close to a breakeven on Friday, however.As the new trading week kicks off, it's the stock charts of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) that are worth some technical scrutiny. Here's why, and what to look for. Philip Morris International (PM)It has been a good run. Philip Morris International shares are up more than 28% from their December low. But the weight of the big gain is starting to bear down on the stock, and it's doing so at the point that's most opportune for the bears.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course A pullback wouldn't necessarily have to be a permanent condition though, and it's pretty clear where the bulls would regroup if PM shares suffer the setback being flagged here.  Click to Enlarge • The make-or-break ceiling is around $92.80, where the stock peaked last week but also peaked in October.• Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can see shares are stochastically overbought and ripe for profit-taking.• While a setback may be in the works, the convergence of the purple 50-day, the gray 100-day and the white 200-day moving average line could readily combine to act as a floor. Twitter (TWTR)For the past several months, the bears have been trying to upend Twitter but have been unable to do it. That has given the stock time to regroup, and even move into a position to stage a full recovery. That's not happened yet, but one or two more good days could do the trick. And, that effort is taking shape with a very encouraging backdrop.  Click to Enlarge • The foundation for the renewed bullish effort is the support supplied at $26.30, where shares made a double bottom in the latter part of last year.• But the big buy trigger here is a move above the white 200-day moving average line and above the falling resistance lines that has tagged all the major peals since December. It's plotted in yellow on both stock charts.• Fanning the bullish flames -- at least partially - is the big bearish gap left behind in July. The upper edge of the gap range is just above the $42 mark. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Finally, in late February UnitedHealth Group gave a second -- and pretty decisive -- selloff that largely confirmed a major downturn was in the works. That panned out as expected, with UNH stock making a few more days of selling.The bulls did push back, but that effort crumbled and turned back into a downtrend right where one would expect. The renewal of the downtrend at the ideal ceiling sets up a third bearish leg that could end up turning into a bigger selloff than the last couple of setbacks have been.  Click to Enlarge • The rally effort was stopped and reversed just as the white 200-day moving average line was bumped. That reversal is highlighted on the daily chart.• The big floor from here is around $235, in line with the past two major bottoms UNH has made. That support is plotted with a red dashed line.• The weekly chart puts things in perspective. The three-year advance was amazing, but arguably overcooked. A little more weakness could easily turn into a lot of profit-taking.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-16,"While sin stocks are traditionally thought of as a recessionary hedge -- in part, due to generous dividends paid by some -- they can also serve as macro and special situation plays. History has shown that investing in casinos, alcohol beverage makers and cigarette manufacturers can net you a nice return.This is especially true when you consider that the USA Mutuals Vice Fund Investor Class Shares (MUTF:VICEX) has actually outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date; the former is up 21%, while the broad index is up 17.5%. There's a good reason to believe that selecting certain securities with better than average growth profiles and macro tailwinds will do better than both.  * 10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now The new addition to vice stocks is, of course, cannabis but some of the old &quot;sins&quot; are still worth a look too. With all of that said, here are three sin stocks to consider now, including a play on the marijuana space.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Source: Aurlmas via Flickr (Modified)Just this week, Wynn Resorts (NYSE:WYNN) ended its intention to pursue a potential $7 billion buyout of James Packer's Crown Resorts Ltd, Australia's largest casino operator after news of these discussions were leaked.I view this as positive news. WYNN would have bought a company with little expectation of expansion beyond the Australian market. The termination of the deal means that WYNN can redirect energy and cash toward the next growth region: Japan. While the yen has depreciated in keeping with Abenomics, it's not exactly a cheap currency or a cheap place to do business. A Japanese resort would cost billions of dollars (estimated at 10 billion). That $7 billion can now be repurposed to a market that has much more potential.Macau, which accounts for 69% of WYNN's business, has seen signs of revival. March revenues in Macau casinos hit a high of $3.2 billion for the year, which &quot;according to Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination … [was] the highest figure recorded so far in 2019.&quot; Even though the figure is a 0.4% decline over the prior year, it beat analyst expectations for up to a 6% decline due to the trade war. WYNN shares rallied in response. With China humming along smoothly, Macau revenues should continue in line.All in all, things are looking brighter for WYNN, even in a post-Steve Wynn world. Although global growth may be slowing, WYNN's focus in Asia and the strengthening of its core Macau market will serve shareholders well. Aurora Cannabis (ACB)Source: Shutterstock Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) had a productive second quarter and the company continues to expand rapidly on the manufacturing front as well as management. ACB has been bulking up with senior management, especially on the strategy side.All metrics are trending positively (SG&A should catch up with Aurora Sky). Net revenue of $54.2 million, is up 83%, and up 363% compared to the same period in 2018, driven by a promising launch in the Canadian consumer market that contributed $21.6 million in sales. The number of kilograms sold was up 162%.ACB has been seeing an uptick in demand with a rosy 2019 outlook to back it up. With Aurora Sky operating at scale, the cash cost associated with producing each gram of cannabis will be significantly lower -- estimated long-term costs are below $1 per gram. This bodes well for improvements in profitability.Management has indicated that if they remain disciplined, they could &quot;achieve sustained positive EBITDA beginning in fiscal Q4 2019 (calendar Q2 2019).&quot;  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Finally, with all the M&A going on in the cannabis space, especially companies that are traded on the major U.S. exchanges, it would not be a surprise to see ACB get snapped up in the next 12 months. Philip Morris International (PM)Source: Shutterstock For an out-of-favor industry, Philip Morris International's (NYSE:PM) 2018 results were exceptionally strong.Diluted earnings-per-share were up 31% year-over-year on net revenues of $29.6 billion. This was in the face of unit shipment volume decreasing 2.1%.Lower cigarette shipment volume was offset by significant growth in heated tobacco unit shipment volume, indicating that PM has been right to invest in smokeless alternatives. Their foresight has been paying off and will continue to do so.Furthermore, on the smokeless front, PM announced last month the results of a new study on e-cigarettes. The six-month study assessed the biological response of mice exposed e-cigarette vapors compared with that of cigarette smoke. It concluded that &quot;e-cigarette vapors with and without nicotine induced a significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases than cigarette smoke.&quot;Digging further into the numbers, annual reported operating cash flow of $9.5 billion gives assurance that the dividend isn't in danger despite a couple of unfavorable class action rulings in Canada. It's 5.3% yield is mighty attractive in a world where the U.S. 10-Year yields just 2.5%.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-24,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in January 2019 It has since been updated and republished.]Is economic growth about to hit a wall and lead us into a period of lackluster results? If that's your concern, you're not alone. This growth cycle and its corresponding bull market are, at 10 years of age, getting a bit long in the tooth.In an environment where trade wars and the fears of an old-fashioned recession have the potential to turn into trouble, investors tend to reprioritize what the market will reward. Safe consumer stocks move into favor, often at the expense of growth names. Dividend stocks become particularly compelling prospects, with traders seeking out the certainty of reliable cash flow when growth is anything but guaranteed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality To that end, here's a rundown of 10 of the market's top dividend-paying consumer stocks to mull as we wade deeper into murky waters. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Some investors mentally wrote Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) off years ago, pegging it as a has-been that got too big for its own good and is too stuck in its old ways to compete well in the modern market.And to be fair, in some regards the criticisms were on target. Since CEO David Taylor took the helm in 2015, however, things have been different. P&G has been shedding brands and lines that simply aren't going to bear fruit, and though too slowly for some, the company has reworked its marketing approach to better reflect how most consumers now make purchasing decisions.Although there's more work to be done, the yield of 2.9% is solid, and Procter & Gamble has upped its payout for 63 consecutive years. Philip Morris (PM)Source: Shutterstock Last year was a rough one for Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) investors. The stock lost a total of 37% in 2018, mostly in response to tepid sales growth of its relatively new IQOS product, though downgrades all throughout the year certainly played a role in the pullback.The sellers arguably overshot their target though.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold While the global smoking cessation movement continues to gain traction and Philip Morris hasn't been the player it needs to be in the vaping market, this company still owns one of the most recognized and respected brand names in the business. Sales and earnings are projected to improve 5.6% and 10.2%, respectively, next year -- pretty good for the smoking industry -- and better still, the dividend yield is an impressive 5.4%. Its payout has grown every year since 2008. Spectrum Brands Holdings (SPB)Source: Shutterstock Spectrum Brands Holdings (NYSE:SPB) likely won't ring a bell with consumers, but the company's brand names will. This is the parent to Remington shaving products, George Foreman grills, Armor All automobile protectant, Tetra fish food and Kwikset door locks, just to name a few.It was a particularly poor performer in 2018, largely driven lower by downgrades and some restructuring that made it tough to get a bead on the company's future. But Bank of America's Olivia Tong made a good point with her upgrade of Spectrum, explaining &quot;SPB's results have been challenged of late, however, headwinds are abating, while the recent sales of SPB Auto Care and Battery provide much better visibility on de-levering the balance sheet.&quot;With the sentiment pendulum swinging in the other direction again, the dividend yield of 2.7% looks like an opportunity. Packaging Corp of America (PKG)Source: Shutterstock When most investors look for consumer stocks to buy, they tend to focus on the manufacturer and brand name and look past the organizations that make those products marketable.Big mistake. That oversight steers investors right past Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG), which makes the boxes and retail displays most shoppers don't give a second thought about.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond The big selling feature isn't the current yield of 3.2%, however, and the fact that the payout hasn't failed to grow at least a little every year going back to 2010. It's the fact that newcomers can step into PKG stock so cheaply. Shares are only trading at 12.7 times their past and 12.3 times forward-looking earnings. Tyson Foods (TSN)Source: Shutterstock Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has been putting food on tables since 1931, and although it's much more than just chicken now, its chicken roots are still highly evident.The past year has been a tough one for shareholders, with fears stemming from a tariff war and rising freight costs pulling the stock well off its December 2017 high near $84. Although it has bounced back from December's low, the current price near $73 is still well short of there.A closer look at Tyson's results, however, suggests the only thing to fear was the impact of the rhetoric. Sales were up the typical 3% last year, and although earnings slipped from 2017's $6.16 per share to what will likely be $5.93 per share for 2018, analysts are looking for an earnings rebound to $6.20 per share in 2019. The pullback, in the meantime, has beefed up the yield to a respectable 2%. Hanesbrands (HBI)Source:  Shubert Ciencia Via FlickrHanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) shares have been a terrible performers since early 2015, peeling back from a peak of around $35 in the middle of that year to a low of less than $12 in December of last year. Nothing the company has done has quelled the stock's bleeding.Don't jump to the wrong conclusion though. Sales have grown rather steadily since 2014, as has operating income. It has not been red-hot growth, nor hyper-consistent but certainly better than the stock's long-term trend suggests.  * 3 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Power Through Market Turmoil Regardless of the past, the present and future look healthy enough. HBI shares are only trading at 12.5 times this year's projected profit, and the trailing yield is 3.2%. This well-recognized brand name has too much going for it to ignore at that kind of valuation. Kimberly Clark (KMB)Source: Shutterstock Finally, Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB) is surrounded by more than a little bit of doubt. The company has seen a number of upgrades in the past few months, but as a group, analysts consider KMB a &quot;hold&quot; and the consensus target price near $110 is below the stock's current value near $125.Yet, to long-term income-minded investors, that earnings news will have little impact on how well KMB shares will serve them. The current yield of 3.3% is more than respectable, and sales of toilet paper, diapers and paper towels are consistent enough to maintain the company's streak of 46 years' worth of annual dividend increases.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-02,"In what has to be one of the strangest headlines over the years, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) announced that they're getting into the life-insurance business. Yes, we're talking about that Philip Morris, the famous (or infamous) distributor of tobacco products. Even more strange, PM stock is taking the news quite well.Source: Shutterstock Shares closed up slightly on the Tuesday session, and didn't really move much during extended hours. Of course, that dynamic runs counter to our intuition. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death. It's almost as if management is deliberately throwing Philip Morris stock into a fierce headwind.Even more curious, PM is offering discounts to buyers who either transition to smoking alternatives like vaporizers or quit altogether. Here's how this will work. For those who switch to e-cigarettes, they'll receive a 2.5% discount on insurance premiums. Anyone moving to a Philip Morris-branded heat-not-burn product -- specifically iQOS -- will get a 25% discount.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Finally, buyers who quit smoking for at least a year will enjoy half off on premiums. On the surface, this is an awfully risky environment for PM stock. I'm sure I'm not the only investor who thought, what the heck is management smoking?At the same time, it can also be a genius move that may stabilize Philip Morris stock. Cynicism Drives PM StockJust based on headlines alone, you would imagine this is the equivalent of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) buying out Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WW). But dive a little deeper into the details, and you get the true sense of where management is headed: they just want the insured to transition to Philip Morris-branded e-cigarettes.And of course, that's a great business strategy that should boost PM stock. A major fundamental overhang working against tobacco firms is shifting consumer habits. Today, it's no longer fashionable to smoke as it once was. Anti-tobacco advocates have done wonders exposing the seedy side of the business, ranging from health concerns to predatory practices.Plus, the cool kids are not smoking. Instead, they're vaping, and it's not hard to see why. For example, take a quick peek at some of the popular e-juice products. You'll find a dazzling array of fruit and organic blends, and candy-inspired flavors. I don't vape yet I'm tempted to!However, it's not just the broader shift toward e-cigarettes that benefits Philip Morris stock. We're talking big tobacco, so naturally, they'll amp up the cynicism factor. Management realizes quite well that no matter how much you want to quit smoking, you just won't do it. Therefore, they don't really have to worry about giving up a 50% discount.For non-smokers, the path to abstinence appears easy and straightforward. Put on a nicotine patch, or chew some nicotine gum, and eventually, you're on your way to freedom. Yet recent scientific studies indicate that tobacco is much more addictive than experts initially thought.  * 7 of the Best ETFs to Buy for a Slowing Economy For instance, the CDC reports that average smokers take eight to 11 attempts to quit. The American Cancer Society has similar numbers, between eight to 10. But the bottom line? PM knows you likely won't quit. Philip Morris Stock to Benefit From Easy CompetitionWhile today's focus is on the company's new business venture, what underlines PM stock, again, is the cynicism. This is management's attempt to adapt to changing market conditions and funnel more revenues into their pockets.Better yet, this is a very realistic strategy. Although the e-cigarette revolution has historically hurt big tobacco, this age-old industry has something the upstart sector does not: massive resources. After paying down some debt, PM is sitting on more than $3 billion in cash.On the other hand, the e-cigarette industry is comprised of many small Chinese companies competing for consumer dollars. Although it's a flashy (literally, in some cases) segment, it's also extremely cutthroat. Plus, geopolitical tensions such as the one we're suffering through right now can present challenges to typical e-cigarette makers.PM, though, has the resources to ride this and other waves. Admittedly, their products haven't captured vape users' attention like the Chinese companies have. But they have ample funds to invest in research and development. Worse comes to worst, management can buy out their vaping competitors, which supports the cause for Philip Morris stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The speech was delivered days after the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that IQOS, PMI’s  electrically heated tobacco system, is appropriate for the protection of  public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S.",Philip Morris International CEO Speaks at Boston College Chief Executives Club
2019-05-03,"With the markets and economy moving forward at a generally healthy rate, now doesn't appear the ideal time to consider vice stocks to buy. After all, most analysts recommend &quot;sin&quot; industries during downturns and periods of uncertainty.But the same factor that makes vice stocks so attractive during recessions -- namely, their resilient demand -- gives them relevancy today. Recently, President Trump made headlines when he called for the Federal Reserve to cut benchmark interest rates by 1%. Furthermore, he asked the central bankers to push more quantitative easing.Maybe &quot;The Donald&quot; is merely giving himself an insurance policy prior to the 2020 election. You have to hand it to him: that's smart thinking. On the one hand, if the economy roars into November of next year, any Democratic candidate might as well just pack it in early. But on the other hand, he also greenlighted vice stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDonald Trump loves gold. In fact, it wasn't too long ago that the then real-estate mogul accepted bullion as a lease payment. Clearly, he was sending a political message about unsustainable QE. Now he's the one requesting financial engineering. If that doesn't send you some chills about the real health of the economy, I don't know what will.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Maybe I'm reading too deeply into this … or maybe, you should consider adjusting your longer-term strategy. If so, here are ten vice stocks to buy: Altria Group (MO)Rather than one of the vice stocks to buy, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) has earned a reputation as a dumpster fire. Some of the negativity is understandable. Smoking it appears is no longer as sinfully cool as it was in prior generations. E-cigarettes and vaporizers have taken over that realm. As a result, MO stock has never really looked comfortable.Still, I'm confident that Altria will soon establish a baseline. From there, I believe contrarian investors will see significant upside, as long as they remain patient. Here's the deal: although broader smoking trends are declining, millennials are more likely to start the habit. According to ScienceDaily.com, a shift in youth subculture - such as delaying baby-making - facilitates living on the edge.Cynically, this backdrop pushes MO into a viable list of contrarian stocks to buy. Additionally, you can't overlook its 6% dividend yield. Philip Morris (PM)A growing consumer base among millennials also helps tobacco-rival Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Young Americans most likely live incredibly-stressed lives compared to older demographics who were once their age. For instance, an alarming number of millennials have used payday loans to make ends meet. Indirectly, that helps vice stocks to buy like PM.Another factor? Companies like Philip Morris have attempted to counter the rise of vaporizers with their own alternatives. That effort just received a shot of adrenaline from the Food and Drug Administration recently. The federal agency gave the okay to PM regarding their IQOS device, which functions similarly to e-cigarettes.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 Here's why I'm specifically interested in PM stock. People who vape come in two varieties: those who've never smoked before, and those who are trying to kick the habit. The latter group tends to be older, and therefore, have more money. I think they'll find IQOS more attractive, driving up revenues. Cronos Group (CRON)Since late February to early March of this year, cannabis firm Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) experienced a noticeable downturn. Indeed, other sector players have also followed suit. Turns out, the honeymoon phase for marijuana stocks to buy has faded. Currently, investors want to see a pathway to profitability.Eventually, they'll get that pathway. But for now, honeymoon phase or not, it's a time for investments and a focus on growth. That doesn't sit well with traditional buyers, who like to see stable balance sheets and evidence of sustainability.Of course, marijuana investments like CRON stock run short on traditional metrics. However, I think the markets must cut Cronos and others like it some slack. The industry is just going through some growing pains. However, the ultimate upside potential - such as full legalization in the U.S. - is tremendous.Therefore, I'd take a serious look at CRON stock. This discount may not last forever. Aleafia Health (ALEAF)Like other speculative marijuana stocks to buy, Aleafia Health (OTCMKTS:ALEAF) is all over the map. In early February of this year, ALEAF stock more than doubled in value against the January opener. But since then, shares of the medical-cannabis firm have disappointed stakeholders. I would know. I'm one of them.Yet I'm not discouraged because I have a longer-term outlook. Plus, I knew what I was getting into: ALEAF is among the most speculative of vice stocks to buy. It's a feast-or-famine pick, and I take full responsibility for my choice.That said, I wasn't just gambling on Aleafia. As any news outlet will tell you, the U.S. is suffering a severe opioid epidemic. Largely, this occurred because big pharmaceutical companies gambled with our health. What was sold as non-psychoactive drugs were tragically anything but.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio Aleafia sidesteps this problem completely with their focus on natural therapies. Therefore, I like ALEAF stock, even though it's going through a rough spell. Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Las Vegas has a slogan that tells you all you need to know about it: what happens there, stays there. Unfortunately for Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), a lot of stuff failed to remain in place. Most notably, former Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn resigned due to a scandalous sexual-misconduct allegation.Another thing that failed to stay in Vegas? Demand. Specifically, Clark County which has jurisdiction over Sin City witnessed ever-deteriorating gaming revenue. Look, people aren't visiting a nasty, smelly, and sweltering dump like Las Vegas for the scenery. So if gambling can't attract tourists, nothing will.But the bright spot for WYNN stock? Those revenues are finally returning to their former glory. Clark County's gaming revenue hit $10.25 billion. This is the first time we've seen the $10 billion mark since the sub-prime lending crisis.That bodes very well for WYNN, which is one of the more underappreciated vice stocks to buy. Sturm Ruger & Company (RGR)It's either a curse or a sign of the times. Whenever I want to talk about my favorite vice stocks to buy - firearm manufacturers - something terrible happens. I'm a firm believer that guns don't kill people; crazy people with access to whatever platform they have available kill people.But taking aside the controversies regarding firearms-related crimes and the associated politics, I like sector players like Sturm Ruger & Company (NYSE:RGR) for purely economic reasons. As much as the left would like you to believe otherwise, Americans love guns. Not only that, the gun-buying demographic is much wider than you think.Don't believe me? Look what happened in California last month. A federal judge ruled that preventing Californians from buying standard and high-capacity magazines is unconstitutional. Opposing factions pressured the judge to reverse course, but not before millions of &quot;freedom sticks&quot; found their way into many Golden State homes.  * 5 Stocks That Failed to Impress Investors This Earnings Season California and other liberal states are just waiting for another black-swan event. If that occurs, watch out: firearms investments like RGR stock stand to benefit greatly. American Outdoor Brands (AOBC)Many years ago, I accompanied a friend who was window-shopping for a handgun. Our salesperson was exactly what you would imagine a man selling guns would look like: big, hairy, and bearded, with tattoos inked into his fists.That wasn't the scary part. No, it was the German Shephard and the swastika tucked away in the corner that freaked me out.Over time, though, firearms companies realized that such imagery doesn't really help sales. Instead, many industry players softened their image because one demographic has significantly increased their presence in the firearms space: women.That's right. The modern American lady is likely packing some heat, while looking great doing so. And that really benefits American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOBC). You know AOBC as Smith & Wesson.For those that don't know, Smith & Wesson is a premiere firearms manufacturer. Better yet, women apparently love their guns, with the Smith & Wesson MP Shield chambered in 9mm ranking highly. This also makes a great Mother's Day gift if you don't have any other ideas…just sayin'. Olin Corporation (OLN)If you learned anything about the previous two companies, it's that all Americans love guns. Men and women of incredibly-diverse backgrounds gravitate toward firearms for two principle reasons. First, America is a violent country, and police response is shockingly limited. Therefore, most people should consider taking responsibility for their own protection. The second reason? They're fun.To feed that fun, though, is an expensive endeavor. That's where Olin Corporation (NYSE:OLN). OLN is a perfect pick among vice stocks to buy in that it's not at all a seedy organization. Principally, Olin is a chemicals specialist. Without its ammunition business, OLN is a great place to grow your money with its 3.9% dividend yield.  * 7 Stocks Worth Buying When They're Down That said, OLN owns the ammunition brand Winchester. It's a very popular brand among firearms enthusiasts because they're relatively cheap yet reliable. Out of 857 million firearms in the world, Americans own 393 million of them, or 46%. That's why OLN belongs on this list of vice stocks to buy. RCI Hospitality (RICK)RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) is in the hospitality business like I'm in the king crab fishing industry. While I'm sure you get excellent treatment and services at RCI's many esteemed clubs, RICK operates the term very broadly. Of course, I wouldn't know anything about this, but I do have a friend who visits frequently.Alright, enough with the cheap jokes. No matter how many times our politically-correct society tries to suppress it, sex sells. It's a dirty way to go about your marketing and advertising endeavors, but it's just the truth. RICK stock represents escapism, fantasy, and sexuality, all rolled into one.More importantly, this &quot;hospitality&quot; industry does very well during a recession. In upscale clubs, women have earned $100,000 to $300,000 annually, even during the Great Recession's immediate aftermath. That's a gender-pay gap that no one is complaining about! GEO Group (GEO)Sometimes, you've got to let out some steam, which is partially why the above vice stocks to buy exist. However, if you let out too much steam, you might end up on the wrong end of GEO Group (NYSE:GEO). Within the sin industry, GEO probably generates the most controversy as a private prison.Also, it's fair to point out that GEO stock represents the true definition of a vice investment. You might wonder how such an organization makes money. For starters, they feed government demand. GEO recently inked a deal to house foreign criminals who violate immigration laws. You think shares will rise if Trump wins another term?Second, GEO is akin to modern-day slavery. While in their penal institutions, prisoners perform tasks for pennies on the dollar. When they've served their time, GEO recognizes that the recidivism rate is extremely high. Ex-prisoners are more likely to come back, bolstering the company's revenue stream.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now It's a nasty business that preys on disenfranchised members of society. However, I can't deny that it's brilliant, albeit in a sick way. If you have no qualms about anything, GEO is your stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long ALEAF stock.

2019-05-03,"It's been almost two months since Altria (NYSE:MO) closed its deal to buy 45% of Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) for C$2.4 billion. And the cigarette maker's latest earnings disappointment would suggest Cronos Group stock is the better buy of the two if you're looking to make a play on marijuana stocks.Source: Shutterstock However, before you jump on your discount broker's website to buy some CRON stock, you might want to consider the argument for considering MO instead.  Earnings in TransitionIn my opinion, free cash flow is the metric that rules most, if not all, investment decisions. That's because if you're a company with minimal debt and growing free cash flow, it's pretty hard to get into too much trouble in an economic downturn. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd while an economic downturn doesn't appear to be imminent here in the U.S., economies have a way of turning sour in a hurry. Donald Trump's economic policies are all the rage right now with (a whopping 56% of ) Americans, but when the benefits of his tax cuts wear off and the country's debt problem worsens, you better own companies whose financials are rock solid.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Altria reported Q1 2019 results April 25. On the top line, revenues net of excise taxes fell 6.0% year over year to $4.4 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share decreased 5.3% to $0.90. As if that wasn't bad enough, Altria missed the analyst estimate for earnings by two cents and revenues by $200 million. Ouch. Free Cash Flow Set to GrowHowever, the company is in the early stages of a cost reduction program that should generate significant savings over the next year. In addition, investments such as Cronos and Juul should change the company's growth trajectory in the years to come. A short-term decline in earnings isn't a big deal. From a free cash flow perspective, despite the downturn in earnings, Altria still managed to generate $2.25 billion in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, it's free cash flow is $7.6 billion providing CEO Howard Willard with plenty of cash to pay down the $16.3 billion in 4.1% unsecured debt it issued in February to pay for Juul and Cronos along with general corporate purposes. As long as it can commit to paying down a billion a year over the next five years, the increased cash flow from Juul along with gains from its Cronos investment should bring the total debt down to close to two times EBITDA from 2.8 after the first quarter. Willard put it best in the company's Q1 2019 press release&quot;After taking steps to position Altria for long-term success at the end of 2018, we entered 2019 with an evolved business platform that includes our strong core tobacco businesses and new strategic investments with tremendous potential for growth,&quot; Willard stated. With 2019 adjusted earnings expected to grow by 4%-7%, there's an excellent possibility that free cash flow could surprise in 2019.  Cronos Stake Worth LessSince Altria closed its deal in early March, Cronos Group stock has fallen in value by 23%. That's prompted InvestorPlace contributor Luce Emerson to suggest Altria overpaid. &quot;With CGC and TLRY already off the market, Altria jumped for CRON,&quot; Emerson wrote April 11. &quot;There are certainly synergies across Altria's core business with cannabis than with beer. Still, it is hard to justify paying a price to sales multiple of 267x (compare that to CGC's 86x).She goes on to suggest that if you compare Canopy Growth's (NYSE:CGC) market cap to kilograms sold with Cronos Group's, you'll see that Altria paid approximately $1.8 million per kilogram of cannabis sold or three times as much as investors pay for Canopy Growth.I'm as big a fan of unconventional metrics as anyone. However, in this case, I don't think we're talking about an apples-to-apples comparison. The fact is, we're not talking about mature companies here, such as Altria or Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), where the price-to-sales comparison is a perfectly logical metric. Comparing P/S ratios at this point in the game when it comes to cannabis makes less sense than it did during the dot.com boom.Emerson is right about one thing. Altria knew it had to act sooner rather than later because it needed to have a place in line once the U.S. government legalized cannabis federally. Why?To show that the company and its partners are experienced in the production of cannabis and worthy of licenses in all 50 states.As I stated in December, compared to the price Altria paid for its 35% stake in Juul, its C$2.4 billion investment in Cronos Group was a steal given the long-term prognosis for cannabis in its various forms including edibles and infused drinks.Sometimes you have to pay a little more to gain entry to an exclusive club. Altria's now a member in full standing.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now For safety reasons, I'd buy Altria over Cronos Group stock.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-12,"Editor's note: This story was previously published in May 2019. It has been edited and republished.No matter where we are in the investing cycle, dividend stocks never go out of style. However, it's during times of unpredictability that investors seek out dividend aristocrats. But despite, there are other dividend stocks out there that are still worth checking out despite not being in this exclusive club.Regardless of the dividend stock's status, investors must consider the following when looking at good dividend stocks to buy: Investors should select a company that has a history of steady increases in dividend distributions, has growing cash flow every year and is still trading a discount or up to fair value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Stock Despite Its Earnings Miss With that in mind, here are the seven dividend stocks that are worth your money: Ford (F)Starting with one of the most cyclical but most dependable in dividend income on this list, Ford (NYSE:F) offers a dividend yielding 5.8%.Source: Shutterstock The selling pressure Ford stock saw near the tail-end of 2018 has been replaced by a bit more optimism in 2019still, a U.S.-led trade war is hurting the stock.But the company's quarterly earnings report offered no evidence that business was so bad the stock deserved to fall. Instead, Ford reported a solid earnings-per-share and revenue beat of 29 cents (non-GAAP) and $40.3 billion, respectively.The economic cycle may hurt auto sales, but Ford is ready to take on the challenging environment. It benefited from a strong product mix in North America. It may even issue a special dividend if truck and SUV sales exceed estimates in 2019. Philip Morris International (PM)Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) has a dividend yielding 5.84%.Source: Shutterstock Rumors that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to impose restrictions on e-cigarette sales hurt PM's stock price slightly. Still, it is holding up better than other cigarette suppliers, which is why it's one of the solid dividend stocks to buy.Philip Morris is adapting to the change in smoking habits. It continues to invest in its IQOS device, which has helped the company significantly in the longer term. IQOS 2 launched at the end of 2018 in Japan with notable success. By offering an alternative to cigarette smoking as consumers embrace the heated tobacco system, this company will bring in revenue growth quarter-after-quarter.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 And with that trend playing out, management may reward its loyal investors by increasing its dividends in the years ahead. Dominion Energy (D)Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) has a dividend yield of 4.97%.  The stock rallied from $61.53 and closed recently around $74.Source: Shutterstock The company's stock has started to rise out of its 2019 range, but it still has some legroom to run. Dominion Energy earned $1.15 a share and $3.16 so far for the nine months of the year. Power generation, power delivery and gas infrastructure revenue all came within the guidance range midpoint.Income investors may look forward to the completion of the SCANA merger later this year, as Dominion's business plan includes a diverse growth capital investment program that will spread its business risks.Ultimately, this is one of the dividend stocks to buy because, when you consider that it is starting a variety of businesses, it has an improved risk profile, strong earnings results. Chevron (CVX)Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is a major integrated oil and gas firm. At a yield just shy of 4%, consistency is what makes this one of the best dividend stocks to buy.Source: swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Chevron's upstream operations found a boost at the end of 2018 going into 2019, earning 828 million -- a vast improvement from a loss of $26 million last year. The unit benefited from crude oil prices moving higher, while the company increased production.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows Chevron stock is really closely tied to the price of oil, which has been volatile for the last five years, but the dividend is so reliable as to make that a non-issue. Iron Mountain (IRM)At 7.1%, Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM) offers one of the highest dividend yields on this list of dividend stocks to buy.Source: Shutterstock In its Q1 report, revenue rose 5%, year over year while adjusted EBITDA slid 6%. Iron Mountain benefited from rental revenue growing 2.6% so far this year. Internal service revenue growth of 1.8% is due to grow in the shred business, digitization and special projects.Markets often question the sustainability of Iron Mountain's dividend, but the NOI CAGR of 3.1% for Physical Storage, plus its expansion in emerging markets and data center, suggests the company will grow EBITDA through the end of 2020. If business keeps up at this strong pace, the share price will go up, lowering the dividend yield. But management may just hike the dividend in the future to keep its yield attractive while rewarding its shareholders.The takeaway here is that Iron Mountain is in the process of shifting its business into new segments. It has time to make the conversion because its borrowing was at a fixed-rate, averaging 4.8%. BCE Inc (BCE)Telecom giant BCE Inc (NYSE:BCE) is a Canadian firm whose dividend yields 5.04%.Source:  BCE, Inc. Bell allayed fears of any business weakness when it reported a good first-quarter report. It added a little more than 3% to its customer base when compared with Q1 2018. This added more than 2% in revenue growth and 6.9% higher adjusted EBITDA.In 2019, BCE will cut 4% of its management staff (700 positions). The capital intensity ratio will fall along with total cash pension funding. In effect, the cost controls will keep profit margins strong while the firm continues to pay out a dividend to shareholders.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Sure, investors could consider AT&T (NYSE:T) as an alternative, especially given that the dividend is north of 6%. But since BCE is a pure play in wireless and internet markets, with little exposure to content other than its CTV unit, it has a distinct advantage depending on your investment approach. And for that reason, I chose BCE instead. BP (BP)BP (NYSE:BP) already has added about 10% to its stock price this year and its dividend yields 5.81%.Source: Shutterstock While BP had a rocky 2018, 2019 has seen a little less volatility, given that this is an oil stock. This is because the company is well-prepared for an even bigger drop in oil prices. Over the years, it shed non-core assets, strengthened its balance sheet and continued paying a dividend despite the fluctuations in oil prices. Its underlying cash flow inflow is balanced with the outflow of organic capital expenditure and dividends. Should cash flow fall due to lower oil prices, BP may sustain its dividend but lower spending.To keep growing in the future, BP has five major projects currently in operation: Thunder Horse Northwest Expansion, Western Flank B, Atoll, Taas Expansion and Shah Deniz 2.BP's outlook is bright. It is shedding over $3 billion in assets and spending ~ $15 billion in capital expenditure in 2018. In the upcoming fourth quarter, it forecasts higher production from upstream. Downstream will benefit from higher levels of a turnaround thanks to its Whiting refinery in the U.S.Will oil prices keep falling? No one knows, but BP is prepared.As of this writing, Chris Lau owned shares of F and BP.

2019-06-13,"Wednesday's 0.2% setback for the S&P 500 still wasn't enough to push it past the point of no return. But, anything remains possible at this point … good or bad. More than anything, traders are losing interest.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) was a proverbial problem child, off more than 4% after a judge rejected its initial settlement offer to end an opioid liability case against the company. Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) was the bigger overall drag, falling more than 7%, mostly driven by industry pricing weakness. General Electric (NYSE:GE) helped keep the weakness to a minimum, up 1.5% as investors increasingly buy into the turnaround story.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 None are great picks headed into Thursday's trading though. Rather, it's the stock charts of Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and H & R Block (NYSE:HRB) that merit the closer looks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips H & R Block (HRB)Shares of H & R Block are, in simplest terms, at a crossroads.The fact that HRB was able to recover and rebound after being on the verge of a pretty significant selloff (as recently as March) confirmed there's a rather significant floor around $23.65, plotted in blue on both stock charts. However, this week's action also confirms there's a major ceiling that stands in the way of higher highs. Although the stock could still fall on either side of the fence, with two years' worth of consolidation ready to be unleashed, the possible breakout thrust is worth a closer look.  Click to Enlarge  * The ceiling in question is, of course, the $29.20 level marked in red on both stock charts. That's around where H & R Block stock peaked several times since late 2017.  * Although none of the other attempts to hurdle $29.20 have been effective, this one differs in that the last couple days have made big gains on big volume.  * Perhaps the most bullish argument here isn't what is, but what isn't. The weekly chart's RSI indicator hasn't crept into overbought territory yet, leaving room for more upside before the profit-takers push back. Philip Morris (PM)With nothing more than a passing glance at Philip Morris, it looks as if it has averted trouble. And, perhaps it has. The weakness seen late last month has been quelled, with a technical support level taking shape around $76.70.This may only be a short pause before the selloff resumes again, however. One more misstep could push PM shares over that cliff's edge.  * 10 Smart Dividend Stocks for the Rest of the Year   Click to Enlarge  * The way the highs and lows over the course of the past week and a half have made a pretty well-defined box shape is telling in itself. It could be considered a bearish continuation pattern that lets the sellers regroup.  * The floor at $76.70 is more meaningful than the past few days would suggest. That same level was a key floor a trio of times in 2018, making it a more important support area now.  * Still, until that floor actually fails to keep Philip Morris stock propped up, there's still a chance at a rebound. Twitter (TWTR)Several times earlier this year Twitter was featured as a budding bullish candidate. Although choppy, the fact that the buyers were repeatedly making an attempt to reclaim ground lost in the middle of last year was encouraging. The breakout move finally took shape in April, though in the worst possible way. That is, a huge gap was left behind; traders generally don't like to leave gaps unfilled.Sure enough, that gap was filled in the meantime, with last month's weakness. The spot with which the bounceback has taken shape, however, suggests a whole new trading range has been established that will serve as a Launchpad for the move to the next higher level.  Click to Enlarge  * All it took was a kiss of the gray 100-day moving average line in early June (highlighted) to close the gap left with April's surge.  * This week so far, the purple 50-day moving average line and the blue 20-day moving average line have acted as a technical floor, holding TWTR above a key technical ceiling near $37.20, plotted in red.  * The next level to watch is $42.14, where the upper boundary of July's bearish gap is found.  * It's more readily evident on the weekly chart, but with the recent move higher, the old trading range between $35.80 and $26.25 has been left in the rearview mirror.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-25,"2018 was not an easy year for the tobacco industry to say the least. Repeated attempts made by the FDA to reduce smoking rate have caused demand for cigarettes to diminish. Indeed, the number of smokers in the United States in that year has hit a record low of 16% (in 2013, the figure stood at 20%).  If that was not enough, in June, a proposition to prohibit the sale of flavored tobacco products in San Francisco almost passed.Tobacco companies are still facing difficulties in 2019. This June, British American Tobacco, the second largest tobacco company in the world, warned about a sharp decline in its revenues due to low demand for regular cigarettes in the United States as more and more Americans use e-cigarettes and vaping products. Having said that, prospects for tobacco companies in the short and long term are not as bad as it was previously thought. It is predicted that by 2021 market size will reach almost $695 billion – a 2.8% CAGR from 2016.From a yearly perspective, Philip Morris stock (NYSE:PM) has surged by 15%, almost matching the entire gains recorded by the S&P 500. In fact, the largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the world is now enjoying positive assessments from Wall Street’s top analysts. One of  them is Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. She has recently given the company’s a buy rating and a $100 price target with a 26.23% upside. Herzog is not alone in her assessment, if we weigh other analysts’ assessments, we get an average target price of $94.57 and a 19.38% Upside. Philip Morris’ current share price stands at $79.22 (June 24). Explaining the rationale behind her buy rating, Herzog points mainly to strong cigarette price realization and the acceleration of next gen iQOS 3/Multi platforms (tobacco heating system without combustion) shipment volume in Japan (+14.5%). Regarding the company’s iQOS, it should be mentioned that in April, Philip Morris finally received the FDA’s approval to sell this product in the U.S. domestic market after years of waiting. Up until recently, the product has been sold in the foreign markets, such as the Japanese and the Russian ones. Another reason for optimism from Philip Morris’ point of view (and other tobacco manufacturers) was the resignation of FDA’s commissioner Scott Gottlieb in April. Gottlieb was considered a vehement anti-tobacco advocate. Tobacco companies now hope the FDA will adopt a more moderate approach towards their products. To conclude, as bright as the future may seem for tobacco manufacturers and their investors, one must not forget that there are still challenges awaiting them in years to come, especially due to the constant decline in the number of smokers in the United States and other Westerns countries. A reminder for such a challenge came in the form of an initiative in San Francisco a week ago to ban the sale of e-cigarettes.

To not do so is a good way to go out of business. So the decision by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to encourage its customers not to purchase flights – at least in some circumstances – is rather curious.The Dutch airline, part of the Air France-KLM group, launched a new sustainability campaign last week that featured some surprising suggestions for how passengers could help cut the aviation industry’s carbon dioxide emissions. The advert claims that while “we all have to fly every now and then,” sometimes there are better alternatives. “Do you always have to meet face-to-face? Could you take the train instead?” the kindly narrator enquires. The clip concludes by assuring viewers that “no actual flights were taken for the making of this film.”If you’d have asked me a few years ago about potential threats to the aviation industry, then video conferencing and high-speed trains would have come high on my list. That KLM has become an advocate for these things is unexpected, but it might help its business in the long run.It certainly makes sense to try to get ahead of policymakers and public opinion in responding to aviation’s big contribution to pollution (the industry is responsible for about 2-3% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions). Thanks in part to the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, “flight shame” has become a thing and seems to be affecting demand for travel and holidays. France has joined the Netherlands in supporting new European aviation taxes, and some French politicians have floated the idea of banning domestic flights on routes where trains are an alternative.Taxes and enforced restrictions on short-haul flying would be bad for KLM, which relies on connecting international passengers via its Amsterdam hub. No wonder it’s keen to project an image of environmental responsibility. Its goal certainly isn’t to discourage all air travel. “We are a company that needs to make a profit to survive… We want to still be around when we have succeeded in our efforts to make aviation sustainable,” it has explained.Hence its campaign will doubtless prompt claims of green-washing: Raising ticket prices or scrapping routes would be a much simpler way to curtail emissions. KLM knows the train isn’t really an alternative to its many long-haul flights.Cigarette maker Philip Morris International has drawn similar flak for urging people to give up smoking or to use its vaping or heated tobacco products instead, while the drinks industry was lampooned for urging customers to drink responsibly (while doing everything it could to make alcohol seem cool).However, KLM’s intervention does at least look like an acknowledgement that the unconstrained growth anticipated by the aerospace and aviation industries is irresponsible. Airbus SE expects international air traffic to increase almost 4.5% a year for the next two decades, creating lots more carbon pollution.Large commercial electric planes aren’t technologically viable yet. Until then, it’s better that when people do fly, they pick an airline with more efficient jets, less polluting fuels and carbon-offsetting projects, all of which KLM is pursuing. Similarly, Ryanair Holdings Plc – long a climate change skeptic – has begun publishing monthly emissions data to try to show its “pollution per passenger kilometer traveled” is lower than that of its peers. If anything, climate change is happening faster than scientists feared and our efforts to cut emissions have been too slow. That means companies will have to forgo their most indefensible activities. Even Glencore PLC, hardly an environmental angel, has promised not to increase coal production above current levels. As strange as it sounds, “Don’t Buy Our Product” could yet become a common business strategy.To contact the author of this story: Chris Bryant at cbryant32@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2019-07-09,"There's nothing more satisfying that getting money for doing nothing. That's why dividend stocks hold so much appeal for portfolios. After a one-time investment, top dividend stocks will pay you year in and year out, for doing nothing except holding them. This has to be one of the greatest forces in all of investing. And everyone likes getting money for free.To that end, high-yielding dividend stocks could be an income seeker's or retiree's best friend.By focusing on those stocks with above-average yields, investors can truly supercharge their current income. The best part is that many of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500 aren't exactly risky names. We're talking huge companies with plenty of cash flows and earnings to back-up those payouts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half The truth is, there are plenty of big-time stocks that are producing some serious income for their shareholders. Here are five of the best high-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500. Macerich Company (MAC)Dividend Yield: 9%Source: Shutterstock With a nearly 9% yield, Macerich (NYSE:MAC) tops the list as one of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500. That high yield can be explained in two ways: For starters, MAC is a real estate investment trust (REIT). As a REIT, the firm is required to pay out the bulk of its cash flows to investors as dividends in order to take advantage of lucrative tax breaks.The second reason is that Macerich is a retail real estate owner -- specifically a mall owner. As e-commerce has taken hold, stocks like MAC have taken it on the chin.Today, MAC stock sits at new eight-year lows.This could be a prime time to load up on such a high-yielding dividend stock. The reason is that MAC doesn't own slouch malls. Yes, junky Class B malls are dying, but premium Class A shopping malls are thriving. MAC owns 48 of these high-end malls and they continue to see high occupancy rates -- over 95% -- and sales per square foot -- around $869.Meanwhile, the firm continues to change its tenant mix to involve more experiences, dining and entertainment options. This has only boosted traffic and sales further.The point is, MAC is being unfairly cast aside with the lower mall operators. This has shown up in its ability to boost critical funds from operations (FFO) measures over the retail Armageddon. It has also continued to raise its standard dividend as well as pay special ones.All in all, Macerich is one high-yielding dividend stock to snag-up. Iron Mountain Inc (IRM)Dividend Yield: 7.64%Source: Orin Zebest via FlickrLike Macerich, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) is also a REIT, but IRM is a tad bit different. The firm makes its money by owning records and data storage facilities around the world. In fact, Iron Mountain is the biggest provider of such facilities with more than 1,400 different locations.It turns out this is an incredibly profitable and needed niche. Key customers include nearly everyone in the Fortune 1000 as well as various government organizations. With retention rates as high as 98%, IRM is able to pull in some hefty cash flows from the &quot;rent&quot; it charges these customers. Last year, it was able to grow its total FFO by nearly 19% and boost its dividend by over 6%.The best part is that Iron Mountain continues to evolve. It's no secret that digital records and data creation is growing by leaps and bounds. To this end, IRM has expanded in datacenter, cloud and digital hard drive access for its clients.Given its leadership position in physical document storage, the firm has had great success in upselling these digital products to customers. And with higher margins for cloud storage, IRM should be able to keep the growth coming for years.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 And yet, because of its quirky nature, investors don't really pay too much attention to Iron Mountain. That fact provides it with a whopping 7.64% dividend yield. Philip Morris International (PM)Dividend Yield: 5.66%Source: Taber Andrew Bain Via FlickrWe all know smoking is dying a quick death here in the United States. Even e-cigarettes are getting the evil eye from regulators, which is just fine for tobacco stock Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM).The key for PM is the &quot;international&quot; in its name. The firm operates and sells tobacco in over 180 countries and territories with the U.S. not being one of them. Emerging markets such as Indonesia, Russia, China, and India make up the bulk of the firms' revenues.And those revenues continue to rise as smoking still carries some &quot;cool&quot; factor in these regions and is considered a small luxury.  All in all, PM sold more than $29.6 billion dollars' worth of tobacco last year -- a 3.1% year-over-year jump.Philip Morris' future looks rosy as well.Big tobacco enjoys some big pricing power. Nicotine is an addictive substance and PM is able to pass on price increases to cover costs to consumers pretty easily. Secondly, the firm's IQOS heated-tobacco delivery system is seeing some very impressive numbers. Shipments for IQOS jumped 20% to reach 11.5 billion units in the firm's most recent quarter. All of this continues to strengthen the firm's cash flows, bottom line, and dividend prowess.The reality is, PM is one of the highest yielding dividend stocks because it's a hated vice firm. Not because fundamentals are bad. AbbVie (ABBV)Dividend Yield: 5.71%Source: Shutterstock The giant pharmaceutical firms have long been great dividend stocks. This includes biotech king AbbVie (NASDAQ:ABBV). Driving that fact has been its blockbuster drug Humira.Last year alone, the autoimmune-disease medication brought in nearly $20 billion for ABBV -- an increase of 8.2% over 2017's numbers. The drug has continued to drive ABBV's dividend -- currently at almost 6%.The problem is, Humira is facing the proverbial patent cliff sooner than later. Given that the drug is responsible for the bulk of AbbVie's revenues, this cliff shouldn't be taken lightly. And that's one of the reasons why the dividend stocks yield is so high.However, ABBV has a plan to replace that missing revenue. To begin with, the firm is buying out fellow biotech rival Allergan (NYSE:AGN). AGN features hits like Botox and other blockbusters in its umbrella. Meanwhile, AbbVie has recently scored several approvals that could turn into real cash cows over time. Add in its rich pipeline that is now more robust from the AGN buy and you have a recipe for continued cash flows.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice For investors, there's plenty of potential in the dividend stock and you can grab that potential at a very high yield. Williams (WMB)Dividend Yield: 5.35%Source: Shutterstock Pipeline firms have often been called the &quot;toll roads of the energy sector.&quot; That's because they are paid on the volume of oil and natural gas flowing through their systems. After a few years of simplification, the sector is now back to those roots. That includes top pipeline firm Williams (NYSE:WMB).WMB owns plenty of top-notch natural gas assets in key areas such as the Marcellus shale and the DJ Basin. These assets feature plenty of cash flows tied to their volumes. This provides less risk for Williams as many of these assets are paid via so-called &quot;take or pay&quot; contracts. And WMB's continues to add capacity and expansions to these prime pipelines and gathering systems. This will help expand WMB's cash flows further down the road.These moves seem to be working.Last quarter, WMB saw a big 12% boost to its quarter-over-quarter cash flow from operations, and a big 8% jump in its distributable cash flows. With that, management expects to be able to grow its dividend payout by between 10% and 15% this year. That's pretty impressive considering that WMB already yields 5.35%. With a full slate of expansion projects for the next few years, Williams should be able to keep the growth coming for years to come.For investors, pipelines have historically been some of the best dividend stocks. WMB is continuing that tradition.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-07-17,"Markets are high, as investors have rushed back into stocks on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least once before year’s end. With bond yields already low, and lower rates in the offing, stocks are the natural place to turn. And among the stocks, high-yield dividends offer investors an additional income stream to supplement share price growth. Here we look at three stocks offering high dividend payouts. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Shares in Broadcom slipped in recent sessions, when acquisition talks between the chipmaker and cyber security corporation Symantec (SYMC) broke off. Symantec ended the negotiations, saying that Broadcom’s per-share offer was too low. Both companies saw a retreat in share price; Broadcom much less.Macro factors have been more important to AVGO’s share performance than possible acquisitions. The US semiconductor industry was hit hard last month when tariff fears flared up, but that has eased since Presidents Trump and Xi met cordially at the G20 summit and announced that formal trade talks would resume.So, Broadcom is looking stable, but more attractive to investors is the company’s 3.73% dividend yield. While that percentage may not seem high, AVGO’s $284 share price makes the annualized payout $10.60. Quarterly, it pays out $2.65 per share. Even better, AVGO has a history of both consistent payouts and steady increases of the dividend. It’s a guaranteed income that nicely complements the stock’s 9% upside potential.Broadcom has gained over 13% since the beginning of June, and analysts are sanguine about the stock’s future. William Stein, of SunTrust Robinson, remains “positive on Broadcom's outstanding historical track record of value creation from its investing decisions and expects its management to continue to make intelligent capital allocation decisions.” His price target, $307, suggests an 8% upside to the stock.A look at Stein’s ratings history on Broadcom shows that he has been consistently bullish on this stock for the last year. Even better, his ratings are frequently borne out by performance – he has a 19% average return on his recommendations for AVGO shares.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see William Stein’s complete Analyst ProfileOverall, Broadcom holds a strong buy from the analyst consensus, based on 21 buy ratings and 6 holds assigned in the last 3 months. The stocks $311 average price target suggests room for 9.6% growth from the $284 current share price. Home Depot, Inc. (HD)Home Depot leads the big-box home improvement superstore niche, with double the market share, double the share price, and triple the market cap of its largest competitor, Lowe’s (LOW). With recent positive economic indicators, especially June’s strong jobs numbers and the prospect of a Fed interest rate cut putting downward pressure on mortgage rates, the home improvement niche is looking strong.A solid business niche leads to profit and cash flow. HD is set to release Q2 earnings on Aug 13, and the expectation is for $3.09 per share, and increase of 36% from last quarter’s $2.27 EPS. Historically, the company’s fiscal second quarter is its strongest for earnings.HD also has a history of sharing earnings with investors through a robust dividend. The yield is a modest 2.5%, but the high share price makes the annual payout $5.44. Quarterly payments are $1.36, and HD has a history of raising the dividend each year.&gt;&gt;Click here to see the HD Dividend CalendarThe reliable dividend and profitable business model may explain HD’s popularity among investors. TipRanks tracks over 50,000 individual portfolios; among the best performing of these, Home Depot shares appear in 16.3%, or 1 out of 6. Top performing investors have increased their HD holdings by more than 2% over the past month, reflecting the overall “very positive” investor sentiment on the stock.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see HD Investor SentimentInvestors and dividend fans aren’t the only ones bullish on Home Depot. Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane reviewed the stock earlier this month and gave it a $235 price target, implying an upside potential over 8%. In her comments, McShane wrote: “Home Depot hits all the marks when it comes to gaining market share and increasing operating dollar growth. Expect these two attributes to drive upside to the stock over the next 12 months.”Home Depot’s price target presents us with the interesting case of a solid stock whose recent gains have pushed its share price above recent analyst expectations. HD is trading at $217; the average price target, however, is only $209, and still reflects older analyst ratings. As McShane’s comments and target show, Wall Street is beginning to readjust its outlook on the company. HD remains a strong buy, based on an analyst consensus of 8 buys and 5 holds in the past three months. Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM)Yes, this is a cigarette company, a classic “sin stock.” But investors are in the market to make a profit, and that’s where Philip Morris delivers. Year-to-date, shares in PM are up 22%. The profits come while cigarette sales are slowing, as the tobacco companies have been casting about for other business opportunities, making investments in cannabis, alcohol, and e-cigarettes.In looking for alternate revenue streams, Big Tobacco hasn’t forgotten the investor. PM pays out a regular dividend of $1.14 quarterly. Annualized, this represents an income of $4.56 per share and a yield of 5.59%. More important, is PM’s 11-year history of growing the dividend, making this stock particularly attractive to value investors.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the PM Dividend CalendarSecular trends – especially the poor reputation of tobacco and smoking products – may be lined up against the tobacco companies, but some Wall Street analysts see this as a buying opportunity. Writing from Goldman Sachs, Judy Hong says, “Tobacco valuations are &quot;at a 10-year trough despite a more accommodating market backdrop.”She sees a floor to cigarettes’ unpopularity, and a stabilization in sales and profits. Continuing, she says, “Expect the current discount on tobacco stocks to narrow as cigarette fundamentals hold up better than feared, contribution from next generation tobacco products builds, and regulatory concerns subside over time.”Hong says that the bearishness on tobacco traces back to lower sales volumes for cigarettes along with up-front costs of the shift to e-cigs and other alternative products. However, she adds, “Expect the decline in cigarette consumption to abate and the shift to e-cigarettes to moderate. And international cigarette volume trends have been mostly stable.” In line with her bullish stance on the industry, Hong gives PM a solid buy rating.Bonnie Herzog, of Wells Fargo, agrees with Hong on the outlook for Philip Morris. She bases her optimism, however, on a successful move toward alternative tobacco products, specifically the iQOS heat-not-burn option. Writing of PM, she says she expects the company to beat the Q2 earnings estimate, saying, “We expect PM will beat conservative EPS of $1.32 (vs our $1.36) and we expect: (1) sequential acceleration of iQOS shipment volume in Japan (+14.5%) given strength from next generation iQOS 3/Multi platforms; (2) iQOS to lead heat-not-burn (HNB) category growth in Japan and gain market share elsewhere; and (3) strong cigarette price realization.”Herzog gives PM a price target of $100, suggesting an upside potential of 22% to the stock. Her rating suggests that PM has more room for growth than the conventional wisdom would indicate – PM’s average price target is $93, indicating a possible upside of 15% from the share price of $81.PM’s analyst consensus rating is a moderate buy, derived from 7 buys and 3 holds in the last three months.TipRanks puts a wide variety of data analysis tools at your fingertips, so you can find the right investment for your portfolio.

It now expects earnings per share for the year to be up by at least 9% from last year. This translates to an earnings per share minimum of $5.28 for the year. In comparison, Wall Street is estimating earnings per share of $5.16 for 2019.The Philip Morris outlook increase is due to its earnings per share of $1.46 for the second quarter of the year.

2019-07-18,"The stock market again took a break from its robust rally as it digests more earnings results. We've seen plenty of mixed results, but so far, the market is handling the news pretty well. Here are a few top stock trades to watch going into the last trading day of the week.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: IBM  Click to EnlargeInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) started off lower on the day, but climbed more than 4.5% later in the day after reporting its earnings results.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, IBM stock pushed over downtrend resistance (blue line) and this week's move cements it. That prior downtrend mark is now a must-hold level for investors. I would love to see IBM stock stay above the trio of candlesticks that marked the weekly closing highs for the past 52 weeks. That's the black line that comes into play near $146.   If it holds, shares could run into the mid- to high-$150s and possibly challenge the 2018 highs. Below the ~$146 mark and we'll need to see if the 10-week moving average holds as support.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Honeywell  Click to EnlargeLook at the beautiful &quot;inside day&quot; Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is printing after reporting its quarterly results and raising guidance. An inside day occurs when the entire range of the second day is &quot;inside&quot; the range of the prior trading session.Of course, this one is even more interesting as HON stock initially lost, then reclaimed the 50-day on Thursday, but couldn't get above the 21-day moving average. Hmm. This sets up a range trade.Below Wednesday's lows and HON is likely heading lower. Above Wednesday's highs -- remember, that's the prior session -- and HON is likely heading higher. At least, until it runs into potential downtrend resistance (blue line).  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Philip Morris  Click to EnlargePhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock erupted 9% after better-than-expected earnings results. The move on the weekly chart thrust the stock above a key downtrend level, as well as the $87 mark. As long as PM holds above $87, bulls can justify a long position. Below it and we'll need to see the 200-week moving average hold as support. On the upside, let's see if PM can push through Thursday's highs and $90.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Morgan Stanley  Click to EnlargeMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) caught a slight lift after reporting second-quarter earnings. The stock continues to put in a series of higher lows and is maintaining above all of its major moving averages. However, it's having trouble pushing through resistance between $44 and $45. Like most major bank stocks, resistance continues to keep these names in check. Over $45 and a move to $46.50 is possible. Above that and $49 is doable. On a pullback, see that $43 holds as support. Below is concerning.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Bank of America  Click to EnlargeAnother example of a bank stock struggling to breakout? Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).The stock flirted with a breakout over $29.50 on Wednesday after beating on earnings expectations. However, the stock gave up most of its gains going into the close before holding short-term support at $29. BAC stock is stuck in a very tight range between $29 and $29.50. However, it's got plenty of bullish catalysts working in its favor, including earnings growth, revenue growth and a continually rising dividend and buyback. Its valuation continues to drop, too.   * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now If it can push through $29.50, it could trigger a breakout, first to $30 and possibly up toward $30.75. A move below the 21-day moving average and $29 is concerning.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-07-19,"The market managed to snap out of a two-day funk before it raced out of control, with the S&P 500 logging a gain of 0.36% on Thursday. Nevertheless, the volume behind the move was modest, and the weight of the gains since early June are still bearing down.Source: Shutterstock The gain took shape despite Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which fell 11% after last quarter's subscriber growth fell well short of estimates. Helping keep stocks in the black despite Netflix's stumble, above others, were International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Shares of Big Blue improved more than 4% following its second quarter earnings beat, and the cigarette company's stock jumped more than 8% after it crushed its Q2 outlooks.It's the stock charts of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK) that offer the most promising trade prospects as the week comes to a close, however. Here's why, and what to look for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Intel (INTC)It would be easy to give up on Intel here, after the reversal that began to take shape in late May seems to have stalled. It's too soon to throw in the towel just yet, though. INTC stock has found support right where it needed to most, and may only simply be preparing its next move.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) If such an effort is brewing and manages to take hold, however, there's a fair amount of upside that could actually be captured in a short period of time.  Click to Enlarge• The support in question was offered by the critical 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. This week, it's kept Intel from sinking any lower (highlighted).• That support, however, will mean nothing until INTC stock moves above the gray 100-day moving average line, which more or less coincides with a handful of highs around the $50.50 level.• The long-term pattern favors a move above current levels. Pushing up and off of a support level that now tags all the key lows since the beginning of 2018, plotted in red on both stock charts, a move to the $58 area would repeat and complete the pattern.• Still, there's a decided lack of volume behind the bullish effort thus far. Mohawk Industries (MHK)At the beginning of this month Mohawk Industries was pegged as a good breakout candidate. Though the thrust from June had rolled over, it found a technical floor at the idea spot and turned high again. The move underscored a much bigger upside effort that started to take shape late last year.MHK has knocked over another impasse in the meantime. The technical ceiling that capped the early July gain where June's peak was to be found has been hurdled as well. The backdrop isn't too shabby either.  Click to Enlarge• The technical ceiling in question is $153.50, plotted in blue on both stock charts, marking where Mohawk made its last two highs.• Though hardly above average, the volume that had been missing since the late-June bounce is finally starting to take shape.• The rebound from last year's miserable pullback puts that weakness well into the rearview mirror, but also leaves no clear technical ceiling. Last July's high near $228 is the next most plausible resistance. eBay (EBAY)The initial reaction to Wednesday's post-close earnings report from eBay was extreme bullishness, unwinding a sizeable (even if not earth-shattering) setback suffered during Wednesday's regular hours action. It looked like the pause since mid-June was going to give way to a new rally.Thursday's bullishness faded quickly though, and in a big way. While EBAY stock still ended the day with a gain, it ended the day well below the highs, and the stage is set for much more weakness with even just the slightest of slipups.  Click to Enlarge• Tall bars made on high volume often indicate pivot points. In this case two consecutive tall bars on volume surges suggest that the profit-takers were and are tearing in, and were planning to do so no matter what.• Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can see that the last overbought condition that coincided with a pullback from a tall weekly bar from early 2018 turned out to be a major pivot point as well.• The key here is the $38.84 area, marked in yellow on the daily chart. That's where eBay shares made a low on Wednesday, but also in late June. A move under that level could prove problematic.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

As I look around for a nugget of information that might excite investors, the only thing I can come up with is the appointment of five executives for the company's European operations on July 5.      * 10 Small-Cap, Up-And-Coming Stocks to Keep on Your Radar &quot;Having strong people on our team is critical to our success and growth,&quot; said Sascha Mielcarek, Tilray's managing director of Europe, about the five executives hired. &quot;We're thrilled to welcome this group of highly skilled leaders to our team. Arne, Jose, Maike, Nadja and Natalie all join Tilray with wide-ranging experience in regulated industries. We're confident their appointments will accelerate our global growth strategy and help strengthen our position in Europe and other international markets.&quot;   Portugal will serve as the company's hub of operations in Europe. In April, the company launched its $20 million, 250,000-square-foot facility in Cantanhede, Portugal. As part of the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the company showed off its new facility to local government officials and Canadian healthcare professionals. The tour came on the heels of a successful indoor harvest at the facility. It now plans to hire 200 employees for the facility, which produces pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis. Portugal looks to become one of the leaders in the European medical market, which is expected to hit $65.6 billion by 2028.Although Italy and Germany are easily the two largest medical markets in Europe, Portugal is likely to punch above its weight as the European cannabis industry continues to mature. Having several executives in place who understand the regulatory nature of cannabis will be helpful as Tilray stakes out its piece of the global marketplace. It's not news that Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is investing in Tilray, but it is crucial to the company's development in Europe.  The Company's Cultivation RecordI'm not as concerned about how much cannabis Tileay produces as I am about the kinds of products it's got in the development pipeline. As I said in June, the company's purchase of Manitoba Harvest for $316 million, wasn't a flashy deal, but it got Tilray into the CBD-infused foods market in North America, which is going to be huge. It's the quality of Tilray's partnerships that matter, not necessarily the cultivation numbers at the present moment. Having a research partnership with Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) that could lead to the production of cannabis-infused beverages is more important at this point than the total number of kilograms of cannabis it's sold to date.My InvestorPlace colleague Luke Lango recently pointed out that Tilray sold only 3,000 kilograms of cannabis in the latest quarter, one-third the amount of both Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB). While that's true, I still believe that the dry flower isn't going to be the major winner in a global cannabis industry; the winners are going to be edibles and cannabis-infused beverages with the dry flower commoditized to a certain extent. Maybe I'll be proven wrong, but I don't think so. Lagging behind Canopy and Aurora isn't the death knell for Tilray.  The Bottom Line on TLRY StockAs we've moved further into 2019, I've become more positive about Tilray's chances of becoming a global player in the cannabis space. I wouldn't have said that a year ago. As a CEO, Brendan Kennedy seems far more focused on the bigger picture while remaining patient about the speed at which Tilray grows. That's fantastic news if you own Tilray stock.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season However, I still feel as though Tilray hasn't earned enough street cred to be valued higher than Canopy or Aurora based on price-to-sales, price-to-book, or some other metric that's an apples-to-apples comparison. If it drops to $35, I'll change my tune.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The S&P 500 ended Wednesday's action at 2924.43, up 0.82%, and in the middle of several moving average lines.Source: Shutterstock Target (NYSE:TGT), incredibly enough, led the charge, rallying more than 20% on the heels of an impressive second-quarter report. Same-store sales grew 3.4%, and e-commerce revenue was up 34%. That's a tremendous win for the retailer, which got a slow start on the digital sales front.Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) knocked it out of the park too, rallying more than 5% in front of its post-close report, then adding more than 10% in response to its solid quarterly earnings figure. Although sales came up short of expectations, income of 90 cents per share easily topped expectations of only 77 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot every name was a winner, though. Holding the market back more than most others was Cree (NASDAQ:CREE), and its 16% stumble. Although the chipmaker topped last quarter's sales and profit expectations, investors were horrified of its guidance for the quarter now underway.As Thursday's action gets going, however, it's the stock charts of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) that are of the most interest. Philip Morris International (PM)A year ago, Philip Morris International was in real trouble. PM stock was not only trending lower, it plunged April and wasn't acting as if there was any interest in a recovery. Even once the bulls started to test the waters by October, they had the rug pulled out from underneath them. In one fell swoop in December, Philip Morris was deep into new 52-week territory.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More Things do seem to have taken a turn for the better in the meantime though. While it has been anything but a straight-line effort, the choppiness has also been net bullish. One more good 'umph' could push PM shares over the hump.  Click to Enlarge• It started in March, but that effort buckled until it was renewed in July. That's when Philip Morris broke back above the falling resistance line plotted in red on the weekly chart.• It doesn't look like it on the daily chart, but it's there. All the moving average lines, and the stock itself, are converging to a point that could be setting up an explosive divergence.• Although the undertow is bullish, there's still a significant ceiling ahead. As marked on the weekly chart, in blue, the $92.86 level has capped a couple of rally efforts since late last year. News Corp (NWSA)A week and a half ago, News Corp shares jumped higher, pivoting out of a lull at a point exactly where support would be expected to be found. The move rekindled a big gain in June that shook shares out of a rut and possibly back into an uptrend.That move persisted for a couple more days, albeit at a slower pace, until finally a familiar technical ceiling stopped the effort cold. The subsequent pullback was quelled as well though, with the advance rekindled last week. Although the ceiling remains in place, the odds of punching through this effort improve every day.  Click to Enlarge• The technical ceiling is around $14.40, plotted with a yellow line on both stock charts, where shares peaked in November and again earlier this month.• The daily chart of News Corp also makes clear that the white 200-day moving average line and now the blue 20-day moving average line are serving as support, ending selloffs.• As of yesterday, the gray 100-day moving average has moved above the 200-day line, and all four key moving average lines are sloped upward. The underlying momentum is undeniably bullish. Bank of America (BAC)Banks like Bank of America aren't in absolute dire straits, despite the recent rate cut. Though lower rates mean weaker profit margins on lending activity, the economy is reasonably healthy. Banks, including B of A, will be fine.That doesn't mean BAC stock is going to hold up against a near-term bear attack though. A well-established but sinking floor was met again last week, and though traders pushed up and off of it a little bit, it's still within reach of a break below that floor. And, the backdrop is less than encouraging.  Click to Enlarge• The support in focus is marked with a red dashed line on both stock charts. It connects most of the major lows since the middle of last year, and is clearly moving lower.• It has been messy on this front since the beginning of the year, we're on the cusp of seeing shorter-term moving average lines slide below longer-term moving averages.• It's only evident on the weekly chart, but it's crystal clear there … there's growing volume behind the recent weakness.

The ministry has proposed that the government issue an executive order banning the devices in the public interest, saying it was needed to ensure e-cigarettes don't become an ""epidemic"" among children and young adults.  Health officials are proposing jail terms of up to three years, with a penalty of up to 500,000 rupees ($7,000), for repeat offenders against the new rules, according to a draft of the executive order.","Exclusive: India proposes ban on e-cigarettes, with jail terms for offenders - government documents"

2019-08-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Big food is salivating over fake meat after the blockbuster initial public offering of Beyond Meat Inc., the leading plant-based protein brand, in May.  Traditional producers have rushed into the booming market for meat substitutes, which threaten to take a slice of their business. Tyson Foods Inc. was an early investor in Beyond Meat, but sold its stake before the company’s trading debut and announced its own line of faux meat. Other U.S. companies, such as Smithfield Foods Inc., are introducing alternative protein products. European giants are getting in on the act too, with Nestle SA snapping up California-based Sweet Earth two years ago and Unilever NV buying The Vegetarian Butcher last year.It’s a familiar playbook. The big drinks companies have bought craft brewers. Major cosmetics houses are blending more artisan scents into perfumes. But there’s one segment where the similarities – and potential pitfalls -- are striking: tobacco, which is trying to woo smokers with the products they describe as lower risk, such as electronic cigarettes. Just as the tobacco industry has turned to vaping products to cope with high taxes and declining rates of smoking, big food sees a growing market for meat substitutes as people eat less animal protein and governments slap taxes on their other unhealthy products (and even consider levies on red meat). But traditional food manufacturers eager for vegan profits may struggle with some of the same obstacles tobacco has faced with vaping: adoption and regulation.Just look at Japan. It’s the most developed nation for devices that heat, rather than burn, tobacco, accounting for about 25% of the market. While tech-savvy early adopters were quick to switch to the new devices, older generations were slower to follow suit.Meat substitutes could see a similar trajectory. Analysts at Barclays Plc point out that men drive demand for meat. Convincing them –particularly older generations to switch -- will be crucial. Plant protein substitutes also tend to be more expensive. The premium will need to be whittled away for consumption to be widespread.While there’s no suggestion that fake meat products cause harm in any way – as has been alleged in some cases with vaping –  not everyone agrees that they are healthier than animal protein. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said it would not be stocking meat alternatives because they are too processed for the burrito chain. Beyond Meat has hit back at the claims, saying that its products and facilities are more transparent than those in the meat industry. More importantly, faux meat manufacturers will need to keep innovating – and investing – to grow, just as tobacco companies have had to come up with ways to make electronic cigarettes more satisfying for smokers to encourage them to switch. Plant-based protein producers will need to stay one step ahead of the competition with new ingredients, akin to how the market for milk substitutes expanded from soy to embrace soaring demand for nut and oat drinks. Beyond Meat and Nestle’s Sweet Earth use peas for their meatless dishes; Unilever’s The Vegetarian Butcher uses lupine beans to give some meals a fatty, nutty flavor. The possibilities are endless.Yet with innovation comes the risk of alienating consumers and inviting regulation. The magic ingredient at Impossible Foods Inc. – the other big independent plant-based protein maker – is heme, which gives its burgers a bloody meat-like taste. The ingredient is genetically engineered. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently found heme to be safe as a color additive, paving the way for sales in supermarkets. But using a genetically-engineered ingredient could turn off the very ethical, health-customers Impossible wants to attract.As big food courts vegans, it will confront pickier consumers than smokers-turned-vapers. Already some are worried about Burger King cooking the Impossible Whopper on the same grill as meat burgers, unless the customer asks for it to be prepared separately.A bigger danger would be if any plant products were found to contain animal traces. Impossible recently partnered with meat processor OSI Group to add more manufacturing capacity and ease supply constraints. It has dedicated capacity at OSI’s facilities, and the production line is not shared with animal-derived products. But it’s a risky move, and one that traditional meat producers going vegan will also have to manage.Like big tobacco, food manufacturers are already confronting challenges to the way they label products. States including Arkansas and Mississippi have banned companies from using the word “burgers” or “dogs” to describe plant-based alternatives. That’s a regulatory breeze compared the crackdown on vaping. In June, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to ban the sale of electronic cigarettes. But it’s still a headwind in what is a nascent industry. While the path of big tobacco highlights some of the challenges facing plant-based protein, there’s one more appetizing similarity. Last year, Altria Group Inc., which owns Philip Morris, took a 35% stake in Juul Labs Inc., the U.S. market-share leader in electronic cigarettes, valuing the company at $38 billion. Beyond Meat is now valued at a staggering $9 billion, almost a third of what food giant Tyson is worth. Such lofty valuations reflect long-term consumer trends. But as the tobacco industry has learned from its foray into alternatives, big food producers shouldn’t assume fake meat is an easy recipe for success.  To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Baker at stebaker@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-08-27,"S&P Global Ratings said there is insufficient information available regarding a potential all-stock merger between of equals between Philip Morris International Inc.  and Altria Group Inc.  to warrant any rating actions on either company. However, the credit rating agency said it believes there will be &quot;significant roadblocks&quot; to completing a merger, including agreeing on a valuation that both companies accept. &quot;Specifically, we believe there could be significant disagreement over the valuation of the companies' next-generation products given the heightened regulatory scrutiny over some products (i.e. e-cigarettes) and the uncertain impact future regulatory actions could have, particularly in the U.S.,&quot; S&P Global Ratings said. If there is more evidence in the coming months that a deal is likely, S&P said it would then assess the potential rating of the combined company. Currently, S&P rates Philip Morris credit at A and Altria credit at BBB, which is just two notches above junk. Altria's stock dropped 3.2% in afternoon trading and Philip Morris shares shed 7.0%.

2019-08-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Philip Morris International Inc. shares sank as much as 11% on Tuesday to their lowest since January, a sign that investors are concerned about talks to reunite with Altria Group Inc. more than a decade after their 2008 split.Some on Wall Street see the deal as better for Altria shareholders than for Philip Morris holders due to regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Altria gets all of its revenue from the U.S., while Philip Morris gets none.“I’m not really sure why this is a good idea” with a U.S. regulatory environment that has become “a lot more difficult to predict,” said Brian Barish, president and chief investment officer of Cambiar Investors, in a phone interview. The firm oversees $15 billion in assets but sold out of Philip Morris late last year.Investors generally agree that products stand to benefit from global integration and distribution, and that the combined company would have a “stronger and more predictable/stable cash flow profile,” said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog, a supporter of the deal.Timing of any deal or next step was not disclosed, but Barish said he’d be surprised if the Philip Morris board went forward “until there is more clarity” on the regulatory front. This may come in October, when the FDA is expected to provide more clarity on the industry, he said.Here’s more of what analysts and investors had to say:Wells Fargo, Bonnie HerzogSees “significant value creation” for shareholders of both companiesHas “long believed” that a combination “would make a lot of sense, especially now given Altria’s stake in Juul & IQOS coming to market shortly in the U.S.”Rates both stocks outperformMorgan Stanley, Pamela KaufmanSees “limited strategic rationale for a potential merger” given soft U.S. cigarette fundamentals and regulatory risk; also sees “limited scope” for synergies and “minimal” earnings gains (based on an assumed deal price of $49-$53 per share)With Philip Morris boosting that its goal is to have a “smoke-free world,” increasing its combustibles exposure seems contrary to its strategyPotential merits of deal include: Altria proving Philip Morris with a steady stream of U.S. dollar-denominated earnings and cash flow to offset foreign exchange volatility; Philip Morris getting full control of IQOS in the U.S. and facilitating Juul’s international expansion through its distribution footprintRates Philip Morris overweight and Altria equal-weight.Bernstein, Callum ElliottSome merit in a re-merger, but ultimately believes that Altria’s Juul stake “could prove problematic” and remains “unconvinced that Philip Morris would be incentivised to push the product internationally”Philip Morris shares likely face “significant” valuation risks; combined company would be unlikely to trade at Philip Morris’s premium valuation with about 40% of earnings exposed to U.S. regulatory risks and slower growing U.S. market.Rates Philip Morris outperform, price target $99, and rates Altria market perform, price target $53.What Bloomberg Intelligence says“We view positively Philip Morris’ announcement that it’s in talks to recombine with Altria in all-stock deal.” “The move has much merit to broaden their combined opportunity to capitalize on growing global demand for noncombustible devices and create an entity better able to exploit legal cannabis market opportunities worldwide.”&#92;-- Kenneth Shea, senior consumer products analyst&#92;-- Click here for the researchJefferies, Ryan TomkinsWhile a merger “makes sense and will create a more valuable company when combined, we do think it is strange timing given possible risk to Juul in the U.S. with regards to regulatory action”Little cost synergies besides corporate overheads and leaf buyingThat said, there could be “sizable” revenue opportunities as the international outlook for Juul improves with the help of Philip Morris’s distribution and sees value creation as IQOS in the U.S. would become more efficient under one ownershipSees greater value for Altria shareholders. He rates Philip Morris and Altria hold.Gardner Russo & Gardner, Thomas Russo“I’m surprised by the timing and the conversation as are the rest of the market,” Russo said in a telephone interviewThat said, he sees how a potential combination could benefit both companiesAltria is now “a much leaner organization and one in which it’s conceivable that many of the services duplicated by their foreign former brother firm could be share”“Same brands, same brand heritage and hence a shared voice might lead to savings and also increased effectiveness”NOTE: The firm held 9.3 million Phillip Morris shares and almost 5 million Altria shares as of June 30, according to data compiled by BloombergTo contact the reporters on this story: Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.net;Tatiana Darie in New York at tdarie1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Philip Morris-Altria Reunion Divides a Worried Wall Street

2019-08-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Philip Morris International Inc., the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in overseas markets, is in talks to reunite with Altria Group Inc. more than 10 years after the tobacco giants split their operations.Altria shares reversed earlier gains to fall as much as 3.3% on Tuesday. Philip Morris declined as much as 11%. The deal would be the biggest since AT&T Inc. bid for Time Warner in 2016. Philip Morris had a market value of nearly $126.4 billion at the close of trading on Aug. 23, before speculation of a possible deal gained traction, while Altria was worth about $86.7 billion.The companies broke apart more than a decade ago, bowing to pressure from U.S. investors who wanted higher dividends and more share buybacks. The move was also pitched as a way to set free faster-growing overseas operations while the U.S. business was entangled in smoker lawsuits.But times have changed. Altria has recently diversified its portfolio with investments in vaping and cannabis, giving the company more growth potential even as fewer people smoke cigarettes. Some analysts and investors have argued that the companies should get back together, a move that would give Philip Morris more U.S. exposure.The transaction would give Philip Morris roughly 58% ownership of the new company, with Altria holding the rest, according to a person familiar with the terms who asked not to be identified because the details haven’t been made public.They are considering a no-premium deal based on the companies’ closing share prices on Aug. 23, according to the person. The companies would aim to close the deal within six months and expect to make no divestitures, the person said.Alternative ProductsThere’s been speculation that the companies might get back together. On Monday, Wells Fargo published a research note that said a deal could make sense now, in part because Altria has a stake in the vaping company Juul.A reunification would combine two of the most popular smoking alternative products: IQOS and Juul. Philip Morris has been plowing billions of dollars in promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions consumers outside the U.S.. Altria meanwhile has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., which has catapulted itself to the U.S. industry leader in smoking alternatives in just a few years.Altria also has been planning to start selling IQOS in the U.S. this year, testing out demand in the Atlanta area with a store opening next month.Philip Morris said in a statement that no agreement has been formally reached and any deal would be subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval. Altria also issued a statement confirming the talks.Like Hollywood, which has been churning out films based on blockbusters of decades past, Wall Street bankers seem to be running out of new ideas. Earlier this month, CBS Corp. agreed to reunite with Viacom Inc. in an $11.7 billion transaction, 13 years after the two media giants split.Analysts were largely positive on a potential tie-up between Altria and Philip Morris after speculation Monday afternoon that something was brewing. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi saw several strategic reasons for a deal, including geographic alignment with international competitors and full economic benefit of IQOS in the U.S. and global access for Juul.“The potential to reunite the companies has been often discussed, but we did not believe this would occur given the heavy regulatory burden in the U.S. market and its weakening growth profile,” Stifel analyst Chris Growe said in a note. “Perhaps the FDA’s approval of IQOS changed that thinking.”Antitrust RiskThe tie-up would face little antitrust risk because the companies’ brands don’t compete in the same markets, said Kenneth Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. That contrasts with the last major tobacco deal: Reynolds American Inc.’s 2015 takeover of Lorillard Inc. The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews tobacco deals, required Reynolds to sell four brands to Imperial Tobacco Group to resolves antitrust concerns.One area of likely scrutiny would be the combined company’s control of the vaping market, said Shea, given Altria’s 35% stake in Juul and its agreement to sell IQOS in the U.S. for Philip Morris.“Depending on how regulators define the vapor market, there could be potential for perceived excessive control,” he said.(Adds quote from analyst about antitrust concerns in last three paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Thomas Mulier, Catherine Larkin, Ed Hammond, Matthew Monks, Janet Freund and David McLaughlin.To contact the reporters on this story: Jonathan Roeder in Mexico City at jroeder@bloomberg.net;Craig Giammona in New York at cgiammona@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa WolfsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Philip Morris in Talks to Reunite With Altria in All-Stock Deal

Altria spun PM off more than a decade ago, and the two companies sell the same cigarette brands, with Altria in the U.S. market and Philip Morris selling them in other international markets.  The breakup was a success for shareholders of both companies, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said in a Tuesday note to investors that the last two years ""have created significant uncertainty, and the future of tobacco is a lot more dynamic than it was in 2008,"" when the breakup occurred.","Altria, Philip Morris Discuss Reunion Merger: Analyst Says Deal Makes 'Strategic Sense'"
2019-08-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Philip Morris and Altria, two tobacco giants valued at about $100 billion each, are in talks to merge in what would be the industry’s biggest deal ever. Their goal: join forces to quickly concentrate nicotine addicts around new non-cigarette products before competition heats up or more people quit smoking altogether. On Tuesday, amid recent M&A speculation, Philip Morris International Inc. confirmed that it is, in fact, in discussions to recombine with its sister company, Altria Inc., from which it was spun off in 2008. The deal, if consummated, would give Philip Morris 58% ownership of the combined entity and would award no premium to Altria shareholders, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. I’ve written about the merits of a possible transaction again and again and again, and now it may actually happen. The main reasons, in a nutshell, are cash flow and something called IQOS (more on that in a moment). Altria is best known for producing Marlboro, the top-selling cigarette both in the U.S. and globally. Philip Morris is responsible for selling the brand in international markets. But while cigarettes are still the overwhelming source of their profits, you’d never know it from looking at either of their corporate websites. In fact, it’d be easy to mistake them for organizations advocating against smoking, rather than profiting from it. Altria’s online homepage talks of “Tobacco Harm Reduction,” and you’d be hard-pressed to find any mentions of their cigarette brands. Here’s a snippet from Philip Morris’s rather artful landing page:Altria and Philip Morris have tried to remake their images in recent years into something more wholesome-seeming, diverting attention and resources to what they call “smoke-free” products, such as tobacco-heating sticks and e-cigarettes that yield vapors instead. This about-face comes as the prevalence of smoking in the U.S. falls to about 13%, down from more than 20% a decade ago, a precipitous trend that’s similar around the world. The companies’ key new product is called IQOS (pronounced eye-kose) that heats tobacco rather than burning it. Philip Morris has been selling IQOS in Europe and Japan, and in last month’s earnings statement it explained why the product is gaining such strong traction – just like regular sticks, it’s reliably addictive:IQOS delivers nicotine in levels close to combustible cigarettes suggesting a likelihood that IQOS users may be able to completely transition away from combustible cigarettes and use IQOS exclusively.Altria has the exclusive license to sell IQOS in the U.S. beginning next month, making its debut in Atlanta stores, after gaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval earlier this year. By acquiring Altria, Philip Morris will get to keep the IQOS profits that come from the U.S. instead of having to split them. Altria also has a 45% stake in Cronos Group Inc., one of Canada’s fast-growing cannabis companies, and a 35% economic interest in Juul Labs Inc., the controversial maker of the leading e-cigarette. Last week, an Illinois adult resident became the first recorded death from a mystery respiratory ailment that health officials believe is linked to e-cigarettes.Altria throws off $6 billion to $8 billion of free cash flow every year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would enable Philip Morris to make a greater push for IQOS and Juul globally, as well as help fund future dividends and share buybacks.Valuations for both companies have languished in recent years. To the extent the cigarette giants’ grip on consumers was also slipping, this is how to get it back.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-08-28,"(Bloomberg) -- British American Tobacco Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc. risk falling further behind in fast-growing cigarette alternatives should Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc. complete the biggest tobacco deal ever.Analysts said BAT may be the biggest loser if New York-based Philip Morris succeeds in combining with Richmond, Virginia-based Altria. Shares of BAT fell Wednesday, extending the two-day slump to as much as 6.5%. Japan Tobacco dropped less than 1% in Tokyo.The proposed combination would reunite two companies that split more than 11 years ago and result in a behemoth that would outrank BAT as the world’s largest publicly traded cigarette maker. Plus, it would put two of the most successful smoking alternatives, Juul and IQOS, together under the same roof.BAT’s new chief executive officer, Jack Bowles, faces unprecedented pressure to jump-start its underperforming portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products such as electronic cigarettes. The company has lost almost half of its market value in the past two years. The maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes lowered the outlook for growth in cigarette alternatives for both this year and last.The transaction would give Philip Morris about 58% ownership of the new company, according to a person familiar with the terms who asked not to be identified because the deal hasn’t been made public. The firms are considering a transaction based on Altria’s market value as of the close on Aug. 23, which was about $87 billion.The Marlboro-maker split up in 2008, making two companies with different strategies in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Now, they’re embracing again as Big Tobacco faces severe disruption amid declines in cigarette use and the rise of smoking alternatives.Philip Morris has invested billions of dollars in its heat-not-burn product IQOS, and Altria has the right to start selling the device in the U.S. this year, starting with a store in Atlanta next month. Altria has also invested about $13 billion in Juul, which could speed up its expansion worldwide with Philip Morris’s help.The deal would heighten prospects for further M&A, according to Jefferies analyst Ryan Tomkins. Speculation has been smoldering that BAT and Japan Tobacco could consider a joint bid for Imperial Brands Plc, which had been one of the most successful e-cigarette vendors in the U.S. until Juul came along. However, both of the potential bidders are struggling with the industry decline and have significant debt from past acquisitions.Shares of Japan Tobacco, the world’s third largest publicly traded cigarette maker, have dropped for three consecutive years to touch the lowest level since 2012 last week. Japan Tobacco has a market value of $42 billion, compared with $84 billion for Altria and $131 billion for Philip Morris. BAT is worth about $80 billion.Although Japan Tobacco does minimal business in the U.S., it sells cigarette brands such as Winston and Mevius across the globe. If those markets gain a significant Juul presence, it would cut into sales of traditional smokes and threaten earnings.Japan Tobacco has had difficulty gaining traction with its own heated tobacco business, Ploom Tech, and it’s starting to drag on results. The company earlier this month cut its full-year earnings forecast partly due to weaker-than-anticipated sales tied to its high-tech smoking devices.Chief Financial Officer Naohiro Minami said Ploom Tech has struggled with keeping repeat customers, and the company was having trouble managing production costs related to the devices.The increased competition may force Japan Tobacco to double down on its parallel strategy of seeking growth in traditional cigarettes in emerging markets. While its rivals have been staking their future more heavily on new smokeless tobacco products, Japan Tobacco has viewed the sector as just one alternative and has been expanding more than rivals by snapping up local players in emerging markets from Indonesia to Russia over the past several years.While the company has aimed to boost growth with traditional cigarettes in places where smoking rates are still high, currency volatility has weighed on international results in recent quarters. Also, the long-term term prospects for cigarettes remains a question as global demand falls and smoking regulations tighten.&#92;--With assistance from Lisa Pham and Jeff Sutherland.To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Mulier in Geneva at tmulier@bloomberg.net;Lisa Du in Tokyo at ldu31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, ;Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, John Lauerman, Frank ConnellyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","BAT, Japan Tobacco Face Threat From Philip Morris-Altria Combo"

To that end, Philip Morris shares fell nearly 8%, albeit on lower volume, on the unpopularity of the idea among its shareholders.Yet, there were some winners. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them, up 5% after a very well-received opening of its first store in China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow As for names worth a look headed into the midpoint of the trading week though, take a look at the stock charts of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). Here's what's most noteworthy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)It has more to do with the broad market and the industry itself than it does with the company. Nevertheless, UnitedHealth Group shares -- already fighting a losing battle -- started to break down in a big way last week. Yesterday's 3.1% tumble underscored how easily UNH stock could be up-ended.While the stage is perhaps set for a short-term dead cat bounce, even a modest recovery effort wouldn't be enough to undo the bulk of the damage that has been done just since the middle of last month.  *   Click to EnlargeChief among the technical problems here is a break back under what had been a support level tagging most of the key low since late last year, plotted in red. April's dip was an exception.  * Also note that the convergence of all the key moving average lines in February and March has since turned into a divergence … a bearish one. The blue 20-day and purple 50-day moving average lines have since turned into technical resistance as well (highlighted).  * It's a bit difficult to see in detail, but many of the daily selloffs since the middle of July have been on high volume. That bearish volume has been persistently above average the past few days. eBay (EBAY)In the middle of last month, eBay was put under the trading microscope. After it punched through a technical ceiling just under $39 in June, a couple of very rough days were testing that level again as resistance.It ended up surviving, against the odds. But, that reprieve may have only been temporary. The bears took another shot early this month, and although EBAY stock bounced off the former ceiling near $39, the bears started to take another shot on Friday. The outlook is not encouraging for a couple of different reasons.  * The 10 Biggest Winners From Second-Quarter Earnings   *   Click to EnlargeSince the last look, the gray 100-day moving average line has stepped up as a support level, although it has yet to spark a clear rebound.  * It's only a mild concern at this point, but notice how the &quot;down&quot; volume bars since the middle of last week are starting to grow taller, and taller than the green &quot;up&quot; volume bars.  * If the support around $39 should fail, two potential landing spots are already clear. One of them is the white 200-day moving average line, currently at $35.66, and the other is the floor around $35.40, where eBay found support several times earlier in the year. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Finally, it's not a name that's often analyzed from a charting or technical perspective. But, if Berkshire Hathaway is dropping technical hints, then it's dropping technical hints.And, that is what it's doing here. Although they're unsurprisingly subtle given the income-oriented nature of Buffett's portfolio, they're there, and they mean something. Indeed, given that Berkshire is a name preferred by the non-trader types, there's an argument to be made that the chart's shape tells us more about the changing viewpoint of the average investor than charts of more actively traded names. In this case, a big red flag is starting to wave.  *   Click to EnlargeIt's clear on both stock charts, but the perspective needed to fully appreciate the risk is more evident on the weekly chart. That is, BRK.B stock has already logged a string of lower highs, and is testing a major floor right around $198.  * It would be easy to miss in the entanglement, but all four key moving average lines are now sloped downward. It's a subtle clue that the momentum has taken a turn for the worst in all timeframes.  * Berkshire Hathaway will most likely move in the same direction as the broad market, and if that's lower, the next likely landing point is the line that connects the key lows from last year, plotted in yellow, just under $190.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Philip Morris is down 40%.Altria operates in the U.S. and has been aggressively moving away from dependence on tobacco in recent years.It got nearly 10% of Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) in 2016, plus $5.3 billion in cash, after that company bought SABMiller. It got the SAB stake in 2002, before the Philip Morris-Altria split, when it sold Miller Brewing for $5.6 billion.Altria put $1.8 billion into Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), a leading marijuana company, last December to get a 45% stake. Cronos opened for trade August 28 with a valuation of $3.7 billion, close to where it was at the time the deal was announced.Then Altria spent $12.8 billion buying 35% of Juul Labs last December, valuing the vaping company at $38 billion. At the time Juul had 75% of the e-cigarette market. The Failed Split of PM and MO StockThe original idea behind the 2009 split was that Philip Morris would have a growing international market while Altria would try to capitalize on a declining U.S. market.While Philip Morris sales are still growing, they're only up 10% in the last three years, from about $26.8 billion to $29.5 billion. Altria sales, meanwhile, have been nearly flat, at slightly over $25 billion per year.Combined, the two companies would be able to spread the financial power of alcohol, the growth of vaping, 8% per year, and the hope of pot profits to a global market.The two companies had combined net income of about $15 billion last year. Based on the relative values of the two companies, that would be spread across about 2.5 billion shares outstanding if they merge. The Bottom Line for MO StockCigarettes, pot and alcohol can all kill people, but only the tobacco business is in a long-term decline.Adding the possibility of marijuana and the reality of beer to the global mix offers at least a hope of growth and should protect the dividends of both companies. Altria's vaping unit can spread globally, while Philip Morris' electronic cigarettes would get a bigger lift in the U.S.Neither of these companies has been a great investment lately, even with Altria's rising dividend, because their valuation declines have both been bigger than the dividend income. If that can be arrested, shareholders will be pleased. * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Investors looking for income will hold their noses, cash their checks and hope for global growth out of Altria's diversification efforts.

2019-08-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Something must be done. That’s often the response to a big deal like the planned $200 billion union between cigarette makers Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc. For the duo’s competitors overseas, the temptation will be to indulge in some copycat dealmaking. In reality, bulking up would be a bad way to address their strategic challenges.There is some commercial logic in the tie-up of the two U.S. tobacco giants given their complementary businesses: each have sought to expand into alternative tobacco products in different ways. Altria took a minority stake in vaping group JUUL Labs Inc., while Philip Morris developed its IQOS system for heating rather than burning tobacco. Altria is focused solely on the U.S., Philip Morris on the rest of the world.Cost savings may be limited, but integration should be simple. Together, the pair can cross-sell some of their products in each other’s markets. By definition, there is no antitrust hurdle. It is harder to make comparable arguments for any combination involving British American Tobacco Plc, Japan Tobacco Inc. and Imperial Brands Plc.For BAT, which has a market value of 65 billion pounds ($79 billion), the appeal of a takeover of domestic rival Imperial, capitalized at 20 billion pounds, would merely be opportunistic and financial. Imperial’s shares have a dividend yield of more than 10%, a sign investors expect the annual payout will decline. The company’s net debt is forecast to fall to below three times Ebitda this year, whereas BAT’s net borrowings are expected to touch 3.6 times the same measure of profit. An all-share deal would therefore slightly improve BAT’s leverage and generate some cost savings from cutting duplicate functions.But such a transaction wouldn’t transform BAT’s position in tobacco alternatives. A slightly stronger financial position would be a modest benefit set beside the distraction of the integration and the likely need to make disposals to assuage antitrust concerns.Japan Tobacco, worth $42 billion, is substantially less geared, so an all-paper deal would achieve more in terms of reducing indebtedness. But it, too, could present antitrust issues for BAT. The presence of the Japanese government as lead shareholder would also be a complicating factor. It’s true both Imperial and Japan Tobacco are developing less risky tobacco products. But so, too, is BAT.One idea is that Japan Tobacco and BAT carve up Imperial’s geographical empire between them. The main outcome would, however, be to expand in conventional cigarettes. The wildcard buyer is Beijing-based China National Tobacco Corp.The only compelling M&A transaction would be one that enabled these companies to redeploy large parts of their manufacturing, marketing and distribution assets into products that weren’t just less harmful, but actually harmless. No banker has come up with that yet.The combination of Philip Morris and Altria may nudge others elsewhere toward M&A at some point. For now, the market’s caution around the mooted U.S. tie-up suggests the effect is going to be marginal.

The combination of PMI and Altria would be a reversal of the decision to separate 11 years ago.

2019-09-03,"When Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) first announced its partnership with Altria (NYSE:MO) last year, management discussed the various advantages that the company gained. Mentioned were Altria's proven expertise in brand management and product development, its ability to plan and capitalize on emerging market opportunities, and its research, development and technological capabilities.Source: Shutterstock Of course the biggest advantage was probably the huge cash infusion that Altria made into Cronos. Because of this, Cronos still has almost $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.This puts CRON stock in a strong position.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is Cronos Group Stock a Sin Stock?However, what Cronos' management didn't discuss is how this partnership effectively makes CRON stock a sin stock. If there ever was a sin stock, it's big MO. As one of the tens of millions of people who have seen loved ones die due to the effects of smoking, I have no problem expressing my belief that Altria, aka Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), is an unethical company and I would never invest my personal funds in it.But regardless of whether or not you share my beliefs, if you are interested in CRON stock this is something that you should be aware of. So-called sin stocks are stocks of companies that engage in what some people would consider immoral or unethical practices. This would include companies such as weapons makers and companies in the alcohol business. Of course, stocks involved in the production and sale of tobacco would also be included.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill This is the issue that should concern shareholders. Some of the largest institutions with money managers are state and union pension plans. Religious and educational endowments also have money which needs to be managed. Many of these institutions are focusing greater attention on ESG -- environmental, social and governance -- concerns when developing their investment strategies. Environmental, Social and Governance InvestingESG stands for environmental, social and governance. Institutions that are focusing on these concerns are considering not just the financials of a company when they perform their analysis. They are also considering the company's overall effect on the well being of society as part of the research process. Clearly, many of the business practices of Altria would not be acceptable to pass the ESG screening procedures that these institutions are implementing.Because of this, many of these wealthy institutions will not be able to invest in CRON stock. This could put the company at a serious disadvantage against its competitors. If an institution wants to invest in the cannabis market, many of the other growers would be much more attractive to them because they aren't considered to be sin stocks or have ESG concerns. This will lower demand for CRON stock, making it harder for the stock price to rise. A Closer Look at CRON StockCRON stock has trended lower since breaking support at the $14 level.

Some investors have been initially tepid about the deal to create a new tobacco titan, that said the question for cannabis stakeholders is whether this massive transaction is in fact about tobacco.

2019-09-04,"No matter how uncomfortable Big Tobacco makes us feel, the cigarette companies are going to remain attractive stock buys. Share prices can vary, up or down, but these companies typically offer reliable rewards for investors, with steady income streams and positive cash flows.Now that’s not to say the market won’t change. Alternative nicotine delivery systems, such as e-cig and heat-not-burn options, are going to define the future of these companies. Additionally, Big Tobacco sees a logical long-term partner in the emerging cannabis industry, which some industry analysts say can reach $66 billion by 2025. According to Altria CEO Howard Willard, a diverse portfolio will position his company to succeed as the tobacco landscape evolves away from traditional cigarettes. A Union of Tobacco GiantsThis junction of alternative nicotine and cannabis helps explain the rumors we have been hearing – now confirmed by both companies – about a ‘merger of equals’ agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (MO) and Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM). Early reports indicate the merger will be an all stock deal, giving PM 59% and MO 41% of the combined company. The split ratio simply reflects size of each company’s market cap.A merger between these two tobacco companies will bring advantages to both. There is the obvious – combining customer bases, supply and distribution networks, marketing costs. More importantly, however, are the different paths they have each taken toward the alternative nicotine products that will shape the future of their industry.Philip Morris has already invested some $6 billion dollars in the iQOS heated tobacco product, and has cultivated over 11 million users world-wide. For its own part, Altria has spent $12.8 billion building a 35% stake in the largest US e-cigarette company, JUUL. Altria also has a 45% stake, worth $1.8 billion, in Canada’s Cronos Group, Inc. (CRON), giving it a foot into the rapidly growing legal cannabis market. A PM-MO merger would help both companies with their fading cigarette business, but it also brings together a powerful combination of emerging tobacco and cannabis interests. Altria Group, Inc. (MO)Writing from Wells Fargo, 3-star analyst Bonnie Herzog sees both PM and MO as buying opportunities in light of their merger plans. Of Philip Morris, she notes that joining MO will improve the value of iQOS: “PM will capture the full margin and accelerate the growth of iQOS in the U.S. given its full control over sales and distribution.” She makes a similar point about Altria, saying that “MO is more attractive with its stake in JUUL, given JUUL’s clear dominance in the US e-cig/vapor market and international ambitions.” Herzog puts a $102 price target on PM shares, while declining to attach a specific target to her Buy rating on MO.RBC Capital’s Nik Modi is less reticent, and puts a $68 target with his Buy on MO. He says the merger “makes strategic sense,” and says, “The combined entity would give BAT and Imperial products exposure to the U.S. markets and reduce FX headwinds for PM International, while giving Altria's JUUL more global exposure.” His target suggests a 55% upside to Altria.Overall, MO holds a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 5 recent buy ratings and 3 holds. Shares are selling for $43.74, and the average price target of $56.17 implies an upside potential of 28% for the stock. Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM)Christopher Growe, of Stifel, describes the Altria-Philip Morris merger as “game changing” for both companies. He says of the Philip Morris side, “Ultimately, this transaction would represent a bold vote of confidence in the potential in iQOS in the US.” He gives PM a solid Buy rating ahead of the final merger talks, but without a price target.Philip Morris also holds a consensus rating of Moderate Buy, based on 8 buys, 1 hold, and 1 sell given in the last three months. The average price target, $97, suggests a solid 34% upside potential from the current share price of $72. Cronos Group, Inc. (CRON)Tobacco won’t be the only industry affected by an Altria-Philip Morris merger. As noted above, Altria brings to that table, among other assets, a 45% stake in Cronos Group, one of the larger players in Canada’s cannabis industry. We have noted before in this space some of the advantages that Altria’s investment opened up for Cronos: access for the Canadian company to Altria’s experience in processing and packaging smoking products, along with enhanced distribution networks. What’s equally important, however, is what Cronos brings to Altria: a new product, and a foot into a new market.Looking at Cronos’ future, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery initiated coverage with a Buy rating and an $18 price target. He wrote, “We expect Cronos to have modest near-term revenues from Canadian cannabis production, but believe it has significant potential growth opportunities with CBD products in the US.” He adds that due to Altria’s investment in the company, CRON should have a “premium valuation;” the company has access to $1.8 billion in cash; to Altria’s 230,000 retail outlets in the US market; and to JUUL, where the application of vapor products to the emerging cannabis industry is clear. Lavery’s price target on CRON suggests an upside potential of 59% for the stock.CRON is another Moderate Buy stock in the analyst consensus, based on 3 buys, 3 holds, and 1 sell. The current share price is $11.30, and the average price target of $17.63 implies an impressive upside of 56%. It’s worth noting here that even CRON’s low-estimate price target is higher than the current share price. Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC)We’ve been looking at so-called ‘sin’ stocks, which take their name, and profits, from the catalog of human foibles. The list won’t be complete, however, without Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC). Canopy is the largest of the Canadian cannabis companies – by market cap, by potential production, by sales – and like Cronos, it has the backing of a ‘sin’ giant. In Canopy’s case, the backer is Constellation Brands (STZ), the owner of Corona and Modelo beers, the largest beer importer to the US market.Canopy’s former CEO, Bruce Linton, sought out Constellation’s backing as part of his vision for the company’s growth, and Constellation responded with a $4 billion investment, a 38% stake in the company, and control over Canopy’s Board of Directors. Constellation also fired Linton earlier this year, after Canopy reported two straight quarters of steep losses. Linton had a vision leading toward $1 billion annual revenues, but Constellation wasn’t willing to wait for a return on that sizable investment.As a result, Canopy has been experiencing some turmoil. The company is seeking a new CEO, share prices are down by half this year, and yet… CGC remains a buy rated stock. As noted above, Canopy is backed by Constellation Brands. In addition, in the last quarter its cannabis production grew four-fold year-over-year and more than 12% sequentially, and the company has a market cap of $8.2 billion – by far the largest in the Cannabis industry.Seaport Global analyst Brett Hundley sees a clear path to recovery for Canopy in the so-called ‘2.0 market’ in Canada’s cannabis industry. 2.0 refers to the coming legalization and development of additional cannabis products, including vapes, edibles, and beverages. Hundley writes, “In addition, the Canadian space is about to gain a fair amount of pricing power, in our view, as the 2.0 market opens up late this year. We think Canopy can regain some lost share of shelf, as it leverages R&D, IP and partnerships to bring leading value-added products to market.” As the cannabis market expands, Canopy’s connection with Constellation will become more valuable.In light of CGC’s clear long-term strengths, Hundley rates the stock a buy and gives it a $31 price target. His target implies a 24% upside to the stock.Canopy’s analyst consensus rating is a Moderate Buy, firmly based on 10 buys and 5 holds. The average price target of $39 implies an impressive 60% upside from the current share price of $24.Find out what stocks are hot now with TipRanks’ Trending Stocks tool.","4 ‘Sin’ Stocks for the Future – Altria (MO), Philip Morris (PM), Cronos (CRON), and Canopy (CGC)"

2019-09-09,"[Editor's note: &quot;3 Top Tobacco Stocks Still Burning Strong&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.] In many respects, the top tobacco stocks defy logic. The Surgeon General's Office released its warning about the dangers of tobacco in 1964. Despite a sustained anti-smoking crusade, tobacco stocks continued marching higher. As the climate at home became more hostile, these firms have found new customers overseas.They also found other sources of revenue. The latest new source for tobacco stocks? The cannabis industry. Long illegal throughout the world, marijuana continues to gain both acceptance and legal status. Moreover, anyone who pays even scant attention to business news knows marijuana stocks continue to rise. This industry could easily become a new profit center for tobacco companies. Furthermore, tobacco companies know how to navigate the hostile regulatory climate cannabis will face, particularly in the United States.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy Whatever direction the tobacco industry takes, I would not bet on its decline despite the negative public image of cigarettes. With new product lines and creative marketing, I think the following top tobacco stocks should continue to perform well.Source: Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)[/ipm_caption] Altria Group, Inc. (MO)Perhaps no large company defines the top tobacco stocks more than Altria (NYSE:MO). Altria manages to keep profits moving higher, despite its core product's falling popularity. The parent company for brands like Marlboro (in the U.S.) and Parliaments has also emphasized so-called &quot;reduced risk products&quot; such as smokeless tobacco. Moreover, it could profit further if the FDA approves IQOS, a smoke-free cigarette popular in other countries. And, like its counterparts in the beverage industry, Altria has also explored investing in cannabis.All of this will serve to benefit those who want the generous levels of dividend income that MO produces. This track record of payouts goes back decades. Investors who bought in the fall of 1985 and held now make their original investment back every year in dividends alone. For those who reinvest dividends, investors who bought in the spring of 2003 now have achieved the same feat.The company will occasionally pay an outsized payout followed by a dividend reduction. Still, the dividend has risen annually for the last 10 years. Investors buying today will still enjoy a yield of 7.66%.Continuing to pay this dividend should not be an issue in the future either. Analysts, on average, predict its profits will increase by 5% this year. They also project an average of 6.8% annual growth over the next five years. Current earnings also place the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at 9.8.That allows investors to buy into this generous dividend stream at a discount. Given MO's ability to mitigate the negative sentiment surrounding tobacco, and its potential in the cannabis industry, I think these benefits will accrue for years to come.Source: Shutterstock [/ipm_caption] Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM)Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) spun off from Altria in 2008. As the name implies, it operates primarily outside of the U.S., despite the Manhattan address of its headquarters. Among top tobacco stocks, it remains best known for retaining the right to market Marlboro cigarettes outside of the U.S. (Altria holds the U.S. rights).While it remains a similar company to Altria in many respects, its non-U.S. focus gives it the advantage of not having to deal directly with federal regulation. As a result, it has led the way in IQOS in other countries. Its non-U.S. focus also gives this company an advantage over Altria if it wants to make deals with cannabis companies.Due to its offshore focus, Phillip Morris International now exceeds the size of its original parent company. It holds a market cap of about $1114 billion, larger than Altria's market cap of about $92 billion. The forward P/E of 13 comes in somewhat higher than Altria. However, it usually trades at a slight premium to its former parent.On the dividend front, it lags the long-term history of Altria, but little else. The payout has risen every year since the company's 2008 spinoff. The recent increase takes the annual dividend to $4.56 per share, a yield of 6.34%.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy Despite the accolades, the PM stock price has fallen steadily since achieving a high of $122.90 per share in June 2017. It now trades almost 40% below this level. However, with its generous dividend, I think it presents a buying opportunity. If Phillip Morris International enters the marijuana business, investors can profit from both a high payout and hopefully, a rising stock price.Source: Shutterstock [/ipm_caption] Universal Corp. (UVV)Universal Corporation (NYSE:UVV) operates in a different segment than other top tobacco stocks. The company processes tobacco. It buys the plant directly from producers, refines it, and then sells it to product manufacturers.Given the overall decline of tobacco use throughout the world, I would typically take a cautious view on such a company. However, the company processes other products besides tobacco.Potentially, Universal could revive its fortunes by making a modest pivot into cannabis. Since it already processes other products, shifting into weed should not create any major operational shifts. Moreover, it also controls a supply chain useful for both procuring and distributing its product. This supply chain extends to over 30 countries on five different continents.Although the company has yet to announce such a move, investors may already have noticed this potential. UVV stock shot higher in the middle of last year as its operating income rose despite its falling sales. The stock subsequently lost most of its mid-2018 gains.The company remains small, as UVV's market cap is around $1.27 billion.Its current P/E is about 14, while its dividend stands at $3 per share. This amounts to a yield of 6%. It has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years.As a smaller company that processes tobacco, Universal might seem like a strange pick at first glance. However, its varied product base, small size and large dividend make UVV stock an intriguing play among top tobacco stocks.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-09-13,"Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) stock fell 5.2% on Sept. 9 as a result of investors' concerns about the cannabis company's focus on vaping products. Those offerings have come under severe scrutiny in recent weeks, due to the death of six people from lung disease related to their use. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCronos isn't the only cannabis company to have a vested interest in the success of vaping pens, but at the moment, it appears to be the biggest player taking it on the chin as a result of the recent health scare. If you own CRON stock, now is the time to be thankful that Altria (NYSE:MO) owns 45% of the cannabis company, with an option to buy an additional 10% in the future. Here are three reasons why that's the case.  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession  Altria Understands Lungs Better Than MostWho would have more knowledge about how our lungs operate than a company whose products are directly responsible for harming them?Altria would not have made a $12.8 billion investment in Juul Labs or a $1.8 billion investment in CRON stock if it didn't understand the health risks associated with vaping. MO has been down this road many times with cigarettes. The fact that President Trump and his administration are trying to crack down on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, while understandable, isn't really crucial for CRON stock. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 480,000 Americans die each year due to smoking. That's a staggering amount. However, we haven't seen cigarettes outlawed as a result of that sad situation. In fact, the FDA is currently trying to ban the sale of menthol cigarettes, but the tobacco companies will continue to fight the agency's legal efforts for years to come. Flavored e-cigarettes will likely take a long time to ban. The reality is that Altria understands what's at stake when it comes to vaping and e-cigarettes. They, along with the rest of the industry, are not going to go quietly into the night. Remember, the NRA isn't the only trade group in the U.S. with a powerful lobby.  CRON Stock and a Potential MergerIn recent weeks, Altria's been negotiating with Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), the owners of the Marlboro brand outside the U.S., to reunite after 11 years as separate companies. Last October, before Altria bought up a big chunk of CRON stock, I suggested that Philip Morris should make a play for one of Canada's big cannabis companies. &quot;The tobacco companies were born to manufacture and sell the various by-products of the cannabis plant which includes marijuana and hemp,&quot; I wrote at the time. &quot;The fact that only now are they considering a move -- after legalization in Canada -- suggests they've been irreparably scarred by years of tobacco litigation.&quot;Cowen & Co. analyst Vivien Azer recently suggested that the crackdown on vaping flavoring might be the nudge CRON and MO needed to officially tie the knot. After an acquisition, CRON would be controlled by a company with $54.7 billion pf annual  revenue and $14.3 billion in free cash flow, providing it with plenty of capital to fight any potential opposition to cannabis vaping in the future.  Altria Has a Beverage UnitCronos isn't the only cannabis company with a big focus on vaping. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) is focusing on vape pens and edibles while ignoring cannabis beverages.I believe that's a mistake. Perhaps not a lethal one, but a mistake nonetheless. The older people get, the less they want to be messing with their lungs,. That's why I think cannabis-infused drinks will win in the end. Altria, although not nearly as involved in the alcoholic beverages industry as it once was, still owns premium wine producer Ste Michelle Wine Estates. In addition, as a result of Anheuser-Busch's (NYSE:BUD) $100-billion acquisition of SABMiller in 2016, Altria owns 10% of BUD stock.It's hard to imagine Budweiser turning down an opportunity to partner with Atria and Cronos to produce cannabis-infused drinks on a global basis. As long as Altria continues to own a big chunk of Cronos Group stock, I don't think investors need to overreact to the latest health concerns surrounding vaping.

2019-09-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Altria Group Inc.’s investment in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., announced last December, was meant as a $12.8 billion statement that the maker of Marlboros was future-proofing its business. But two announcements on Wednesday make clear that the Juul investment has not made the tobacco giant’s future any less hazy — and, in fact, may have made it even more so.Altria and Philip Morris International Inc. said that they have called off merger talks that would have reunited two businesses that were once part of a single corporation and today sell the same products in different markets. (Altria is focused on the U.S. market and Philip Morris on international ones.)It’s probably not a coincidence that the deal fell apart amid increasing scrutiny from Washington amid a spate of mysterious illnesses associated with vaping. Both the White House and Congress have shown interest in putting restrictions on this emerging product category, raising questions about Juul’s growth potential. Then Walmart Inc. announced last week it would cease selling e-cigarettes, another blow to a nascent industry that has been trying to pitch itself as a healthier alternative to smoking.So it’s easy to see how a recombination may have looked unnecessarily risky to Philip Morris under these circumstances. Why join forces with Altria at a moment when U.S. regulators appear ready for a crackdown?Meanwhile, Juul said Wednesday that its CEO Kevin Burns was stepping down and would be replaced by K.C. Crosthwaite, a veteran of Altria. This will probably be a helpful change for the upstart, as Crosthwaite has experience navigating complex regulatory environments. Burns had come to Juul from the c-suite of yogurt maker Chobani LLC — a business that is not exactly full of regulatory landmines.Nevertheless, the mere fact of the leadership shakeup would appear to indicate that Altria was getting impatient with Juul’s ability to manage mounting public and political pressure over health concerns. Juul said this morning it will cease all advertising and lobbying in the U.S., a move that seems aimed at trying to show regulators that Juul can be a responsible corporate steward without government intervention.Investors hadn’t seemed particularly enthusiastic about the Philip Morris and Altria deal, despite the advantages to such a merger that my colleague Tara Lachapelle has noted, including combined cash flow that would allow them to put more firepower behind product innovation. So today’s news should help lift both their share prices.At the same time, today’s events are a stark reminder that Altria has yet to see a clear benefit from its bet on Juul — a cautionary tale for any stalwart in a mature industry that is looking for a savior in the form of an upstart.  — With assistance from Tara Lachapelle and Max Nisen.

This is particularly as hopes for a trade-war resolution rise.After opening lower on the day, stocks reversed higher and posted strong gains on Wednesday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) rallied just under 0.6%, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA:DIA) climbed 0.6% and the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) jump 1.1%.The action leaves investors wondering if they should still be preparing for another rough fourth quarter or if new highs are in store for the market. Let's look at the charts. Sizing Up the S&P 500A look at the S&P 500 reveals several things. First, resistance near $3,020 is still firmly in place. Second, the 50-day moving average is acting as current support, as is the $2,960 level.With Wednesday's recovery, the S&P 500 is reclaiming the 20-day moving average. More importantly, it's back over the Fed-day low, with the Fed-day range highlighted via the blue box on the chart.Action below this box has traders feeling more cautious, while above the Fed-day high brings more of a risk-on environment. Alongside the rally in stocks, the decline in bonds, gold and volatility was noteworthy as well.  * 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Set for Growth If the S&P 500 can continue higher and reclaim the Fed-day highs, a retest of $3,020 resistance is likely.

Movers in the Stock Market TodayAltria (NYSE:MO) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) were in the spotlight Wednesday when the two announced they were no longer looking to merge. PM stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while MO was down slightly, falling 0.4%.Although Altria gave a slight bump to the midpoint of its earnings outlook, concerns continue to swirl about its big investment in Juul. The latter has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny and given that Altria has dumped billions into Juul over the years, it has created concern among investors. Juul also just announced that its CEO will step down.Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) ended the day down 41 basis points, but was a focus in early trading after its investor meeting. Management is aiming for $50 billion in sales in fiscal 2025, while expecting $1 billion in cost cuts and efficiencies. For this fiscal year, BBY expects sales between $43.1 billion and $43.6 billion, with the midpoint about in line with expectations.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was a big focus on Wednesday too, given its hardware announcements. Amazon announced Echo Buds, which are meant to compete with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Air Pods and start at $129. It also announced an Echo Flex, Echo Glow and the Echo Show 8, which start at $24.99, $29.99 and $129, respectively.The tech giant is also launching a new Echo starting at $99 and a high-end Echo Studio, which starts at $199.99.

However, analysts are looking for more gains. Since reporting earnings, Nike has received nine price targets of $100 or more, with the Street-high target sitting all the way up at $150.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) caught a lift on Wednesday, rallying 3.3%. The move comes after analysts at Goldman Sachs upped their price target from $179 to $192. The price target takes NVDA over its recent highs near $188 and implies about 11% upside from Tuesday's close. (Nvidia was also a Top Stock Trade candidate on Wednesday).BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock has been roasted since reporting earnings, falling more than 20% on Tuesday and down another 4.1% on Wednesday. The analysts aren't feeling good either. MKM Partners cut their target from $8.75 to $6.50, while Canaccord Genuity went from $9 to $7. Further, CIBC Capital Markets cut their target from $13 to $6.50, too.Those who read the Top Stock Trades column may notice a few targets at $6.50 and recall how critical this level is.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-09-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Altria Group Inc. moved to put its investment in embattled e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. on firmer ground after a global vaping backlash threatened the startup’s survival and helped scuttle a potential reunion with Philip Morris International Inc.One of Altria’s senior executives is taking the top job at Juul, which said it would halt its marketing and lobbying efforts following criticism from lawmakers, anti-smoking advocates and parents concerned about a surge in underage vaping. The news of high-level changes at Juul came as Altria and Philip Morris ended their negotiations on a potential merger without reaching a deal.A combination of Altria and Philip Morris would have ranked among the largest deals so far this year, reuniting two companies put asunder after U.S. states won a groundbreaking legal battle against the tobacco industry more than a decade ago.But conflicts over what shape the future would take extinguished any hopes that the companies could move on together from their past.Philip Morris board members met on Tuesday and decided to pull the plug on the talks after concluding the regulatory scrutiny on Juul made the timing bad to pull off a big tobacco deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Before then, the companies had been working toward completing the deal as recently as this week, with plans to get a fairness opinion from bankers on the proposed terms over the weekend, the person said.Altria raised the potential of a leadership change at Juul to Philip Morris during the two tobacco companies’ recent talks about their merger, said a person familiar with the matter. Burns’s resignation reflected that Juul’s focus had changed -- it was no longer pushing for rapid growth in the U.S., but was instead trying to survive a suddenly perilous regulatory environment.“Juul is an independent company that makes its own decisions, and this was Juul’s decision,” Altria spokesman Steven Callahan said in an telephone call.Philip Morris shares closed up 5.2% on Wednesday, while Altria shares lost 0.4% in New York. Shares of both companies were little-changed Thursday.Last year, Altria invested $12.8 billion in Juul, placing a big bet that e-cigarettes are an important part of the tobacco business, and that the startup’s stranglehold on the market represented a golden opportunity. The transaction valued Juul at about $38 billion, placing it in the most elite ranks of Silicon Valley unicorns.Since then, Juul has been blamed for a jump in teen vaping, an escalating public-health crisis heightened by an outbreak of a mysterious lung disease that has killed seven people in the U.S. and sickened hundreds. Juul’s marketing has also been criticized by regulators, and it has faced a series of lawsuits by consumers.Like Altria, Philip Morris wagered on electronic cigarettes, though its IQOS device took a quieter and more cautious path to market, running an approval gauntlet at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Altria will market IQOS, which uses a heat-not-burn technology that differs from vaporizers like Juul’s, in the U.S.“While we believed the creation of a new merged company had the potential to create incremental revenue and cost synergies, we could not reach agreement,” said Howard Willard, Altria’s chairman and chief executive officer. He and Philip Morris CEO André Calantzopoulos said the companies would focus on launching IQOS in the U.S.Regulatory RoadblockThe growing controversy over Juul proved too intense for Philip Morris, leading the company to abandon the talks, which had begun in August, on concern about regulatory changes that are expected from the FDA, according to people familiar with the deal talks.The Trump administration said earlier this month that it would soon remove all flavored e-cigarette nicotine pods from the market, and only allow them back in stores after they had gained approval from the FDA. In the meantime, U.S. states including Michigan, New York, California and Massachusetts have unveiled vaping bans or restrictions.“It appears to us the talks fell apart over Juul,” Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a note. “Obviously the timing of the merger wasn’t right given escalating negative regulatory headlines.”As the Philip Morris talks ended, Altria also appeared to tighten its grip on the reins at Juul, which said in a statement Wednesday that CEO Kevin Burns would step aside to make way for K.C. Crosthwaite, a former Altria executive who had served as the company’s observer on the Juul board, effective immediately.Altria’s decision to buy the Juul stake had raised eyebrows in Washington, where regulators were grappling with a troubling surge in vaping by teenagers and young adults. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb was critical of the deal, seeing it as the companies retreating on a promise to help reduce teen nicotine use. He’d summoned executives to Washington to explain how the transaction aligned with their commitments.“I am aware of deeply concerning data showing that youth use of Juul represents a significant proportion of the overall use of e-cigarette products by children,” wrote Gottlieb in a letter to Altria’s Willard. “Manufacturers have an independent responsibility to take action to address the epidemic of youth use of their products.”Lawmakers and regulators have faulted Juul over the marketing of its products, saying the company has inappropriately pitched them as a potential smoking-cessation tool. The FDA said in a warning letter to Juul this month that the company marketed its products as less risky than cigarettes without gaining the agency’s approval. Juul said at the time it was cooperating with the agency.Lobbying HaltJuul said in its statement on Wednesday that it would suspend all broadcast, print and digital advertising in the U.S., and refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on its guidance regarding proposed curbs on vaping products.“I have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like Juul,” Crosthwaite said. “Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry.”Vaping has been touted as a safe and effective way for adult smokers to quit their cigarette habits, and investors have poured billions into Juul and companies like it. But a combination of candy-like flavorings, sleek, easy-to-hide devices and on-trend social-media marketing also lured kids.Earlier this month, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that 5 million kids reported having vaped this year, up from 3.6 million in 2018. More than a quarter of high school seniors said they’d vaped in the past 30 days.Altria CEO Willard said at a conference in Washington on Wednesday that he expected vaping products to be bigger than burnt tobacco in the next decade, but that the furor over vaping had threatened that trend.“We must acknowledge that a key component of harm reduction -- vaping -- is at an inflection point,” Willard said Wednesday. The company plans to continue to pursue heat-not-burn products like IQOS, vaping devices and pouch tobacco for the mouth, he said.Crosthwaite, a 22-year veteran of Altria, had led the company’s charge to delve into new growth opportunities that offered a path beyond the declining cigarette market -- but also presented new risks. The former general manager for the Marlboro brand is now on the board of Cronos Group Inc., the Canadian cannabis company that got a $1.8 billion investment from Altria late last year.Altria said in a securities filing Wednesday that Crosthwaite would be paid about $5 million in cash and be eligible to receive other payments under a long-term cash incentive plan.Altria reaffirmed its full-year financial guidance Wednesday, and spokesman David Sutton also said the company remains “confident in our standalone plan.”(Michael R.

2019-09-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- “The announcement strips away any doubt about Juul,” said Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group. “It is Big Tobacco.”That quote by Myers is contained in a statement Tobacco-Free Kids issued Wednesday morning, after learning that K.C. Crosthwaite would become the new chief executive of the beleaguered e-cigarette company. And you know something? Myers is absolutely right. (Bloomberg Philanthropies supports the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.)Crosthwaite, 44, has worked at Altria Group Inc. since he was 22. He’s managed the Marlboro brand. He’s been president of Philip Morris USA, Altria’s core cigarette unit. Until Wednesday, he was the company’s “Chief Strategy and Growth Officer,” pushing Altria toward a future it hopes will be less reliant on death sticks – a.k.a cigarettes – to make money.Needless to say, the public health community is appalled at the thought of a tobacco lifer running Juul. But I think it’s the first good thing to happen to the company in months. Strange as this may sound, if Juul is going to survive the current vaping crisis – hell, if vaping is going to survive the current vaping crisis — Big Tobacco is going to have to get involved.The crisis is two-fold. First, the number of kids who are vaping — and, presumably, getting hooked on nicotine — has risen to alarming proportions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the CDC —says that 20.8 percent of high school students tried e-cigarettes last year, up from 11.7 percent in 2017. Second, over the last few months, hundreds of vapers have developed a mysterious lung injury. At least 8 have died. Although the injury appears to be connected to contaminated cannabis oil — most likely bought illegally — federal health officials have been using the news to raise serious questions about vaping.The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration have both recommended that people stop vaping, whether it’s marijuana or an e-liquid. Massachusetts has ordered a four month ban on the sale of all vaping products. San Francisco, where Juul is located, has outlawed e-cigarettes entirely. The Trump administration is considering banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes.And where has Juul been in the midst of this firestorm? Nowheresville. Its protestations that it didn’t market to kids have been scoffed at. As it has become increasingly popular — among both adults and teens — it has seemed to wither in the face of increased criticism. And as more and more people became convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that (1) e-cigarettes were as dangerous as lit cigarettes, which kill 480,000 Americans a year, Juul could never figure out how to respond. Federal and state investigators have swarmed over the company. Juul was even reprimanded recently by the FDA for launching an ad campaign aimed at adult smokers, urging them to become vapers.The CEO who just stepped down, Kevin Burns, was hired in late 2017. Juul then had several hundred employees. It now has around 3,000 employees. Burns was brought in because he’s a manufacturing guy; as the company grew, it needed to be able to produce its e-cigarettes on a large scale.But manufacturing is hardly Juul’s biggest problem today; it needs to get through this crisis with its business still intact. From talking to people at Altria and Juul, I got the sense that Burns and the board understood that Juul needs a leader whose core competency is knowing how to respond to regulatory challenges faced by the company. Juul is hoping that its new chief executive, Crosthwaite, will be that person. At Altria, he was the point person who negotiated the deal that saw Altria pay $12.8 billion for 35% of the vaping company. He knows Juul well. He was also a key figure in getting another new e-cigarette product, called IQOS, approved by the Food and Drug Administration. IQOS, which heats tobacco but doesn’t burn it, was developed by Philip Morris International, but Altria will market it in the U.S.That exceedingly complex approval process costs millions of dollars, and every vaping product, including Juul, is required by the FDA to submit an application by May. Most e-cigarette companies will not be able to make this deadline and will likely be forced out of business. But Philip Morris has the money and the experience to meet the deadline, and to then stick with the rest of the process, which could take several years. Ultimately, the FDA approval process will likely mean that the only e-cigarettes to remain on the market are those under the wing of a major tobacco company.There is a second process, called the Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application. Any product that gets the MRTP designation will be able to finally tell the world that it is less harmful than cigarettes. For Juul—and for Altria—that’s the holy grail. It is also the information smokers need to have the confidence to switch.Not even the most enthusiastic proponent of e-cigarettes discounts the importance of reducing the number of vaping teens. It is, indeed, an epidemic. If the industry can’t help halt the spread of e-cigarettes among youths, it will be doomed. Altria and Juul appear to understand that. As it happens, there was a major tobacco conference in Washington on Wednesday, and one of the speakers was Howard Willard, Altria’s chief executive. He said that the rise in teen vaping was “unacceptable and alarming,” and called for all 50 states to make 21 the minimum age for buying tobacco products.  In an effort to calm the waters, he noted that Juul would immediately suspend all its advertising and marketing, and refrain from lobbying the administration as it tries to decide whether to ban flavors.For a number of years now, Altria and the other big tobacco companies have said they want to help achieve a smoke-free world. They’ve said that the products they are developing, like IQOS, or investing in, like Juul, will help bring that about. In his speech, Willard said that he believes that by 2029, more adults will buy non-combusted nicotine products than cigarettes. Naturally, he wants Philip Morris to be selling those products.There are good reasons to be deeply suspicious of Big Tobacco. But the fact remains that, thanks in part to the fears that have been raised about vaping — some legitimate, some not — only Big Tobacco has the resources, the patience, and the thick skin needed to make vaping an acceptable alternative to smoking.Yes, Big Tobacco is now in control at Juul. That is its only hope.(1) According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 63% of adults in the U.S. disagreed that “vaping is healthier than traditional cigarettes.”The British government has long maintainedthat vaping is 95 percent safer than smoking. Why? Because while nicotine addicts, it is the lit tobacco that kills.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Timothy L.

2019-09-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The crisis engulfing the American vaping industry has claimed its first European victim. Imperial Brands Plc, the British-based maker of Winston cigarettes in the U.S. and the Blu electronic device, cut its sales and profit guidance on Thursday, a day after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks amid increasing Washington scrutiny of illnesses associated with the smoking alternative.Imperial in part blamed a slowdown in U.S. demand for electronic cigarettes for its expectation of flat earnings in the year to Sept. 30. It had anticipated expansion of between 4% and 8%. Revenue will expand by 2%, at the low end of its 1% to 4% range. The shares fell as much as 11%.Some American retailers, including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes, while President Donald Trump is moving to ban flavored products and nicotine pods. All of this came together to weigh on Imperial’s sales in the final quarter, when it was also running a big marketing campaign for its Blu device.So far the problems haven’t spread to Europe or Japan (the most developed market for devices that heat rather than burn tobacco). Imperial expects sales of its new generation products to increase by 50% this year. That may look eye-watering but it’s below previous expectations. This is a worry for all of Big Tobacco, which is investing billions of pounds in innovative new products. Philip Morris has developed the iQos “heat not burn” device, while British American Tobacco Plc has a suite of alternatives.The idea is that manufacturers use the cash flows from their traditional cigarettes business to develop products they describe as lower risk. As smoking rates decline, these devices are meant to pick up the slack among consumers. The transition hasn’t been smooth. Growth slowed in Japan last year, where older people proved more reluctant to follow tech-savvy early adopters of alternatives.The scrutiny in the U.S. is clearly a serious problem for this potentially huge, but nascent market. Yet there’s an irony too: The crackdown on vaping might drive some of the adults who’ve switched to vapes back to cigarettes.Although gross profit margins on alternatives are approaching those of cigarettes, according to Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the traditional product remains the driver of profit and cash flow for the industry. A slower decline in the numbers of traditional tobacco smokers would be terrible for public health, but it might end up easing some of the financial pressure on Big Tobacco, at least in the short term. While the industry has always been a big dividend payer, there have been increasing doubts about whether this is sustainable.Greater regulation of alternatives could also play to the big companies’ advantage. Most — though not all — of the individuals who’ve fallen ill used black-market vaping pods. A tightening of the rules could favor the devices made by large manufacturers, which have decades of experience lobbying lawmakers. These companies have deep pockets for research and development too.Nevertheless, unless the industry can develop alternatives that are genuinely less harmful, the outlook for what was Big Tobacco’s last great hope looks bleak. Expect more vaping dreams to go up in smoke.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-10-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Imperial Brands Plc’s Alison Cooper is stepping down in a cloud of raspberry scented smoke.The timing isn’t surprising. It comes exactly a week after the British-based maker of Davidoff cigarettes and the Blu electronic device, lowered expectations for sales and profits after taking a hit in the U.S. vaping market. The warning brought to a head discussions about the company’s future leadership as the board conducts its search for a successor to Chairman Mark Williamson.Change is clearly needed. The shares of the smallest of the world’s major tobacco companies are roughly back where they were at the start of Cooper’s 9-year watch, having lost more than half of their value since a 2016 peak.Her successor faces a tall order. The new CEO will have to figure out how to make Imperial a strong force in tobacco alternatives. It currently ranks fourth in electronic smoking devices by units sold on a four-week basis. But in the heat-not-burn segment, its Pulze product is a relative newcomer in the Japanese market, where the products have taken hold more quickly than elsewhere. It’s important to have a clear strategy in each segment since no one really knows exactly where the market’s headed.Finding the right path forward won’t be easy, given the crisis engulfing vaping in the U.S., which has prompted efforts by President Donald Trump to ban flavored products and nicotine pads while some retailers including Walmart Inc. have stopped selling e-cigarettes.They must find a way through this. One option would be developing a boarder suite of tobacco alternatives alongside Imperial’s Blu vaping device. Stepping up development in heat-not-burn segment would also be wise.Rival British American Tobacco Plc has hedged its bets, with a presence in both vaping and the heat-not-burn segment. This is a model that Imperial should follow. But this would likely mean more investment.Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, says Imperial can afford to spend more. First of all, it’s core business of traditional cigarettes ­ — including local brands such as Winston in the U.S. — is cash generative. Plus, its 2 billion-pound ($2.5 billion) asset disposal program and decision to abandon its policy to increase its dividend by 10% annually should give it scope to act.The new chairman must also address corporate governance issues. Bloomberg News reported that investors and analysts had voiced concerns about Imperial’s earnings calculations and strategy.Imperial has long been seen as a takeover target, but it is now particularly vulnerable given the share price weakness and that industry consolidation is back on the agenda, even after Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. called off their merger talks.Japan Tobacco Inc. is often mooted as the likely predator, although it would have to find a way to deal with competition constraints.If the new chairman and chief executive don’t raise their game on alternatives, then someone else might light up even more radical change for them.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-10-04,"Stocks go up, stocks go down -- and so do analysts' opinions of them. This series looks at which upgrades investors should act on. Specifically, we'll find out why analysts are revving their engines for VMware, NXP Semiconductors NV and Philip Morris.Let's take a closer look:VMware (VMW)First up, 5-star Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow upped his rating on VMware to 'buy' Tuesday. According to Winslow, the company behind everything from cloud to networking and security to digital workspace is worth about 17% more than it's currently selling for, and should hit $180 within the next 12 months. (To watch Winslow's track record, click here)Winslow wrote, &quot;Although VMware’s core server virtualization business (vSphere) has performed well recently as existing customers continue to invest in their VMware infrastructure and the traction of newer products (NSX, vSAN, and vRealize) and services has been impressive, many investors have been concerned that the growing interest in deploying cloud-native and containerized applications into Kubernetes-centric environments will eventually reduce the relevancy of and customer demand for VMware’s virtualization-centric product portfolio. Conversely, we believe the acquisitions of Bitnami, Heptio, and Pivotal Software, combined with the release of VMware Tanzu (particularly Project Pacific), will position VMware to emerge as the leader in the market for Kubernetes-based, multi-cloud platform solutions.&quot;Overall, the word on the Street rings largely bullish on this cloud computing giant, backing Winslow's confident move, with TipRanks analytics demonstrating VMW as a Buy. Out of 23 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 16 are bullish on VMware stock, 9 remain sidelined, and only one is bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 14%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $175.83. (See VMW's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)Investors may have better luck investing in our second stock of the day, NXP Semiconductors, which was upgraded to 'buy' this week by 5-star analyst Weston Twigg at KeyBanc. According to the analyst, this chip stock with the $110 stock price will rise to $130 a share within a year. (To watch Twigg's track record, click here)Twigg commented, &quot;We believe demand trends at NXPI have bottomed and channel inventories for the Company have begun to normalize. While we had previously had concerns regarding the impact of the pending QCOM acquisition on the Company’s design pipeline, we believe these concerns are already reflected in the Company’s current valuation (12x P/E 2020) and also believe NXPI’s pending acquisition of MRVL’s connectivity assets will partially offset this. While demand trends in automotive remain weak, we like the Company’s outsized exposure to this segment (50% of revenues) longer term, and see opportunities for the Company to offset weak end demand via content growth associated with design wins within: 1) ADAS; 2) BMS (battery management systems) and the associated electrification of autos; and 3) Infotainment.&quot;All in all, cautious optimism circles this semiconductor player, as TipRanks analytics exhibit NXPI as a Moderate Buy. Out of 12 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 7 are bullish on NXP Semiconductors stock, while 5 remain sidelined. With a return potential of 5.5%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $115.91. (See NXPI's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)Philip Morris (PM)A third stock worthy of consideration -- at least, Wall Street thinks so -- is Philip Morris. This week, BofA/Merrill Lynch analyst Lisa Lewandowski upgraded the tobacco titan from 'neutral' to 'buy', predicting PM shares will hit $96 a share a year from now. (To watch Lewandowski's track record, click here)Lewandowski explained, &quot;While vaping issues may drag on the industry as whole near-term, they think PM will eventually rise above the noise given their lack of US vaping exposure. while merger talks shook investors, they see see PM’s underlying fundamentals as strong with upside potential as consumers look for alternatives as vaping products remain in the eye of the media storm. Given its attractive valuation, pricing power, IQOS’ growth trajectory & commitment to shareholder returns (yield 6.2%), we are upgrading PM from Neutral to Buy.&quot;The Street largely seems to echo Lewandowski positive sentiment, considering TipRanks analytics showcase PM as a Buy. Out of 12 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 9 are bullish on Philip Morris stock, 2 remain sidelined, and only one is bearish on the stock. With a potential upside of about 20%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $94.17.

2019-10-18,"Altria (NYSE:MO) stock again finds itself hurt by negative headlines. The controversy over its vaping product, Juul, has led investors to dump MO stock. As a result, it now trades close to its 52-week lows.Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com However, as a result of the concerns surrounding Juul, Altria stock trades at a relative discount and now gives investors an unusually high payout near 7.75%. More importantly, the trading history of MO indicates that Altria stock could profit investors hugely at these levels. MO Stock has Long Prospered Amid Negative PublicityDespite the negative specter that has hung over tobacco stocks since for the 1960s, Altria stock tends to generate profits and generous dividends year after year with little fanfare. However, the negative publicity has returned in recent weeks. Its investment in Juul has come under fire as medical experts have linked vaping products to multiple hospital visits and a few deaths.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, as we have learned over the decades, investors have good reason to take any negative publicity about the tobacco industry with a grain of salt. The Surgeon General's report that first warned of the dangers of smoking came out in 1964. At that time, about 42% of Americans smoked cigarettes. Smoking was commonplace and permitted in most public areas. Altria stock (then known as Philip Morris Companies) was trading at the split-adjusted price of 13 cents per share.The Centers for Disease Control notes that smoking rates continue to fall. However, by 2016, only about 15.5% of the population smoked cigarettes. Now, smokers often struggle to find a public place where they can light their cigarettes. Despite this stigma on tobacco, the Altria stock price stands at around $44 per share, an increase of almost 340 times from 1964 levels. With the dividend at $3.36 per share, investors who have owned Altria stock since 1964 receive almost a 26-fold return annually on the payout alone!  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals That stock growth happened amid decades of negative publicity and billions in legal settlements. If all of that did not stop Altria stock from growing, I remain skeptical that the controversy surrounding vaping will damage the company long term. Juul Brings Both Pain and a Buy OpportunityInvestors should also remember that the investigations continue. This means they may not ultimately trace the illnesses directly to Juul. Also, even if Altria has to write off its $12.8 billion investment in Juul, the company's $1.8 billion stake in cannabis stock Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) could still help the company. That investment gave Altria 45% of Cronos, with the option to take this stake as high as 55%. This should give Altria an alternate, fast-growing revenue source even if tobacco smoking rates continue to fall.Still, investors also need to consider the significant amount of short-term damage that vaping illnesses have caused. Altria stock has fallen by about one-third from the 52-week high it achieved almost a year ago. Concerns about Juul also likely sidelined the proposed merger with Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM).As a result, MO stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 9.8. This is well below the 16.4x average PE ratio Altria supported during the previous five years. Moreover, Wall Street projects profit growth of 5% in 2019 and 7.2% in the next fiscal year. This will not impress many investors, but it still should help maintain its periodic payout hikes. Though the company sometimes misses an annual dividend increase, it has hiked the payout annually for the last 10 years.This has also occurred despite a dividend yield that dramatically exceeds historical averages. Over the last five years, Altria stock produced an average return on its payout of about 4.3%. However, investors who buy today will see a cash return of about 7.75%. Bottom Line on Altria StockFrom a numbers perspective, Altria stock looks clearly like a buy. With a single-digit PE ratio and a growing, generous dividend yield, investors who buy MO stock now should profit from their decision long term.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy (With Brands You Can Find In Your Kitchen) In time, the controversy over Juul will fade from the headlines. However, the long-term average multiple has, and will, probably continue to lag the S&P 500 index. The established link between smoking and a variety of diseases creates a permanent worry about the cost of settlements and other costs. Moreover, many Americans have seen family and friends become sick and die prematurely due to tobacco use. For some of them, Altria stock is not a buy at any price. Investors need to continue to factor this sentiment into the MO stock price.However, MO trades at multiples well below its long-term averages and offers a huge dividend payout. If the lawsuits and anti-smoking crusades from previous decades did not stop Altria stock, I doubt vaping issues will either.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-10-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tuesday was an important day for public health in the U.S. For the first time ever, the Food and Drug Administration ruled that a company will be allowed to advertise its tobacco products as less harmful than cigarettes. As momentous as this decision is — and it is momentous — the public health community was not exactly cheering the news. In fact, it was downright grumpy about the whole thing.The products in question are snus. Swedish Match AB, a company that sells cigars, lighters, and chewing tobacco makes snus. (The company divested its cigarettes business in 1999.) Snus users ingest nicotine by placing a small pouch filled with tobacco in between their teeth and their lips. Nicotine can be addictive, but snus aren’t lethal like cigarettes.According to Swedish Match, the Swedes have been using snus since the 1600s. In the years after World War II, snus were overtaken by cigarettes.  But after the dangers of smoking became irrefutable, the Swedish government imposed hefty taxes on cigarettes. This caused many smokers to gravitate back to snus; Swedish Match estimates that 9% of Swedish men smoke, while about 18% use snus.The health consequences have been nothing short of amazing. Swedish men have the lowest rate of lung and oral cancer in Europe.  A paper published in 2014 by the National Institutes of Health reported that this “mortality advantage” was directly attributable to “the degree of dominance of snus use in the different age groups of Swedish men.” Swedish women, who have not adopted snus like men have, had higher tobacco-related mortality rates.In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the ability to set standards for tobacco products “to protect the public health.” All tobacco products that came to market after the passage of the new law, including e-cigarettes, would have to be approved by the agency. (The deadline for submitting tobacco products for FDA approval has been repeatedly delayed. It is now set for May 2020.) The FDA also gained the authority to designate a “Modified Risk Tobacco Product” — again, if it deemed the product to be helpful in protecting the public health.Well ahead of every other company, Swedish Match received FDA approval for its snus, sold under the General Snus brand, in November 2015. It was also the first company to apply for the modified-risk designation. Alas, in 2016, its initial effort was turned down. Swedish Match re-applied. And that application is the one the FDA approved on Tuesday.What does it mean? Simply put, it means that the company will be able to say that smokers who use General Snus are less likely to get lung cancer, mouth cancer, heart disease, stroke, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Are snus completely safe? No. But they are safer than cigarettes. That is the classic definition of a reduced-harm product.There are strict limits about where Swedish Match can make this claim. It can’t advertise on TV. It can’t say it on the packaging. It can make the reduced-harm claim at the point of sale, on its website and in certain other controlled venues. Before it can do anything, it has to submit a marketing plan to the FDA.Given the limitations on Swedish Match’s ability to get the word out, what the company needs now are some credible advocates willing to urge smokers to switch to snus. And while you might think that should be a job for the tobacco control community — which, after all, wants to eliminate smoking — it has been less than enthusiastic.In May, five major anti-tobacco groups sent comments to the FDA, saying that Swedish Match’s application should be denied. Their primary worry was that if the company started marketing snus as modified-risk, kids would start using them. They also said that there was no evidence that adult Americans would use snus the same way Swedes do.The FDA says that snus haven’t been shown to appeal to kids and Swedish Match has vowed not to market to them. Indeed, the FDA has the ability to take away its modified-risk designation for snus if it believes Swedish Match is trying to lure kids.When I called around on Tuesday, it was clear that anti-tobacco advocates' concerns were intact, however. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids sent me a statement from its president, Matt Myers (Bloomberg Philanthropies supports the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids). “The FDA must insure that snus tobacco products are not marketed to or used by kids,” he said. The American Lung Association declined comment. The American Heart Association sent me a link to a study that claimed that children are more likely to have higher blood pressure by age 6 if their mothers used snus during pregnancy.There are going to be more companies applying for modified-risk designations. Philip Morris International Inc. already has one in the pipelines, called IQOS, which heats tobacco but doesn’t burn it. For all their current problems, the e-cigarette companies will also eventually seek a modified risk label from the FDA. This is the Holy Grail: to be able to say publicly that their products are less harmful than cigarettes.The evidence from Sweden is indisputable: Snus save lives. Anti-smoking advocates could make a credible case for supporting them, thereby improving public health. Instead, even with the modified-risk designation, Swedish Match is going to have a tough time getting the word out to the people who need to hear it: the 35 million adult smokers in the U.S.It’s a funny thing. In Europe, people are far less worried about e-cigarettes than people in the U.S. The British, in fact, have embraced e-cigarettes as healthier alternative to smoking. But snus? Believe it or not, they are banned in most of Europe.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Timothy L.

2019-10-24,Altria stock has recovered sharply in October. There's positive momentum in the stock before the company's earnings. The stock has risen 14% in October.,Altria Stock: Will Sluggishness End with Q3 Earnings?
2019-10-25,AllianceBernstein has combined quantitative and fundamental methods in a portfolio that has beaten the market handily for 15 years.,6 Leading Stocks From Bernstein's 'Quant + Fundamental' Portfolio
2019-10-25,"Until about mid-2017 or so, Altria (NYSE:MO) stock was a fairly solid investment. But then the shares came under pressure, leading to a grueling bear move.  During this period, the Altria stock price went from $77 to $45.Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Since then, the company has continued to face strong headwinds. In the U.S. market, there has been a steady decline in the number of smokers. And there appears to be no end to that trend in sight.Then there was the  company's$12.8 billion investment in vaping products maker Juul. So far, the timing of the deal has been pretty awful. The vaping industry is under a great deal of regulatory scrutiny because of multiple deaths that may have been caused by vaping.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Notch REITs to Buy for Income All of these uncertainties derailed a potential merger between Altria and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM).So given all this, it's reasonable that investors would be shy about taking a position in Altria stock.In the near-term, MO stock may have few positive catalysts.  But for investors who are willing to be patient,  Altria stock may be a good value play.Here are a few reasons why that's the case: Investing in the Long-TermThe investment in Juul was not MO's only questionable deal. Altria also invested $1.8 billion in Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), in exchange  for a 45% stake in CRON. (Altria also has an option to take an additional 10% stake).But I would not characterize these deals as blunders. It's really just too soon to make that call.  When it comes to strategic investments, the focus is on the long-term. And I think these investments will work out well over the long-term.Let's first take a look at Juul. The founders of the company, Adam Bowen and James Monsees, leveraged their backgrounds in product design to transform the e-cigarette market. From the start, the company's growth was torrid - and Juul has become the dominant player in the industry.No doubt, Altria brings lots of value to Juul, in terms of marketing and distribution. The combination should enable Juul to deliver non-cyclical growth.The liability issues are serious. But the investigations are still in the early phases, and there is no evidence that Juul's products are responsible for medical issues. If the company is is cleared of any liability, Altria stock price should rebound in a big way.As for the CRON investment, it looks like a solid play on the fast-growing cannabis market. With companies facing difficulties across the industry, Cronos is in a good position for consolidation. CRON also is a leader of the Canadian market and has a growing medical business. And it's been positioning itself to benefit from the CBD opportunity. The Market DynamicsOne of the key advantages of Altria stock is MO's moat. It would prove extremely expensive and time consuming for any startup to move into the tobacco industry. Because of this, Altria is in a position to keep raising prices. That, in turn,  has enabled MO to offset the negative impact of falling sales volumes. It also helps that the company has an assortment of premium brands like Marboro.Also protecting Altria stock is the fact that marketing tobacco products is illegal . That makes it very difficult for competitors to disrupt the industry. The Valuation of Altria StockThe valuation of MO stock is at rock-bottom levels. Note that the forward price-earnings ratio of Altria stock is only about ten. During the past five years, the forward multiple has usually been about 16. So, if things get back on track, MO stock can climb meaningfully.And finally, Altria provides a lucrative dividend yield of 7.37%. More importantly, the company continues to generate strong cash flows that will allow it to maintain this payout.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-10-25,"Gains from pricing and savings efforts are likely to be reflected on Altria's (MO) Q3 results. However, receding cigarette sales volumes are a concern.",Will Pricing be an Upside for Altria (MO) in Q3 Earnings?
2019-10-25,"Over the last 25 years, Altria (NYSE:MO) returned nearly 3,900% for investors, as compared to a 601% return on the S&P 500. There's no reason to think Altria stock will be stuck in place for too long.Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Most of its growth, though, was thanks to strong cigarette sales and rising dividend yield. Unfortunately, the MO stock just slipped from its lofty highs, tumbling to a low of $39.44.  All as smoking among U.S. adults reached its lowest levels on record and the vaping controversy forced investors to flee.However, while MO stock looks like a slow-motion train wreck now, it's still offering investors a long-term buy and hold opportunity with a dividend yield of 7.25%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Negatives Have Dogged Altria StockAs of 2017, cigarette smoking plummeted to its lowest level on record among U.S. adults, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health's Cancer Institute (NCI).  * 7 Stocks to Buy With 100% Upside Potential In fact, by 2017, only 14% of U.S. adults were current smokers, down 67% over the last 54 years.  Of course, that'll hit Altria's bottom line.Then again this wasn't a big shock. The industry has been in decline for years. In its second-quarter earnings report, Altria even forecast a 5% to 6% decline in cigarette volumes just in the U.S.  All as consumers began to switch to vaping.  So, Altria then got involved with vaping, which became incredibly popular until it led to &quot;mysterious illness&quot; across the U.S.With a health scare raging, President Trump said he was preparing to ban flavored e-cigarettes back in September 2019.&quot;The Trump Administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities,&quot; Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, as quoted by NBC News.On top of that, the U.S. FDA's Scott Gottlieb warned that:&quot;E-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous -- and dangerous -- trend among teenagers. The disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we're seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end. The FDA cannot tolerate a whole generation of young people becoming addicted to nicotine as a tradeoff for enabling adults to access these products.&quot;All of that weighed on Altria, and helped end merger plans with Phillip Morris (NYSE:PM).However, while the Altria stock story appears colder than a wet match, short-term, the company is still attractive long-term with dividend intact. Altria Stock and the Future of Heated TobaccoThere are certainly near-term challenges with the stock.However, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery has a $49 price target on the MO stock.He notes that while iQOS (tobacco heating systems) is a product of Philip Morris, it &quot;focuses solely on overseas markets&quot; and that &quot;Altria will spearhead its rollout in the U.S.&quot;  Despite all of the negative news on vaping, Lavery says the cigarette business will increasingly demand on reduced-risk products like iQOS, which received regulatory approval just last year.In addition, earlier this month, Altria announced it was launching an iQOS product.iQOS is not a cigarette or a vaping device. It simply heats tobacco without burning it. Plus, it's designed to give users the same hit of nicotine as smoking with fewer toxins.&quot;It's perfect timing,&quot; said Lavery. &quot;I don't think they would have expected some consumer uncertainty around vapor coinciding with the launch of Iqos in the U.S.&quot; The Bottom Line on Altria StockAltria's stock may be down considerably over the last several months, but at nearly 14 times trailing earnings and 10 times next year's estimates with a yield of 7.25%, it's a cheap stock worth holding for the next several years.  Granted, there are challenges ahead with declining smokers, but iQOS may be a key driver going forward.While I'm not a fan of MO for the immediate term, I do believe the long-term growth story is intact and strong.As of this writing, Ian Cooper did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-31,"The market rally is alive and well. Following the Federal Reserve’s third rate cut this year, the S&P 500 moved higher on Wednesday. This is on top of the 2% gain the index has already seen since market close on October 22. Bearing this in mind, investors are looking for ways to capitalize on the market’s upward momentum.Analysts suggest that investors seek out the stocks that can reliably generate profits and reward investors with consistent payouts, namely dividend stocks. That being said, it should be noted that not all dividend stocks are created equal, with some offering significantly higher yields than others.So how are investors supposed to determine which dividend names represent the most compelling investments? We recommend using TipRanks’ Stock Screener. The tool helped us pinpoint 3 Buy-rated names that each boast a dividend yield of more than 5%, while the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 stands at 1.85%.Plains All American Pipeline (PAA)Plains All American specializes in the transportation, logistics and storage of crude oil, with its primary focus being the Permian Basin, a large and resource rich region spanning the southwestern part of the U.S. Despite the fact that shares have been hurting recently, the Street’s pros see gains stemming from the Permian business as well as new projects.While concerns have been expressed regarding the overbuilding of the Permian Basin, PAA’s Permian pipes have continued to sustain a solid level of contracts. Not to mention PAA is actively participating in the construction of new Capine, Red Oak and Wink-Webster pipes through its partnerships with major refining companies. These partnerships include the likes of Phillips 66, which PAA joined forces with back in June to build the Red Oak pipeline system.With the company on a steady growth path, part of its appeal lies in its ability to maintain a stable dividend. PAA consistently rewards investors, with its annual payout of $1.44 per share putting the dividend yield at 7.75%.Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research told clients that all of the above lends itself to his bullish thesis. “The company offers well above average growth both organically through its Permian-focused business and through several large new capital projects where PAA has partnered with large refining companies,” the analyst explained. Fleishman added that PAA’s strong balance sheet is “now one of the best in the sector.&quot;Fleishman rates PAA an Overweight along with a $27 price target, which implies about 50% upside from current levels. (To watch Fleishman’s track record, click here)Similarly, the rest of the Street is in favor of this dividend stock. 6 &quot;buy&quot; ratings vs 2 &quot;holds&quot; assigned in the last three months give it a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. Additionally, its $26 average price target implies about 44% upside potential. (See PAA stock analysis on TipRanks)Philip Morris (PM)While best known for its tobacco brands like Marlboro, Philip Morris is captivating investors thanks to its iQOS products. iQOS is an electronic tobacco heating system, differing from traditional cigarettes in that it doesn’t burn the tobacco when it’s smoked.iQOS is the only FDA-authorized reduced-risk product (RRP) allowed to sell mint and menthol flavors, giving it a significant competitive advantage in the U.S. The mint/menthol flavor plays a key role in adult smoker conversion as menthol makes up about 35% of total combust cigarette volume. The tobacco product’s potential isn’t limited to the U.S. iQOS’ launch in the EU only covers about half of the region’s population, leaving plenty of the market untapped. Not to mention there is a substantial opportunity to capture the market in Russia.That being said, PM’s strength as a dividend stock can’t be ignored. Shareholders that get onboard now can expect a substantial reward. It offers the largest annualized payout out of all the names on our list, $4.68 per share to be exact. AdditionallyAll of this prompted top analyst, Wells Fargo’s Bonnie Herzog, to reaffirm her Bullish stance on PM. While she lowered her price target from $102 to $100, the four-star analyst is confident the company can deliver reliable returns, with the upside potential still coming in at a respectable 22%. “Given PM’s superior profit, existing infrastructure, capital strength, strong free cash flow, attractive 5%-plus dividend yield, leading global brand portfolio including Marlboro and deep management team with superior knowledge of the global tobacco industry, we expect the stock to outperform over the next 12 months,” she commented. (To watch Herzog’s track record, click here)The rest of the Street is slightly more cautious regarding PM. Its ‘Moderate Buy’ consensus rating comes from 6 Buy ratings, 2 Holds and 1 Sell received in the last three months. Analysts see about 10% upside potential based on its $89.43 average price target. (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks)Tenaris SA (TS)When a stock scores a ratings upgrade, it’s a signal to investors that a unique opportunity may be presenting itself. This is the case for steel pipe and tube manufacturer Tenaris.Wolfe Research analyst Blake Gendron just bumped up his rating from a Hold to a Buy, citing its free cash flow yield as well as its offshore optionality as particularly noteworthy. “TS has a relatively defensive balance sheet and robust FCF outlook (10% EV on our FY20 estimates), underpinned by its capital light footprint,” he noted.While the analyst acknowledged that the fuel price freeze in Argentina could impact TS’ top-line performance, a new contract could offset any negatives. The company was recently awarded a five-year contract with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) worth $1.9 billion to provide tubulars and Rig Direct services. As a result, Gendron believes that TS is the most compelling name in the space, calling it “our WR CE top pick”. All of this lends itself to a potential twelve month gain of 32%, according to the analyst. (To watch Gendron’s track record, click here)Along with promising new opportunities and a strong balance sheet, TS is an attractive investment based on its continued ability to pay a solid dividend. With its $1.12 annualized payout amounting to a 5.4% yield, it’s no wonder TS is a resounding Buy among Wall Street analysts.Not only is the stock a Buy, but the fact that only bullish calls have been published in the last three months give it a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. It also doesn’t hurt that its $31 average price target suggests 45% upside potential. (See Tenaris stock analysis on TipRanks)",3 Undervalued Stocks Offering Juicier Dividend Yields Than S&P 500

2019-11-13,"Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and the IQOS tobacco heating system, is scouring China's start-up scene for inhalation technology that can be developed for the medical field as the tobacco giant seeks new paths outside its traditional consumer products business.The effort is spearheaded by PM Equity Partner, a US$150 million Swiss-based venture fund seeded by its parent, with a focus on building stakes in healthier environmental, human and fast-moving consumer goods.Philip Morris has said its long-term plan is to stop selling cigarettes eventually by converting its customers to the IQOS system.Such investments could be the springboard into &quot;new industries&quot; related to the tobacco giant's traditional business, according to investment manager Jason Gao. Philip Morris may close Hong Kong research centre on proposal to ban e-cigarettesThat would follow in the step of IQOS, which uses electronic heating to induce nicotine vapour for inhalation, without burning the tobacco.&quot;IQOS shares the same inhalation technology as those currently deployed in medical delivery system,&quot; Gao said in an interview in Hong Kong.&quot;We have already made one of our most successful investments in a Middle East inhalation tech start-up that focuses on delivering botanical matter into the human body through the lungs.&quot;The push into new industries underscores the challenges in its traditional business amid tightening regulations and anti-smoking drives by governments.Cigarette-free alternatives have had varied success and their fair share of bad press globally over health concerns.Gao said PM Equity Partner has spent US$100 million in 10 companies globally outside Asia. That portfolio includes Biovotion, Bow Group, Softhale and Biognosys, according to its website.Inhalation technology, which is considered a fast, effective and non-invasive way of delivering medication to the lungs, has already been used in treating ailments such as asthma. The Middle East venture, he said, has the potential to be the &quot;anchor asset&quot; for the group's move into a new industry.The start-up has also completed a prototype of a product that could be potentially used in the pharmaceutical sector, while a joint effort between Philip Morris and the start-up is also working to develop a new generation of tobacco products, he said.&quot;The botanical form of medicine could be interesting,&quot; he said. &quot;Delivering botanical matter into the human body is a very Asian practice, which today has not yet been well explored in western research.&quot; Ban e-cigarettes and other new tobacco products, Hong Kong parents say in surveyIQOS is sold only in four Asian markets, namely Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Malaysia. The product is banned in Singapore, while Hong Kong is seeking to apply a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. IQOS was introduced in the US last quarter, the only heat-not-burn system approved by authorities there.Gao said Philip Morris is currently not looking at expanding into the medical sector, and that consumer products are still its core business.For more insights into China tech, sign up for our tech newsletters, subscribe to our award-winning Inside China Tech podcast, and download the comprehensive 2019 China Internet Report.

2019-12-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The next big thing for big tobacco has turned into a bit of a nightmare. Vaping took off as a potentially healthier alternative to smoking for adults looking to kick the habit. But then it caught on with a whole new generation, sparking a teen epidemic in the U.S and fears that they could graduate to smoking traditional cigarettes. Matters worsened with a spate of illnesses among some users of electronic cigarettes, raising questions about the safety of vaping for young and old.In the U.K., the fallout from declining sales of tobacco alternatives across the Atlantic has hit British American Tobacco Plc and Imperial Brands Plc hard. Now as new management teams at both companies try to figure out what’s the best strategy back to growth, their fortunes will be driven more by regulations in the U.S. than their business closer to home. But this doesn’t have to be bad news. Heightened scrutiny in the U.S. can dispel concerns about safety, and eventually pave the way for companies to expand their vaping technology to devices that deliver cannabis, vitamins and medicines. Vaping first came under scrutiny for its appeal to teenagers. Altria Group Inc.-backed Juul Labs Inc., has been besieged by lawsuits accusing it of using sweet fruit and candy flavors to overtly target under-aged users. The situation escalated over the summer, after a spate of illnesses and deaths related to electronic-cigarette use. ECigIntelligence, a data provider, now forecasts a 13% decline in the U.S. vaping market in 2020. Previously it had forecast an increase of more than 10%.As the world’s biggest vaping market, accounting for about 45% of global sales in 2019, it’s little wonder the U.S. slowdown is hurting. Imperial, which sells Winston cigarettes in the U.S., warned on profit in September, and parted company with its chief executive officer, Alison Cooper, a week later. BAT, maker of Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes, recently said sales growth from its new generation products would be at the lower end of its forecast range of 30%-50%. A few months earlier, it had guided to the midpoint.With the scrutiny of vaping, having a broad-based portfolio of tobacco alternatives is crucial. Here BAT is well placed, having invested $4 billion over the past five years. Seven months since becoming CEO, Jack Bowles has reorganized its alternatives into three global brands: Glo for heated tobacco, Vuse for vaping and Velo for oral nicotine products. That shows commitment and urgency. It’s still not clear which category, if any, will be the winner, so having options on each is wise.Vaping probably has the most long-term potential. In the meantime, heat not burn options may come to prominence, especially as they haven’t been drawn into the controversy. They’re already popular in Japan, but with Philip Morris International Inc. now selling its IQOS device in the U.S. too, BAT may need to spend more in this area.The $49 billion purchase of the shares it did not already own in Reynolds American Inc. in 2017 stretched BAT’s balance sheet, pushing net debt to more than 6 times Ebitda. But leverage has come down to around 3.5 times, according to an estimate by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Duncan Fox. That’s still high, but it gives Bowles more scope to invest and pay the dividend.Rival Imperial has made a big bet on vaping with its Blu brand, while it also has a strong position in oral tobacco. But it was late into heat not burn, only launching Pulze in Japan in May. Whoever succeeds Cooper as CEO will need to decide whether to expand in this category, or double down on vaping.  Either way, it will mean more investment. For that, the new CEO can draw on the cash generated by the traditional cigarette business, an up to 2 billion-pound asset disposal program and a new dividend policy. The company will return any additional cash to shareholders through buy-backs. It should divert at least some of this into tobacco alternatives instead.Both companies should take care not to create a teen vaping craze at home. After complaints from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and other organizations, the U.K.’s advertising regulator this month banned BAT from using public Instagram accounts to promote smoking alternatives like e-cigarettes. However, it didn’t find that the company had designed ads specifically to target youth.At least investment decisions could be made against a calmer market backdrop in the U.S. There’s a growing consensus that the vaping-related illnesses and deaths involved vaping oils carrying the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned against using black-market products.In 2020, new U.S. regulations will require companies to submit applications by May to keep their e-cigarettes on the market. Big tobacco has the resources to go through this complicated and expensive process. Smaller producers may not. Over about the next 12 months, this regime could reduce some of the competitive pressures on big tobacco. But in both tobacco and newer alternatives, it’s not going to be plain sailing. Numerous U.S. states have outlawed some kinds of e-cigarettes, and although a federal ban on vape flavors aside from tobacco now looks less likely after backtracking by President Donald Trump, it can’t be ruled out. Meanwhile, at some point, U.S. regulators may return their attention to efforts to reduce the amount of nicotine  and ban menthol flavors in traditional cigarettes, bringing more pain to what remains tobacco companies’ biggest and most profitable segment by far. (Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, has campaigned for and given money in support of a nationwide ban in the U.S. on flavored e-cigarettes and tobacco.)Pressure there, and everywhere, could bring more industry hook ups. Philip Morris International and Altria in September ended their brief merger flirtation. Such talks could always come back onto the agenda again or the two may look abroad. Imperial has long been seen as a takeover target, with Japan Tobacco Inc. considered the most likely buyer. A new Imperial CEO may walk in the door only to find that there is a predator hard on the company’s heels.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-01-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Altria Group Inc.’s investment in Juul Labs Inc. is getting vaporized.The tobacco giant on Thursday announced a $4.1 billion non-cash charge related to its stake in the maker of electronic cigarettes. It’s the second writedown in three months, and means Altria’s 35% stake is now valued at $4.2 billion, about a third of its original $12.8 billion investment. Altria shares more than 5% in midday trading.The Marlboro maker’s Juul transaction, in December 2018, was part of a familiar playbook across Big Tobacco. With demand for cigarettes declining, it had little choice but to join other market leaders in the industry in pivoting toward alternatives with potentially lower health risks, but higher growth prospects.For most players, there have been hurdles along the way. Two years ago, for example, demand for devices that heat rather than burn tobacco slowed in Japan — the biggest market for this kind of alternative — which was a problem for Philip Morris Intenational Inc. and the U.K.’s British American Tobacco Plc. Unfortunately, with Juul, Altria has encountered more challenges than most.A crisis has engulfed the vaping industry after a spate of illnesses and deaths related to electronic cigarette use. Even though there is a growing consensus that these occurrences involved vaping oils carrying the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, the events have taken their toll on the U.S. vaping market.Juul has been at the forefront of criticism, besieged by lawsuits accusing it of using sweet fruit and candy flavors to overtly target underage users. The Food and Drug Administration recently announced a ban on flavors aside from menthol and tobacco for pod-based electronic cigarettes, such as those made by Juul, pending new rules coming into force in a few months time. Kenneth Shea, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, says Juul’s many challenges must include the possibility that the FDA doesn’t approve it to remain on the U.S market. All manufacturers must submit their applications to keep their products on sale by May.Along with the Juul writedown, Altria has moved to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with Juul. It has the option to be released from a non-compete clause if Juul can’t sell electronic cigarettes in the U.S. for at least a year – acknowledging the possibility that Juul won’t get FDA approval --  or if the value of its investment falls below $1.28 billion. This paves the way for Altria to introduce its own vaping cigarettes, or, more likely, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Shea, a move away from electronic cigarettes to heat-not-burn. Unlike electronic cigarettes, these haven’t been drawn into the vaping crisis. Altria has the license to distribute IQOS, Philip Morris’s heat-not-burn product, in the U.S. Given the long-term trend for declining smoking rates – Altria will no longer provide multi- year forecasts for U.S. cigarette declines --  all tobacco companies, must find alternatives to traditional cigarettes.  At the time of its original investment, Juul was disrupting the industry, leaving Marlboro man trailing in its wake. By getting in on the act, it was hoping to future-proof its business.But Altria should have been more aware of the risks,  particularly those related to underage vaping, which were plain to see, after Juul axed social media accounts and pulled some flavors. And it should have factored this into the price it paid. To be fair, it couldn’t have foreseen how the environment for electronic cigarettes in the U.S. would deteriorate so dramatically over the past six months.Altria’s new emphasis on heat-not-burn over vaping looks sensible, but it makes the Juul investment look a very expensive foray into a category it may end up moving away from. As Altria’s investment dollars go up in smoke, so do any hopes that its shift away from cigarettes  will be quick or easy.  To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

The company reiterated its guidance in a statement published ahead of a presentation later in the day at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) Conference in Boca Raton, Florida. The guidance includes a 4 cents per share impact from currency movements. The company is assuming total international industry volumes, excluding China and the U.S., will decline 3% to 4%, partly due to the impact of an above-inflation excise tax increase in Indonesia, and the further shift to the cigarillo category in Japan. Those items are expected to account for about 100 basis points of the decline. The company is expecting total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 2.5% to 3.5%.

2020-02-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A quarter century ago, a man named Steve Parrish was the ugly voice of the tobacco industry. The tobacco wars were raging: States were suing the cigarette companies, whistle-blowers were leaking damning documents to the media and David Kessler, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, was trying to regulate tobacco products.Parrish was a senior executive at Altria at the time, and his job was to strike back. He would go on television and hurl insults at Kessler. He would insist that cigarettes weren’t addictive. He would denounce the mounting lawsuits in strident language.Eventually, though, Parrish realized that Big Tobacco had no choice but to negotiate with its opponents. And once he sat down with the other side, a funny thing happened. His anger dissipated when he realized that Big Tobacco’s critics were reasonable people with legitimate concerns — and that Altria, stuck in its bunker for so long, had been wrong to dismiss them. “All we knew was our own rhetoric,” he told me years later. Ultimately, those negotiations led the tobacco companies to agree to pay the states $246 billion and accept tighter restrictions on cigarette marketing.I bring this up because of something that took place last week. On Wednesday morning, Vital Strategies, a leading global public health organization, sponsored a talk titled “Hope Meets Reality: E-Cigarettes, a Public Health Harm or Harm Reduction?” The event was a one-sided assault on e-cigarettes.One speaker was Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Myers has been a critic of e-cigarettes from the start — but he’s been in overdrive ever since Juul became the e-cigarette of choice for teenagers. Its manufacturer, Juul Labs Inc., faces a host of legal woes, including a joint investigation by 39 attorneys general announced on Tuesday. (Both Vital Strategies and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids are supported financially by Bloomberg Philanthropies.)After his talk, Myers was joined on stage by another e-cigarette critic, Joanna Cohen, the director of the Institute for Global Tobacco Control at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The two of them took turns bashing e-cigarettes. Myers complained about “the few zealous people” who continued to argue that e-cigarettes could save lives; Cohen claimed that “there was some evidence of nicotine’s effect on the cardiovascular system.” And so on.Among those who had registered to attend the talk was Moira Gilchrist, the vice president for scientific and public communications at Philip Morris International. That’s right: She’s part of Big Tobacco. Gilchrist is in charge of the company’s harm-reduction efforts. The scientists she leads devise nicotine products that won’t kill consumers the way cigarettes do.Virtually everyone in the public health community is skeptical that Philip Morris is serious about transitioning the company to products that don’t rely on deadly combustible tobacco. But Gilchrist is a true believer. She joined the company a dozen years ago after working at a leading cancer charity in the U.K., she told me the other day. “This is not something we are doing for show,” she said. “This is our commercial future.”A few days before the Vital Strategies talk, Gilchrist received a note from the group disinviting her. “In accordance with our non-engagement policy, tobacco industry representatives will not be granted access,” it read.  In an accompanying statement, Vital Strategies elaborated: Let us be clear: There is a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest between public health and the tobacco industry. And as an organization whose mission is to ensure everyone is protected by a strong public health system, we at Vital Strategies align ourselves with the World Health Organization, governments around the world, and the global health community in upholding a firm non-engagement policy with the tobacco industry.As it turns out, the talk was streamed, and Gilchrist was able to watch it. When we spoke the next day, she told me that there were things that Myers and Cohen had said that she would have liked to challenge if she had been allowed in the room.For instance, the case that nicotine harms the cardiovascular system has been made most prominently by Stanton Glantz, an anti-tobacco zealot who is a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. One widely quoted Glantz study published last year purported to show that e-cigarettes doubled the risk of heart attacks. But last week, the Journal of the American Heart Association retracted that study because its data was “unreliable.”As for Myers, one of the key points he made in his talk was that there was no evidence that smokeless nicotine devices were causing large numbers of adults to quit smoking but  there was lots of evidence that they were hooking teenagers. Of course, part of the reason adult smokers aren’t racing to take up e-cigarettes is that the public health community has heaped such abuse on them that many adults don’t realize they are safer than cigarettes.Philip Morris doesn’t make an e-cigarette like Juul. Its product, called IQOS, delivers nicotine by heating tobacco rather than burning it. And as Gilchrist pointed out when we spoke, there is plenty of evidence that it is moving smokers away from cigarettes. In Japan, IQOS has nearly 18% of the market — not the smokeless market, but the tobacco market, including cigarettes. (“We have seen the most remarkable drop in cigarette sales,” she said.) In Russia it has 5% of the market. In Portugal 7.2%.Last spring, the FDA approved the device for sale in the U.S., ruling that it is “appropriate for the protection of public health” because it contains fewer toxins than cigarettes. Philip Morris has now submitted data to the agency as it seeks a designation that would allow it to market IQOS as less harmful than cigarettes — something e-cigarettes are not allowed to do. That would be a tremendously big deal.Gilchrist told me that there were many things public health advocates believe that Philip Morris also believes: that e-cigarettes should be kept away from youths, for instance, and that the products should be heavily regulated, based on sound science. But, she added, “what I see is that the public health organizations are using youth use as a reason to deprive 40 million U.S. smokers from having access to these products.” She added:This is the future of this company. We have the product, the science, and the will to make it work. For us, there is one path forward and it is smoke-free products. The question is whether public health wants to make it more difficult for us or less difficult.I understand why the public health community doesn’t want to legitimize the tobacco companies by meeting with them; they did a lot of shameful things in the past, and they still sell a product that kills about half its users. The memory of those old sins makes public health officials skeptical that tobacco executives like Gilchrist are sincere when they say they want a cigarette-free future.But the only way we’re going to solve the e-cigarette conundrum — namely, how do we keep the products away from youths while urging adult smokers to make the switch? — is if the two sides sit down and start talking. I think the public health officials would see — just as Parrish saw two decades ago — that those on the other side genuinely want to find a solution. At that point, the two sides could fairly easily come up with proposals that would work for everyone. The refusal to engage with the tobacco companies is actually harming public health.As I’ve noted before, one of the people who negotiated with Parrish all those years ago was Myers. It took a lot of guts; when his allies in the public health community discovered that he was involved in the tobacco settlement talks, he was roundly denounced. But he stuck with it and helped change the cigarette landscape for the better. If only he were willing to do it again, he could hasten the end of cigarettes.(Corrects the given name of Stanton Glantz, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in the 11th paragraph.

2020-02-28,"The coronavirus outbreak has been taking up its fair share of headline space, and rightly so. The virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, but large-scale outbreaks are now appearing in South Korea, Iran and Italy. While healthcare companies are working around the clock to develop a vaccine, the reality for now is harsh: a rapidly spreading virus is causing major disruptions to international travel and trade. China’s economy has already taken a serious hit, and even Apple has announced that its Q1 2020 results will suffer badly from the economic impact of the coronavirus. As a result, the S&P 500 is down 12% from its February 19 peak.Investors don’t want much, really: just a guaranteed return on a stock that pays back a steady income stream, even when markets tumble. It’s not too much to ask for. It can be hard to find, however. Strong returns – based on gains in share price – typically don’t go hand-in-hand with a steady income stream – based on dividends. The two forms of investment returns are based on different marketing and business strategies by the companies involved.A careful look into the TipRanks database, however, can bring up intriguing choices for income-minded investors to study. The Stock Screener tool has filters to sort more than 6,200 stocks, making it a breeze to find the right one for your investment profile. Setting the filters to scan for tickers with over 5% dividend yields and “Strong Buy” consensus ratings, the search is narrowed to 41 companies. Here are three  with a clear path forward and proven returns. Let's take a closer look.Philip Morris International (PM)Sin stocks are a classic choice for dividend hunters. Most of us can agree that cigarettes and alcohol are just plain bad for you, and that they are addictive, but those very attributes help guarantee a high sales floor. Philip Morris has been riding that wave for decades.There has been some interesting news about PM in recent months. In 2H19, the company entered into talks with Altria, its former parent, regarding a ‘merger of equals’ deal. Those talks were called off in September, much to investors’ pleasure. The companies will, instead, pursue a joint venture in iQOS, a heated smokeless tobacco product, in the US market. PM has already put some $6 billion dollars into iQOS, while Altria’s tobacco alternatives – in vaping – are facing serious regulatory and public relations challenges.That being said, investors did get some good news after the company reported a Q4 earnings beat earlier this month. EPS beat the estimate by 1 cent, coming in at $1.22, and the $7.71 billion in revenue edged out the forecast by half a percent.Investors will be pleased with PM’s dividend, too. The payment, $1.17 quarterly, annualizes to $4.68 and gives a yield of 5.51%. The company has a 12-year history of reliably maintaining the payment, and has raised it three times in the past three years. The yield compares favorably to the average among S&P listed companies, which is only 2%.Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery reviewed this stock last week, and wrote, “We remain bullish on PM's strong underlying core earnings growth and incremental iQOS earnings to be attractive, and it is our top pick in the space... We believe its 2020 guidance is appropriately conservative, though we believe it can exceed its minimum expectations. Buybacks may also be in play for 2021.”Lavery maintained his $114 price target, implying room for a strong 32% upside potential, and reiterated his Buy rating. (To watch Lavery’s track record, click here)Philip Morris’ Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 4 Buys against a single Hold, all set in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $83.07, and the $101.20 average price target suggests it has room to grow another 22%. (See Philip Morris price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)Moelis & Company (MC)The next stock on today’s list, Moelis, is an investment banking company. The firm is an independent operator, offering advisory services to corporations, financial sponsors, and governments. Advisory services include recapitalizations and restructurings as well as mergers and acquisitions.The financial industry’s services are always in demand, a fact which has supported this stock over the years, and shows in the quarterly reports. Even though Q4 revenues were down 6% year-over-year, at $223.5 million, and EPS slipped 51% year-over-year to 38 cents, both figures were well above Wall Street’s forecasts. It was the fifth quarter in a row that beat the forecasts.A company that consistently beats earnings forecasts will surely attract attention – but so will a company that keeps up its dividend. MC announced a $1.26 per share payment this month, to be paid at the end of March. This is a jump from the usual quarterly divided of 51 cents – but it is consistent with company practice for February dividends. The annualized regular payment, at $2.04 per share, gives a yield of 5.96%, or nearly triple the S&P average.Ken Worthington, reviewing MC for J.P. Morgan, likes what he sees. He writes, “Moelis continues to see a rather favorable macro environment lining up for a robust client activity outlook going forward, pointing especially to the private sector, where Moelis sees its strong relationship with sponsors paving the way for more sponsor-related deals.”Worthington gives the stock a Buy rating and increased the price target from $44 to $49, implying robust upside potential of nearly 50%. (To watch Worthington’s track record, click here)Also bullish is Jeff Harte from Piper Sandler. Harte was impressed by the company’s earnings, especially that EPS beat the forecasts. In line with this development, Harte says, “We are increasing our 2020 EPS estimates from $2.98 to $3.00 and initiating a 2021 EPS estimate of $3.14.”Harte puts a Buy rating on this stock along with a price target of $44. His target indicates a 33% potential upside to the shares. (To watch Harte’s track record, click here)Overall, Moelis has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 4 recent Buy-side reviews. The average price target is $41.25, suggesting an upside potential of 17%. (See Moelis stock analysis on TipRanks)Two Harbors Investment (TWO)Last on our list today is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), another classic dividend choice. And no wonder why – required by tax code to return most of their profits to investors and shareholders, these companies have some of the highest dividend yields among publicly traded stocks.TWO is no exception. This company, which owns both real properties and mortgage-backed securities, with a focus on residential properties, pays out 40 cents per share quarterly, or $1.60 annualized. This equates to a dividend yield of 10.86%, more than 5 times the average – and more than 6 times the yield of Treasury bonds.The company did have a disappointing Q4, though. TWO reported EPS of just 25 cents, 11 cents below estimates, and shares slipped after the news. Revenues, however, beat the forecast handily by $8.7 million, coming in at $71.2 million.Writing on the stock after the earnings report, JMP Securities analyst Trevor Cranston said, “We currently expect the $0.40 dividend to be sustained for the foreseeable future, as management indicated that it views the underlying return profile of the portfolio as continuing to support that figure. This dividend level provides a yield of 10.86% on the current share price.”Cranston’s optimism on the dividend prompted his Buy rating on the stock. He gives TWO shares a $15.50 price target, suggesting room for 10% upside potential. The real attraction for investors here is the powerful dividend return. (To watch Cranston’s track record, click here)All in all, with 5 Buy ratings and only 1 Hold, Two Harbors gets a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus view. Shares are priced at $14.13 and the upside potential stands at 9%, based on an average price target of $15.45.

2020-03-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest with assets of about $945 billion, has seen its returns eroded this year as the Covid-19 pandemic trashes equities. Its ethical approach to investing, however, may help it eventually emerge from the rout with fewer bruises than other asset managers.Norges Bank Investment Management’s equity portfolio was down about 23% through Wednesday, the fund said last week. That followed a return on stocks of 26% in 2019 that, along with its fixed income and property investments, contributed to an overall return for last year of almost 20%, the best performance since 2009.None of that was too surprising. Its equity returns act as a proxy for global stocks, which boomed last year and have plummeted in recent weeks. What stands out, though, is how the fund is starting to reap the benefits of putting environmental, social and governance considerations at the forefront of its investment decisions, while the rest of the investing crowd starts to catch up with the need for capital allocation to serve a broader aim of ranges than just corporate profitability.  The details provided in the fund’s “Return and Risk” report make it possible to discern a possible pathway to success.The fund has two broad categories of companies it shuns and ejects from its benchmark calculations: Exclusions based on products discard weapons makers, tobacco companies and those that depend on coal production for their revenue; exclusions based on corporate conduct cover firms guilty of corruption, environmental damage or human rights violations. Overall, kicking miscreants out of the portfolio has boosted returns for the past two years.The impact of that stance is evolving over time. As the chart shows, swings between positive and negative contributions are getting smaller. When looked at since 2006, returns have been 1.3 percentage points lower than they would have been without the exclusions, according to the fund’s calculations. But the bulk of that underperformance is because of a rip-roaring performance by tobacco companies Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc. for most of that time, although they’ve dipped recently.As a result, the decision to exclude tobacco producers and makers of other potentially harmful products have subtracted 2.1 percentage points from returns in the past decade and a half or so. But that only tells part of the story.By contrast, the decision to avoid companies on the basis of their conduct toward society has actually boosted returns by 0.8 percentage point since 2006, the fund calculates. Moreover, as environmental, social and governance issues have become more prevalent in portfolio construction across the industry as a whole and more fund managers adopt similar exclusion policies, the Norwegian fund is starting to see benefits from its stance on both categorizations.  Last year, for example, barring companies that depend on coal for their revenue, whether by mining the fossil fuel or using it to generate power, added 8 basis points to returns; shunning tobacco companies, which fell out of favor with investors last year relative to the broader market, added a further 4 basis points.Those are small numbers given the amount of money involved. But Norway’s sovereign fund has been a trailblazer in its willingness to withhold capital from companies deemed not to share its values. If it can prove that doing good need not mean sacrificing returns, more of the asset management community might be persuaded to follow suit – for all of our sakes.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mark Gilbert is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering asset management.

2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Lloyd Bridges’s character in the disaster comedy “Airplane” captured it quite well when he said, “Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking.” It’s a sentiment shared by people locked down around the world. While demand for most everything outside of food and toilet paper has declined, cigarettes are holding up.In an environment where companies are ditching their profit guidance left, right and center, Imperial Brands Plc, which makes Kool and Gauloises cigarettes, said on Tuesday that so far the virus had had no material impact on performance and trading remained in line with expectations. That echoes comments two weeks ago from British American Tobacco Plc. Shares in Imperial rose as much as 15%In the coronavirus-induced consumer crisis, big tobacco is certainly living up to its defensive reputation.After all, if people are addicted to nicotine, they still need their fix. And the pandemic-stricken world we live in provides incentives to light up more often:  Anxiety induced by ever-grimmer headlines; the fact that local stores selling cigarettes are still open; and the ease with which you can take a fag break when working from home as opposed to having to step outside the office.But it’s not unqualified good news for the industry.Imperial, which also makes Golden Virginia tobacco,  said that its factories were building contingency stocks, and its Logista distribution business serving Italy, France and Spain was doing the same to ensure supplies could get through to retailers. It’s also possible that as with rice and pasta, consumers are stockpiling cigarettes in case of even more stringent isolation measures down the road. So some demand may have been pulled forward, meaning this uptick might not be sustained in the long term.What’s more concerning is a recent focus on the increased risk of Covid-19 to smokers, and whether that may encourage more people to quit once the crisis has passed. Reports that the state of New York was in discussions about potentially banning cigarettes made headlines, but Bloomberg News reported on Monday that consideration of a ban was “100% not true.”Still, a renewed focus on personal health, especially where everyone’s lungs are concerned, would likely hurt cigarette sales in the future. These are all challenges tobacco companies will have to grapple with as they race to find what alternative product will drive growth if or when the world does kick its cigarette habit. The industry was already working to get past questions about health risks around vaping, which was last year linked with a spate of cases of respiratory illness. Groups including BAT, Altria Group Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. have invested billions of dollars in electronic cigarettes and devices that heat rather than burn tobacco. Altria took a 35% stake in vaping leader Juul Labs Inc., which it has now written down. Right now, though, with the prospect of economic conditions deteriorating, tobacco’s resilience in the face of recession should come to the fore, especially given that traditional cigarettes remain the industry’s most profitable product. Smokers may trade down if money becomes tight, or switch to rolling their own cigarettes. But Duncan Fox, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, says that even then pure tobacco has higher margins.So from a position a few months ago, where vaping sales were under pressure, but there were worries about an accelerated decline in smoking traditional cigarettes too, Big Tobacco’s core business now looks to be on a surer footing. That’s bad for public health, and for those funds that choose not to invest in cigarettes. But at least it can help preserve the industry’s profits and chunky dividend payouts for investors, when those at many other companies are suffering.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-04-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Cigarette makers may seem like an unlikely source of life-saving vaccines, yet Philip Morris International Inc. and British American Tobacco Plc are trying to devise a defense against the coronavirus from the humble tobacco leaf.BAT said Wednesday that it’s in pre-clinical testing of a plant-based vaccine via a U.S. biotech subsidiary Kentucky BioProcessing. Philip Morris has said its partially owned Canadian unit Medicago expects to start human trials for a potential vaccine this summer.“We believe we have made a significant breakthrough,” said David O’Reilly, BAT’s director of scientific research. “We stand ready to work with governments and all stakeholders to help win the war against Covid-19.”Big Tobacco isn’t a total stranger to the field: BAT’s Kentucky BioProcessing was involved in developing ZMapp, an Ebola drug, with Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. in 2014 -- but that treatment never made it out of the lab. The race to find a vaccine is essential as world leaders question how long countries can remain in lockdown without extinguishing future economic prospects.The involvement of tobacco companies in the fight against Covid-19 may strike some as paradoxical as the World Health Organization has said smoking may raise the risk of coming down with more severe reactions to the disease.Philip Morris’s Medicago uses a virus-like particle grown in a close relative of the tobacco plant. Plant-based vaccines mimic viruses and allow the body’s immune system to recognize them and create an immune response, without being able to infect or replicate.Kentucky BioProcessing recently cloned a portion of Covid-19’s genetic sequence, which led to a substance that induces the production of antibodies. The antigen was then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction. According to BAT, the method generates the vaccine faster than conventional methods, reducing the time required from several months to about six weeks.BAT’s U.S. unit Reynolds American bought Kentucky BioProcessing in 2014 planning to use its tobacco extraction technology to develop alternatives to cigarettes. The company is now exploring partnerships with government agencies to bring the experimental vaccine to clinical studies. BAT said while the unit is a commercial business, its work on a Covid-19 vaccine will be on a not-for-profit basis.Researchers in China were quick to share the virus’s genetic sequence with other scientists, providing them with a headstart to hunt for treatments and vaccines. They are testing everything from drugs first developed for HIV and the flu to antibody-containing plasma from recovered patients.(Updates with smoking’s effect on Covid-19 patients in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Coronavirus Vaccine Race Gets Unlikely Partner: Big Tobacco

Cases appear to be flattening in areas including Chicago and Boston, while New Orleans is back to its baseline for infections, Birx said at the daily White House briefing. Philadelphia, Houston, Atlanta and Nashville are also among cities improving, she said.The Washington, D.C., region is one where “we don’t see a decline yet,” Birx said. Nursing homes in rural areas are also seeing outbreaks.USNS Comfort to Leave N.Y. (6:20 a.m. HK)President Donald Trump said the Naval hospital ship the USNS Comfort will return to Virginia, where it’s based, after it was sent to New York City to supplement the health-care system and add capacity following the surge in coronavirus cases last month.Trump said at his daily press conference that he discussed the matter with in a meeting Tuesday with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who Trump said agreed to returning the ship.Trump to Ask Big Companies to Repay Aid (6:15 a.m. HK)President Donald Trump said he’ll ask larger companies to return money they accessed from the federal stimulus package because it was intended to help small businesses.Trump, speaking Tuesday at a White House press conference, criticized Harvard University’s endowment for borrowing more than $8 million through the program.“They shouldn’t have taken it,” Trump said. “And they’re going to pay back that money.”Speaking at the same press conference, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threatened “severe consequences” for those who take money from the program without meeting the criteria and fail to return it.Senate Passes Third Virus Package (5:30 p.m. NY)The U.S. Senate passed $484 billion in new pandemic relief funds Tuesday to bolster a tapped-out small business aid program, pay for coronavirus testing and help hospitals deluged by sick patients.The legislation, which the House could take up as early as Thursday, includes $320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program designed to help struggling small businesses keep their workers on the payroll. The program has already committed all of the $350 billion allocated when it was created just weeks ago.The Paycheck Protection Program “is already helping millions of small-business employees receive paychecks instead of pink slips,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement before the voice vote.President Donald Trump said he would sign the legislation and then turn to the next round of stimulus for an economy that has ground to a halt.South Africa Sets Up Aid Package (5 p.m. NY)South Africa’s government unveiled a 500 billion rand ($26 billion) package to shore up an economy devastated by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and support those who’ve been worst affected.The plan will be funded by reprioritizing 130 billion rand of expenditure from existing budgets, and borrowing from domestic and international lenders, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Tuesday in a televised address to the nation. There will be 200 billion rand in guarantees for banks to encourage them to lend, a 100 billion-rand allocation to protect and create jobs and an additional 50 billion rand for welfare grants for the poor and unemployed, he said.“The coronavirus pandemic requires an economic response equal to the scale of the disruption it’s causing,” Ramaphosa said. “The scale of this emergency relief program is historic. It demonstrates that we will not spare any effort or any expense in our determination to support our people and protect them from harm.”South Africa has been relatively spared the worst of the ravages of the pandemic -- it’s had 3,465 infections and 58 fatalities so far. Still, a lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the disease and preventing the health system from being overwhelmed is damaging the economy, with the central bank expecting it to contract 6.1% this year.Netflix, Chipotle Gain on Lockdown (4:50 p.m. NY)Netflix Inc. added nearly twice as many subscribers as predicted in the first quarter, cementing its role as one of the rare companies to benefit from the global health crisis. Netflix added a record 15.8 million paid subscribers during the first quarter, almost double the 8.47 million forecast by Wall Street analysts. The company also clobbered its own forecast of 7 million, with droves of new customers binge-watching “Tiger King” or “Love Is Blind” to ride out the quarantine.Chipotle’s loyalty program is helping it connect with customers as digital sales grew 80%. It’s had to temporarily close about 100 restaurants, primarily those inside malls and shopping centers, as well as some locations in Europe. It withdrew its earlier guidance for the fiscal year, citing the uncertainty related to the virus. The company has enough cash on hand for over a year, so it doesn’t plan to tap the government’s Paycheck Protection Program, it said in reporting first quarter results.Treasury Has Used Half of Relief Fund (4:40 p.m. NY)The U.S. Treasury has deployed more than half of the Coronavirus Relief Fund, which provides for payments to state, local, and tribal governments.As of Monday, $81.9 billion had been used this month, according to the daily Treasury statement. The $150 billion fund was established to help lessen the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. The pandemic has crushed sources of tax revenue for states and municipalities at a time when resources, including paramedics and hospitals, are being committed to combat the threat to public health.U.S. Confirmed Cases Rise 5.7% (4 p.m. NY)U.S. cases rose 5.7% from the day before to 810,561, the biggest daily increase since April 10, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That topped Monday’s growth rate of 2.7% and the average daily increase of 4.4% over the past week.In New York, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, cases rose 3.5%.New Jersey reported a one-day record of 379 new deaths, bringing total fatalities in the second hardest-hit state to 4,753. New Jersey cases rose 3.9%.California had a 7.4% increase in positive cases from Monday, Governor Gavin Newsom said. The state reported 60 deaths, a 5% increase. Hospitalizations climbed 3.3%, with intensive-care patients up 3.8%.Texas reported its first bump in new cases in five days, with a 38% increase to 738, according to the state’s health department. Total cases are now just under 22,000.Florida reported 27,495 cases, up 3.1%, from a day earlier. Deaths reached 839, an increase of 6.3%.Panel Warns on Trump-Backed Drug Combo (2:28 p.m. NY)A panel of medical experts convened by the U.S. National Institutes of Health recommended against the use of a drug combination touted by President Donald Trump for Covid-19 patients.The NIH panel, made up of 50 doctors, pharmacy experts and government researchers and officials, specifically recommended against the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin. The malaria pill can cause heart issues, and the NIH panel warned of the potential for harm from the combination.Trump has repeatedly backed the use of the drugs on Twitter and at numerous briefings of the Coronavirus Task Force, though some medical experts in his administration have cautioned about the lack of evidence.Netherlands to Reopen Primary Schools (2 p.m. NY)The Netherlands will reopen primary schools and daycare centers starting May 11 while all other measures constituting what Prime Minister Mark Rutte has called an “intelligent lockdown” are extended until at least May 19. The ban on mass events, including professional football, was extended until Sept. 1.French ICU Patients at Lowest in 3 Weeks (2 p.m. NY)France reported the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus outbreak fell to the lowest in three weeks, while new deaths linked to the virus declined from a day earlier.Patients in intensive care dropped by 250 to 5,433, Director General for Health Jerome Salomon said in a Tuesday briefing in Paris. The number of ICU patients, which Salomon has said is an indicator of the outbreak’s impact on the country’s hospital system, fell for a 13th day to the lowest since March 30.Texas Cases Rise 38% (1:30 p.m.)Texas reported its first bump in new cases in five days, with a 38% increase to 738, according to the state’s health department. The jump came a day after testing almost doubled to more than 15,000. Total cases now stand at just under 22,000.Deaths in the Lone Star State edged higher to 22 on Tuesday, bringing the total to 517. The Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas have accounted for more than half the fatalities so far, although that is based on incomplete figures because not every death is geographically tagged in the state’s database.There are about 1,400 patients in Texas hospitals and more than 6,200 ventilators still available, according to the state.U.K. Vaccine Trials Begin Thursday (12:49 p.m. NY)The U.K. will give 40.5 million pounds ($50 million) to vaccine development projects, with human trials beginning Thursday, according to Health Secretary Matt Hancock.Of that amount, 20 million pounds will go to the University of Oxford to fund clinical trials while 20.5 million pounds will go to development projects at Imperial College London, he said.Italy Recoveries Almost Surpass New Cases (12:15 p.m.)Italy reported an almost equal number of virus recoveries and new infections on Tuesday as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte draws up a plan to cautiously extricate the country from a nationwide lockdown.There were 2,729 new cases of the disease, compared with 2,256 a day earlier, the first increase in five days, according to the civil protection agency. The number of freshly recovered patients was 2,723 over the past 24 hours, a daily record. Confirmed cases now total 183,957.Cuomo Prods U.S. for Test Supplies (12:11 p.m. NY)Hours before meeting President Donald Trump, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that while it may be states’ responsibility to organize virus testing, the federal government needs to handle international supply-chain issues.His comments address a touchy subject between the two politicians. Trump has repeatedly said that states should be in charge of the testing needed to reopen their economies. Cuomo said he plans to ask Trump to take charge of getting manufacturers to provide testing supplies and feeding them to the states, and the states can take it from there.Florida Cases Rise 3.1% as Reopening Looms (11:46 a.m. NY)Florida reported 27,495 Covid-19 cases Tuesday, up 845, or 3.1%, from a day earlier. Deaths reached 839, an increase of 6.3%.For most of April, coronavirus cases in Florida have increased at a clip of about 1,000 a day, and have shown some signs of slowing in recent days.Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has seized upon the numbers as he began holding meetings this week of his “Re-Open Florida Task Force.” Addressing the group on a conference call Monday, DeSantis said the premise of shutting down the state was to avoid overwhelming the health-care system. That has been accomplished, he said.N.Y to Allow Elective Outpatient Treatment (11:15 a.m. NY)New York state will begin allowing elective outpatient surgery in some areas as coronavirus hospitalizations level off, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.The state will allow outpatient treatments in counties and hospitals that don’t have a significant risk of a virus surge in the near-term, mostly outside the New York City region, Cuomo said in his daily press briefing. Outpatient services won’t put any strain on hospital beds, the governors said.Deaths in New York rose 481 yesterday to 14,828 in total, while hospitalizations were basically flat, Cuomo said. The death rate has slowed over the past few weeks.U.K. Parliament Agrees to Virtual Sittings (11:06 a.m. NY)Britain’s House of Commons agreed to new rules allowing members to take part in proceedings remotely during the lockdown. The chamber, often packed because it’s too small for its 650 members, will now be restricted so only 50 people can be present at a time.Benches have been blocked off to keep those present at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart and other MPs will be able to ask questions using Zoom. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle will continue to chair proceedings from the chamber. Plans for virtual voting are still being worked up.Running of the Bulls Suspended (10:40 a.m. NY)The Spanish city of Pamplona suspended the week-long San Fermin festival set for July that includes the world famous running of the bulls.“As much as it was expected, it gives us great sadness,” the city’s acting mayor, Ana Elizalde, said in a statement, adding that it’s too early to know if the event will be rescheduled. The city’s actual mayor, Enrique Maya, is at home, recovering from COVID-19 “little by little.”As the event traditionally draws thousands of visitors from around the world, the city said it’s launching a campaign with videos to honor the tradition.Humanitarian Fund Is Short (9:22 a.m. NY)The heads of 15 international organizations, including the World Health Organization, wrote an open letter to the donor community saying a United Nations effort to raise $2 billion to help fight Covid-19 in the most vulnerable countries has so far raised only about a quarter of the goal. The World Food Programme needs more money to help pay for flights and shipments of medical supplies, and any delay may undermine efforts to control the coronavirus, the letter said.EU Set to Prolong PPE Export Curbs (9:20 a.m. NY)The European Union plans to prolong curbs on the export of personal protective equipment while narrowing the scope, EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said. The restrictions, due to lapse on Saturday after six weeks, will be extended for 30 days, Hogan told a video-conference with the European Parliament’s trade committee. The current measures require an authorization for the export outside the bloc of goods including masks, gloves and garments.Home Testing Kit Gets U.S. Approval (9:05 a.m. NY)Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings gained U.S. authorization for the first home-testing kit for Covid-19. Patients will collect samples from their noses and send them to LapCorp for testing, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Tuesday.The kits are expected to be available in most states with a doctor’s order in the coming weeks, according to the FDA. The agency said it worked with LabCorp to ensure the tests are as accurate as those done in a doctor’s office or hospital.Pandemic Hits U.S. Earnings (9:04 a.m. NY)HCA Healthcare Inc. suspended its quarterly dividend program and withdrew its outlook.Philip Morris International Inc. abandoned its 2020 earnings guidance as the coronavirus outbreak weighs on duty-free tobacco sales, while Coca-Cola Co. said the impact of the pandemic on the second quarter will be “material.” International Business Machines Corp. shares fell after the company reported a drop in first-quarter revenue and pulled its full-year earnings outlook.A UBS model suggests that U.S. companies’ earnings-per-share estimates for the next 12 months could be slashed by almost 15% in the coming eight weeks.Schumer Says Aid Deal Reached; White House Says It’s Close (9:03 a.m. NY)Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday his party’s congressional leaders and the Trump administration reached a tentative deal on an emergency economic rescue package that will replenish a tapped-out small business aid program and provide money for coronavirus testing and overwhelmed hospitals.An administration official said Tuesday the sides were “very close” to a deal. A Senate Republican aide said no agreement had been reached yet.U.K. May Post ‘Modest Contraction’ in First Quarter: Haldane (8:46 a.m. NY)Economic figures for the first half of the year will probably be “very ugly,” Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said in a podcast with the Institute for Government. He said the second quarter will show a sharper contraction, and those patterns will be replicated across the world.Separately, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters on Tuesday that the government is standing by its testing target. At the beginning of April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock had pledged to get the daily testing rate up to 100,000. While capacity is now closing in on 40,000, a fourfold increase since the start of the month, finding people to test is proving more problematic.“Clearly we need to make sure that that capacity is being used and that’s what we’re working on,” Slack said.Netherlands New Cases Fall to Lowest Since March 23 (8:12 a.m. NY)The Netherlands reported 729 new cases, the least in nearly a month, bringing the total up 2% to 34,134. Deaths rose by 4% to 3,916, while reported hospital admissions increased 1%, the RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment said in its daily update.Prime Minister Mark Rutte will announce late Tuesday whether lockdown measures in the country will be relaxed.EU Health Commissioner Urges Caution (7:20 a.m. NY)Governments in the European Union mustn’t be complacent even if the number of infections is stabilizing, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said, urging caution in easing lockdown measures. Quick, uncoordinated exits risk jeopardizing the sacrifices of citizens and medical staff, she told members of the European Parliament’s health committee.The EU is also boosting efforts to develop a vaccine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will host an online pledging conference on May 4 to help fill funding gaps and mobilize investment necessary for research into effective therapeutics.In a video-conference with his counterparts from Germany and Austria, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis called on neighbouring countries and the EU to proceed in a coordinated manner to ease restrictions as quickly as possible, according to a statement by the Bern-based government on TuesdayVirus May Only Be a ‘Blip’ in German Mortality Rate (6:40 a.m. NY)The new coronavirus will barely cause a “blip” in German mortality statistics if the country is able to keep its spread under control as well as it is now, the country’s public-health authority said.“If we continue to control the virus as well as is currently the case, then we probably will barely see the effect on total deaths,” said Lars Schaade, vice president of the Robert Koch Institute. “This is different in other countries with a very large number of cases.” Schaade warned against complacency, saying Germans must keep up their guard until a vaccine is found. Some 95,200 people in Germany have recovered from the virus, more than any other nation, while 4,862 have died.More European Countries Ease Lockdowns (6:20 a.m. NY)Serbia eased one of Europe’s strictest coronavirus lockdown regimes, allowing small businesses to reopen and relaxing a daily curfew that had kept most citizens indoors since mid-March. In Croatia, citizens can now move within their county of residence and Slovenia opened some businesses on Monday, while Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will next week provide details on a plan for a return to normalcy.Oil Meltdown Spreads Beyond Expiring Contracts (6 a.m. NY)The meltdown in oil markets widened, with huge losses spreading beyond contracts affected by technical anomalies as the world runs out of places to store unwanted crude. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery plunged below zero on Monday for the first time in history, but the panic selling spread to the June contract on Tuesday, which briefly dropped as much as 42% to $11.79 a barrel.The widening of the price collapse to futures that aren’t close to expiry underscored the severity of the crisis in the oil market. Storage tanks, pipelines and tankers are rapidly being overwhelmed by a vast oversupply caused by slumping fuel demand as countries are locked down to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Earlier, Brent crude futures dropped below $20 a barrel, the lowest since 2002.(A previous version corrected the spelling of Pamplona)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Cases Rise 5.7% as Trump to Pause Immigration: Virus Update

That’s with capital expenditures of approximately $0.8 billion versus the previous $1 billion guidance.“We started the year with a very strong first quarter, reflecting continued structural growth momentum driven by our smoke-free portfolio and favorable combustible tobacco pricing” said CEO André Calantzopoulos, referring to the fact that government restrictions were generally only implemented in March.However looking ahead he struck a cautious tone, saying “We expect that the pandemic will have adverse impacts on our full-year 2020 business results.”According to Calantzopoulos, the impacts already observable relate to a severe reduction of duty-free sales, slower IQOS user acquisition and delayed minimum price enforcement in Indonesia.“We also have to assume that, in certain markets, unemployment and related reductions in disposable income will have a temporary impact on market dynamics or the ability of certain small retailers to operate” he added.Nonetheless, analysts continue to display a bullish sentiment on PM stock.

2020-05-17,"There's no question Americans are facing unprecedented stresses these days. Data suggests some Americans are relying on vices such as alcohol, tobacco and cannabis to get through the health crisis. At the same time, gamblers have been driven online for the time being due to casino closures.When times are good, people like to celebrate with a drink or a smoke or a roll of the dice. When times are hard, they turn to these activities as a distraction or a means of self-medication. Regardless of how you feel about the activities themselves, here are seven ""sin stocks"" to buy that Morningstar analysts say have significant upside.Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM)Philip Morris is one of the largest global tobacco companies and holds nearly a 30% market share of the international cigarette and heated tobacco markets.Analyst Philip Gorham says Marlboro customer loyalty is extremely high and Philip Morris has considerable pricing power. The company has a first-mover advantage in heated tobacco, but it remains to be seen whether or not heated tobacco can completely offset lost cigarette volumes over time. Gorham says a successful launch of iQOS in the U.S. would generate completely incremental revenue given the company currently has no U.S. products.Philip Morris shares also pay a sizable 6.9% dividend.Morningstar has a Buy rating and $98 price target for PM stock.See Also: 7 Best Cheap Stocks To Buy Or Sell Cronos Group Inc (NASDAQ: CRON)Cronos is one of the ""big four"" Canadian legal producers of cannabis and owner of brands such as PEACE NATURALS, COVE and Lord Jones. Cronos reported impressive 180% revenue growth in the first quarter, but it also reported a $45 million operating loss.Analyst Kristoffer Inton says write-downs associated with lower prices due to oversupply in the Canadian market were the cause of the loss. However, Inton says Cronos' write-downs are shrinking, whereas other cannabis producers' losses are growing. Morningstar is projecting Canadian cannabis demand will grow 20% annually over the next decade, and Cronos has the balance sheet to expand its market share.Morningstar has a Buy rating and $8.50 fair value estimate for CRON stock.Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE: LVS)Las Vegas Sands is an international casino operator that owns casino resorts and hotels in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. Analyst Dan Wasiolek says Macau and Singapore are the keys to the bull case for Las Vegas Sands.Macau accounted for about 59% of Sands' earnings in 2019, and Singapore was another 31%. Wasiolek says Sand's has a dominant position in the high-growth Cotai Strip in Macau, and it has a duopoly in place in Singapore through at least 2030. COVID-19 shutdowns in Las Vegas and a 97% drop in gross gaming revenue due to COVID-19 may be scary, but Wasiolek estimates Las Vegas sands has 18 months of liquidity at nearly zero revenue.Mornigstar has a Buy rating and $62 fair value estimate for LVS stock.British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE: BTI)British American Tobacco is an international tobacco company that owns brands such as Lucky Strike, Newport and Camel and generates 45% of its revenue from the U.S. market.While cigarette volumes are likely in secular decline, Gorham says British American's accelerated volume declines in fiscal 2019 may be particularly troubling to investors. However, he says the company may be best-positioned to capitalize on the next generation of tobacco products, including its Vype and Vuse vaping brands an Glo heated tobacco brand. Gorham says British American's buyout of Reynolds American was a solid strategic move given its pricing power and the value of its assets.Morningstar has a Buy rating and $59 target for BTI stock.Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (NYSE: BUD)Anheuser Busch Inbev is the world's largest brewer and owner of brands such as Budweiser, Beck's and Corona.Gorham says the worst of the downturn may be yet to come for Anheuser Busch, but the company has plenty of liquidity to navigate the crisis. In the longer term, he says the company's near monopoly and cost advantages in developed markets make the stock a solid investment, and its potential for free cash flow generation isn't fully priced in at current levels. Gorham projects volumes will fall 20% in the first half of 2020 and only 7% in the second half of the year.Morningstar has a Buy rating and $96 fair value estimate for BUD stock.Altria Group Inc (NYSE: MO)Altria Group is one of the world's largest tobacco companies, but it's also one of the most diversified sin stocks. In addition to being the parent company of Philip Morris USA, Altria has a more than 10% ownership stake in Anheuser Busch, a 35% stake in vaping leader JUUL, and a 45% stake in cannabis stock Cronos.Gorham says COVID-19 has certainly disrupted Altria's business, but its underlying business trends in the first quarter appear to be solid. Cigarette shipment volume was up 6%, and management reiterated its guidance that industry-wide volume will drop between 4% and 6% this year.Morningstar has a Buy rating and $54 fair value estimate for MO stock.See Also: 7 Best-Performing Stocks Of 2020: Buy, Sell Or Hold?Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ)Constellation Brands is one of the world's largest producers of wine, spirits and imported beer and owns brands such as Arbor Mist, Black Velvet and SVEDKA. Constellation also recently upped its ownership stake in leading Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE: CGC) to nearly 40%.Analyst Nicholas Johnson says Constellation's beer business should help support numbers for now, and the sell-off in the stock has pushed it to ""egregiously cheap"" levels. In fact, given his bullish long-term outlook for Constellation, Johnson says it's his top stock pick in the pure-play beverage group.Morningstar has a Buy rating and $215 price target for STZ stock.Latest Ratings for CRON  DateFirmActionFromTo  May 2020StifelMaintainsHold  Apr 2020Piper SandlerDowngradesOverweightNeutral  Apr 2020B of A SecuritiesDowngradesBuyNeutral    View More Analyst Ratings for CRON   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Here's How Much Investing 0 In The 2018 Cronos Listing Would Be Worth Today  * The Road To Recovery For Las Vegas Casino Stocks  * Cannabis Stock Rally Puts Short Sellers In The Red For 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-05-18,"COVID-19's impact has been crippling, but something positive may come from the pandemic. Billionaire Ray Dalio said in a live LinkedIn interview that in terms of the broader historical context, the recent economic downturn should be “relatively brief,"" and could spur significant societal progress. This would include a worldwide “restructuring” lasting approximately three to five years.“I know that’s a long time, but it’s not forever. The human capacity to adapt and invent and come out of this is much greater,” Dalio commented. He added, “I think we should be very excited about the new future. We’re now in a wonderful revolution in terms of the capacity to think and use that in a way. I would say that is absolutely the most treasured thing in the future.”Still making sure to account for the unknowns, Dalio has been diversifying his investments across geographic locations, asset class and currencies throughout the ongoing public health crisis.  Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration, we used TipRanks’ database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform, the analyst community believes they do, with all of the picks earning “Strong Buy” consensus ratings. Let’s jump right in.Philip Morris International (PM)Cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company Philip Morris has become known as a “sin stock."" However, regardless of its product portfolio, Dalio sees plenty of upside in store.Recently, the billionaire’s fund acquired a new position in PM, snapping up 67,447 shares. The value of this new addition? More than $4.9 million.Turning now to the analysts, the stock boasts a strong fan base, which includes Piper Sandler’s Michael Lavery. He doesn’t dispute the fact that there are some headwinds facing the company. “PM expects near-term iQOS new user acquisition to be about 50% lower than it originally planned due to social distancing measures that have shut iQOS stores and made it harder to engage with consumers,” Lavery stated.That being said, the company has already surpassed Lavery’s expectations, which were cut to near-zero. The analyst even says that if PM can maintain the pace of its customer acquisition, there could be upside to his estimates. The analyst added, “We expect HeatStick volume growth of 20% in 2020E (1Q20: +45%) and believe 90-100 billion sticks in 2021 is still achievable.”While lower duty-free volumes and down-trading in Indonesia could take a toll on second quarter EPS, Lavery remains optimistic. “We remain bullish on PM's strong long-term outlook, and we expect nicotine demand to remain resilient near-term (particularly in times of personal stress),” he explained.It should also be noted that PM has had to grapple with patent infringement claims from British American Tobacco (BAT) and a transactional currency hit. Speaking to the first issue, Lavery said, “We reviewed BAT's six patents named in its U.S. complaint, and it is difficult to handicap an outcome, but a third-party reviewer of patents generally did not give BAT's relevant ones here very high marks.”As for the latter, Lavery points out that about $100 million of the currency hit in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by the revaluation of euro or dollar denominated payables in markets like Russia, but he doesn’t foresee another event of this magnitude happening again.Based on all of the above, Lavery kept an Overweight rating on the stock. He did reduce the price target from $98 to $95, but this still implies shares could climb 40% higher in the next year. (To watch Lavery’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts are in agreement. 7 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $83.56 average price target brings the upside potential to 23%. (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Hoping to help people live healthier lives and make the healthcare system work more efficiently, UnitedHealth Group offers a wide range of healthcare products and insurance services. While the late-March acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a somewhat lackluster quarter, Dalio believes the company’s future is bright.To this end, Bridgewater went in on UNH. In a purchase valued at $5,481,000, Dalio’s hedge fund scooped up 21,977 shares.Five-star analyst Michael Wiederhorn agrees that UNH is moving on to bigger and better things, noting that its Q1 performance was relatively solid. “Overall, UNH produced strong results and seems well-positioned to navigate the COVID pandemic due to a relatively stable top-line, a diversified business mix and a dominant position across its businesses.”Wiederhorn tells investors that management thinks the slowdown in non-COVID-irelated utilization, which was driven by highly constrained elective care and will be offset by the late-year pent-up utilization, will have a significant impact on MCR in the second quarter. As a result, despite some uncertainty surrounding COVID-19's impact, UNH maintained its full year 2020 EPS guidance of $16.25-$16.55.Adding to the good news, Wiederhorn argues that its Optum segment has a strong standing within the market. Expounding on this, he noted, “Trends at Optum remained solid, and management did note that even OptumHealth should be positioned to hold up relatively well due to its reliance on risk-based contracts, accounting for two thirds of revenues. Both OptumRx and OptumInsight have strong pipelines (though the timing of meetings was disrupted) with the latter of particular interest as companies look to improve the economics and delivery of healthcare.”Even though commercial enrollment could be hampered by elevated levels of unemployment, higher Medicaid should partially offset this. Additionally, UNH is in the early stages of pricing and benefit design for 2021, with its plans possibly including pricing for COVID-19 testing and a potential vaccine.Bearing this in mind, Wiederhorn maintained an Outperform call and $343 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of 18% could be in the cards. (To watch Wiederhorn’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts also like what they’re seeing. With 12 Buys and 2 Holds, the word on the Street is that UNH is a Strong Buy. At $326.23, the average price target indicates 12% upside potential. (See UnitedHealth stock analysis on TipRanks)Accenture PLC (ACN)Dalio’s third recent addition, Accenture, provides management and technology consulting services and solutions to help its clients, which inhabit almost every industry, create lasting value. With the company relying on a new strategy, Dalio thinks it has set itself up for success.Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity, Bridgewater pulled the trigger on 27,763 shares, giving it a new position in ACN. Looking at the value of the new holding, it comes in at more than $4.5 million.When it comes to the analysts, they are also singing the company’s praises. Writing for BNP Paribas, analyst Ben Castillo-Bernaus argues that COVID-19's disruption has presented investors with an opportunity to buy a “high-quality” IT service company, with ACN trading well below historical five-year average EBIT multiples.“Accenture remains ‘best in class’ and the recent weakness is an opportunity to gain a position in this IT Services global leader delivering 40% returns on capital,” Castillo-Bernaus stated. He added, “Accenture has been a pioneer in developing ‘the New’ with 65% of revenues now coming from high growth Digital, Cloud and Security services.”As for what makes the company so successful and allows it to continuously take market share, Castillo-Bernaus points to its investments in new technologies and growth areas. To back up this conclusion, the analyst cites its EUR1 billion investment in training each year and EUR800 million investment in R&D all while delivering margin improvements every year. On top of this, ACN conducts smaller-scale M&A, with it working alongside the companies before an acquisition to limit any potential deal failures.Castillo-Bernaus also noted, “We believe Accenture has customers that spend more than $100 million annually, with 98% of Accenture’s top 100 clients having been clients for more than five years. These ‘sticky’ relationships help Accenture maintain high margins and high returns as Accenture has a high number of ‘sole source’ wins where it does not even see competition in RFPs.”That being said, the company has started using a new approach. It will now organize itself by Strategy & Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations instead of by verticals, and the results will be reported geographically for these segments. “We believe it is too early to tell what kind of impact these changes will have, but Accenture has a positive track record of occasionally tweaking its growth strategy in order to best deliver on the opportunities ahead,” Castillo-Bernaus commented.It should come as no surprise, then, that Castillo-Bernaus joined the bulls. Along with an Outperform rating, he initiated coverage by setting a $215 price target. This target conveys the analyst’s confidence in ACN's ability to surge 17% in the next twelve months.In general, other Wall Street analysts have also been impressed. ACN’s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 13 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months. However, the $195.29 average price target suggests modest upside potential of 6%.

2020-05-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After a prolonged shutdown, Ford Motor Co. officially resumed production at its North American factories this week. It hasn’t been as smooth a process as the company might have hoped: Ford had to temporarily close two critical facilities this week to allow for a deep cleaning after workers tested positive for the coronavirus. An Explorer SUV plant in Chicago was closed a second time after an employee at a nearby supplier facility tested positive for the virus, causing a parts shortage.This is the reality of manufacturing for the time being as companies fret about worker safety and the legal and reputational risks of not doing enough to protect employees. Unlike Ford, whose products fall into a category of consumer spending that’s become even more discretionary amid the pandemic, wide swaths of the industrial sector were deemed essential and allowed to remain operational. Those companies, too, have had their share of growing pains as they adjust to a new way of working.Boeing Co. temporarily closed its factories in the Puget Sound area in March after a worker died of the coronavirus and later briefly shuttered work at its 787 plant in South Carolina. CBS Minnesota reported earlier this month that a Honeywell International Inc. facility in Minneapolis had closed after a worker tested positive. Whirlpool Corp. closed its Amana, Iowa, refrigerator plant at least twice after employees tested positive for the virus, according to the Gazette local paper. Deere & Co. and Altria Group Inc.’s Philip Morris USA are among the many others that have had to close plants on a limited basis to avoid outbreaks among workers. Lockheed Martin Corp., meanwhile, said this week it will temporarily slow production of the F-35 fighter jet because of delays at suppliers.  It’s a lot harder, though, to bring factories back to life than it is to just figure it out as you go along. Ford may be a manufacturer, but because it’s one of the few to have experienced an extended lockdown, it’s arguably a better benchmark for the non-industrial economy. You better believe that office-based companies that have sent most of their workers home are keeping a close eye on how the likes of Ford fare in flipping the switch back on. Seeing the automaker’s setbacks this week, companies that can operate without their employees clustered in the same place may be less keen to rush back. They’re getting a more continuous stream of work out of their employees now than they would if they had to hit the pause button and clear out the office every few weeks. And the mixed messages from the White House aren't helpful: President Donald Trump is due to visit a Ford factory in Michigan that’s been converted to ventilator production and has been wishy-washy on whether he will adhere to the company’s face-mask requirements. Already, American Express Co. CEO Steve Squeri and Visa Inc. CEO Al Kelly said this week that most of their employees would work from home for the rest of the year. Some 28% of employers recently surveyed by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said they would make work-from-home arrangements permanent for at least some employees. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and social media site Twitter Inc. are among those who have publicly said remote working will be their indefinite default option. Facebook Inc. said Thursday it would follow suit and move to a more permanent remote workforce.At the end of the day, manufacturing or non-manufacturing, it's all interconnected. How permanent this shift to work from home will be is debatable, but if companies end up needing less office space, by default that means fewer HVAC systems, commercial lighting, fire and security products or even 3M Co.’s Post-it notes. And if workers aren’t going to be commuting, do they still need to buy cars from Ford? There's a lot riding on getting reopening right.     This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-06-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- So, perhaps reassuringly, it turned out tobacco wasn’t so defensive during this global health crisis after all.After indications early in the pandemic that tobacco may hold up, British American Tobacco Plc on Tuesday reduced its forecasts for full-year sales growth as Covid-19 lockdowns hurt business in emerging markets. The maker of Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes depends on developing nations for one-quarter of its revenue.South Africa has banned sales of tobacco products as part of a strict lockdown policy that BAT and other companies are fighting. Cigarette consumption has been disrupted by curfews in some markets, such as Bangladesh. In addition, smoking in markets such as Vietnam often takes place in bars and restaurants. With establishments closed, or consumers reluctant to venture out, there was less temptation to light up.This slowdown provides good reason for pause for investors in BAT, led by the relatively new Chief Executive Officer Jack Bowles. With higher smoking rates, and the potential for consumers to trade up to more expensive brands as average incomes grow, these regions are supposed to offset the deterioration in developed markets as people there quit smoking. But now, because of the coronavirus hit, BAT expects a 7% decline in global industry sales volumes of cigarettes and heated-tobacco devices this year, more than the previously anticipated 5% fall.This scenario has implications for competitors such as Philip Morris International Inc. and Japan Tobacco Inc., which produces Winston and Benson & Hedges cigarettes. Japan Tobacco has been using its strong balance sheet to buy emerging-market brands over the past few years.As the contagion spread and shined a spotlight on potential risks related to smoking, lockdowns meant BAT had to delay launches of new devices that heat rather than burn tobacco and electronic cigarettes, because the stores where they’re sold were shut. The U.S. market, the world’s biggest for electronic cigarettes, was already struggling to recover after a spate of illnesses and deaths last year related to vaping.Consequently, BAT expects to reach its target of annual sales of 5 billion pounds ($6.4 billion) from tobacco alternatives a year later than planned, in 2025. The dislocation across cigarettes and newer products will lead to lower underlying earnings growth this year than previously forecast, as well as a slower reduction in debt.However, it’s still too early to throw out the thesis that people will reach for cigarettes no matter what’s happening. In developed markets, consumption is holding up. In the U.S., for example, industry volumes could now fall by only about 4% this year, compared with the 5% previously anticipated, amid signs pointing to BAT gaining market share and few consumers are switching to cheaper brands.Vaping as a category is still reeling, but BAT is making headway with its Vuse and Vype brands. And it continues to invest in its tobacco heating device Glo, as well as in oral tobacco Velo. The strategy of having a balanced portfolio of new-generation products is wise. It’s not yet clear which of these categories will be the winner as traditional cigarette sales decline.True, BAT had to lower its outlook and there is a risk that smokers will seek out cheaper brands in a recession, but at least the company is updating investors regularly. It also remains committed to its policy of paying out 65% of underlying earnings per share. Rival Imperial Brands Plc cut its dividend last month.BAT has not been immune from the pandemic, but the company is positioning itself well for the future. And who knows, its biotech subsidiary might even come up with a Covid-19 vaccine.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-07-08,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now authorized the marketing of Philip Morris International’s (PM) “IQOS Tobacco Heating System” as modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs). Shares in PM rose 3.3% in Tuesday’s trading.This marks the second set of products ever to be authorized as MRTPs and the first tobacco products to receive “exposure modification” orders- which permits the marketing of a product as containing a reduced level of or exposure to a substance or as being free of a substance when the issuance of the order is expected to benefit the health of the population.PM will still need to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies to determine whether the MRTP orders continues to be appropriate, including assessing the potential for increased use among youth.“Through the modified risk tobacco product application process, the FDA aims to ensure that information directed at consumers about reduced risk or reduced exposure from using a tobacco product is supported by scientific evidence and understandable,” said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.“Data submitted by the company shows that marketing these particular products with the authorized information could help addicted adult smokers transition away from combusted cigarettes and reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals, but only if they completely switch.”The IQOS Tobacco Heating System includes the electronic IQOS device that generates a nicotine-containing aerosol by heating tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper, specifically Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks.The FDA previously authorized the marketing of these products without modified risk information in April 2019.Shares in PM are currently trading down 14% year-to-date, and analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock’s outlook. This is with a $79 average analyst price target (8% upside potential). (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks).“We view today’s ruling as an important step forward on the risk continuum that could give IQOS some advantage in aiding consumers to fully switch to IQOS from cigarettes or vapor products. Remember that today’s order will also benefit Altria (MO), which will be selling IQOS in the US.

2020-07-14,"Medicago said on Tuesday it has begun testing its plant-based coronavirus vaccine in an early-stage clinical trial as the Canadian company, backed by tobacco company Phillip Morris, races against larger drugmakers to develop a treatment option to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.  Medicago said it dosed the first healthy volunteers on Monday in a 180-person study, making it the first vaccine from Canada among the more than 20 experimental coronavirus vaccines being tested in humans.  Experts have cautioned that more than one vaccine may be necessary to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugmakers such as AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc ahead in the race and gearing up to test their vaccine candidates in large trials.",Canada's Medicago begins human trials of plant-based COVID-19 vaccine
2020-07-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Medicago Inc. has been using plants to develop potential vaccines for more than two decades. A new partnership with GlaxoSmithKline Plc. putting its unproven technology to the test against the novel coronavirus is pushing the Canadian biotech into the limelight.The Quebec City-based company dosed the first humans with its experimental Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, making it one of 23 candidates that have reached phase 1 clinical trials in the race to curb the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.Medicago, which is backed by large investors like Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and Philip Morris International Inc., last week clinched a deal with Glaxo to pair the vaccine with the U.K. giant’s adjuvants -- boosters that can help any brand of shot.“It’s a bit of a coup for a company like ours, because I had to convince them about the robustness of our technology,” Chief Executive Officer Bruce Clark said of the plant platform, which has yet to produce an approved vaccine. “It’s a real watershed moment for us as the new kid in town.”Read More: Glaxo Teams With Philip Morris-Backed Biotech on Covid VaccineMedicago relies on an Australian plant that’s a close relative to tobacco, known as nicotiana benthamiana, to develop vaccines. The plant has a weakened immune system that allows it to easily host genetic material and develop particles that mimic a virus. As Clark put it in an interview, the plants serve as “bioreactors” that can harvest clinical-grade material in a matter of weeks.The Canadian trial of Medicago’s Covid-19 candidate will involve 180 healthy patients aged 18 to 55, and will test various doses of the vaccine alone and coupled with two different adjuvants: one from Glaxo, and another from Dynavax Technologies Corp.Pre-clinical results of its vaccine candidate both with and without a booster demonstrated a high level of neutralizing antibodies following a single dose, according to the company. Should the early-stage study prove successful, Medicago aims to enter later-stage trials in October, and manufacture 100 million doses by the end of 2021.Medicago, like many companies behind the 160 coronavirus vaccines currently in development, is seeking to earn investors’ trust by validating their new platforms amid the pandemic.It’s “at once exciting, and extremely frustrating” to be a small vaccine player vying to be taken seriously, Clark said. “If we’re going to show the world how this works, we have to take Covid on. The skepticism for new technology is there. The plant skepticism is there.”Budding TechnologyMedicago launched in 1999 out of a partnership between Canada’s agriculture department and Laval University. After focusing on the tobacco-adjacent plant, Medicago went public in 2006. In 2009 it began using the technology to develop a shot to counter the H1N1 pandemic. In 2013, Medicago was taken private by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and Philip Morris.Clark, who has spent his career at a range of large pharmaceutical companies including Glaxo and Sanofi, was a vice president at Philip Morris when that acquisition occurred. He’s helped the company usher a seasonal flu vaccine through late-stage clinical trials. That program is currently under review by Canadian health authorities.Medicago is not alone in pursuing a plant-based approach to the novel coronavirus. Cigarette maker British American Tobacco Plc has been working on a similar vaccine through its biotech subsidiary Kentucky BioProcessing.Medicago sees itself as confronting a similar challenge as high-profile vaccine makers like Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi, which are relying on so-called messenger RNA technology to prompt the body to make a key protein from the virus, sparking an immune response. The mRNA technology also has yet to generate a vaccine approved by regulators in the U.S. or beyond.“We really think we’ll need more than one type of vaccine,” said Nathalie Landry, Medicago executive vice president of scientific and medical affairs, noting that various populations could respond differently to certain technologies.So, Clark said, “the data has to speak for itself.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Covid Shot Derived From Tobacco-Like Plant Tested in Humans

2020-07-21,"Shares of Philip Morris Intl Inc. (NYSE: PM) increased by 3.16% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Philip Morris Intl has.Philip Morris Intl's Debt According to the Philip Morris Intl's most recent balance sheet as reported on April 28, 2020, total debt is at $28.37 billion, with $25.00 billion in long-term debt and $3.37 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $3.75 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $24.62 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Philip Morris Intl has $37.49 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.76. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Price Over Earnings Overview: IBM  * A Look Into Texas Instruments' Debt  * P/E Ratio Insights for Coca-Cola(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-19,"On Wednesday, shares of Philip Morris Intl (NYSE: PM) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $79.48.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-18  * Strike Price: $82.50  * Volume: 1122  * Open Interest: 16563 Signs of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * A Look Into Philip Morris's Debt(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At 6 a.m. on Aug. 3, Google bought a 6.6% stake in ADT Inc., the largest U.S. home security company, for $450 million. ADT appreciated 100% as soon as the stock market opened. But the headlines detailing the transaction weren't a total surprise because more than a few people knew ADT was poised to benefit from an event big enough to be gaining Google's hitherto inaccessible technology.Three days earlier, when ADT wasn't reporting much of anything, a series of computerized trading alerts derived from the algorithms of Bloomberg Automated Intelligence (BAI) revealed insiders' unmistakable handiwork: &#92;-- On July 29, the frequency of people searching for articles about ADT and reading them exceeded the most recent 30-day average. &#92;-- The same day, ADT rose 6.3% via trades 90% more numerous than the 20-day average and when its weekly gain until that point was 4.1%. ADT competitors closed with an average decline of 2.6%. -- On July 30, ADT bonds changed hands four times more than the five-week average. -- The following day, ADT volume jumped to more than five times the 20-day average.All of this activity means investors, who were informed enough to buy ADT at $7.91 a share before the BAI alerts, could sell the stock at $17.21 on the news of the Google stake in ADT. The return was 118%, or the equivalent of turning $1 million into $2.8 million in four days. Trading was significant: The three-day average value of the shares ($8.55) prior to the deal's disclosure was 8.2% greater than the 30-day average price prior to July 29, indicating investors' behavior changed in the 72 hours of trading before the news, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.There's no end to the parade of corporate transactions preceded by trading underlying their selective disclosure.

2020-09-09,"Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock has been on a terrifying roller coaster since its 2018 debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Since rocketing to a peak enterprise value of $15.7 billion, ACB has since wiped out 93% of shareholder money as profits have failed to materialize.Source: Shutterstock On Tuesday, investors received another dose of bad news when ACB announced a massive $1.4 billion write-down of old acquisitions. Shares slid 12% on the news. Yet, ACB stock remains the 11th most popular holding on Robinhood, a popular trading app, as speculators cheer Aurora's news of its new CEO.But investors shouldn't hold out hope.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's certainly not a sound investment strategy, no matter how much you love pot. That's because, as soon as the U.S. government federally legalizes marijuana, Aurora's grower-centric business model will make it a slow-moving target for nimbler firms.Here's why Aurora Cannabis stock is on a slow death march to zero. ACB Stock: Great Industry, Bad Business ModelEvery several years, a new industry emerges that promises 1,000%-plus returns. Legalized marijuana is one of them.And these are precisely the industries I love.  * 10 Buyout Stocks With Long-Term Potential In many cases, like e-commerce and cloud computing, these industries DO deliver. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has returned 200,000% to investors since its 1997 IPO.But a great industry doesn't guarantee investment success. In 1999, a survey by UPenn counted no fewer than 1,100 major e-commerce companies. By 2004, that number had collapsed to just 31. You would have needed extreme luck or skill to scoop up winners from that pile of wreckage.But while it's often hard to pick the big winners, it's usually easy to see the obvious losers.Here's one example. In 1999, Medicineonline.com launched its website Bidforsurgery.com, bringing an eBay-like bidding system for surgical procedures. Patients would submit anonymous requests for surgeries, and the cheapest doctor would get the contract. Sounds like a questionable investment?And skeptical investors would have been right to stay away. Bidforsurgery.com closed not long after realizing no doctor would risk losing their medical licenses over rock-bottom pricing.Today, Aurora Cannabis also finds itself on the same losing side of history. Its decision to focus on cultivating marijuana might have seemed like the obvious path into the pot industry. But its overemphasis on production over marketing has left it with a broken business model that will doom the company.As ACB looks towards bankruptcy in the next 18-24 months, here's what happened. Aurora Meets the Lousy Farming BusinessAs attractive as marijuana growing sounds, it's still an agriculture business.And most farms have one thing in common: relatively uninspiring returns.Why? Farming has high capital requirements and few barriers to entry. An American soybean farmer doesn't just compete with his or her next-door neighbors. He's competing against Brazilian and Chinese farmers as well. And in this highly commoditized business, return on assets from income rarely breaks 2.5% in any given year.That's why all major tobacco companies like Phillip Morris (NYSE:PM) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) don't bother growing their own tobacco. Instead, they're happy to buy tobacco on contract at just $2.98 per kilogram. Each cigarette, after all, holds only 1 gram of tobacco.So where does big tobacco's real riches come from? Sales, distribution and marketing (and taxes, in the government's case). The average pack of cigarettes costs $5.51, with customers in many states happily (or sullenly) paying closer to $10.The tobacco industry's focus on marketing has paid off; profits at cigarette companies are staggering. Phillip Morris, Marlboros's maker, generates a 160% return on invested capital (ROIC). That's roughly as high as Apple's profit margins. Did ACB Follow Big Tobacco's Lead?Unfortunately, no.Instead, Aurora decided to jump into farming. At its peak in 2019, Aurora operated 18 different growing facilities across four countries. And its income statement has all the signs of a bad agricultural firm.In Q3, the company produced 36.2 tons of cannabis but sold just 12.7 tons. (Keep in mind, stored marijuana lasts only 6-12 months). Even if the company managed to sell 100% of its production at current prices, gross profit of $82.2 million would have fallen short of its $110 million overhead costs.The company has since &quot;retired&quot; that CEO, Terry Booth, amidst &quot;sweeping changes.&quot; And on Tuesday, the company announced Altria veteran Miguel Martin would take over the CEO role. But it might be too late for the cash-strapped firm. Aurora's Costs Still Far Too HighIn a paper by the RAND Drug Policy Research Center, a centrist think tank, Jonathan Caulkins made some marijuana cost estimates. If legalized, he concluded, the cost to produce one pound of commercial-grade marijuana would fall from $225/pound to just $2.50/pound. That's because, as a crop, there's little difference in planting lettuce, asparagus, or sinsemilla (a marijuana variety with high psychoactive content)And what if prices follow those of industrial hemp? Production costs could plummet to under $1/pound.These prices would spell disaster for Aurora Cannabis.According to its most recent filings, the ACB spends 2.90 CAD to produce just 1 gram of marijuana, or $1,315/pound. Adding overhead costs makes a total of almost 6 CAD per gram (or $16 per eighth of weed). Even in the illicit U.S. market, those are incredibly high prices for the wholesale market.Why are costs so high? Firstly, that's because Aurora focuses on higher-grade marijuana strains, something its recreational users don't seem to care for. Secondly, the company produces in Canada, where they're forced to use expensive indoor facilities. Indoor growing costs run about ten times higher than outdoor ones.This spells huge trouble for Aurora. Once (or if) pot legalization happens in the U.S., investors can be sure that cheap imports will quickly replace Aurora's high-cost production. ACB on the Brink of BankruptcyAurora might yet figure out a marketing plan. But investors won't have much time to wait.In March, the company reported $230 million on its balance sheet. Though the interim CEO has quickly shuttered a dozen plants and laid off 25-30% of its staff, the cuts might not hit deep enough.That's because the company also has 128.6 million CAD in current liabilities, which includes leases due this year. Even with planned cutbacks, the company's burn rate could still top 250 million CAD every year.In years past, Aurora plugged its cash flow gap by issuing new shares. Today, the company won't be as lucky. With an 86% decline in share value in the past twelve months, the company will cut far deeper in diluting current shareholders. What's ACB Stock Worth?Marijuana stock investors have long hoped that the U.S. House and Senate would eventually pass federal pot legalization rules.

2020-09-10,"Philip Morris International announced that it is raising its regular quarterly dividend by 2.6% to an annualized rate of $4.80 per share.Shares closed 1.8% higher at $80.47 on Wednesday after Philip Morris (PM) said that its board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to $1.20 per share, up from $1.17 per share. The dividend is payable on October 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of September 24, 2020. The ex-dividend date is September 23, 2020.Tobacco giants including Philip Morris have been under pressure as health awareness, a stricter regulatory environment and the emergence of alternatives like e-cigarettes over recent months have led to a decline in cigarette volumes. Yet, some investors prefer these companies for their high dividend yields. Philip Morris has increased its annual dividend every year since becoming a public company in 2008, representing a total increase of 160.9%, or a compound annual growth rate of 8.3%.Furthermore, the company has been focusing on capturing the demand for heated tobacco products and its IQOS tobacco heating device to offset a decline in cigarette shipments.Shares in PM are currently trading down 5.5% year-to-date after recouping a chunk of this year’s earlier losses, and analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock’s outlook. This is with a $88.43 average analyst price target (9.9% upside potential).Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett last month raised the stock’s price target to $73 from $70 due to FX gains but maintained a Hold rating noting that an expected volume miss and multiple headwinds in 2021 could be overlooked by investors. (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks).&quot;The bigger risk for us on PM (vs. cigs), and the reason we remain cautious near term, is possible heated slowdown,” Bennett wrote in a note to investors. “While we increase our estimates for the current year, we do think the pace of growth could slow into FY21.”Bennett expects heated volumes for FY21 at 86 billion vs the target of 90-100 billion.“Likely a bigger risk over volumes is to sales, and the threat of heated taxes. We think as we enter a recession, increased taxes are likely.

2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Companies ranging from industrial majors to consumer heavyweights boosted their full-year guidance Tuesday, pointing to earnings strength despite the pandemic -- and in some cases, because of it.At least seven companies raised their forecasts before market opened, including aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp., consumer-products company Procter & Gamble Co., Philip Morris International Inc. and Prologis Inc. Although only 67 companies in the S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter earnings, so far the trend is positive, with more than 80% beating estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The results helped lift U.S. stocks, which also got a boost from hope for a stimulus deal before the Nov. 3 election. The S&P 500 has recovered all the losses triggered by the pandemic, though it’s pulled back from last month’s record close amid concern about rising coronavirus case numbers and further economic fallout.Among the companies that reported Tuesday morning, Procter & Gamble Co. rallied the most in six weeks, while Lockheed Martin and Philip Morris slipped.F-35 jet maker Lockheed Martin Corp. boosted its full-year earnings per share and sales guidance even as the U.S. government, its biggest customer, runs a record deficit due to pandemic-related spending.Procter & Gamble was the most obvious beneficiary of people spending more time at home. The consumer giant reported its best organic sales growth since 2005. The maker of Charmin toilet paper and Tide detergent also raised its revenue growth outlook to a range of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year that ends in June 2021.“This isn’t a flash in the pan,” Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told Bloomberg. “I don’t see any reason that we shouldn’t be able to sustain strong results.”Philip Morris also boosted its full-year earnings guidance for the second time in recent months despite a nearly 10% drop in cigarette volumes in the third quarter. Its IQOS tobacco-heating device saw a 19% surge in sales in the quarter, indicating growing consumer appetite for cigarette substitutes.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:The early part of 3Q earnings season looks a whole lot like 2Q with extremely high and widespread beats, confirmed by stronger-than-expected revenue growth as S&P 500 companies shake off the pandemic-fueled recession. The second straight quarter of record beats doesn’t seem to have inspired much confidence, though, as price reactions have been negative and forecasts remain stagnant.Though only about a 10th of S&P 500 companies have reported so far, 84% have exceeded EPS estimates, the highest rate in 30 years of BI data, Martin Adams said. Almost all sectors are showing positive estimate momentum for 3Q earnings, suggesting analysts were likely caught off guard by the recovery in the period.\-- Gina Martin Adams, Chief Equities StrategistKey Developments:U.S. futures trimmed gains after reports that federal prosecutors will file an antitrust lawsuit against Google.Traders are backing away from bets on chaos after the Nov. 3 elections.The U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.’s Google, accusing it of abusing its monopoly in search.Analysts expect Netflix Inc. to report 3.32 million new subscribers in the third quarter after markets close Tuesday.Here’s today’s top earnings news by sector:ConsumerProcter & Gamble raised its outlook after posting its best organic sales growth since 2005 amid a boom in at-home consumption of toilet paper and cleaning supplies. The maker of Tide detergent and Dawn dish soap now sees organic revenue growing 4% to 5% in fiscal 2021, an increase from the previous outlook of 2% to 4%. Shares rose as much 2.7%.Albertsons rose as much as 7.4%, the most on record, after virus-wary Americans cooking at home led to another jump in sales growth. Identical-store sales, a key gauge of a retailer’s health, climbed 13.8% for the three months ended Sept. 12.

2020-10-20,Philip Morris third-quarter profit beat Wall Street's estimates. Revenue fell but still beat expectations.,Philip Morris Climbs After 3rd-Quarter Earnings Beat Estimates
2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Although one in four of all adult Indians use tobacco, the country’s addiction runs far deeper. The government, too, has a toxic dependence. It’s called ITC Ltd. Formerly known as Imperial Tobacco of India, later renamed India Tobacco Company, and finally truncated to just ITC, the 110-year-old conglomerate is 29.4% owned by British American Tobacco Plc. About 28.5% is controlled by various Indian state-run insurance companies and a government-controlled bad bank.And therein lies the problem. The large quasi-state ownership is acting as a value trap. It’s preventing the $25 billion enterprise from being carved up into a pure cigarette company, owned by BAT, and a supply-chain platform like China’s Pinduoduo Inc., which is nearly four times bigger in enterprise value. It's a missed opportunity, not just for ITC’s minority shareholders, but for India. Now that the country is giving farmers the freedom to sell their produce outside state-designated market yards, a corporate buyer like ITC that has distribution capabilities in the smallest of Indian towns (thanks to cigarettes) has a shot at building a meaningful digital, agri-business franchise. One that’s able to obtain better prices for producers. As for the core tobacco business, London-based BAT has tried in the past to raise its stake and take over the cigarette maker, but local managers have seen it off using Indian financial institutions’ voting power. However, many investors are now wondering if empire-building by ITC’s management, in the garb of protecting national interests, has gone too far.A cash-strapped New Delhi, which is delaying fiscal support to an economy expected to lose a 10th of its real output this year to Covid-19, also needs to rethink its stance: What additional harm will befall if BAT wins ITC’s successful cigarette division, paying a hefty control premium to acquire smokers, a vanishing breed in developed markets? In return, India can wrest a time-bound commitment from the new owner to steer the revenue toward, say, 25% reduced-risk products like the Swedish snus and heat-not-burn devices. That will mean a fall in future healthcare costs from lower tar consumption. ITC scored 0.62 in Foundation for a Smoke-Free World’s 2020 Tobacco Transformation Index, better than China National Tobacco Corp., but way behind BAT, Philip Morris International Inc. and Swedish Match AB. “Companies that offer reduced-risk products are mostly focusing their efforts on selected high/medium income countries, where overall smoking rates are lower and cigarette sales are already declining,” says the new study. India can negotiate a better outcome with BAT.Let the $3.3 billion cash pile plus the non-tobacco parts — hotels, information technology, finance, fashion, potato crisps, paper, safety matches and what not — get sequestered under a separate holding company. The Indian managers get to keep what they can turn into a digital, agri-business-led supply chain, and sell the rest. This way, the government will extract much-needed budgetary resources. The value trapped in the conglomerate will get released.The deadlock between two equally poised large shareholders is hurting minority owners. The stalemate has gone on for too long. A quarter-century ago, the fight was over whether ITC should be setting up power plants. The state-led economy had just started liberalizing and there was an acute shortage of electricity. The Indian cigarette maker was sitting on a cash hoard. Had BAT wrested control, it wouldn’t have allowed the funds to be put into unrelated businesses. But BAT’s tenuous hold weakened after a currency-control violation saw a change in leadership at the Kolkata-based firm.Yogesh “Yogi” Deveshwar, the new chairman in 1996, took the government’s help to defeat BAT’s plan for a separate unit to sell international brands like 555 State Express and Benson & Hedges cigarettes in India. Since then, the local business has increasingly charted its own course. Now, BAT can’t even try to mount a bid for all of ITC because tobacco has been made off-limits for foreign direct investment since 2010. That, too, was done to keep ITC in Indian hands.To what end, though? As much as 84% of ITC’s $2.8 billion pretax profit last year came from cigarettes, but four-fifths of the $325 million-plus capital expenditure was in snacks, hotels and paper. The dividend payout ratio did jump last year to 81%, yet the previous 18 years’ average is just 50%, almost 20 percentage points lower than BAT’s distribution.The U.K. associate, which has just one representative on the Indian firm’s board, has returned $2.1 billion to its own shareholders via buybacks over the past six years. No such luck for ITC investors. They can’t be offered a buyback, lest it increases BAT’s shareholding. Widows and pensioners get a 6% dividend yield, 5 percentage point more than on the benchmark Nifty 50 index. It’s a bit like collecting pennies in front of a value-crunching steam roller. In the past 10 years, ITC shares have lost 11% of their dollar value, while an investment in Nestle India Ltd. has tripled. The opportunity ahead is clear. Agri-business offers the chance “for building a digital platform linking retailers with consumers, something that Chinese companies like Pinduoduo have done successfully,"" said Gaurav Patankar, head of emerging market equity strategy at Bloomberg Intelligence. As Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, and the 152-year-old Tata Group mimic platforms from the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., ITC can plug another gap, provided New Delhi gives up its addiction.Tobacco is toxic.

2020-10-21,"Shares of Philip Morris plunged 5.8% on Tuesday after its 4Q earnings guidance fell short of analysts’ expectations. The cigarette maker expects to report EPS of $1.16 ($1.20 excluding currency headwinds) in 4Q, while the Street consensus is pegged at $1.25. The lower-than-expected guidance reflects a shift in planned costs to 4Q.Philip Morris (PM) also registered a year-over-year decline in its 3Q top and bottom-line results. The company’s adjusted EPS dipped 0.7% to $1.42 year-on-year, while revenues decreased by 2.6% to $7.45 billion. Quarterly results were negatively impacted by a 7.6% decline in total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment, which more than offsets the benefit of favourable pricing variance and lower manufacturing costs.Nonetheless, Philip Morris’ 3Q revenues and earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates of $7.28 billion and $1.36 per share, respectively. (See PM stock analysis on TipRanks).The company raised its full-year earnings outlook. It now projects adjusted EPS at constant currency basis between $5.37 and $5.42, up from the earlier guidance range of $5.23-$5.38. Moreover, the company forecasts total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volumes to fall 8%-9% in 2020, compared to its previous anticipation of a 8%-10% decline.Ahead of the 3Q results, Citigroup analyst Adam Spielman upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $100 (36.4% upside potential) from $82. In a note to investors on October 7, Spielman said that Philip Morris is expected to achieve 175 billion sticks of reduced risk products by 2024. The analyst is also optimistic that the company could announce a new multi-year target of achieving 150-200 billion sticks by 2024, which will be way up from the current three-year goal of 90-100 billion sticks by 2021.Currently, the Street is bullish on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 8 Buys versus 1 Hold. The average price target of $93.56 implies upside potential of about 27.6% to current levels.

2020-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Ferrari NV has started to search for a new chief executive officer to resolve its second leadership crisis in as many years after Louis Camilleri abruptly resigned, complicating the Italian supercar maker’s transition toward electric mobility.Ferrari has scheduled a board meeting next week to discuss the replacement process, according to people familiar with the matter. Chairman John Elkann will for now take the role on an interim basis. He has to find a new leader just 30 months after picking Camilleri to succeed Sergio Marchionne, who died in July 2018 from complications after a surgery.Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer Enrico Galliera is among the potential internal candidates after leading Ferrari’s sales efforts for the past decade, the people said, declining to be named because the deliberations are private. A spokesman for Ferrari declined to comment.Camilleri, 65, is leaving after he had to be hospitalized for Covid-19. He’s recovering at home and the infection wasn’t the main reason for his exit, a company spokesman said, without elaborating. Camilleri also stepped down as chairman of Philip Morris International Inc.His departure comes at a difficult time for the former unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. The coronavirus pandemic has depressed auto sales just as the industry is shifting away from the internal combustion engine -- a key feature of the high-powered Ferrari cars.Ferrari declined 0.7% at 12:11 p.m. in Milan, valuing the company at about 34 billion euros ($41 billion). The stock has gained about a fifth this year, for the best performance in the Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts Index.Whoever becomes new CEO will have “big shoes to fill,” Angus Tweedie, an analyst at Citigroup, said in a note. He pointed to questions about whether the company can achieve its 2022 profitability targets, roll out new models including the PuroSangue SUV and shift the supercar maker toward an emissions-free fleet.Camilleri was a Ferrari board member when he took over as CEO from Marchionne, who died within days of being replaced. Marchionne orchestrated Ferrari’s 2016 spin-off from Fiat Chrysler, where he also served as CEO.Ferrari has managed the pandemic better than expected, fielding orders for its six- and seven-figure supercars at rates similar to last year, the company said in November.Ferrari TransformationDuring his stint as CEO, Camilleri oversaw the transformation of Ferrari into a fully fledged luxury brand. He revamped Ferrari’s lineup so it could keep boosting prices. The company introduced five new models in 2019, which helped increase annual sales to more than 10,000 units for the first time.“Louis showed an unswerving sense of responsibility ensuring continuity for our organization, while guiding Ferrari into the future with an ambitious and far-sighted strategic plan,” Elkann said in a letter to workers.Exor NV, the investment company for the Agnelli family, controls Ferrari with 36% of its voting rights and a direct 23% stake. The supercar maker was listed in New York in 2015.Elkann, the scion of the Agnelli family, is set to become chairman of Stellantis, the company which will start its operations next year following the combination of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV with Peugeot-maker PSA Group.One looming question for Camilleri’s successor is how Ferrari will cope with more stringent emissions regulations in the European Union and other markets. While the company has said that 60% of its models will have a hybrid powertrain by 2022, Camilleri has expressed doubts the brand would go fully electric.Emissions PressureHe recently criticized European environmental regulations that aim to cut transport emissions by penalizing the sale of vehicles with particularly inefficient engines, saying they fail to take into account how infrequently some are driven.“If you take a V-12 Ferrari that only runs 3,000 kilometers a year, probably it has less emissions than a very small car that runs every day,” he said during an investor call last month.At Philip Morris, his exit triggered an orderly succession plan that’s been in place for some time, the company said. The tobacco company’s CEO Andre Calantzopoulos will become executive chairman right before the annual shareholders meeting in May, it said.Lucio Noto, the company’s independent presiding director, will serve as interim chair in the meantime. Chief Operating Officer Jacek Olczak will succeed Calantzopoulos as CEO when he takes the chairman spot.The tobacco giant has long been a sponsor of Ferrari’s Formula One racing teams, but Camilleri had no direct automotive experience, which made him a somewhat controversial pick to run one of the world’s pre-eminent car brands.(Updates with information on replacement process in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Ferrari Faces New Leadership Crisis After CEO Abruptly Resigns

On top of that, the industry enjoys multiple advantages that make it attractive for investment. The best names in tobacco have the ability to raise prices over time, while demand for tobacco products remains steady during economic downturns. The industry also benefits from high returns on invested capital as well as high barriers to entry.
As a result, tobacco stocks are ripe for the picking — particularly for income investors looking for high dividend yields and stable payouts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Dividend Yield: 8.01%
MO stock is probably one of the most notable tobacco stocks in the United States, with its flagship Marlboro brand commanding 40% retail market share. On top of that, Altria also owns the popular chewing tobacco brands Skoal and Copenhagen, Ste. Michelle wine and an approximate 10% investment stake in global beer giant Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD).
Altria is a legendary dividend stock. The company has raised its dividend for 50 years in a row, placing it on the exclusive list of 30 Dividend Kings. In part, it owes success to its durable competitive advantages, generating extremely high returns on capital while reaping significant economies of scale in production and distribution.
And because it possesses the top brand, Altria can raise prices over time to grow revenue. MO has even continued to perform well in 2020 despite the pandemic. In the most recent quarter, revenue of $5.67 billion increased 4.9% year-over-year (YOY) and beat analyst estimates. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came to $1.19, beating projections by 4 cents.
Finally, in response to the declining smoking rate, it has also made investments in new categories, highlighted by the $13 billion purchase of a 35% stake in e-vapor company Juul. This gave Altria exposure to a high-growth category. On top of that, it also recently announced a $1.8 billion investment in Canadian cannabis company Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON). That made for a 45% equity stake in CRON, as well as a warrant to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest. Lastly, Altria has put extensive research and development into its own heat-not-burn tobacco product IQOS.
The combination of vaping, marijuana and new tobacco products will fuel Altria’s future growth, even if traditional cigarettes continue to decline. Its investment in Anheuser-Bush as well as in wine and smokeless tobacco businesses will also continue to provide growth, securing its hefty dividend.

Philip Morris International (PM)

Dividend Yield: 5.65%
Next on my list of tobacco stocks is Philip Morris International, a company that spun off from Altria over a decade ago. Today, PM sells the Marlboro brand and many others outside of the United States. While Altria dominates the States, PM has the rights in international markets.
While 2020 has negatively impacted PM stock, it has performed relatively well considering the difficult operating climate. Net revenue declined 1.5% in Q3 2020, as many international markets have experienced an economic downturn due to the pandemic. However, the company’s ability to raise prices drove 6.5% revenue growth per unit and 5.6% adjusted diluted EPS growth. Over the first three quarters combined, adjusted diluted EPS rose 7.4%.
So, Philip Morris’ consistent profitability and steady earnings growth has allowed the company to maintain its dividend. PM even delivered a 2.6% dividend increase in September.
Like Altria, the company has also waged its future on new products. But whereas MO has meaningfully expanded into adjacent vice categories such as beer, wine and marijuana, PM is staking its future on IQOS. The company greatly increased its capital expenses in the last two years in order to develop and manufacture this new product. IQOS has met great success in some markets, like Japan and Korea.

The revenue generated by PM’s reduced-risk portfolio has gone from essentially zero in 2014 to nearly $5 billion annually (Page 13). Over the first nine months of 2020, PM’s reduced-risk products (RRPs) accounted for 23% of its total revenue in that period. Continued growth from RRPs will allow the company to keep increasing its dividend.

Universal Corporation (UVV)

Dividend Yield: 6.20%
Universal Corporation is one of the world’s largest leaf tobacco exporters and importers. The company is a wholesale purchaser and processor of tobacco operating between farms and the companies that manufacture cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco.
Like Altria, Universal is a Dividend King, as it has also raised its dividend payout for 50 consecutive years. Because of its leadership position in processing, UVV has also maintained a long track record of steady profitability in the face of declining smoking rates. In addition, price increases have offset reduced demand, helping the company stay profitable. Last year it reported adjusted EPS of $3.49 Maintaining that consistent profitability has allowed the company to return excess profits to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Going forward, Universal intends to continue diversifying its business model. In response to the falling smoking rate, it has branched out into processing other produce like fruits and vegetables. In fact, the firm has conducted multiple acquisitions in this area to accelerate efforts.
For example, last year UVV acquired FruitSmart, a specialty fruit and vegetable ingredient processor. FruitSmart supplies juices, concentrates, blends, purees, fibers and more to food, beverage and flavor companies around the world. On Oct. 1, Universal also completed its acquisition of Silva International, a dehydrated vegetable, fruit and herb processing company.
These efforts should help UVV stock adapt to the difficult situation facing the tobacco industry as well as allow it to maintain the Dividend King title. That makes this name a top contender among tobacco stocks for the income investor.

2021-01-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Artificial intelligence, quantum computers and autonomous vehicles are among the fastest-growing areas of technology, with American companies often in the lead, according to a new study of U.S. patents issued over the past five years.International Business Machines Corp. received the most patents in machine learning and quantum computers, while Ford Motor Co. is the most active in areas of vehicle navigation and control systems, according to the analysis by Fairview Research’s IFI Claims Patent Services.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued 352,013 patents last year, a 1% decrease that’s likely attributable to work-flow changes because of the coronavirus pandemic, said IFIClaims Chief Executive Mike Baycroft. IBM topped the list of patent recipients for the 28th year with 9,130 patents, while Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea was second with 6,415 new patents issued last year.Of the top-10 fastest growing fields, IBM also was No. 1 in areas of quantum computers, machine learning and computer systems using neural networks that imitate how the human brain works. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. also ranked in the top five of those three areas.“We are focused on areas where we think it will keep IBM competitive in the future,” said Kathryn Guarini, chief operating officer of IBM Research. “We see cloud, AI and quantum as the trifecta of technologies for the IT industry.”The company, based in Armonk, New York, has integrated artificial intelligence into all areas of its business, she said. One of its new patents is for ways AI can understand conversational tones, such as when a person contacts customer service. It’s just one example that backs up a Brookings Institution report that AI is likely to transform white collar and higher paid jobs.“It’s never our intent to replace the human,” Guarini said. “Our hope and our intent is that it makes all of us more efficient and improves productivity.”Quantum computers, which use the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers can’t handle, could create new ways for drug and agriculture companies to discover new compounds and financial service companies to improve encryption.With the classical computers, “we’ve made tremendous progress, making it more efficient and secure,” Guarini said. “But there has not been a revolution in how the technology works, for decades and decades. Quantum is on a whole new level.”Other fast-growing areas include display technology, with Samsung Display Co. in the lead; data transfer technology in computer design led by Intel Corp. and China’s Huawei Technologies Co., and plant and seed development led by Bayer AG’s Monsanto.In the two areas involving autonomous vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp. and LG Electronics Inc., were the next highest recipients behind Ford.The second-fastest growth area, albeit with a small number of overall patents, was in the area of electrical smoking devices with Philip Morris International Inc. as the top recipient over the past five years.“Patents are a significant mechanism for companies to develop intellectual property assets,” Baycroft said. “This is how you compete in the global market.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","IBM Leads in Quantum Computing, Ford in Driverless Car Patents"

2021-05-11,"Worldwide, cigarette smoking is in decline, but dwindling interest in cigarettes may not spell doom for Philip Morris International (PM) stock. The tobacco powerhouse, maker of global brands like Marlboro, has read the writing on the wall. Choosing to adapt rather than go extinct, Philip Morris is betting big on its alternative to traditional cigarettes, the IQOS tobacco-heating product. After striking success in Europe and Asia, it plans to bring the product to the U.S. market. To do so, it has formed a licensing deal with its former parent company, Altria Group (MO), which owns Philip Morris USA. Continued success with IQOS may boost confidence in the company’s long-term prospects and shift PM’s stock, which has mainly traded sideways since 2019. Even if this new product brings minimal growth, and only helps the company maintain its current level of sales, it still might enhance its valuation. Given that it offers a relatively high dividend yield (4.86%) as well, investors may still find opportunity here. The stock trades for around $98 per share. PM Stock and IQOS IQOS isn’t like the e-cigarette/vaping products we’ve seen until now. Unlike those products, which deliver straight nicotine, Philip Morris’ IQOS device still uses tobacco. IQOS heats tobacco instead of burning it, a method the company believes is less harmful than cigarettes. Harm reduction is a pragmatic option for the nicotine-dependent, so governments around the world may look the other way instead of intervening in this product’s sale. In fact, in December 2020, the U.S. FDA authorized the IQOS 3 for sale in the U.S. While this innovation may help stabilize Philip Morris’ sales, it may be a bit of a reach for the company to become a growing business once again. Yet PM stock tends to be resilient. Simply proving to investors that the business is not on the way to extinction might fuel multiple expansion. Solid Yield in a Low-Interest World If income, not appreciation, is your investment objective, PM stock may be a great option. With interest rates set to remain at historic lows over the next year or two, it will be tough to find yield. This stock is one of the few names that could help generate portfolio income, although it’s unlikely to become smoking hot. With the company paying out the lion’s share of its earnings as dividends, the odds of a big boost to this payout may be slim. On the other hand, with the company growing its dividend an average of 3.5% per year over the past five years, this yield may continue to keep up with inflation. In short, conservative investors who have more interest in income than gains could find this an appealing opportunity. (See Philip Morris International stock analysis on TipRanks) What Analysts are Saying About PM Stock According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, PM stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 8 analyst ratings, all 8 rate it a Buy. As for price targets, the average analyst price target is $109.71 per share, implying around 11.9% upside from current prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $105 per share to a high of $114 per share. Bottom Line: Philip Morris International Stock is Less Risky Than It Seems In the past few years, declining cigarette smoking rates in international markets have negatively affected the performance of Philip Morris International shares. In addition, the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing trends, which discourage investment in tobacco stocks, have harmed the stock. However, thanks to its adaption to tobacco’s new normal with its IQOS harm-reduction product, Philip Morris may not see a massive decline in sales and earnings in the coming decades. Do not expect this stock to see earth-shattering price appreciation, but if you are looking for high-yield dividend plays, consider PM stock. With its ability to continue its current payout and increase it in tandem with inflation, this is a high yield stock with less risk than it appears to have at first glance.
