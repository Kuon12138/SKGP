2018-06-26,"Income investors can do well enough by staying domestic in their hunt for dividends. But they can add some oomph by branching out into international dividend stocks, which provide several benefits. First, international stocks on average offer higher yields than their domestic counterparts. An index of international developed-market stocks - the MSCI EAFE - shows international stocks yielding roughly 2.6% right now, versus about 1.8% for the Standard & Poor&apos;s 500-stock index of U.S. large-cap companies. International companies also tend to pay out about 35% to 45% of their earnings in the form of dividends, versus 25% on average for U.S. stocks. There are other perks, too. International dividend stocks diversify an equity portfolio so you&apos;re protected against weakness in the U.S. They also help protect against inflation. International stocks domiciled in &quot;emerging&quot; markets such as China and India may also offer better growth prospects than in a developed market such as the U.S. And lastly, with American stocks trading at high valuations, historically speaking, international stocks - particularly those in Europe - may offer better values at present.

2019-01-11,"The Accenture CEO (NYSE:ACN) has announced that he will be stepping down from the role after leading the global management consulting firm for nearly a decade.

Pierre Nanterme, Chairman and CEO of the Ireland-based company, said that he will be leaving his post as boss after serving the company for eight years under that role. The company added that Nanterme will be stepping down due to health reasons, although the circumstances and condition surrounding these health issues have not been fully revealed to the public.

Accenture did reveal back in July 2016 that Nanterme was diagnosed with colon cancer, although it is unclear how advanced the condition is, as well as what type of treatment the boss is currently on as he battles this difficult illness. The consulting firm said that it will put current Chief Financial Officer David Rowland in the position as interim CEO, which means that KC McClure, who is currently in charge of leading finance operations, will take over as CFO for the time being.

Additionally, Accenture's Lead Independent Director Marge Magner will be the company's non-executive chair for the time being. The company also said that there are no changes to its outlook for the results of its second quarter of its fiscal 2019.

ACN stock was moving down slightly to the end the week, sliding about 0.5% on Friday.

2019-06-21,"(Bloomberg) -- While global banks have been pouring money into information technology -- to the tune of $1 trillion over three years -- only a handful appear to be fully committed to a digital transformation and are therefore reaping the benefits, according to an Accenture Plc study.Just 19 of the 161 largest retail and commercial banks that the consulting firm examined have been focusing enough on digital strategies to “make the shift to a different sort of bank,” Accenture said in the report, released Thursday. And those that did were rewarded for their efforts, the firm said.All the banks studied, based in 21 countries, started at roughly similar rates of return on equity in 2011, but by 2017 the banks that Accenture identified as “digital focused” had ROE that rose 0.9 percentage points. The 81 least digitally focused banks, meanwhile, saw their ROE slip 1.1 percentage points -- and Accenture researchers said the gap is likely to continue to widen through 2021. ROE at a middle group of 61 “digital active” banks was little changed.“You could see in those three groups the performance deferential,” Alan McIntyre, an Accenture senior managing director and co-author of the report, said in an interview. “You see a gap, and where the gap is coming from, and it’s coming from digital.”Cost-CuttingThe $1 trillion estimate by Accenture is for retail and commercial banks globally, and includes all internal and external hardware, software, service and information-technology staff costs. The most digitally focused banks became more profitable through cost-cutting, Accenture researchers said, and Wall Street has rewarded them with higher valuations. While the study didn’t include names of the banks studied, McIntyre said that the 19 most digitally focused banks include JPMorgan Chase & Co.New York-based JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, has been a top spender among financial firms in the technology arms race. In February, it said it planned to boost its tech budget by $600 million to $11.4 billion this year.“Everyone is trying to do something -- there’s not any bank in the world that’s ignoring digital,” McIntyre said. “Everyone’s trying to become more digital, but it takes organization, evangelism, commitment and structure.”(Updates with co-author’s comment in last paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Michelle F.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A bidder offers a 650 million-euro ($740 million) premium for a smaller rival and the stock market rewards it by raising its own market value by 1.3 billion euros. No prizes for guessing who got the better side of the deal in Capgemini SE’s agreement to by smaller French consulting peer Altran Technologies SA for 3.6 billion euros in cash. Altran shareholders should ask whether management got the best price.The acquisition makes strategic sense, adding engineering and R&D services to Capgemini’s core IT consulting offer. The buyer’s growth has been less impressive than that of peers lately, and sensible M&A offers the potential for a pick-up.Financially, the transaction looks good value for Capgemini. Altran’s shares collapsed last year after the group revealed a forgery in the Aricent business it acquired from KKR & Co. While the stock had recovered a lot prior to Capgemini’s deal, the damage wasn’t fully repaired. The takeover premium here is a humdrum 22% over Monday’s closing price and a more conventional 30% only when measured over the last three months’ average.A year ago, Altran implied it had the capacity to be generating nearly 600 million euros of operating profit in 2022. Add to that cost savings of around 85 million euros – the middle of the range Capgemini says is achievable – and the total 5 billion-euro investment (including assumed net debt) looks capable of earning a 9% post-tax return inside three years. That should be good enough for Capgemini shareholders. And revenue synergies would only lift this higher.True, this is a relatively large purchase for Capgemini, capitalized at 19 billion euros, so integration could be a distraction. The company’s leverage will shoot up, given the cash paid out to Altran’s shareholders and the target’s existing high leverage following the Aricent deal. But these additional risks are tolerable given the overall logic.As for Altran shareholders, they get an offer valuing the group roughly where Capgemini trades on forward earnings. The target doubtless feels the offer captures the value of its own strategic plan, otherwise it wouldn’t be recommending the transaction. Still, it looks like Capgemini could have afforded to pay more here.Altran shareholders will hope for a counterbid. Accenture may be tempted to look, although the target could be too big, and Capgemini already has backing from shareholders with 11% of the stock. The shares, trading just below the bid, aren’t pricing in a gatecrasher. It would take an activist and full-blown shareholder rebellion to force Capgemini higher.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jennifer Ryan at jryan13@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Capgemini SE said it will acquire Altran Technologies SA in a 3.6 billion-euro ($4.1 billion) deal in order to win more tech clients and keep up with rivals.Paris-based Capgemini is looking to maintain its position as a major IT consultancy in a consolidating industry, as competitors such as Accenture have been building out their sales from digital projects.Capgemini’s shares rose as much as 8% in early morning trading in Paris Tuesday, the most since October 2011. Altran rose 21% to 13.9 euros, trading just below the 14 euros-a-share offer price.Analysts broadly backed the deal. &quot;We think this deal should bring strong value creation and provides scale that can help Capgemini close the valuation gap to larger rivals such as Accenture,&quot; said Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud.The 14 euros-a-share cash portion of the deal amounts to 3.6 billion euros excluding net debt of 1.4 billion euros, the companies said in a statement Monday. The offer is a 22% premium to Altran’s closing price on Friday.The proposal is a “positive step, as it looks to significantly expand into R&D and engineering, two areas becoming main growth drivers for IT-outsourcing companies,” said Anurag Rana, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “The deal would enable Capgemini to compete more aggressively with Accenture, which generates more than 60% of sales from digital projects.”When combined Capgemini and Altran -- also based in Paris -- will be able to help clients in areas such as cloud computing, the internet of things, 5G, and artificial intelligence software, Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said in a statement.In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Hermelin added that Altran adds &quot;beautiful accounts&quot; such as Intel Corp, Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but added that the group still needed to develop its business in Asia. The combination of the two companies will result in a group with 17 billion euros in annual revenue and more than 250,000 employees.Hermelin expressed confidence on a conference call Monday that there are no antitrust issues associated with the takeover since “the market is very fragmented.”Still, the companies’ businesses do overlap, as they provide some of the same services to similar industries. Capgemini expects the deal to boost earnings per share by 25% by 2023, from 15% before the transition is completed.(Updated with CEO interview.)To contact the reporters on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.net;Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Capgemini Buys Altran for $4.1 Billion to Expand in Tech

2019-07-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon’s Prime Day gives shoppers an opportunity to flex their deal-spotting muscles ahead of Black Friday. It also gives package thieves their own chance to warm up.Although the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas see far more parcel deliveries—and therefore, more brazen from-the-stoop thefts, Prime Day’s limited 48-hour window creates a concentrated opening for “porch pirates” to make their move, said Brody Buhler, managing director of Accenture’s post and parcel industry group.It’s hard to pin down exactly how many cardboard boxes are pilfered from plain sight around the invented summer buying spree, since customers can report thefts to one of three sources—the local police department, the retailer or the mail carrier—and those reports aren’t tallied centrally. But according to research from video-doorbell company Ring, 19% of U.S. households had a package stolen at some point in 2017 with an average value of $140 per package. Nextdoor, a social-networking app for neighborhoods, says user comments about package theft spiked 85% between July 18 and 20 last year, the main delivery period for Prime Day packages.“Criminals know about Prime Day—everyone has access to the internet these days,” said James Crecco, a police captain in Jersey City, New Jersey.The police department in Jersey City partnered with Amazon in December to run a sting operation and track down package thieves after hearing from a swelling number of victims of porch piracy. Within just seven minutes of placing the first package, officers made an arrest and ultimately caught 23 robbers over an 11-day period. The department has been thinking about implementing a similar plan in the days following Prime Day, though Crecco said it was waiting to see if Amazon would partner again before renewing the program.Of course, on-the-porch delivery isn’t a new phenomenon in the U.S., with Montgomery Ward launching its dry goods mail-order business while Ulysses S. Grant was president and Sears, Roebuck and Co.’s iconic catalog serving as America’s consumer bible for a century. But the proliferation of e-commerce brought delivery of goods—and chances to pilfer them—to a whole new level. E-commerce accounted for more than 10% of all retail and food service sales in the first quarter, up from about 3% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department. Orders come in all year long, especially as grocery delivery expands, but they’re concentrated around big shopping events. During last year’s Prime Day, members bought more than 100 million products. Amazon has expanded this year’s extravaganza to 48 hours from 36 last year, with Coresight Research forecasting Amazon raking in $5.8 billion globally in sales, up from an estimated $3.9 billion in 2018.“Criminals know about Prime Day—everyone has access to the internet these days.”And that’s just the orders placed on Amazon itself. With rivals from Target Corp. to one-time mail-order king Sears itself leaning into the event, logistics providers will be extra busy in the coming days.The growth of porch piracy has led a number of states, including California, South Carolina, Michigan and New Jersey, to propose bills for stricter penalties for package thieves. In Texas, the problem became so prevalent that state representatives formed a mail theft task force in 2017 and have since passed legislation that makes certain degrees of package theft a felony. Related: Amazon Workers Plan Prime Day Strike at Minnesota WarehouseWhen packages do go missing, most major mail carriers agree to be liable for about $100, leaving the retailer to refund the remaining dollar amount or send a new item. Accenture finds that 70% of consumers won’t return to an online store after a bad delivery experience, which has retailers putting more pressure on logistics companies to give customers what they want, including tracking and delivery flexibility to ensure their wares arrive unscathed.When online shopping first became popular, the “focus was on price, then it became on free shipping, then fast shipping and now consumer-controlled shipping that can be altered until 10 minutes before the package arrives,” Accenture’s Buhler said. The demand for control over delivery comes from concerns about theft combined with increased demand for convenience, he said.Theft's a pervasive problem, and retailers have tried a variety of deterrents but are still looking for the perfect solution. For instance, to attract grocery customers, Walmart Inc. is experimenting with staffers, sporting wearable cameras, arriving in company-owned cars to unpack food in customers’ kitchens. Others are trying to leave deliveries in shoppers’ garages or the trunks of their cars. But with each new test, questions linger about privacy and efficiency, plus one-off issues like escaping pets or malfunctioning apps that deny the employee entry.Amazon itself offers Amazon Lockers, keyless entry and click-and-collect “counters” to give buyers more ways to control how they receive their orders. Amazon Logistics also gives Prime members the opportunity to track the arrival of their packages in real time and to receive a photo of where the box was dropped, the company said. A spokeswoman declined to comment further or share company data on thefts. Rising fear about package theft has helped usher in a new industry altogether: porch security. Brad Ruffkess, a former Coca-Cola Co. employee, installed security cameras at his Atlanta home and watched two boxes get stolen off of his doorstep within weeks of each other in 2017. Frustrated by the limited protection options available, Ruffkess founded BoxLock Inc., a WiFi-connected lock that lets delivery drivers place packages in secure parcel boxes outside users’ homes.BoxLock launched on Prime Day last year and sold out within hours of being posted to the Amazon website, he said. Other innovations that seek to keep porch pirates from their loot include secure parcel mailboxes, in-home package drops, Nest and Ring cameras, and alternative delivery locations through programs like UPS My Choice.“There’s still a lot more innovation to come in package security as e-commerce continues to grow,” Buhler said. “When it gets up to 20% of total shopping and there are so many more packages on people’s doorsteps, we’ll see even more innovation in protecting deliveries.”Back in Jersey City, a booming waterfront metropolis just over the Hudson River from Manhattan, package theft is evenly distributed among high and lower-income neighborhoods, Captain Crecco said, calling it one of the “rare crimes that crosses every economic demographic.” The trick to stopping it is making sure it’s not so simple to pull off for minor criminals looking for a low-effort pull. “It’s easy and criminals aren’t looking for a lot of work,” he said.To contact the author of this story: Olivia Rockeman in New York at orockeman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa WolfsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Thieves Love Amazon Prime Day as Much as Shoppers

The total value of fintech deals globally in the six months ended June 30 was US$22 billion, compared with US$31.2 billion in the same period of 2018, a decline of 29%.

The number of deals globally, in contrast, increased 2 per cent to 1,561 in the first half of the year.Ant Financial Services, the operator of Alipay and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, raised US$14 billion in the first half of 2018, the largest fintech investment last year. Excluding that deal, global fintech investments would have increased 28 per cent in the first half of this year, according to Accenture. Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.The United States remained the biggest market for fintech transactions, with investments jumping 60 per cent to US$12.7 billion in the first half of 2019, according to Accenture.

Fundraising is also moving to support the scaling up of challenger and collaborative fintech, which will cause lumpiness in some [funding] rounds,&quot; said Julian Skan, a senior managing director in Accenture's Financial Services practise. &quot;However, the question is: How long can that last? Fundraising is likely to reach a plateau soon and will most likely dip going forward.&quot;Accenture used data from CB Insights, a global venture finance data and analytics firm, for its analysis.In China, the number of fintech investments fell by nearly half to 79 transactions, compared with 155 fintech deals in China the first half of 2018, Accenture said. China was a major driver of fintech funding globally in 2018.The overall amount of fintech investments in China was US$820 million in the first half of the year, compared with US$17.7 billion in the first half of 2018. Excluding the Ant Financial transaction, fundraising in China still fell 79 per cent in the first half.The decline in Chinese fintech investments came as tensions intensified between the US and China over trade and technology in a trade war that has raged for more than a year. Asia-Pacific finance professionals fear AI, fintech will steal jobsThe US has increased scrutiny of foreign investments in the US, including by Chinese firms, and placed restrictions on some Chinese firms to be able to access US technology, including blacklisting Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies.Fears also are growing about a potential global recession as the trade dispute has weighed on future business investment. US markets posted some of their biggest declines of the year on Wednesday, following signs of a slowdown in Germany and weak economic data out of China.Overall, venture capital funding in China declined 69 per cent to US$15.1 billion in the first half of the year, according to data from Refinitiv. That compared with US$48.5 billion in the first half of 2018.

2019-08-22,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Corp.’s brokerage unit plans to do something that may be a first in capital markets. It will allow individuals in Japan to participate in initial public offerings with as little as a 1,000-yen note (worth a bit less than a 10-dollar bill).One Tap BUY Co., controlled by the wireless unit of investment giant SoftBank Group Corp., is preparing to start offering such sales as early as March 2020 after obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. This will mark the first time that investors will be able to subscribe to an IPO by investment amount rather than specified number of shares, said One Tap BUY Chief Executive Officer Masaaki Uchiyama.&quot;When you buy food or fuel your car, it’s easier to specify the amount of money you want to spend rather than the volume,&quot; Uchiyama said in an interview. &quot;The only thing investors want to know is how much they can gain from $10.&quot;SoftBank is going up against competition from Line Corp. and Rakuten Inc. in the race to tap individuals through financial services. Line started an online brokerage with Japan’s biggest bank, Nomura Holdings Inc., this week, while Rakuten last month announced it will start lending and issuing credit cards in the United States. All three are aiming to create and expand new markets, targeting younger and less well-off investors.SoftBank owns 46% of One Tap BUY, while Mizuho Securities Co. holds 13%. Uchiyama, who joined the smartphone-based brokerage in 2016 after stints at the predecessors of SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. and Accenture Plc., became the CEO in July.One Tap BUY will seek an IPO of its own in the next three to five years, the CEO said. Ahead of that, the company plans to raise as much as 3 billion yen ($28 million) from investors by March 2020 to expand its brokerage operation, he added.”As long as we are a unit of SoftBank, we are supposed to seek to become a unicorn,” Uchiyama said.To contact the reporter on this story: Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Takashi Amano at tamano6@bloomberg.net, ;Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Will Let People Invest in IPOs With Less Than $10

2019-09-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Steve Schwarzman has doubts. So does Larry Ellison.And so, too, do the growing numbers of Wall Street bankers and investors who are all anxiously awaiting the next move by WeWork and its brash co-founder, Adam Neumann.Neumann was a no-show this week for a long-planned appearance at a SoftBank Group Corp. three-day retreat in Pasadena, California, according to people familiar with the the matter, a further sign that company executives are hunkering down. Once the WeWork initial public offering was postponed late Monday, organizers knew Neumann’s presence would be iffy, the people said. His planned appearance was rescheduled from the first day of the event at the Langham hotel to the last and then canceled altogether.In short order Neumann’s office-sharing company has gone from a get-rich story to a you’ve-got-to-be-joking melodrama -- from WeWork to WeWait to, now, WeWorry.On Sunday, it was reported that some WeWork board members supported removing Neumann as CEO and making him non-executive chairman. CNBC said Softbank chief Masayoshi San supported removing him. It was a brutal week. First, WeWork’s parent company, We Co., finally conceded that its grandiose plans for going public would have to wait.Then Schwarzman, one of the most powerful figures on Wall Street, threw shade on the company’s hoped-for valuation, which has already collapsed from upwards of $60 billion to $15 billion -- or lower.“I sort of went, what? How do you get this?” Schwarzman, the head of private equity giant Blackstone Group Inc., said of the early numbers Wednesday at a luncheon in New York. Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., went further, according to Barron’s. He told a group of entrepreneurs at his San Francisco home that day that WeWork is “almost worthless.”And it only gets worse. In London, two deals for major office buildings that are largely leased out to WeWork started to fray. Back in its hometown of New York, the company made a small round of job cuts. And the Wall Street Journal, examining WeWork’s over-the-top culture, reported that Neumann and his friends smoked marijuana on a private jet en route to Israel last summer -- and left a chunk of the drug behind, spurring the plane’s owner to summon it back.If all that weren’t enough, Neumann’s own bankers were getting antsy: They were looking to revise a $500 million credit line secured by WeWork stock -- an acknowledgment that those shares appear far less solid than they used to.New RisksAnd, by Friday, Wendy Silverstein, a big name in New York commercial real estate who joined WeWork last year as head of its property investment arm, had left the company. She’s spending time caring for her elderly parents.Even the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston was adding to the angst. In a speech Friday in New York, Eric Rosengren warned that the proliferation of co-working spaces might pose new risks to financial stability.A WeWork representative declined to comment on Neumann’s canceled appearance at the SoftBank conference, citing the pre-IPO quiet period. SoftBank also declined to comment.Rarely has so much gone so wrong so fast for a young company in the spotlight. Neumann has begrudgingly agreed to cede some of his powers. The question now: Will that be enough?“I’ve never seen a company of this size and scale generate such a consensus of negative opinion in my long, long life of following IPOs,” said Len Sherman, a Columbia Business School adjunct professor whose 30-year business career included time as a senior partner at consulting firm Accenture Plc. “There is no box that they haven’t ticked when you think of all the reasons that you might be very concerned -- like blaring red lights. Like, oh my gosh, caution, danger, danger.”WeWork now hopes to go public next month. But even that may be optimistic. Neumann, also We Co.’s chief executive officer, has to persuade investors that his company -- which has raised more than $12 billion since its founding and never turned a nickel of profit -- is worth billions on the stock market.Deadline LoomsTime is short. WeWork must complete its IPO before the end of the year to keep access to a crucial $6 billion loan.The company’s $669 million of bonds due in 2025 have dropped 5 cents this week to 97.75 cents on the dollar as of Thursday, according to the Trace bond-price reporting system.A few hours after the Journal story hit Wednesday, investors at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. conference in New York heard from Snap Inc.’s Evan Spiegel -- Neumann’s predecessor as a celebrated startup founder whose behavior and company control attracted unflattering attention as the unicorn went public in 2017.He was asked what advice he’d give to founders looking to become CEOs of companies that have to answer to shareholders.

2019-09-23,"(Bloomberg) -- WeWork’s board is convening Monday and could discuss ousting Adam Neumann as chief executive officer, people familiar with the situation said, as the startup seeks to salvage its troubled initial public offering.With the drama of a palace coup, Neumann has found himself at odds with WeWork’s largest investor, SoftBank Group Corp. Masayoshi Son, founder of the Japanese conglomerate, is among those pushing for Neumann to resign, a person familiar with the situation said, after widespread criticisms of the company’s governance and spending. Some directors are expected to raise the prospect of Neumann becoming non-executive chairman, according to the people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The choice is ultimately Neumann’s, as the 40-year-old CEO maintains effective control of management decisions.The boardroom infighting not only imperils the IPO but also a $6 billion loan contingent on the deal. The unprofitable company must complete a successful stock offering before the end of the year to keep access to the credit facility. WeWork’s debut high-yield bond dropped three cents on the dollar after news that some directors are planning to push Neumann out.WeWork conceded last week that its plans for going public would have to wait after talks with potential investors lowered expectations for the company’s planned IPO valuation to $15 billion or less, after a previous valuation of $47 billion. Among the concerns they voiced: Neumann’s controversial style and control of the company.Rarely has so much gone so wrong so fast for a young company in the spotlight.“It’s Uber-scale mess,” said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, who blames both the board and Neumann for not learning from that company’s earlier mistakes. “He’s really taken a first-mover advantage that WeWork had in the space and blown it in a big way.”Read more: WeWork, WeWait, WeWorry: What’s Next for CEO Adam Neumann?The WeWork story is beginning to fit squarely into the era of unicorn capitalism: A young and charismatic entrepreneur disrupts an industry, runs afoul of elders and investors, sometimes winning but sometimes failing to live up to their own hype.Institutions including Benchmark Capital, one of WeWork’s investors, pushed out Uber Technologies’ Travis Kalanick before the ride-hailing company went public.Still, even if some directors want to oust Neumann, it won’t be easy given the company’s governance structure. Based on the number of shares he controls and their unique super-voting rights, Neumann has the power to get rid of the entire board on his own, according to the prospectus.Softbank’s intervention in the WeWork saga comes as the biggest backers of the company’s gargantuan Vision Fund are reconsidering how much to commit to its next investment vehicle. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which contributed $45 billion to the $100 billion Vision Fund, is now only planning to reinvest profits from that vehicle into its successor, people familiar said last week. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co., which invested $15 billion, is considering paring its future commitment to below $10 billion, the people said.Week of UncertaintyThe news of Neumann’s potential ouster comes after a whirlwind week of uncertainty for WeWork. Banks that provided a $500 million credit line to Neumann are looking to revise the terms as the company’s struggle to go public casts doubt on the value of his collateral, people briefed on the discussions said last week.

2019-09-23,"(Bloomberg) -- In a dramatic battle playing out at troubled unicorn WeWork, members of the company’s board are considering calling for the ouster of Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to discuss the prospect as soon as this week.The palace intrigue at one of the world’s largest startups echoes the chaos surrounding Uber Technologies Inc., when the board orchestrated the removal of co-founder Travis Kalanick two years ago. At Uber, after a scandal-plagued year, board member Bill Gurley of Benchmark helped force Kalanick’s resignation, with participation from other investors. Today, the story unfolding at WeWork includes some of the same cast members: Bechmark is a major WeWork investor.Factions are now forming around the decision of whether to try to remove Neumann, 40, whose outsized personality has been a driving force behind WeWork’s parent company, We Co. It’s also possible that Neumann could benefit financially from stepping down, if some board members’ calculation is correct that the company would be worth more without him. Uber’s Kalanick made a fortune from his departure, with a net worth today of $4.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son, founder of the Japanese conglomerate, is among those pushing for Neumann to resign, as the startup seeks to salvage its initial public offering, a person familiar with the matter said. WeWork’s rocky IPO preparations came at a particularly sensitive time for SoftBank, WeWork’s largest investor, as it works to raise a second $108 billion Vision Fund.SoftBank expects Benchmark to be aligned with its position on Neumann, one person said. SoftBank has two representatives on WeWork’s board and Benchmark has one.Representatives for WeWork, SoftBank and Benchmark declined to comment.“It’s Uber-scale mess,” said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, who blames both the board and Neumann for not learning from that company’s earlier mistakes. “He’s really taken a first-mover advantage that WeWork had in the space and blown it in a big way.”The overthrow of Kalanick at Uber could offer lessons for the situation at WeWork. Benchmark sought to drive Kalanick out with help from the courts and other major investors. The VC firm sued Kalanick, accusing him of defrauding investors, and threatened to publicly air claims of mismanagement. Kalanick agreed to resign in 2017 after a confrontation with two Benchmark partners at a hotel in Chicago. Benchmark’s lawsuit was dropped the next year.In both cases, investors’ machinations have been complicated by the founders’ power within their companies. Kalanick wielded control over Uber by holding stock with strong voting rights, similar to Neumann’s. At Uber, the board effectively stripped Kalanick of that power by changing the structure of the shares, so that when the company went public, all its shares were worth one vote each. Neumann, too, has disproportionate power over WeWork that is being whittled down. When the company first filed to go public, it did so with an unusual three-class share system that gave Neumann the vast majority of the voting power. Following backlash over governance issues from investors, it reduced the power of the high-vote stock to 10 votes per share, from 20.Though there are similarities between the controversies surrounding Kalanick and Neumann, the two men’s methods are different. Kalanick came under fire for allegations of fostering a toxic workplace culture, including reports of sexual harassment by employees at the company. In contrast to Kalanick’s hard-charging tactics, Neumann often speaks about “elevating the world’s consciousness,” and promoting a sense of community. But Neumann has drawn investors’ ire for perceived self-dealing, including acting as a landlord to WeWork and profiting from a trademark on the company’s name. (Those arrangements have been wound down.) Both CEOs have also faced blowback over the raucousness of company parties and the free-flowing availability of alcohol.WeWork’s boardroom infighting not only imperils the IPO but also a $6 billion loan contingent on the deal. The unprofitable company must complete a successful stock offering before the end of the year to keep access to the credit facility.WeWork conceded last week that its plans for going public would have to wait after talks with potential investors lowered expectations for the company’s planned IPO valuation to $15 billion or less, after a previous valuation of $47 billion.

The online survey of 1,500 U.S. consumers found that Americans expect to spend $637 on holiday shopping this year, on average, with approximately six in seven respondents planning to spend either the same (57%) or more (28%) than they did last year.  There does appear to be a level of caution among consumers this year, however, as the percentage of those who anticipate spending less rose slightly year on year, from 11% to 15%.","Most US Shoppers Expect to Spend as Much or More This Holiday Season than Last Year, with Many Turning to Physical Stores for Inspiration, Accenture Survey Reveals"
2019-10-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Mother Nature is figuring into consumers’ holiday spending plans this year.The environmental impact of fast-delivery options, which may include using planes and shipping multiple items separately, is a concern resonating with Americans, according to Accenture’s Annual Holiday Shopping Survey. Half of respondents said they’d choose options that leave a smaller carbon footprint, such as slower shipping or in-store pickup.“Consumers are starting to care” about the use of cardboard and the impact of next-day shipping, Jill Standish, senior managing director and head of Accenture’s global retail practice, said in an interview. “This is just the beginning. This is the new normal.”To be sure, while consumers say they want to rein in any repercussions on the planet from their shopping habits, it’s unclear how much their behavior will actually change. One-day or other fast-shipping options may prove too strong a lure, especially when trying to meet holiday deadlines.Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have been investing billions of dollars to speed up and broaden delivery options as they vie for customers, a strategy that has put pressure on their profit margins. Walmart has said its shift to one-day shipping will mean items will typically come in just one box from a single warehouse that’s closest to the customer. Amazon, meanwhile, said in April that reducing delivery times for its top customers would cost it $800 million in the second quarter alone.In addition to the environment, social responsibility is becoming more important to consumers, according to Accenture. Of the 1,500 people surveyed in July and August, 45% said they plan to shop at retailers this holiday season who demonstrate social consciousness in their business practices and working conditions.Six out of seven participants said they plan to spend the same or more than last year, averaging $637. On average, men expect to lay out $685, about 15% more than women, with gift cards, clothing and footwear the most popular purchases. Respondents were split evenly between men and women, with 20% representing each of five generational groups from Gen Z to Baby Boomers.&#92;--With assistance from Jordyn Holman and Matthew Boyle.To contact the reporter on this story: Lisa Wolfson in Boston at lwolfson@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Jonathan RoederFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Holiday Shoppers Weighing Carbon Footprint in Delivery Decisions

2019-10-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- An advertisement showing in U.K. cinemas currently shows a boy hesitating to kiss a female zombie. “But I’m kinda hot,” she says, popping chewing gum into her mouth before they lock lips — and her arm drops off. The finance community has a similarly conflicted relationship with Libor, the reference interest rates for everything from mortgages to car loans to corporate debt. This makes it likely that the benchmarks will survive beyond their planned termination date.The current plan is for Libor to wink out of existence by the end of 2021. Changes in the wholesale funding market mean it’s no longer based on actual transactions between banks. The Financial Conduct Authority is adamant that the U.K. finance industry should shift to using the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average rate (known as Sonia). In other jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the euro area, regulators are implementing replacements.But with a bit more than two years to go, a combination of complacency, complexity and inertia is keeping Libor very much alive.The Bank of England’s “Bank Overground” blog pointed out recently that the value of sterling swap contracts referencing Libor is increasing rather than decreasing, according to data compiled by LCH Ltd., the derivatives clearing house.The value of contracts that extend beyond Libor’s mooted end date has increased since April 2018, and stands currently at more than 10 trillion pounds ($12 trillion), as the chart above shows. Even by 2026, more than 5 trillion pounds of Libor swaps will still be outstanding. “Use of Libor remains widespread, and this poses risks to market stability,” the Bank of England blog says.There has been some progress in moving financial products to the regulators’ recommended replacement. Earlier this month, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s NatWest unit switched the reference rate on an existing loan to South West Water to Sonia. In July, the same bank made the first new loan based on Sonia, to National Express Group Plc.Of course, some of the warnings about the need to accelerate away from Libor are self-serving. Consultants and lawyers will make money from offering expensive advice on the transition; it’s in their interests to emphasize the dangers.But the sheer volume of outstanding notes around the world still tied to Libor and expiring after 2021 — as much as $864 billion, the International Capital Markets Association estimated earlier this year — leaves many financiers skeptical that the regulators will carry out their threat to kill off the benchmarks as planned.A survey published last month by consulting company Accenture Plc showed 23% of respondents expect Libor to survive past its current death date. The poll of 177 global banks, asset managers and companies showed just 18% of the respondents described their shift away from the benchmarks as “mature,” with only one-fifth saying they were “operationally ready.”Regulators face a tough choice. If Libor wins a stay of execution, there will be even less pressure to switch away from the old reference rates. But if they stick to their guns, billions of dollars and euros and pounds of contracts will come untethered as the interest rates on which their payments are based disappear.That risk is too big to ignore. Sure, Libor is flawed and outdated and probably beyond redemption. But with less than 27 months to go, the finance industry needs more time to come to terms with its demise. Let Libor live on. Sometimes even a zombie can be hard to resist.To contact the author of this story: Mark Gilbert at magilbert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mark Gilbert is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering asset management.

2019-10-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Digital financial services from lending to asset management are expected to generate at least $38 billion of annual revenue across Southeast Asia by 2025, more than tripling from $11 billion in 2019, according to a new study by Bain & Co., Google and Temasek Holdings Pte.Online lending will comprise about half that total for the region, which houses some of the world’s fastest-evolving internet and mobile industries. Growing smartphone penetration promises to unlock internet-based services such as insurance to more than 70% of an adult population neglected by traditional banks, according to the report.The region has seen a rapid adoption of digital finance since Southeast Asian ride-hailing giants Grab Holdings Inc. and Gojek funneled some of the billions they raised into in-app payments and financial services. Other segments like lending and insurance remain in their nascent stages, said Aadarsh Baijal, leader of Bain’s digital practice in Southeast Asia.“As payments grow like WeChat, we see other services following quite quickly,” he told reporters in Singapore on Wednesday, referring to Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s signature messaging product. “The payments adoption is becoming the gateway to the growth of other financial services.”Even Uber Technologies Inc. is moving into financial services by launching a new division, Uber Money. The San Francisco-based company is taking its cue from Gojek and Grab, which have successfully developed new revenue streams by branching out. “There are definitely encouraging signs that Southeast Asia would be a hub of innovation, with Uber’s new payments play learning from companies from this side of the world,” Baijal said.Read more: Investors Pour Record $735 Million Into Singapore Fintech DealsThere are no clear winners yet in Southeast Asia’s fragmented digital financial services market. But traditional banks will play an important role because of their access to capital, said Rohit Sipahimalani, joint head of the investment group at Temasek. Lenders like DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and United Overseas Bank Ltd. have teamed up with Gojek and Grab, respectively. Thailand’s Kasikornbank has partnered with Shopee, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms, to provide digital loans to sellers.“Fintech companies will need to partner with banks to be able to have access to balance sheet,” he said. “And banks will need to partner with consumer fintech companies because they don’t have reach to tap into the under-banked population.”Read more: Southeast Asia’s Internet Economy to Top $100 Billion This YearIndonesia and Vietnam are projected to grow fastest in terms of digital financial services revenue, according to the report by the three companies, their first on the region’s digital financial services industry. Their expansion already underpins a $100 billion Southeast Asian internet economy, the firms said in a broader survey published earlier this month.Southeast Asia, a region that houses more than 600 million people, is rapidly warming to online finance as governments craft investor-friendly policies to encourage everything from blockchain startups to digital banking. Investors poured a record $735 million into fintech ventures in Singapore alone in the first nine months of this year, according to research from Accenture Plc.Liberalization is key to the region’s rapid adoption of online financial services. Singapore and Thailand have instituted so-called sandboxes, or systems that let companies experiment under regulatory supervision. Both countries have also established standardized QR codes for mobile wallets. Digital payments in the region are projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2025, from $600 million in 2019.Depending on how the region’s governments approach fintech regulation, digital financial services revenue could conceivably reach $60 billion by 2025, well above the $38 billion estimate, the study’s authors added.To contact the reporter on this story: Yoolim Lee in Singapore at yoolim@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Digital Financial Services to Generate $38 Billion in Southeast Asia, Study Finds"

2019-11-04,"Banks in China and Hong Kong could lose as much as US$61 billion in revenue from payments in the next six years as digital wallets and competition from technology companies and other non-banks continues to increase, according to a report by Accenture.In new data to be released on Monday, Accenture found that 2019 payments revenue is expected to increase by 69 per cent to US$494 billion by 2025 on the mainland, from US$292 billion this year. Hong Kong's payments revenue growth is slower by comparison, increasing by 12.6 per cent over the same period to US$10.7 billion by 2025.Accenture, the consulting and professional services firm, said banks will be required to change their business models and focus on providing more value-added services to capture the growth in payments revenue.&quot;The payments industry has been under a lot of pressure from new competition and margins are likely to get squeezed even further because the world of instant, invisible and free payments is here to stay,&quot; said Albert Chan, Accenture's financial services practice lead for Greater China. HKMA: Virtual banks could soft-launch some services in fourth quarterThe report was based in part on the results of an online survey of 240 retail and corporate payments executives at global banks that was conducted in February and in March.Accenture found that the worldwide payments industry could increase by more than US$2 trillion by 2025, with banks having the opportunity to capture US$500 billion of that growth.The report comes as technology giants, such as Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, are dominating the payments space in mainland China and Hong Kong's first virtual banks are expected to begin offering services later this year or early next year.Traditional banks, such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of China have responded by building out their own digital banking services or teaming up with technology partners.HSBC, one of the major banks to eschew a virtual banking licence in Hong Kong, has expanded its PayMe e-wallet service to businesses this year and has been increasing its digital offerings in the city.Standard Chartered has partnered with Chinese online travel group Ctrip.com and Hong Kong telecommunications companies HKT and PCCW to start a virtual bank, while developing its own digital offerings in Africa and in other parts of Asia. Standard Chartered expects its digital bank to begin operating by the second half of next year.Accenture's report found that free payments will put pressure on bank income from card transactions and fees &quot; 5.2 per cent of revenue are at risk on the mainland and 23.9 per cent in Hong Kong. E-wallets, where consumers use mobile devices for payments, will put further pressure on payments, with 4 per cent of revenue at risk in China and 2.6 per cent of revenue at risk in Hong Kong, Accenture said.Instant payments, where funds are transferred in real time and banks make little to no interest, will put an additional 3.6 per cent and 2 per cent of payment revenues at risk in mainland China and Hong Kong respectively, the company said.Accenture noted that revenue from credit card transactions by business dropped by 33 per cent globally between 2015 and 2018, while consumer debit card transactions fell by nearly 15 per cent during that period.&quot;The digital transformation underway in payments will have a deep impact on all industry players and banks will have to fundamentally change how they think about their revenue in this area,&quot; said Chan, the Accenture executive. &quot;The billions of dollars banks previously earned from some of these channels will dry up, so they'll need to develop new digital business models to compete in this new era. Banks lagging behind risk being relegated to the plumbing of payments.&quot;This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- North American banks could save more than $70 billion through 2025 using technology to automate jobs or assist employees, according to estimates from Accenture Plc.The study released Thursday found that the broader group of financial-services firms in the region could save $87 billion to $140 billion through automation and augmentation of more than half their tasks. The cost savings could be as high as $44 billion in insurance and $25 billion in capital markets.“There are certainly some jobs that will be automated,” said Cathinka Wahlstrom, head of Accenture’s financial-services practice in North America. But for those employees who remain, technology can be a boon, she said. “It’s an opportunity as opposed to something to fear. Done right, it’s going to be great both in terms of productivity savings and ultimately client experience.”Banks and other financial firms are grappling with the rapid pace of technological change by overhauling operations and investing in digital offerings for clients. That means eliminating some job functions and retraining staff.“Some roles will change dramatically in years to come,” Accenture said. It estimated more than 50% of tasks performed by loan officers, financial advisers, bank supervisors, loan clerks and tellers could be automated and augmented by 2025.In capital markets, more than half of the work done by financial analysts, sales agents, brokerage clerks and statisticians could be automated or augmented in the same period. Financial-industry executives surveyed by Accenture said only a quarter of employees are ready to work with intelligent technologies.In wholesale markets, foreign exchange has made wide use of technology while fixed income lagged, Wahlstrom said. Portfolio analysis is also becoming more automated. Even in private banking, where the wealthiest clients expect bespoke service from human advisers, digital tools are in demand.As technology allows firms to cut costs and become more efficient, machines can also help the human workforce to focus on higher-value work such as innovation, relationship-building and customer service, the consultant said.“The labor market is really tight, so it’s not like there’s enormous supply,” Wahlstrom said. “The faster and easier thing is for most companies to retrain their employees” to improve their work using technology, she said.To contact the reporter on this story: Lananh Nguyen in New York at lnguyen35@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-12-14,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Army will spend $111 million next year in a new contract with Palantir Technologies Inc., deepening ties between Peter Thiel’s data analytics company and the Pentagon.The new Defense Department deal will represent about 10% of Palantir’s revenue next year, according to people familiar with the company’s finances. It’s the first step in what could be a four-year, $440 million deal with the Army.The Silicon Valley company will provide software to connect human resources, supply chains and other Army operations systems into a single dashboard. The Army considered earlier proposals for related work from Accenture Plc, Deloitte, Ernst & Young and Microsoft Corp.“We started Palantir in 2004 to help the war fighter and solve difficult problems,” Doug Philippone, head of Palantir’s global defense business, said in an emailed statement. “In helping the Army make better use of its own data, we accomplish both goals.”The Defense deal solidifies a relationship between the U.S. government and the Palo Alto, California-based company, which was co-founded and partly bankrolled by Thiel. The billionaire venture capitalist and adviser to President Donald Trump has chastised other technology companies, in particular Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for their reluctance to work with the Defense Department. After Google abandoned a Pentagon effort known as Project Maven, Palantir stepped in to help develop video recognition software as part of the project, a move reported earlier by Business Insider.On Saturday, a company spokeswoman said Palantir will run its first-ever commercials, which will air during the Army-Navy football game, in a bid to show its support for the U.S. military.In recent years, Palantir has sought to work more with companies and be less reliant on government contracts. Airbus SE and Merck KGaA are among its customers, but government clients still make up a significant portion of revenue.To contact the reporter on this story: Lizette Chapman in San Francisco at lchapman19@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Palantir Wins New Pentagon Deal With $111 Million From the Army

2019-12-16,"(Bloomberg) -- The international effort to rein in fossil fuel pollution took a step backward this weekend after envoys at a marathon round of United Nations talks watered down language on issues they had agreed on in previous years.The delegates from almost 200 nations left Madrid after more than two weeks of discussion, agreeing only on the “urgent need” for countries to make deeper cuts to greenhouse gases. They shelved work on adding market mechanisms as a tool for countries to meet their goals and couldn’t agree about finance needed to fix the problem.The result undercut principles of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, under which all countries agreed to deliver increasingly ambitious policies to cut pollution. It also walked back on a three-decade-old commitment from the richest industrial nations to help developing countries shoulder the costs of global warming.“There is a lot of disappointment with the outcome on this COP,” Krista Mikkonen, Finland’s environment minister, said after the meeting that was known as COP25. “No one can be proud. We are really lacking the big countries, the big economies to understand that we need action.”President Donald Trump’s retreat from U.S. pledges to cut emissions sapped momentum. China and other nations were reluctant to embrace stiffer language promising tighter emissions pledges.The result contrasted with a rising tide of protests from environmental groups, whose figurehead this year Greta Thunberg has inspired millions of students to speak out on the issue.The envoys at COP25, drawn from environment and energy ministries, have promised to work toward limiting temperature increases in the atmosphere to 1.5 degrees Celsius since the start of the industrial revolution. That would still mark the quickest shift in the climate since the end of the last ice age.“The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a post on Twitter. “We must not give up, and I will not give up.”Setback for Carbon MarketsFor financial markets and companies, the biggest disappointment was the lack of progress on markets. The envoys for a second year in a row were unable to agree on the details of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. That called for countries to use market mechanisms to meet goals on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The impasse leaves companies that encouraged carbon trading, including the oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc and the Spanish utility Iberdrola SA, with fewer price signals showing how quickly the cost of pollution is rising. In an op-ed in the Financial Times on Monday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon urged governments to put a price on the cost of carbon, whether through a cap and trade system, carbon tax or other means.Carbon market advocates say trading mechanisms could shave $320 billion a year off the cost of reducing emissions by helping countries and companies identify the most efficient projects. Environmental groups and many nations saw them as a loophole and way to shift around the responsibility for cutting pollution.“People all over the world are asking for urgent action and several countries only offered accounting tricks and cover for climate inaction,” said Sam Van den Plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch, a research group following the talks. “What was on the table here could have been a real disaster for the Paris Agreement. We need carbon markets to increase climate action, not undermine it.”The highly technical measures are important because they give countries the ability to generate tradable credits representing emissions cuts. A deal would have encouraged the spread of carbon cap-and-trade markets like the one working in Europe, which has put a price on pollution for thousands of power plants and industrial plants.“Many of these national plans are already banking on the existence of Article 6 mechanisms,” said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, chief executive officer of Accenture’s resources businesses. “As a result, many pledges could be watered down due to the ongoing lack of clarity regarding market mechanisms. Countries may even choose to delay submission of their pledges until they have clarity on the rules.”Inaction this year was a blow to developers who participated in the Clean Development Mechanism and other programs that sprang up out of the last major climate pact, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The CDM has fed $138 billion into thousands of climate-related projects, but its credits have become nearly worthless today because of questions about the system’s credibility.To some extent, the consequences of failure this year are low. Markets were the main agenda item, and many nations and green groups were skeptical about involving those mechanisms. They see carbon trading as a distraction from the broader need for much deeper and faster cuts in emissions, which no market mechanism would force.“It symbolizes profits for their private sector and the chance to give the appearance that they are meeting their commitments while continuing to pollute and operate business as usual,” said Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands.Failure in Madrid puts a spotlight on the U.K., which is hosting next year’s talks in Glasgow. The agenda there was focused on raising the ambitions of countries to promise deeper cuts than they have set out for the Paris deal. Markets will now complicate that discussion.The envoys agreed to use texts drawn up in the closing hours of the Madrid meeting as the basis of their discussions next year, saying much progress had been made.“For Glasgow to be a success, we need a clear message that countries will be called to revise and improve their climate action plans,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, an environmental group. “If that doesn’t come through, there’s going to be little that we can be able to harvest in Glasgow.”While markets were the backbone of this year’s talks, it was the language around “ambition” that drew the most attention.In previous years, the envoys endorsed similar terms to what Paris set out, promising a tightening ratchet on pledges for reducing pollution. Those voluntary cuts were set down when the Paris deal was negotiated in 2015. Next year’s talks in Glasgow, Scotland, was to be the focus of getting countries to promise more. The weakness of this year’s language suggests many are getting cold feet on those ambitions.Debates about wording of texts in Madrid pushed the conclusion of the meeting into Sunday morning. That gave COP25 an inauspicious comparison with the COP meeting in 2000, when envoys in The Hague suspended talks around 1 p.m. in 2000 with nothing agreed.“It’s hard to encourage countries to do more when the biggest polluter in the world is not doing enough,” said Ian Fry, who represented Tuvalu at the talks in Madrid.(Updates with Goldman Sachs commentary in 10th paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Laura Millan Lombrana in Madrid at lmillan4@bloomberg.net;Jeremy Hodges in Madrid at jhodges17@bloomberg.net;Bobby Magill in Madrid at rmagill3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net, Natasha DoffFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Climate Fight Takes a Blow With No Deal on Carbon Markets

2020-01-23,"(Bloomberg) -- A handful of local technology startups gathered to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, celebrating the city’s evolution as an international tech hub in recent years.“Ten years ago, tech in New York was people who would meet in Central Park and play soccer and now tech in New York is ringing the bell in the stock exchange,” said Serkan Piantino, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spell, an artificial intelligence company in New York.New York’s tech industry accounted for 333,000 jobs as of 2019, and counts more than 9,000 startups, according to Tech:NYC’s annual report. In addition to home-grown companies, the giants of Silicon Valley are increasingly expanding in the Big Apple. Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which already has more than 8,000 employees in New York could surpass 14,000 by 2028, while Facebook Inc. intends to double its headcount in the city. Many of the biggest tech companies are gobbling up real estate in Manhattan, seeking to tap the city’s highly skilled and diverse workforce.@TechNYC celebrates tech startups in NYC https://t.co/CBrUHdTsaJ— NYSE (@NYSE) January 23, 2020 Companies find that they can recruit people in New York for many different disciplines that are becoming fundamental to the industry, such as artificial intelligence, data science, and computer vision, said Ro Gupta, CEO of Carmera Inc., which makes real-time maps for autonomous driving.It’s that kind of growth and opportunity that has made the tech industry in New York “incredibly bullish” about its future, said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech:NYC, a network of more than 800 tech companies in the city. However, it’s becoming harder to hire mid-level and senior employees in the industry, according to a 2019 survey by Tech:NYC and Accenture Plc.Tech has become a part of the city’s identity, said Aaron Block, co-founder of MetaProp NYC LLC, a venture capital firm focused on real estate technology. “It’s great to see New York embrace this in a way that is going to continue to fuel the growth of the industry locally,” Block said.To contact the reporter on this story: Nikitha Sattiraju in New York at nsattiraju@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Molly Schuetz at mschuetz9@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",NYC Startups Celebrate City’s Tech Cred by Ringing NYSE Bell
2020-01-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor makers Qorvo Inc. and Skyworks Solutions Inc. are weighing bids for Broadcom Inc.’s wireless-chip business, which could fetch about $10 billion in a sale, according to people familiar with the matter.Other potential buyers could be interested, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. The unit makes radio-frequency, or RF, chips.A final decision hasn’t been made and Qorvo and Skyworks may opt not to proceed with offers, they said.A representative for Broadcom declined to comment. Representatives for Qorvo and Skyworks didn’t respond to requests for comment.Broadcom on Thursday disclosed new agreements to provide components for Apple Inc. devices for several years. The disclosure lets potential acquirers of the radio frequency unit know that they’re buying into a substantial business relationship with Cupertino, California-based Apple.The potential sale comes as Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan -- fresh off a $10.7 billion takeover of Symantec Corp.’s security software unit -- seeks to focus on businesses with strong share in profitable markets that don’t require excessive investment. He’s jettisoning components that don’t fit that plan. Broadcom agreed to sell a cybersecurity services business this month to Accenture Plc.The RF unit’s chips are used to filter and amplify radio frequency signals. Its filters also let wireless communications systems support a large number of subscribers at the same time by ensuring that voice and data streams don’t interfere with each other.The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Broadcom was seeking a buyer for the division.To contact the reporters on this story: Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.net;Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, ;Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Michael HythaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Qorvo and Skyworks Weigh Bids for Broadcom’s RF Chip Unit

2020-01-27,"(Bloomberg) -- ServiceNow Inc. plans to release software for finance and telecommunications clients, adopting an industry-solutions strategy in its bid to reach a goal of $10 billion in annual revenue.Deloitte Consulting LLP will be the initial leading partner for the banking product, helping the software maker package and sell the workflow tools to clients, ServiceNow said Monday in a statement. Accenture Plc will be the lead partner for the telecommunications software.New Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott has pledged to build the Santa Clara, California-based company into a software “juggernaut.” While plans for the industry strategy preceded the October announcement of McDermott’s hiring after a decade in charge of German software giant SAP SE, he has maintained the sales goal of his predecessor, John Donahoe. In the crowded landscape of cloud-computing companies, ServiceNow has long promised to organize tedious parts of office life, like setting up a help desk for IT operations and bringing on board new employees.ServiceNow said the industry approach will help banks modernize their internal processes and ultimately provide more efficient customer service.“In banking, we’ve seen disruption from fintechs around giving customers a better experience,” Marshall Tyler, ServiceNow’s vice president of industry solutions, said in an interview. “Banks have reacted with, ‘let me give my customers a better user interface,’ but are starting to realize it’s the operations behind the user interface that can improve experiences.”For telecommunications customers, ServiceNow aims to help clients maximize availability and quality of service by “proactively anticipating issues and addressing them quickly.” Part of the rationale is helping clients modernize their internal systems and processes amid the transition to fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless service.Banking and telecoms are just the beginning of ServiceNow’s industry verticals strategy. The company promised to bring specific solutions to health care, manufacturing, media and technology “in the near future.”ServiceNow has expanded into new markets, such as human resources, to maintain an annual sales growth rate of at least 31% since going public in 2012. The company, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday, is projected to generate $3.45 billion this fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares have gained 61% in the past 12 months, closing Monday at $307.63.To contact the author of this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","ServiceNow Targets Banking, Telco to Reach $10 Billion Sales Goal"

2020-02-20,"Investments in global fintech firms fell 3.7 per cent in 2019, hurt by a sharp decline in deal activity in China in 2019 against the backdrop of a bruising trade war between Washington and Beijing, according to a new report by the consulting firm Accenture.Despite the steep fall-off in activity by Chinese companies, there were 3,472 deals worth US$53.3 billion globally last year, the second-highest value of investments since 2013, Accenture said. That compared with 3,251 investments worth a record-high US$55.3 billion in 2018.Deal activity was marked in 2018 by Ant Financial Services, the operator of Alipay and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, raising US$14 billion in the largest fintech investment that year. Excluding the Ant Financial deal, global fintech investments would have increased 29 per cent last year, according to Accenture. Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.&quot;Despite strong demand for fintech globally, it's likely that, as start-ups become more mature, investments will flow to fast-growing economies, where there's still a huge, unaddressed consumer and corporate market thirsty for innovations,&quot; said Julian Skan, a senior managing director in Accenture's Financial Services practice.Accenture used data from CB Insights, a global venture finance data and analytics firm, for its analysis.Despite the future potential of emerging markets, fintech investors continued to favour the United States, which retained the crown as the biggest market for fintech deals worldwide last year. The value of deals in the US jumped 54 per cent to US$26.1 billion in 2019. Fintech investments in the United Kingdom rose 63 per cent to US$6.3 billion, while India, Brazil and Germany posted strong gains. 'No way.' Chinese firms won't be buying in US, Europe, says former Sinopec bossInvestment in Asia is likely to increase in 2020 and some later stage fintech companies may seek to list their shares this year, driven by an &quot;incredible growth&quot; in the middle class and more people migrating to urban centres in the region, according to a report by Ecosystm, a technology research and advisory firm.&quot;While Asia may seem a mile away from financial institutions operating in most mature economies, the growth in investment in Asia will allow these technologies to put newcomers in a better position to disrupt the incumbents,&quot; Paul Gestro and Amit Gupta, its co-authors, said in the November report. &quot;With fairly open government policies through most of Asia and a generally underdeveloped banking sector that allows innovation to flourish, scaling up will happen fast and if you blink you will miss out.&quot;In China, the number of fintech investments fell 38 per cent to 216 transactions last year, compared with 348 deals in 2018, Accenture said.The overall amount of fintech investments in China was US$1.9 billion in 2019, compared with US$25.5 billion in the prior year. Excluding the Ant Financial transaction, fundraising in China still dropped 83 per cent last year.&quot;Venture capital investments are cyclical, so it's not unexpected that they may decline after a period of record volumes or very intense activity,&quot; said Albert Chan, Accenture's Greater China financial services lead, adding that there were hardly any mega deals there in 2019.The largest fintech deal in China last year was the US$145 million financing of insurtech Shuidi Huzhu in June. Four deals, including the Ant Financial transaction, accounted for nearly US$20 billion in investment in China in 2018.Fintech deals in Singapore more than doubled to US$861 million in 2019, with 39 per cent of investments going to payments start-ups, according to Accenture. Singapore had deals worth US$365 million in 2018.Hong Kong saw its fintech investments nearly to double to US$374 million in 2019 as the city issued licences to its first virtual banks, which are expected to make their debut later this year, Accenture said. That compared with US$188 million in 2018.The largest deal in the city was US$156 million raised in December by WeLab, which won a virtual banking licence in Hong Kong last year.Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).

2020-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the sprawling networks of contract workers who keep social-media services running smoothly. Software is picking up the slack, but Facebook Inc. and YouTube are already warning there’ll be less content moderation and slower customer support.While tech platforms believe artificial intelligence software will ultimately reduce the need for human oversight, many experts think the technology is not yet ready to take on nuanced decision-making required for tasks like content moderation. “Now it's going to be really obvious to everyone how poorly they actually work,” said Hannah Bloch-Wehba, a law professor at Drexel University who studies internet governance.Facebook has about 15,000 contract workers policing its platform. While full-time employees log on remotely, the company won’t let contractors who filter disturbing content work from home, citing privacy concerns and legal considerations. Many are employed through staffing firms such as Accenture Plc, which recently sent some Silicon Valley-based workers home to comply with a shelter-in-place order. One moderator who asked not to be named for fear of retribution said he was told the cuts would last at least three weeks. As he left the office on March 16, he wondered if he’d ever return. Accenture didn’t respond to a request for comment. Read more: Inside Silicon Valley’s Shadow WorkforceThe following day, Facebook users began complaining that their posts were being removed at curiously high rates. Jodi Rudoren, editor-in-chief of The Forward, complained on Twitter that her newspaper’s links were disappearing, cutting traffic to its website. Within hours, Facebook restored many of the links. The company blamed a glitch in its spam-moderation software, and executive Guy Rosen said it was “unrelated to any changes in our content moderator workforce.”Still, the incident undermined confidence in Facebook’s technology at a time when the company is relying more on automation. “I posted a scientific article about COVID spread and it was censored. That is some Orwellian Machine Learning you have there,” genomics scientist Kevin McKernan wrote on Twitter. “If you censor COVID, I’m off the platform forever.”Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told reporters the next day that shortages of contract workers will mean less content moderation. With fewer people to make difficult judgment calls on what content to keep up, the company is prioritizing the most-urgent cases, such as posts recommending people drink bleach to cure Covid-19. Other problem areas, such as “back-and-forth accusations a candidate might make in an election,” will get less attention, he said. The largest U.S. internet gatekeepers have come under immense criticism in recent years for spreading toxic content and misinformation. In response, they hired thousands of contractors who work alongside software to filter out the dross. The novel coronavirus is forcing the companies to re-assess that combination. Google, which has more than 10,000 contractors, recently said it would temporarily increase the use of automated content moderation on its services, including YouTube. The internet's largest video site warned this would mean more videos will be removed. Creators can challenge these automated decisions, but YouTube said “workforce precautions will also result in delayed appeals reviews.&quot; There was a similar message at the top of the YouTube Creator Support website on March 26. Much of the public debate over content moderation has centered on social and political issues, as when YouTube's AI systems labeled footage of the Notre Dame cathedral fire a conspiracy theory last year. But it can also hurt creators who rely on YouTube and similar services like Instagram for income. YouTube's automated decisions about advertising, for instance, have sparked outrage from its stars for years. As global Covid-19 cases surged earlier this month, YouTube's systems automatically pulled ads from videos that mentioned the virus in an effort to curb misinformation. After creators protested, CEO Susan Wojcicki announced changes to the company’s guidelines to allow ads on a limited number of video channels that go through a formal approval process. “Sometimes these automated systems can make mistakes, which we know can be frustrating,” a YouTube creator support representative said in a video describing the certification procedure. On Tuesday, Forrest Starling, who runs the popular gaming YouTube channel KreekCraft, alerted YouTube that far fewer people were visiting his channel from the service’s search engine. He couldn’t get an explanation from the company, but suspected an algorithmic mishap. &quot;It’s a very weird time in the world right now and I understand everyone there is doing the absolute best they can,&quot; he wrote in an email. &quot;It’s just frustrating when issues like this pop up.&quot;The day after, YouTube issued a statement attributing problems like Starling’s to Covid-19 related staff shortages. “Content may not show in search, etc. until a reviewer takes a look, & w/fewer reviewers available, this is taking longer,” the company wrote on Twitter. &quot;Completely understandable considering the circumstances,&quot; Starling said afterward.The staffing challenges for tech companies may get worse before they get better. On March 24, the government of India ordered all 1.3 billion of its citizens to stay in their homes for 21 days. The country is a significant source of remote technical and support staff for U.S. tech companies.  Read More:  How India Plans to Lock Down 1.3 Billion People in a DemocracyA YouTube spokesman described the staffing shifts as a temporary response to virus-related disruptions. Facebook’s Zuckerberg hasn’t been shy about his long-term vision of a content-review regime that relies far more on machines than humans. This holds appeal because content moderation is labor intensive and brutal, with some workers complaining of trauma from exposure to disturbing content. Regardless of the long-term prospects, people like Starling see troubling signs. On Thursday, he sent a tweet from KreekCraft’s Twitter page: “Well I woke up and YouTube crashed,” he said. He added an emoji of a face sneezing. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Tech’s Shadow Workforce Sidelined, Leaving Social Media to the Machines"

2020-05-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- These days, someone proposing a remote meeting or virtual happy hour is very likely to say, “Let’s Zoom.” While the coronavirus-induced lockdown has made Zoom Video Communications Inc. synonymous with video calls, it has also created a broader market, and whet investor appetite for stocks well placed to profit from the move to working from home. Pexip Holding ASA has satisfied some of that demand with Europe’s biggest technology initial public offering this year. The Thursday listing valued the Oslo-based company at some 9 billion Norwegian krone ($880 million) – not shabby for a business with just 370 million krone in revenue last year.The company is trading at a discount to its bigger, better-known competitor. If Pexip grows at the same pace for the rest of this year as it did in the first quarter, and profitability is consistent with previous years, then the listing gives it an enterprise value of more than 70 times forward Ebitda (a measure of a company's operating performance). Zoom is considerably pricier, with a valuation on the same basis of more than 370 times.If this were primarily a classic consumer-facing market, then investors would have to weigh up the prospect of a winner-takes-all battle. After all, that’s how things have tended to pan out for online services: Alphabet Inc.’s Google took search, Facebook Inc. dominates social media, Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn has professional contacts and so on. And Zoom has already entered the lexicon as a verb in much the same way as google or tweet.But the video-conferencing business model differs from those advertising-driven offerings: Most of the money is to be made from companies paying for premium services. Chief technology officers care less about what’s in vogue than about the best solution for their needs from both a technical and cost perspective. So while Pexip’s valuation is still punchy, there is room for multiple players. Concentrating on a business-to-business solution is far more likely to build a sustainable concern built on rational purchases — Pexip already boasts customers such as Vodafone Group Plc, General Electric Co. and Accenture Plc and annual recurring revenue from multi-year contracts jumped 50% in the first quarter. With 1.1 billion krone in IPO proceeds, it now has capital to accelerate that pace of growth.There’s significant demand to capitalize on the work-from-home trend. Shares in TeamViewer AG, a German maker of software that facilitates remote working, have climbed 33% this year, while the benchmark DAX Index has fallen 22%. Even at enterprise software giant SAP SE, Chief Executive Officer Christian Klein told Bloomberg News this week he’d love to have a video-conferencing solution in the company’s portfolio right now.Pexip must do a lot to justify its valuation, which prices in a huge increase in earnings over the next few years. It may be telling that many of its investors are using the offering as an opportunity to sell their stakes: The company will have a free float of some 80% of the share capital. Perhaps they’re sensing an opportunity to make hay while the sun shines. But if work from home is here to stay, then there will likely be plenty of seats around the (dining room) table.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-05-18,"COVID-19's impact has been crippling, but something positive may come from the pandemic. Billionaire Ray Dalio said in a live LinkedIn interview that in terms of the broader historical context, the recent economic downturn should be “relatively brief,"" and could spur significant societal progress. This would include a worldwide “restructuring” lasting approximately three to five years.“I know that’s a long time, but it’s not forever. The human capacity to adapt and invent and come out of this is much greater,” Dalio commented. He added, “I think we should be very excited about the new future. We’re now in a wonderful revolution in terms of the capacity to think and use that in a way. I would say that is absolutely the most treasured thing in the future.”Still making sure to account for the unknowns, Dalio has been diversifying his investments across geographic locations, asset class and currencies throughout the ongoing public health crisis.  Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration, we used TipRanks’ database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform, the analyst community believes they do, with all of the picks earning “Strong Buy” consensus ratings. Let’s jump right in.Philip Morris International (PM)Cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company Philip Morris has become known as a “sin stock."" However, regardless of its product portfolio, Dalio sees plenty of upside in store.Recently, the billionaire’s fund acquired a new position in PM, snapping up 67,447 shares. The value of this new addition? More than $4.9 million.Turning now to the analysts, the stock boasts a strong fan base, which includes Piper Sandler’s Michael Lavery. He doesn’t dispute the fact that there are some headwinds facing the company. “PM expects near-term iQOS new user acquisition to be about 50% lower than it originally planned due to social distancing measures that have shut iQOS stores and made it harder to engage with consumers,” Lavery stated.That being said, the company has already surpassed Lavery’s expectations, which were cut to near-zero. The analyst even says that if PM can maintain the pace of its customer acquisition, there could be upside to his estimates. The analyst added, “We expect HeatStick volume growth of 20% in 2020E (1Q20: +45%) and believe 90-100 billion sticks in 2021 is still achievable.”While lower duty-free volumes and down-trading in Indonesia could take a toll on second quarter EPS, Lavery remains optimistic. “We remain bullish on PM's strong long-term outlook, and we expect nicotine demand to remain resilient near-term (particularly in times of personal stress),” he explained.It should also be noted that PM has had to grapple with patent infringement claims from British American Tobacco (BAT) and a transactional currency hit. Speaking to the first issue, Lavery said, “We reviewed BAT's six patents named in its U.S. complaint, and it is difficult to handicap an outcome, but a third-party reviewer of patents generally did not give BAT's relevant ones here very high marks.”As for the latter, Lavery points out that about $100 million of the currency hit in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by the revaluation of euro or dollar denominated payables in markets like Russia, but he doesn’t foresee another event of this magnitude happening again.Based on all of the above, Lavery kept an Overweight rating on the stock. He did reduce the price target from $98 to $95, but this still implies shares could climb 40% higher in the next year. (To watch Lavery’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts are in agreement. 7 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $83.56 average price target brings the upside potential to 23%. (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Hoping to help people live healthier lives and make the healthcare system work more efficiently, UnitedHealth Group offers a wide range of healthcare products and insurance services. While the late-March acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a somewhat lackluster quarter, Dalio believes the company’s future is bright.To this end, Bridgewater went in on UNH. In a purchase valued at $5,481,000, Dalio’s hedge fund scooped up 21,977 shares.Five-star analyst Michael Wiederhorn agrees that UNH is moving on to bigger and better things, noting that its Q1 performance was relatively solid. “Overall, UNH produced strong results and seems well-positioned to navigate the COVID pandemic due to a relatively stable top-line, a diversified business mix and a dominant position across its businesses.”Wiederhorn tells investors that management thinks the slowdown in non-COVID-irelated utilization, which was driven by highly constrained elective care and will be offset by the late-year pent-up utilization, will have a significant impact on MCR in the second quarter. As a result, despite some uncertainty surrounding COVID-19's impact, UNH maintained its full year 2020 EPS guidance of $16.25-$16.55.Adding to the good news, Wiederhorn argues that its Optum segment has a strong standing within the market. Expounding on this, he noted, “Trends at Optum remained solid, and management did note that even OptumHealth should be positioned to hold up relatively well due to its reliance on risk-based contracts, accounting for two thirds of revenues. Both OptumRx and OptumInsight have strong pipelines (though the timing of meetings was disrupted) with the latter of particular interest as companies look to improve the economics and delivery of healthcare.”Even though commercial enrollment could be hampered by elevated levels of unemployment, higher Medicaid should partially offset this. Additionally, UNH is in the early stages of pricing and benefit design for 2021, with its plans possibly including pricing for COVID-19 testing and a potential vaccine.Bearing this in mind, Wiederhorn maintained an Outperform call and $343 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of 18% could be in the cards. (To watch Wiederhorn’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts also like what they’re seeing. With 12 Buys and 2 Holds, the word on the Street is that UNH is a Strong Buy. At $326.23, the average price target indicates 12% upside potential. (See UnitedHealth stock analysis on TipRanks)Accenture PLC (ACN)Dalio’s third recent addition, Accenture, provides management and technology consulting services and solutions to help its clients, which inhabit almost every industry, create lasting value. With the company relying on a new strategy, Dalio thinks it has set itself up for success.Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity, Bridgewater pulled the trigger on 27,763 shares, giving it a new position in ACN. Looking at the value of the new holding, it comes in at more than $4.5 million.When it comes to the analysts, they are also singing the company’s praises. Writing for BNP Paribas, analyst Ben Castillo-Bernaus argues that COVID-19's disruption has presented investors with an opportunity to buy a “high-quality” IT service company, with ACN trading well below historical five-year average EBIT multiples.“Accenture remains ‘best in class’ and the recent weakness is an opportunity to gain a position in this IT Services global leader delivering 40% returns on capital,” Castillo-Bernaus stated. He added, “Accenture has been a pioneer in developing ‘the New’ with 65% of revenues now coming from high growth Digital, Cloud and Security services.”As for what makes the company so successful and allows it to continuously take market share, Castillo-Bernaus points to its investments in new technologies and growth areas. To back up this conclusion, the analyst cites its EUR1 billion investment in training each year and EUR800 million investment in R&D all while delivering margin improvements every year. On top of this, ACN conducts smaller-scale M&A, with it working alongside the companies before an acquisition to limit any potential deal failures.Castillo-Bernaus also noted, “We believe Accenture has customers that spend more than $100 million annually, with 98% of Accenture’s top 100 clients having been clients for more than five years. These ‘sticky’ relationships help Accenture maintain high margins and high returns as Accenture has a high number of ‘sole source’ wins where it does not even see competition in RFPs.”That being said, the company has started using a new approach. It will now organize itself by Strategy & Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations instead of by verticals, and the results will be reported geographically for these segments. “We believe it is too early to tell what kind of impact these changes will have, but Accenture has a positive track record of occasionally tweaking its growth strategy in order to best deliver on the opportunities ahead,” Castillo-Bernaus commented.It should come as no surprise, then, that Castillo-Bernaus joined the bulls. Along with an Outperform rating, he initiated coverage by setting a $215 price target. This target conveys the analyst’s confidence in ACN's ability to surge 17% in the next twelve months.In general, other Wall Street analysts have also been impressed. ACN’s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 13 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months. However, the $195.29 average price target suggests modest upside potential of 6%.

2020-06-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just after dawn last Wednesday, the smell of smoke lingered over the intersection of Lake Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis. It's a major commercial thoroughfare, home to dozens of black-owned businesses. It's also eight blocks from where George Floyd suffocated beneath a police officer's knee and died on May 25. During the chaos that followed, dozens of Lake Street's buildings and businesses burned.It was a serious blow to a community that's struggled for decades to achieve economic equality. In 2018, the median income for black households in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was $38,200; for whites, it was $82,500. That’s a wider gap than for the U.S. as a whole, despite the area’s progressive reputation, a corporate community that's renowned for its civic-mindedness, and a robust regional economy.Worse, it echoes a range of other depressing metrics — including gaps in employment, wages, education and business ownership — that make the Twin Cities one of the most unequal metro areas in the country. In some ways, these are very much local problems. But they also exemplify some broader long-term trends that have contributed to the current national crisis.As I surveyed the damage, two questions in particular were bothering me. Why is Minneapolis's black unemployment rate more than four times that for whites? And why, in an area where corporations make such conspicuous efforts to support diversity, do black-owned businesses make up such a small part of the local economy?*****Later that morning, I met up with Tawanna Black, an experienced business and philanthropy executive, in downtown St. Paul. In 2018, Black founded the Center for Economic Inclusion, which works to combat racism and inequality across the Twin Cities. With clients and partners such as Accenture Inc., the Itasca Project, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Ramsey County (home to St. Paul), the group calculates metrics and indicators for inclusion and seeks to deploy them across the region.We talked about the factors that drive economic inequality in the Twin Cities and beyond, and in particular how corporate America can do its part to reduce disparities in employment and ensure that black communities share in the nation’s prosperity.Many of the problems, Black pointed out, were decades in the making. Beginning in the early 20th century, racial covenants prevented black residents from purchasing homes, accessing good schools and accumulating wealth in Minnesota and elsewhere. Progress has been made on some of these fronts: In the Twin Cities, at least, more equitable zoning policies are helping to ameliorate inequalities over time.But there remain many less obvious problems that contributed to the pain and anger that have erupted since Floyd’s death.To take one example, the considerable corporate philanthropic efforts that the area is known for sometimes allow executives to punt on the harder question of addressing inequalities in their own organizations. Meanwhile, the Twin Cities — like a lot of communities across the U.S. — are increasingly home to large employers that don't deal directly with consumers, and thus are less responsive to community complaints and campaigns.It adds up to a lack of accountability.&quot;I've heard some business leaders say we need somebody to give us the right proposal and ask the right question,&quot; Black told me. “I wrestle with that because I think the state of racial inequities is hurting everyone. In a city this size, this prosperous, we should be producing results. And if we're not, we should be asking ourselves, what does it take? And we haven't gotten to that point where it's not just a thing for ‘you people’ to go solve — as in people of color.”*****Changing that mindset won’t be easy, because many of the underlying problems are structural — held in place by either government policy, strong corporate incentives or some combination.Black points to low-income workers who lose government benefits when they reach a certain wage level. This sometimes forces them to choose between health care and a job, and makes it harder for employers to retain minority workers, a decades-old problem. &quot;More and more I find HR leaders and employers that want to work with government to change those systems,&quot; Black told me, but getting the political system to respond can be a huge challenge.Another example involves contracts. Corporate America is often willing to fund organizations that train minority entrepreneurs, Black said, but when it comes to actually hiring them, those companies sometimes beg out &quot;because I have large contracts and those businesses aren't big enough.&quot;In fact, many national corporations have such burdensome contracting requirements that small businesses, especially those of color, simply don't have the resources to apply for them. As a result, more established competitors have a persistent advantage. &quot;It's built in,&quot; Black says. &quot;But structures are held up by people.&quot;Fortunately, at least a few of those structures are being dismantled.*****Five years ago, when Minneapolis faced a community uprising due to a previous police killing, Target Corp. — one of the state’s largest employers — made a serious effort to address underlying inequalities in the area’s business community. It not only started contracting with very small companies in North Minneapolis, home to a large black community, but tried to eliminate burdensome language from the contracts.That kind of thing is good for companies and economies both. But truly reducing inequality will also demand fresh thinking about job creation. Black notes that in the Twin Cities and other regions, black small businesses are heavily concentrated in areas like restaurants, catering, barbershops and hair salons. Those are important industries. &quot;But chances are,&quot; Black said, &quot;the jobs those create aren't going to change our wealth gap.&quot;Doing so will require more intentional support from big companies in sectors like tech. Several years ago, the Itasca Project, an organization that includes some of the Twin Cities' most important employers, created a program to encourage contracting with small local companies. There was a belief, Black said, that “those dollars would naturally trickle to businesses owned by people of color.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Nothing trickles.&quot;Now CEI is working with Itasca to add race-based goals to the program. That approach could prove transformative: According to CEI's data, if the rate of white and minority business ownership in Minnesota were at parity, the state would have another 87,000 jobs.That's reason for hope in the midst of some of the bleakest days ever faced by the Twin Cities. But will it lead to real change? Is it an inflection point for the region, and for American corporations?&quot;It is, and it has to be,&quot; Black said. &quot;And I pray that we pause in it long enough to create deep and sustained change.&quot;This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-06-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Duck Creek Technologies, a software provider for insurers, has raised $230 million from new and existing investors ahead of a planned initial public offering.The Boston-based company attracted Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management and Whale Rock Capital Management as new investors, according to a statement reviewed by Bloomberg. The valuation of the company in the round wasn’t included in the statement.The deal comes as the IPO market is roaring back after the coronavirus pandemic largely sidelined listings. Last week, more than $7 billion was raised globally through first-time share sales, the busiest week this year. On Tuesday, used car sales platform Vroom Inc. scored the year’s second-biggest first-day pop, rising 118% in its trading debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Duck Creek plans to use the proceeds to invest in business growth as well as to buy back equity from certain existing investors, it said in the statement. The deal is expected to be announced Wednesday.The company announced in December that it had confidentially filed a draft registration for an IPO. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the sole placement agent for the private fundraising, according to the statement.“Our platform’s performance, particularly during these recent months, has shown the industry that SaaS can deliver new levels of value,” Duck Creek Chief Executive Officer Michael Jackowski said in the statement, referring to “software as a service” in which software is licensed on a subscription basis. “We see growing opportunity for Duck Creek as more insurers accelerate their adoption of SaaS solutions for their core systems.”Duck Creek’s customers include American International Group Inc., Chubb Ltd. and Zurich Insurance Group AG. Its software, focused on property and casualty insurance, is used for policy administration, billing and claims, among other functions.Apax Partners acquired a majority stake in Duck Creek from Accenture Plc in 2016 and established it as an independent company. Dragoneer Investment Group, Insight Partners, funds advised by Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers LLC and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte participated in a $120 million private fundraising in December, according to a statement at the time.

2020-08-13,"Accenture (NYSE: ACN) posted Q3 earnings of $1.71 billion, an increase from Q2 of 15.03%. Sales dropped to $10.99 billion, a 1.36% decrease between quarters. In Q2, Accenture brought in $11.14 billion in sales but only earned $1.49 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Accenture posted an ROCE of 0.1%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on ACNROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Accenture is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Accenture, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight Accenture reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.9/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.85/share.See more from Benzinga  * Price Over Earnings Overview: Accenture  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Over the past month, the stock decreased by 13.06%, but over the past year, it actually increased by 9.83%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 14.78%.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on ACNDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 27.68 in the IT Services industry, Accenture Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 28.07. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Accenture Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued.Price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

The deal follows Accenture's (ACN) announcement last month that it will invest $3 billion to help clients rapidly become “cloud-first” businesses and accelerate their digital transformations. The IT consulting firm did not disclose the financial terms of the transaction.Following the deal, Enimbos’s employees will join Accenture’s Cloud First organization, which includes 70,000 cloud professionals globally who help clients transform processes and functions through integrated cloud strategies.“The addition of Enimbos is a significant step forward in our growth strategy in Spain and Portugal, and in our plans to continue enhancing Accenture’s specialized capabilities with each of the native ecosystem partners in the cloud world, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft,” said Accenture’s Domingo Mirón. “Most companies have not completed their digital transformation and urgently need to fast-track their innovation journeys. Cloud is the key enabler to complete their transformation, and COVID-19 has further accelerated this mandate. This accelerated transition will shift companies to about 80% cloud in the next three years.”Apart from cloud migration services, Enimbos also provides cloud modernization services, standardized multi-cloud managed services, and cloud governance and optimization. Enimbos is headquartered in Madrid, with additional offices in Cáceres, Mérida and Barcelona in Spain, and in Aveiro and Lisbon in Portugal.Shares in Accenture have climbed more than 9% so far this year, and analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock’s outlook.

2020-11-18,"(Bloomberg) -- More than 200 of Facebook Inc.’s content moderators said their lives are being put at risk by the requirement to work in offices in global hot spots during the pandemic.“Now, on top of work that is psychologically toxic, holding onto the job means walking into a hot zone,” wrote the outside contractors and Facebook employees in a letter to the executives of the social-media company and the contracting companies released Wednesday. Moderators sift through explicit, violent and abusive content to remove it from Facebook’s social network.“Workers have asked Facebook leadership, and the leadership of your outsourcing firms like Accenture and CPL, to take urgent steps to protect us and value our work. You refused.” Several Covid-19 cases have occurred at moderator workplaces, according to the letter.At the start of the pandemic, Facebook asked content moderators to work mostly from home. But some content, such as explicit child imagery, needed to be viewed in a secure environment legally; in those cases, Facebook either attempted to use its artificial intelligence to weed out bad content, or asked some moderators to work in offices in places such as Austin, Texas.The company had been relying more heavily on AI moderation so human workers could focus the past months on election-related content and Covid-19 misinformation. Now, more of Facebook’s contractors are back to work in offices. The letter writers said Facebook’s AI is simply not good enough to replace human judgment.“Facebook’s algorithms are years away from achieving the necessary level of sophistication to moderate content automatically,” the moderators said in the letter. “They may never get there.”The moderators, who work for contracting companies such as Accenture Plc, are asking for full-time employment, hazard pay and safer working conditions in light of the spread of Covid-19.Facebook disputed the characterizations made in the letter.“While we believe in having an open internal dialogue, these discussions need to be honest,” Facebook said in a statement. “The majority of these 15,000 global content reviewers have been working from home and will continue to do so for the duration of the pandemic.”(Updates with Facebook statement in the final paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Content Moderators Say Office Push Risks Lives

2020-12-01,"Canada’s largest community credit union implements cloud-based platform to manage its commercial loan lifecycleTORONTO, Dec. 01, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- nCino, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCNO), a pioneer in cloud banking and digital transformation solutions for the global financial services industry, and Accenture (NYSE: ACN) have supported Vancity, Canada’s largest community credit union, in evolving its commercial lending business through the implementation of the nCino Bank Operating System®.  With over CA$28.2 billion in assets and more than half a million members, Vancity sought an agile technology to grow its commercial lending business and replace a 15-year-old legacy system. The credit union selected the nCino Bank Operating System, an end-to-end cloud-based platform that manages the entire loan lifecycle — including origination, loan reviews, renewals and modifications — eliminating the need to combine various point solutions.Working alongside teams from Vancity and nCino, Accenture helped implement the nCino platform on time and budget, despite the project occurring in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic — which made the cloud-based nature of the platform particularly important, as Vancity’s members and employees shifted to a remote work environment.In addition to benefitting Vancity’s commercial loan book, the nCino platform is helping the credit union align processes across lines of business, automate tasks and streamline workflows. Because the nCino Bank Operating System is flexible and configurable, Vancity can continue to customize processes as they see fit to best suit their evolving needs.“By adopting nCino for our commercial lending operations, we’ve embraced a cloud-based technology with regular updates and releases that will grow along with us and help us remain competitive and agile,” said Nez Aquino, chief risk officer at Vancity. “We see nCino as an incredible value-add to our organization, not only from a platform standpoint, but also as partners along our digital transformation journey.”“Digital transformation is top-of-mind for commercial banks of all sizes and particularly credit unions as they embrace changing customer dynamics, and deal with aging legacy systems and the pressure to compete in a challenging environment,” said Robert Vokes, Accenture’s Financial Services practice lead in Canada. “Vancity’s decision to evolve its operations and streamline various businesses with nCino’s cloud-based platform will help them deliver an improved, tailored experience that meets the evolving expectations of members and employees. This is a great example of the scalability of nCino’s platform and the deep industry expertise and talents of our people to bring it alive with our clients.”“Vancity is a great Canadian brand and a real leader in the credit union space, and they should be very proud of how they’ve helped to develop the communities they serve,” said Cam Sterrett, area vice president and general manager – Canada at nCino. “With nCino, Vancity has put a foundational system in place that will give them the ability to grow their member-facing digital front end and further fulfill their mission of improving their members’ financial well-being. We very much appreciate the great work our organizations, alongside Accenture, have been able to do together so far and look forward to expanding these relationships into the future.”About nCino  nCino (NASDAQ: NCNO) is the worldwide leader in cloud banking.

2020-12-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Timnit Gebru, a co-leader of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence team at Google, said she was fired for sending an email that management deemed “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.”The email and the firing were the culmination of about a week of wrangling over the company’s request that Gebru retract an AI ethics paper she had co-written with six others, including four Google employees, that was submitted for consideration for an industry conference next year, Gebru said in an interview Thursday. If she wouldn’t retract the paper, Google at least wanted the names of the Google employees removed.Gebru asked Google Research vice president Megan Kacholia for an explanation and told her that without more discussion on the paper and the way it was handled she would plan to resign after a transition period. She also wanted to make sure she was clear on what would happen with future, similar research projects her team might undertake.“We are a team called Ethical AI, of course we are going to be writing about problems in AI,” she said.Meanwhile, Gebru had chimed in on an email group for company researchers called Google Brain Women and Allies, commenting on a report others were working on about how few women had been hired by Google during the pandemic. Gebru said that in her experience, such documentation was unlikely to be effective as no one at Google would be held accountable. She referred to her experience with the AI paper submitted for the conference and linked to the report.“Stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference,” Gebru wrote in the email, which was obtained by Bloomberg News. “There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything.” The email was published earlier by tech writer Casey Newton.The next day, Gebru said she was fired by email, with a message from Kacholia saying that Google couldn’t meet her demands and respects her decision to leave the company as a result. The email went on to say that “certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager,” according to tweets Gebru posted, which also specifically called out Jeff Dean, who heads Google’s AI division, for being involved in her removal.“It’s the most fundamental silencing,” Gebru said in the interview, about Google’s actions in regard to her paper. “You can’t even have your scientific voice.”Representatives for Mountain View, California-based Google didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment.Google protest group Google Walkout For Real Change posted a petition in support of Gebru on Medium, which has gathered more than 400 signatures from employees at the company and more than 500 from academic and industry figures.The research paper in question deals with possible ethical issues of large language models, a field of research being pursued by OpenAI, Google and others. Gebru said she doesn’t know why Google had concerns about the paper, which she said was approved by her manager and submitted to others at Google for comment.Google requires all publications by its researchers to be granted prior approval, Gebru said, and the company told her this paper had not followed proper procedure. The report was submitted to the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, a conference Gebru co-founded to be held in March.The paper called out the dangers of using large language models to train algorithms that could, for example, write tweets, answer trivia and translate poetry, according to a copy of the document. The models are essentially trained by analyzing language from the internet, which doesn’t reflect large swaths of the global population not yet online, according to the paper. Gebru highlights the risk that the models will only reflect the worldview of people who have been privileged enough to be a part of the training data.Gebru, an alumni of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is one of the leading voices in the ethical use of AI. She is well-known for her work on a landmark study in 2018 that showed how facial recognition software misidentified dark-skinned women as much as 35% of the time, whereas the technology worked with near precision on White men.She has also been an outspoken critic of the lack of diversity and unequal treatment of Black workers at tech companies, particularly at Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and said she believed her dismissal was meant to send a message to the rest of Google’s employees not to speak up.Under FireTensions were already running high at Google’s research division. Following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed during an arrest by White police officers in Minneapolis in May, the division held an all-hands meeting where Black Googlers spoke about their experiences at the company. Many people broke down crying, according to people who attended the meeting.Gebru disclosed the firing Wednesday night in a series of tweets, which were met with support from some of her Google co-workers and others in the field.Gebru is “the reason many next generation engineers, data scientists and more are inspired to work in tech,” wrote Rumman Chowdhury, who formerly served as the head of Responsible AI at Accenture Applied Intelligence and now runs a company she founded called Parity.Google, along with other U.S. tech giants including Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc., has been under fire from the government for claims of bias and discrimination and has been questioned about its practices at several committee hearings in Washington.A year ago, Google fired four employees for what it said were violations of data-security policies. The dismissals highlighted already escalating tensions between management and activist workers at a company once revered for its open corporate culture. Gebru took to Twitter at the time to support those who lost their jobs.For the web search giant, Gebru’s alleged termination comes as the company faces a complaint from the National Labor Relations Board for unlawful surveillance, interrogation or suspension of workers.Earlier this week Gebru inquired on Twitter whether anyone was working on regulation to protect ethical AI researchers, similar to whistle-blower protections. “With the amount of censorship and intimidation that goes on towards people in specific groups, how does anyone trust any real research in this area can take place?” she wrote on Twitter.Rare VoiceGebru was a rare voice of public criticism from inside the company. In August, Gebru told Bloomberg News that Black Google employees who speak out are criticized even as the company holds them up as examples of its commitment to diversity. She recounted how co-workers and managers tried to police her tone, make excuses for harassing or racist behavior, or ignore her concerns.When Google was considering having Gebru manage another employee, she said in an August interview, her outspokenness on diversity issues was held against her, and concerns were raised about whether she could manage others if she was so unhappy. “People don’t know the extent of the issues that exist because you can’t talk about them, and the moment you do, you’re the problem,” she said at the time.(Adds petition in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google’s Co-Head of Ethical AI Says She Was Fired for Email

2020-12-15,"As we are about to close this unprecedented year, the market is slowing down. While there are still reasons to be optimistic about 2021, namely due to the incoming vaccines, the near-term reality is still filled with implications of rising COVID-19 cases and business closures. Although this will be a lighter week in terms of earnings, there are three highlights to keep an eye on. They are Accenture (NYSE: ACN), FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and Nike (NYSE: NKE).Can Accenture Embrace The Power Of Change? Accenture will report before the market opens on Thursday. Wall Street expects earnings of $2.05 per share on revenue of $11.36 billion, compared to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $2.09 per share on revenue of $11.36 billion. Compared to other tech/software stocks, Accenture shares haven't participated in the robust market rally since the March bottom, but the stock has held pretty well despite a muted enterprise IT spending environment. Rising 17.5% in six months and up 17% year to date, the IT consulting company has outperformed the S&P 500 index in both spans. The question is, with the stock already up some 20% off its October low, presumably in part due to its buyback strategy, can Accenture be relied upon to pull out a meaningful recovery next year?FedEx Is Expected To Deliver Away FedEx Corporation will report after the market closes on Thursday. Wall Street expects earnings of $3.93 per share on revenue of $19.39 billion, compared to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $2.51 per share on revenue of $17.32 billion. The stock is up 110% in six months and up 92% year to date. It is trading near 52-week highs fueled by stronger-than-expected business activity, particularly in its domestic parcel capacity. Asia airfreight rates have risen sequentially, which provides support for its Express performance while the continued strength in e-commerce provides a strong revenue backdrop for FedEx to build upon. Analysts at UBS expect upside 2Q earnings and have consequently raised their estimate from $3.82 per share to $4.20 per share. On Thursday, positivity regarding profitability improvements within FedEx's ground segment is expected.Just Like Its Swoosh, Nike Is Expected To Triumph Nike is the Winged Goddess of Victory in Greek Mythology, and Nike's logo is derived from the goddess' wing, the so-called ' swoosh'. When Nike reports after the close on Friday, it is expected to reflect the win over the pandemic as Wall Street expects earnings of $0.61 per share on revenue of $10.55 billion. For the comparable quarter last year, Nike made $0.70 per share on revenue of $10.33 billion.Its shares remain one of the better-performing names within the retail sector, rising more than 35% over the past six months despite the economic devastation the pandemic has inflicted upon consumers and retail in general. Although some might suggest that Nike shares have now run too far ahead of the company's fundamentals, besides being driven by the pandemic, Nike is benefiting from the fact that consumers across the globe are focusing more on health and wellness.Nike is known for its strong brand name and innovation, so it should not be surprising that Wall Street sees Nike strongly positioned to capitalize on increased demand for its products. But, the company will need to justify that confidence with strong revenue forecasts, particularly as expectations are high for the holiday quarter.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-12-15,"Annual report finds as 2020 forced the world to re-examine how it lives, works and plays, 2021 will see seven trends emerge that map out new, hopeful territory for businesses, consumers and society NEW YORK, Dec. 15, 2020 /CNW/ - As the COVID-19 crisis redefines how economies and society as a whole function, human ingenuity has sparked a wave of innovation set to be the blueprint for the decades to come, according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN).","2021 Will Redefine the 21st Century, According to ""Fjord Trends 2021"" Report from Accenture Interactive"
2020-12-16,"This is your daily dividend safety check. Today, we consider Accenture as its earning call is on December 17, 2020 before the bell. Let's look at Accenture (NYSE:ACN) to see if its 1.53% dividend yield is safe, judging by its earnings to dividend payout ratio and history of dividend cuts.Accenture's Payout Ratio Payout ratio is an important measure of dividend affordability. It's equal to dividends per share divided by earnings per share. Accenture's payout ratio of 51.76% is low enough to not cause concern. When a payout ratio is relatively low (i.e. below 75%), it suggests that a company can afford to cover its dividend. A ratio closer to 100% could indicate a company is struggling to cover its dividend.Has Accenture Cut Its Dividend in the Recent Past? Generally, past behavior is not highly predictive of what's to come. However, companies that have a recent history of dividend cuts are more likely to cut them again due to less incentive to appease income investors than companies with historically consistent or rising dividends. Accenture has not cut its dividend in the last few years. While this is no guarantee of dividend safety, it does imply that the company's management is reluctant to cut it.How Safe Is Accenture's Dividend Overall? Accenture has failed neither of our dividend safety tests. It has a low payout ratio and no recent case of dividend cut. With all of this in mind, it is very unlikely that Accenture will cut its dividend next quarter.Looking for more help identifying reliable investments?

2020-12-16,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) announces its next round of earnings this Thursday, December 17. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Thursday's Q1 earnings announcement.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Accenture analysts model for earnings of $2.05 per share on sales of $11.36 billion. In the same quarter last year, Accenture reported earnings per share of $2.09 on revenue of $11.36 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on ACNIf the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, EPS would have fallen 1.91%. Sales would be up 0.01% from the year-ago period. Accenture's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2019  EPS Estimate 1.73 1.85 1.72 2  EPS Actual 1.70 1.90 1.91 2.09  Revenue Estimate 10.91 B 10.88 B 11.09 B 11.14 B  Revenue Actual 10.84 B 10.99 B 11.14 B 11.36 B  Stock Performance Shares of Accenture were trading at $246.92 as of December 15. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 18.96%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably satisfied going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently above from its 52 week high by 6.20%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. View more earnings on ACNMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. Accenture Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 49.95 of the IT Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. Price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

2020-12-17,"Looking at Q1, Accenture (NYSE: ACN) earned $1.89 billion, a 22.4% increase from the preceding quarter. Accenture also posted a total of $11.76 billion in sales, a 8.56% increase since Q4. Accenture earned $1.54 billion, and sales totaled $10.84 billion in Q4.What Is ROCE? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Accenture's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q1, Accenture posted an ROCE of 0.1%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on ACNROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Accenture is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Accenture, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q1 Earnings Insight Accenture reported Q1 earnings per share at $2.17/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.05/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Recap: Accenture Q1 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For December 17, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Sergio Kaufman, president of Accenture Argentina and Hispanic South America said, “We will integrate Wolox across Accenture’s services, including Strategy & Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations, enabling us to deliver 360 degree value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities.” (See ACN stock analysis on TipRanks) Last month, Accenture reported 1Q results and raised its fiscal year revenue forecast. The company's 1Q earnings of $2.17 per share grew 8% year-over-year and topped the Street’s estimates of $2.02 per share. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $11.76 billion and beat the Street consensus of $11.28 billion. New bookings grew 25% to $12.9 billion in the first quarter. On Jan. 6, Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Kupferberg upgraded Accenture stock to Hold from Sell and maintained a price target of $261 (2.9% upside potential). In a note to investors, the analyst said that the momentum in the company's bookings should remain strong in the near term. However, the stock's valuation is keeping him on the sidelines. From the rest of the Street, the stock scores a cautiously optimistic outlook with the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $278.64 implies upside potential of about 9.9% to current levels. Shares have gained 24.5% in one year.

2021-02-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Atos SE shares jumped the most in more than nine months as investors cheered its decision to walk away from a deal to buy U.S. rival DXC Technology Co.Atos’s board of directors “unanimously determined not to pursue” the deal with DXC Technology, the company said in a statement Monday, confirming a Bloomberg News report. DXC’s board decided the Atos offer was inadequate and lacked certainty, the U.S. company said separately.A deal with DXC would’ve been transformational for Atos, creating an IT giant with scale to better compete with the likes of SAP SE and Accenture Plc. But investors were taken aback by the size of the combination, people familiar with the matter had said. DXC may have been valued at more than $10 billion in a deal, Reuters had reported previously.“Though the purchase would have given Atos scale to resist some pricing pressures, it wasn’t a perfect fit as the company looks to move toward high-growth digital services,” Tamlin Bason, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said. “Atos’s decision to walk away from its proposed $10 billion acquisition of peer DXC Technology suggests that it’s opting against doubling down on legacy IT outsourcing services.”Atos rose as much as 7.4% in Paris on Tuesday, the biggest intraday gain since April, giving the company a market value of 7.4 billion euros ($8.9 billion). The shares had previously declined 14% this year. DXC fell about 10% in late trading Monday, valuing the company at $6.5 billion.“From the start, we considered the unsolicited and non-binding offer was far from a done deal, given the level of uncertainty prevailing on several topics and the extent of concern for many investors,” Gregory Ramirez, an analyst from Bryan Garnier, wrote in a note.It’s the second big transatlantic merger to fall through this year.

2021-03-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. unveiled software tools designed to make it easier and less expensive for people to access virtual reality and augmented reality content, and for more creators to build these digital and holographic worlds.The company’s Mesh software will enable users to work and play together virtually by interacting with the same set of holograms on devices at various price points and from different manufacturers, ranging from Microsoft’s $3,500 HoloLens augmented reality goggles and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus and other specialized VR headsets to cell phones and computers where users can get a two-dimensional view. Mesh also lets multiple people see the same holograms from different locations, allowing for events such as concerts or company meetings where one user attends in person and the other “holoports in” from home.“You can be anywhere as a hologram or an avatar, and it’s not just you,” Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in an interview. “You now have not just yourself but all of your co-workers or your friends with you and you can do things together, not just with real objects, but with holograms.” In a demonstration, Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman described the product and answered questions through his holographic avatar — a torso, bearded head and pair of disembodied hands — using both a HoloLens and an HP Inc. Reverb headset in turn. A school of jellyfish, a shark and two planets floated around the space, all holograms that could be passed back and forth, resized and examined.The software giant first announced a product in this space in 2015 with HoloLens, a pricey product that has largely focused on corporate uses, like medical imaging and complex equipment repair. Though companies have been touting AR and VR as breakthrough technologies for years, they have yet to gain traction with a wide audience. Facebook, HP and Snap Inc. have released various forms of goggles and glasses that use the technology, but augmented and virtual reality still haven’t reached mass appeal save for some lower-end mobile applications, like Niantic Inc.’s Pokemon Go AR game. Microsoft is betting that a set of cloud-based tools to make it easier to develop compelling AR and VR applications for almost any type of device will have broader appeal. Nadella said the key is bringing these technologies to the gadgets and platforms that engineers design for and consumers use most, rather than requiring them to jump through additional hoops to access them. “There’s always the cost, but there’s also — what’s that ubiquitous device that I have with me always that I can use to interact? It’s not like I have a HoloLens on me — it’s not like I am wearing it right now,” Nadella said. “Whereas, I have a computer right now or I’m using my phone. That’s why Mesh is not just about HoloLens.” Seeing 3-D holograms will still require some sort of headgear, Nadella said, but as more AR and VR experiences become available for larger groups, phones and PCs allow a way in without expensive devices.Based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud, data and artificial intelligence tools, Mesh is available now in preview. Customers can also request access to a Mesh-enabled version of the AltspaceVR meeting app to let companies hold corporate meetings with secure sign-ins and privacy features. Microsoft will roll out additional features in the coming year and is planning to add them to its Teams teleconferencing app.The Redmond, Washington-based software maker demonstrated prototypes of how the technology can be used on Tuesday at the company’s Ignite conference in a keynote speech, which Microsoft is also streaming in virtual reality using Mesh. In one demonstration, Niantic CEO John Hanke donned a HoloLens and hunted for Pokemon near Oakland, California’s Lake Merritt, joined initially by Kipman’s avatar and later another friend also clad in a HoloLens. Around them, Pokemon frolicked in groups, reacting to each other. While the features demonstrated are not yet part of a finished product, Niantic is working on games and services that make use of similar concepts and hopes to use Mesh for things like programming the presence of two or more holograms.“The thing that’s exciting to me is this notion of mixing the real and the virtual in terms of social interaction,” Hanke said. “In the future you could join from Texas and play with your mom and dad and the kids, or you could join your college roommate in New York City and walk around Central Park playing together virtually, comingled with people in the physical world.”To Microsoft, the idea of Mesh is similar to that of Xbox Live, the online gaming service the company introduced in 2002 that provided the networking infrastructure so game developers could create online multiplayer games between friends and strangers without having to build that technology themselves, Kipman said. “Apply that same analogy here with Microsoft Mesh,” he said. “It’s possible today to create experiences with multiple people sharing the same holographic landscape in the room, but it’s significantly hard, and you don’t see a lot of that, because most developers don’t have the time or know-how to be able to do it appropriately.” Mesh also uses spatial sound to change the audio based on where holograms and people participating are located, giving the user a sense of space in the virtual world. A friend sitting beside another friend’s hologram in a work meeting or at a concert can whisper to their neighbor, for example. Hānai World, a new company from Cirque du Soleil co-founder Guy Laliberté, plans to use Mesh to create entertainment events that mix live and virtual aspects. The events will take place in physical venues and through mixed reality headsets, with previews starting at the end of the year. Ray Dalio’s marine science nonprofit OceanX will use the technology to create a holographic table on ships that scientists can gather around, in person or remotely, to view three-dimensional holograms of exploration areas, and Accenture Plc has created a virtual headquarters to bring in new employees and help with connections during the pandemic.While Mesh makes creating these programs easier, there’s still more work to be done in complex scenarios. For example, to broadcast a DJ set or a concert, developers would have to place sensors around the performers’ space to capture the 3-D experience. That’s why sports programming is still a way off, Kipman said — it would require sensor tracking on too many players and too large a space.Nadella plans to keep investing in VR and AR, likening it to Microsoft’s decision 10 years ago to go “all in” on cloud computing, which took a while to pay off. “That’s what it takes,” he said. “I don’t think about this as, ‘oh, it’s about HoloLens,’ I think of this as Microsoft should — and the industry should — continue to push on how can people communicate, collaborate and build community, whether it’s for work or for play.” (Updates to reflect keynote speech on Tuesday.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Microsoft Steps Up Push to Bring Virtual Reality to the Masses

2021-03-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Accenture Plc’s hunt for talent is turning it into the world’s most acquisitive company, helping the $172 billion consultancy become a bigger force in everything from digital marketing to industrial automation.Accenture has announced at least 65 takeovers over the past two years, more than any other major business, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s snapping up a target every week and a half on average, keeping it busier than private-equity giants like Blackstone Group Inc. and KKR & Co.While most of the deals are small, the pace has been relentless and seems to be accelerating: It’s not rare for Accenture to announce two transactions in a single day. On March 1, it unveiled three deals, buying an Australian supply chain consultancy, a Brazilian robotics firm and a U.K. leadership development business.The company is having to move faster to keep an edge in the digital technologies that are transforming business, and takeovers are a quick way to soak up talent and ideas. Investors appear to approve of the tactic -- Accenture shares have surged 42% in New York trading in the past 12 months, giving it a market value of $171.6 billion.It expects to spend at least $1.7 billion on acquisitions in fiscal 2021, Chief Financial Officer KC McClure said on an earnings call in December.

2021-03-17,"For many people, St. Patrick’s Day means a corned beef and cabbage dinner, a pint of Guinness and watching “The Quiet Man” for the 100th time. For investors seeking to add a breath of fresh Eire in their portfolios might want to consider taking a second look at some major Irish companies trading on the U.S. exchanges. Accenture Plc: (NYSE: ACN) A Fortune Global 500 company, Dublin-headquartered Accenture generated $44.33 billion in 2020 revenues. With 506,000 employees spread across three continents, this professional services company has been on a shopping spree since 2019. Bloomberg reported Accenture acquired at least 65 companies in the past two years, including three — an Australian supply chain consultancy, a Brazilian robotics firm and a U.K. leadership development business — that were announced March 1. There seems to be more than the luck of the Irish going on here: Accenture’s NYSE shares soared by 42% over the past 12 months, resulting in a market value of $171.6 billion. Accenture's stock last closed at $263.52, down 1%. AerCap Holdings N.V.: (NYSE: AER) One of the aviation industry’s biggest stories last week was the acquisition by Ireland’s AerCap of GE Capital Aviation Services, a General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) business, in a transaction involving $24 billion of cash, $1 billion of AerCap notes and/or cash and 1.1 billion newly issued AerCap shares. AerCap is an aircraft leasing company serving roughly 200 customers in approximately 80 countries, while GE's aviation services business is an aviation lessor and financier that owns, services or has on order approximately 1,700 aircraft. The newly combined corporate entity will boast more than 2,000 owned and managed aircraft, over 900 owned and managed engines, over 300 owned helicopters and approximately 300 customers around the world. AerCap closed at $59.77, down 2.67%. See Also: 4 NFT Stocks Moving On The Blockchain-Based Investment Trend Bank of Ireland Group plc: (OTC: BKRIF) Investors in the over-the-counter market may want to consider Bank of Ireland, the oldest continuously operating bank in Ireland — it first opened its doors on June 25, 1783. While the COVID-19 pandemic challenged the bank, it surprised many analysts in Ireland by turning a profit during the second half of 2020. According to the Irish Times, its underlying 2020 pre-tax loss of $445 million was stronger than the $715 million consensus view among analysts. CEO Francesca McDonagh used the bank’s most recent earnings call to highlight the bank’s ability to adapt to changing times with imagination. While the rising level of digital banking forced the bank to close about one-third of its branch network, a new partnership with the Irish postal service, An Post, will enable all of its customers to have access to banking services in more than 1,000 Irish post offices. Bank of Ireland Group closed at $4.86, down 0.21%. Ryanair Holdings plc: (NASDAQ: RYAAY) Ireland’s low-cost airline joined its peers in experiencing a deeply challenging 12-month pandemic period, with an 83% year-over-year decline in passenger volume. But also in keeping with its peers in the airline industry, the company is aiming for a vibrant post-pandemic rebound. Ryanair is expecting 1,809 routes this summer across 221 airports and 37 countries, according to the aviation trade journal Simple Flying, which would represent a 112% year-over-year increase from the summer of 2020 and a relatively mild 29% decline from the pre-pandemic of summer 2019. Ryanair closed at $115.06, up 0.85%. Trinity Biotech plc: (NASDAQ: TRIB) Trinity Biotech develops, acquires, manufactures and markets diagnostic systems, including both reagents and instrumentation, for the point-of-care (POC) and clinical laboratory segments of the global diagnostic market. The company’s portfolio includes diagnostic tests and instrumentation for detecting infectious diseases, as well as products for identifying and monitoring patients with diabetes. The POC market sales have been impacted over the last 12 months due to the medical field’s pivot to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, with Trinity also acknowledging a decline in sales of diabetes-related instruments and autoimmunity and HIV testing products. That said, the company’s COVID-focused products helped generate $32 million in third-quarter 2020 revenue, a 30% year-over-year growth. “Revenues were very strong this quarter, particularly our Clinical Laboratory revenues which grew by 45%,” said CEO Ronan O’Caoimh. “This was driven by strong demand for our COVID-19 related products which includes our Viral Transport Media product, ELISA antibody test, monoclonal antibodies sold by (our life science supply business) Fitzgerald as well as our rapid respiratory products, demand for which have increased during the pandemic.” Trinity closed at $4.43, down 4.73%.

This current average represents a 2.85% increase from the previous average price target of $269.0. What Are Analyst Ratings? Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts can recommend ""buy"", ""sell"", ""hold"", or similar verbage for each stock based on that company's recent performance. ""Buy"" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth and is a recommendation to purchase the stock. On the other hand, ""Sell"" implies that an analyst forecasts a downwards trend for the stock. ""Hold"" suggests that investors should maintain their positions on that stock because of forecasted stagnation or lack of new information. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.

2021-03-18,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) showed a loss in earnings since Q1, totaling $1.65 billion. Sales, on the other hand, increased by 2.77% to $12.09 billion during Q2. Accenture reached earnings of $1.89 billion and sales of $11.76 billion in Q1. Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Accenture posted an ROCE of 0.09%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. View more earnings on ACN Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For Accenture, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.

Accenture’s (ACN) Chief Responsibility Officer and Global sustainability Services Lead, Peter Lacy, said, “Sustainability transformation must be both technology driven and linked to value to be successful. Creating shareholder value, while also tackling some of the world’s greatest challenges, requires rewiring the global economy with new levels of data, insights, and action.” Lacy added, “We are pleased to expand our relationship with Arabesque S-Ray to help our clients lead with better decision making, more informed investment prioritization, and accelerated realization of overall business value from their sustainability efforts, goals, and ambitions.” The investment will be focused on generating new tools and services for studying and reporting objective measures for non-financial performance and ESG data.

2021-03-19,"In the current market session, Accenture Inc. (NYSE:ACN) is trading at $266.49, after a 0.26% decrease. However, over the past month, the stock went up by 4.92%, and in the past year, by 85.67%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 1.85%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. Accenture Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 50.63 of the IT Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. Price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

Currently, the stock trades at $69.76, and the deep correction seems like a good buying opportunity. While earnings might have disappointed the markets, there is long-term value in the stock. For the third quarter of 2021, the company reported revenue of $49.1 million, which was higher by 19% on a year-on-year basis. Importantly, subscription revenue was $42.7 million and was higher by 23%. On the flipside, the company continued to report operating level loss. For the year, C3.ai expects operating losses at approximately $50 million. The key point to note is that as recurring subscription revenue increases, cash flows upside is likely. Therefore, I don’t see operating losses as a big concern. It’s worth noting that the company has expanded its market presence in the climate and energy sustainability market. Partners include Microsoft, Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR). This segment is likely to accelerate growth in the long-term. In addition, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army and New York Power Authority are among the company’s clients. It seems that C3.ai has a strong base for delivering higher growth in the coming years. The AI stock correction is therefore an opportunity to accumulate. ServiceNow (NOW) Source: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com NOW stock is another interesting name among AI stocks. The stock has surged by 90% in the last year and looks good for further upside. ServiceNow operates several platforms that includes machine learning, intelligent chatbot, AI-powered search and performance analytics. Recently, the company acquired Intellibot, which is a robotic process automation company. The company already has a robust client base with 6,900 global enterprise customers. From a cash flow visibility perspective, the company has over 95% renewal rate. Furthermore, as of FY2020, subscription service revenue was 95% of the total revenue. For FY2020, ServiceNow reported subscription revenue of $4.3 billion, which was higher by 32% on a y-o-y basis. For the current year, subscription revenue is guided at $5.5 billion. Importantly, the company’s free cash flow was $1.4 billion last year. It seems very likely that FCF will be over $2.0 billion (annualized) over the next 24 months. 7 Great Retirement Stocks for Gen Z Therefore, the company has financial headroom to pursue aggressive organic and inorganic growth. In February 2021, Argus Research raised the price target for NOW stock in the range of $600 to $640. NOW stock is positioned to continue trending higher. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: Peteri / Shutterstock.com Among the bigger technology names, MSFT stock is worth adding in the portfolio of AI stocks. The stock has been in a steady uptrend and valuation still looks attractive at a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 31.95. Recently, Microsoft announced a deal to acquire Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) at a price of $56 per share. The latter is a cloud and AI software company with a focus on the healthcare sector. The company has strong presence in the U.S. with 77% of U.S. hospitals being Nuance customers. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft believes that “AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application.” With the acquisition, the company will be positioned to accelerate its presence in the healthcare sector. The above statement also indicates the fact that Microsoft is focused on AI for growth in the coming years. It’s worth noting that Microsoft has also invested in C3.ai with a total exposure of 1.19 million shares. In October 2020, C3.ai, Microsoft and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) entered into a partnership to re-invest CRM with artificial intelligence. I will not be surprised if C3.ai is another potential acquisition target for the Microsoft as it accelerates investments in AI. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com NVDA stock is another big name to consider among AI stocks. As a leading provider of artificial intelligence chips, the company is positioned for strong growth. In the last year, the biggest development for the company in the AI segment has been the acquisition of Arm Limited for consideration of $40 billion. With the acquisition, “Nvida will now be placed at the forefront of Arm’s IoT ecosystem and cloud-based AI edge computing.” Autonomous driving is one segment where Nvidia seems to have made significant inroads. The company will be partnering with TuSimple (NASDAQ:TSP) for autonomous trucks that are likely to commence production in FY2024. Nvidia has also been active in the healthcare segment. In April 2021, the company partnered with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) on a “new AI research projects using breakthrough transformer neural networks.” As Nvidia spreads its wings across different sectors with AI application, NVDA stock is worth holding in the portfolio. Recently, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso upgraded NVDA stock with a price target of $750. This would imply an upside of 23% from current levels around $608.

2021-05-11,"(Bloomberg) -- About 8,300 miles east of Wall Street, on a stretch of Bangalore’s Outer Ring Road, sits what was once the heart of the global financial industry’s back office.Before the pandemic, this cluster of glass-and-steel towers housed thousands of employees at firms like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG who played critical roles in everything from risk management to customer service and compliance.Now the buildings are eerily empty. And with case counts soaring across Bangalore and much of India, work-from-home arrangements that have sustained Wall Street’s back-office operations for months are coming under intense strain. A growing number of employees are either sick or scrambling to find critical medical supplies such as oxygen for relatives or friends.Standard Chartered Plc said last month that about 800 of its 20,000 staffers in India were infected. As many as 25% of employees in some teams at UBS are absent, said an executive at the firm who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. At Wells Fargo & Co.’s offices in Bangalore and Hyderabad, work on co-branded cards, balance transfers and reward programs is running behind schedule, an executive said.While banks have so far avoided major disruptions by shifting tasks to other offshore hubs, India’s Covid crisis has exposed a little-discussed vulnerability for companies that have spent decades outsourcing functions to the country. India’s outbreak is intensifying even as vaccinations fuel economic recoveries in other parts of the world, heightening fears of a back-office bottleneck at a time when Wall Street firms have rarely been busier.“This is not a local, India-only problem, this is a global crisis,” said D.D. Mishra, senior director analyst at researcher Gartner Inc. The current wave will be “significantly bigger” and organizations with India-based staff “will need to take action to plan for and mitigate if needed,” Mishra and his colleagues wrote in a note last week.Nasscom, the key lobby group for India’s $194 billion outsourcing industry and its almost 5 million employees, has downplayed the threat to operations. But Mishra and fellow analysts at Gartner say they’re fielding a daily flood of calls from anxious global clients asking about the Covid-19 situation.India’s total coronavirus infections have risen to almost 23 million, of which about a third were added since mid-April. The state of Karnataka, whose capital is Bangalore, has been hard-hit.Experts have warned the crisis has the potential to worsen in the coming weeks, with one model predicting as many as 1,018,879 deaths by the end of July, quadrupling from the current official count of 249,992. A model prepared by government advisers suggests the wave could peak in the coming days, but the group’s projections have been changing and were wrong last month.In Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai, the three main bases for the financial giants’ operations, infection rates have reached such alarming levels that local governments have ordered stringent restrictions on movement.While the crisis has hit swathes of the nation’s $2.9 trillion economy, the latest wave has notably affected the twenty-something segment of the population that dominates outsourcing companies and is hard to replace. Most of them are English-speaking, technically-skilled workers.Continuity PlanningFor now, back-office units are marshaling part-time workers or asking employees to perform multiple roles and re-assigning staff to make up for those who are absent. They are scheduling overtime, deferring low-priority projects and conducting pandemic continuity planning exercises for multiple locations should the virus wave intensify.A Wells Fargo employee said some work is getting transferred to the Philippines, where staff is working overnight shifts to pick up the slack. The San Francisco-based bank employs about 35,000 workers in India to help process car, home and personal loans, make collections, and assist customers who need to open, update or close their bank accounts.“Nearly all Wells Fargo employees in India are working remotely, and we are not experiencing significant impacts to our business operations,” spokeswoman Beth Richek said in an email response to questions. “We are continuing to support our employees, and we are helping local communities in India with more than $3 million in grants.”She added that no work has moved out of India and there have not been delays in the work the India team does to support Wells Fargo’s credit card business.An employee at UBS said that with many of the bank’s 8,000 staff in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad absent, work is being shipped to centers such as Poland. The Swiss bank’s workers in India handle trade settlement, transaction reporting, investment banking support and wealth management. Many of the tasks require same-day or next-day turnarounds. A UBS representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.With uncertainty surrounding how soon the Indian government will contain the crisis, one executive who asked not to be identified likened the situation to flying blind without any idea how many employees will be affected from one week to the next.Rebalancing Loads“We are looking carefully at how we can rebalance loads,” Standard Chartered Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters said on an earnings call last month, noting that some work has been routed to Kuala Lumpur, Tianjin and Warsaw. “In any case, we think we are very well provided for.”Barclays Plc CEO Jes Staley said some functions were shifted to the U.K. from India. Call volumes have increased and people are distressed, he said, adding that signs of pressure was something to watch for. The bank has 20,000 employees in India.Last year, when a sudden lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw these banks scrambling to keep their operations running, the European Banking Authority said the push to outsource support functions “exposed these banks to operational risks.”After asking their employees to work from home en masse last year, most of them have continued to operate at near 100% work-from-home levels. Natwest Group Plc’s workforce in Bangalore, Delhi and the southern city of Chennai -- accounting for a fifth of its global total -- is completely set up to work from home.Management BandwidthSimilarly, thousands of Goldman employees are working from home, doing high-end business tasks such as risk modeling, accounting compliance and app building. A representative for the bank said workflows can be absorbed by the wider team if needed and there’s been no material impact so far.Citigroup Inc. said there’s currently no significant disruption, while Deutsche Bank AG said employees were working seamlessly from home. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. detailed relief efforts they are undertaking, but didn’t elaborate on the impact on their operations. HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn said he’s “watching it closely” and ruled out any material impact at this stage.Besides worrying about disruptions to operations, employee well-being and securing medical help are also taking up a lot of management bandwidth at every large outsourcing unit.At a recent all-hands, virtual corporate strategy team meeting at Accenture Plc, for instance, the talk wasn’t about the usual pay-raises or promotions. Instead, worker after worker demanded flexibility, reduced workloads and no-meeting Fridays, an executive said, asking not to be named discussing internal company matters.Their size has become a hindrance, one executive said, but it’s not clear where else they can go for talent and scale, he added.The safety of its people is a top priority and the company is taking various measures to ensure their health and wellbeing, Accenture said in an emailed statement. It also has the ability to transfer work across its global network to continue to meet the needs of clients.“We are telling clients they need to relax service levels and reduce expectations for the coming few weeks,” said Mishra, the Gartner analyst. “This is not a normal situation.”(Updates story from May 8 with comment from Wells Fargo in 15th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Wall Street Giants Get Swept Up by India’s Brutal Covid Wave

The addition of Homburg & Partner bolsters Accenture’s expertise in commercial strategy, and sales and price management strategies. Homburg & Partner has clients across different industries including industrial goods, healthcare, and chemicals. It has successfully helped clients increase revenue, gain market share, drive higher profitability, and attain growth targets. Accenture’s Global Lead for Customer, Sales & Service Edwin van der Ouderaa said, “The pandemic accelerated the shift for organizations to adopt new digital standards for customer experience and engagement.” (See Accenture stock analysis on TipRanks) He continued, “The addition of Homburg & Partners expands our ability to shape growth and efficiency strategies across the enterprise and will increase our clients’ focus on growing their sales and profits, as they pivot to their next-generation customer engagement.” Last month, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $310 (9.5% upside potential) from $278. Demand for IT products and services was already high before the COVID-19 pandemic and Keane expects it to stay elevated as the world emerges from the pandemic. Consensus among analysts is that Accenture is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $301.73 implies 6.6% upside potential. Shares have gained about 48.9% over the past year.

2021-05-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp., Accenture Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are teaming up with nonprofits like the Linux Foundation and climate groups to develop and share ways to build software that produces fewer carbon emissions when run in data centers, the notoriously energy-hungry networks of high-powered computers that are consuming increasing amounts of the world’s electricity.The Green Software Foundation, whose founders also include Microsoft-owned GitHub and software consultancy ThoughtWorks, plans to build tools and create standards for measuring the climate impact of software, and will work on training for software engineers who want to learn how to build programs that consume less energy. Data centers now account for about 1% of global electricity demand, and that’s forecast to rise to 3% to 8% in the next decade, the companies said in a statement Tuesday, timed to Microsoft’s Build developers conference. As software applications grow more complex and processing-intensive, they’re requiring more computing power and electricity, leading to calls for greater awareness of their carbon footprint. Cloud-computing companies like Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have announced plans for reducing the emissions output of their data centers and many companies have announced carbon-neutral goals. To get there, software developers are going to have to learn a new skill—green software engineering—the same way they have previously received training on preventing security flaws in their code. “The purpose is to build applications that we describe as carbon-efficient,” Asim Hussain, a Microsoft principal cloud developer advocate who will serve as executive director of the foundation, said in an interview. “To understand how to do that, you need to understand a set of skills that is not taught in traditional environments.” While it’s tough to determine exactly how much carbon is emitted by individual software programs, groups like the Green Software Foundation examine metrics such as how much electricity is needed, whether microprocessors are being used efficiently, and the carbon emitted in networking. The foundation plans to look at curricula and developing certifications that would give engineers expertise in this space. As with areas like data science and cybersecurity, there will be an opportunity for engineers to specialize in green software development, but everyone who builds software will need at least some background in it, said Jeff Sandquist, a Microsoft vice president for developer relations. “This will be the responsibility of everybody on the development team, much like when we look at security, or performance or reliability,” he said. “Building the application in a sustainable way is going to matter.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Teams Up With Accenture, Goldman on Greener Software"
